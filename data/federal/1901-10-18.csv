Adelaide telegrams in this morning's newspapers that the Premier of South Australia denies a statement made by me in the House on Wednesday night. I do not wish to do any person an injustice ; at the same time. I justify, if possible, my statement, and I Governmentshall proceed to show that wherever the fault lies it is not with myself. The telegram in the Argus is as follows :In the House of Assembly the Premier denied that he had suggested holding a meeting to protest against the Federal Tariff as stated by Mr. Poynton in the House of Representatives. He merely advised that if such meetings were held resolutions should be sent direct to Federal members instead of being mentioned in the local Legislature. In the Age this telegram appearsIn the Assembly today the Premier denied that he had suggested a meeting to protest against the Federal Tariff as alleged by Mr. Poynton in the Federal House of Representatives. He had merely advised that if such meetings were held the resolutions should be sent direct to the Federal members instead of being mentioned in the local Legislature. The telegrams are practically ttie same. Now for my authorities for making the veyed, statement. In the Argus of Wednesday hist the following telegram appeared, under the heading of South Australian ParliaWales) ment :The Premier, in response to a request, clined to set apart a day for the discussion of the Federal Tariff. He stated that personally opposed to increasing the cost of living, recognised the impossibility of framing a Tariff to satisfy everybody. He advised that meetings held to protest against the new duties, and send the resolutions direct to the Federal representaThere tives, who would bring them before the Governdeal ment. The telegram in Wednesday's Age was as follows: The Premier declined to set apart a day for discussion of the Federal Tariff. He stated sonally that he is opposed to increasing of living, but recognises the impossibility of framing a Tariff to satisfy everybody. He advised people holding meetings protesting against incidence oE the new duties to send the lutions direct to the Federal representatives, would bring them before the notice of Oiovernment. NA In the face of those telegrams I think I was perfectly justified in the statement. I made here on Wednesday night. I am not responsible for the error. I do not wish to do the Premier of South Australia or any one else an injustice. At the same time, I feel that it was only due to myself that I should make this explanation. MOTIO N OF CENSURE. Debate resumed (from 17th October, vide page 6196) on motion by Mr Reid (1) That this House cannot accept the Financial must and Tariff proposals submitted by the(a) Because they would place the finances of the Commonwealth and the States; upon an unsound and extravagant basis. (Ii) Because they fail to adjust the burdens -. of taxation and the advantages of ' the free list in an equitable manner, revealing a marked tendencj', which this House regrets to observe, to press . upon necessaries of life and appliances -. used in our farming, mining, and pastoral industries more heavily than they do upon many articles of "" luxury. (c) And because they wonld in their operation destroy the stability of the revenue by making imposts for national purposes a source of undueprofit to a few individuals, and a few favoured industries, at the expenseof the whole community. (2) That the foregoing resolutions be conby address, to His Excellency the Governor General.",14
1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"New South - The remarks of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat serve to indicate, if that were requisite, the dewidespread feeling of anxiety, disappointhe was ment, and alarm which exists over the but he whole of this continent regarding the»proposals of the Government in relation to,be the requirements and needs of the State. can be no doubt that there is a great of feverish anxiety all over the continent concerning the Tariff. There is a great deal of anxiety as to how it is to operate, both from a revenue point of view, the and in its effect on the industries of the perStates. There is a feeling of intense disthe cost appointment throughout the whole of my own State at the proposals of the Govern-., the ment. They amount-no t in my judgment resoalone, for I am glad to say that there is, who complete concurrence on this point-to the the political deception of the people of New South Wales on the part of some of her leading men.",14
2,Mr THOMAS,IS G,"They were told by those duties. who opposed the Commonwealth Bill that they would have a Tariff like this. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - Ha d the Prime Minister told the people of this country he would impose duties ranging from 15 100 per cent, on many of the main lines of consumption in New South Wales, he would not be here to-da}' to tell the tale.",15
3,Mr THOMAS,IS G,What did the honourable member tell the people of New South at the first referendum 1,15
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,Is the honourable member a protectionist ? Have I to fight him this morning as a protectionist 1,15
5,Mr THOMAS,IS G,The honourable member does not know what I am. I am talking about what he said.,15
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,The honourable member is only doing this for the purpose of interrupting. He knows there is no sense in it. I shall be glad to hear him justify the Prime Minister after I have finished.,15
7,Mr THOMAS,IS G,I do not think he wants my defence.,15
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I repeat that i the Prime Minister had told the people of New South Wales that he would impose destructive, duties ranging from 15 to 100 per cent., he would not be here to tell the tale, let alone to impose the Tariff. the people of New South Wales took as much notice of the Minister for Home Affairs as of the Prime Minister, and former repeated the statement wherever spoke that the duties this Government would enough ? introduce would be similar to the duties which would have to be imposed by the leader of the Opposition if he came into power10 or 15 per cent. That statement was repeated throughout the length and breadth of New South Wales. Strange to Say, the moment the honourable gentleman is were not high enough. ensconced in his office he turns round and complains that the duties are not high enough for him, although, at that time, he was strong in his statements that they would not be more than 15 or 20 per cent.",15
9,Mr WATSON,IS G,Has he said that they are not high enough ?,15
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Yes . When from interviewed the other day, he complained that they are not sufficiently protective him.",15
11,Mr WATSON,IS G,"That , as I understand, was a complaint against the revenue",15
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The complaint was that the duties are not high enough for liim. Had the two Ministers made these that statements on the hustings in New South to Wales neither of them could possibly have been returned for a seat in this Legislature. I am not narrow-minded enough to believe that it would be a good thing if these two honourable gentlemen remained out of public Wales life, but I think they ought to have been more frank than they were with their own people when they were seeking their suffrages from the hustings. They ought to have told the people what they meant when they were advocating moderate protection. Surely the Prime Minister does not attempt to say that the duties which are imposed under the Tariff are moderately protective, as that term is understood in New South Wales ? There can be only one opinion there, namely, that the duties are stiff in the extreme, and if the Tariff introduced by the Government is a moderate Tariff in the eyes of the rest of Australia, all I have to say is that there is a great difference of opinion among the f States. We, in New South Wales, think that the Tariff is absolutely oppressive and and it is a pity that Ministers did not tell the people more frankly what they intended, after they had succeeded At that time to power and office.",15
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IS G,Do I understand the that the honourable member accused me of he saying that the duties are not high,15
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,Yes .,15
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IS G,I never said anything of the kind.,15
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,The honourable member is reported in the Age as having stated in a recent interview that the duties,15
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IS G,I never said anything of the sort.,15
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Then the honourable gentleman is misreported. Will he deny, however, that he told the people in his own State at the last election that he would propose a Tariff with duties ranging 10 per cent, to 15 percent., and that if the leader of the Opposition had'the arrangefor ment of matters he could not manage with any smaller duties 1",15
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IS G,"What I said was that the average, taking out narcotics and stimulants, with no free list, would not exceed 15 per cent, or 20 per cent.",16
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The honourable gentleman attacked the leader of the Opposition when he proposed a purely revenue Tariff, and said that it was impossible to derive the necessary amount of revenue with a Tariff of less than 10 per cent, or 15 per cent.",16
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IS G,The honourable member has no right to misquote what I stated.,16
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,I am sure there is no mistake about the matter.,16
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IS G,I am sure there is.,16
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The question - arises as to whether these high duties are necessary-whethe r we 'require to pile the - duties up in order to get sufficient revenue to make ends meet, so far as the different States are concerned. The Treasurer in his opening remarks made sensible observation, and it is a great pity that his subsequent statements did not support it . He said we had a grave responsibility at this particular time, and should take the utmost care to prevent - extravagant expenditure. But not many minutes later he told us that he had to deal with inflated Estimates-Estimate s which had been piled up and sent over to the Eederal Government, and which under the - Ordinary State Parliaments would not have been allowed to mount up as high as they are today. He stated that he had been perfectly bewildered, and that he was going to see if he could cut the Estimates down. As a matter of fact we have the Treasurer promising retrenchment after the Tariff has been framed, but I contend that his duty was to cut down his estimates of expenditure before any attempt was made to impose duties in order to produce the revenue necessary to meet the Government obligations. The Treasurer pointed out that, in the Defence department alone, from 1896 to 1901 there had been an increase in the expenditure of £360,000. He knows this is due to extravagance, and he told us of the ruthless way in which he used to cut down defence expenditure in times gone by. Now he says that he will not touch the expenditure until the military commandant comes out. Yet he had been telling us just previously in a most emphatic way of the trouble he had had with IS c 2 these Imperial commandants before. It is these Imperial officers who keep piling up expenses, who will not look with sympathy upon our colonial lines of defence, but who increase their own - emoluments, and cut down the purely volunteer forces. What possible chance, therefore, is there of an Imperial commandant vigorously enforcing the stern necessity for retrenchment? He will probably begin to revolutionize our forces to bring them into accord with Imperial notions and ideas, and the Estimates will very likely be swollen rather than curtailed. The Treasurer knows this himself as well as I do, and there will be a feeling of intense ' disappointment that the Treasurer should have taken up such a feeble attitude with regard to the necessity for retrenchment at the present time. The Prime Minister told the people of New South Wales"" I give you the name of Sir George Turner as a guarantee of sound and careful finance,"" a very and yet here we have this same Sir George Turner submitting Estimates which he knows are inflated-whic h are 50 per cent, higher than they ought to be-and telling, us that he does not feel any obligation to cut them down until the new commandant arrives. What is the result of all this ? He proposes to pile up the revenue to an amount which will represent an increase of £1,200,000 over the revenue for the year 1899. I will not believe that this continent cannot be governed upon the 1899 basis, if a vigorous attempt at retrenchment is made. My belief is founded upon my own experience as a member of the Government of New South Wales for five years. I know that the Commonwealth can easily be governed upon the 1899 basis if we set ourselves strongly and resolutely to do it . If the Treasurer took in hand my own State of New South Wales and kept down the expenses there a little he could not do a better thing for the people of that State. What is happening over there ? They are piling up the expenditure at - the rate of nearly £1,000,000 a year. They are spending £2,000,000 a year more to govern that country than was necessary three years ago. Will the Treasurer tell me that there is no room for retrenchment there 1 He could not have done better service than to set himself resolutely to cut down these swollen Estimates. Two or three years ago New South Wales was governed on £9,500,000 a year; but today the Estimates involve anexpenditureof £12,000,000, in addition to the expenditure of £3,000,000 of loan moneys this year. If the members of the Government will tell me that it is absolutely necessary in order to keep New South Wales solvent that there should be £15,000,000 of money provided for her, I will concede that the Tariff is justified. Surely the Treasurer knows what is going on in New South Wales. He is aware that it is revelling in perhaps the most fruitful revenue it has had for very many years past-a revenue which has come in under a free-trade Tariff, which is ample for all purposes, and which could readily be curtailed without the slightest injury to that State. To say, therefore, that the Treasurer is under an obligation to find the States of the union as much revenue as they have hitherto been receiving is to absolutely shut his eyes to what is going on. We were promised by all the advocates of federation that the first effect of its accomplishment would be to bring about cheaper and more economical government. Yet there is not slightest sign of anything approaching economy up to the present Whether it will result in, effectiveness in administration remains to bfe seen. But, so far, the only result of the amalgamation of the various departments has been to bring about a less effective administration. of course, is susceptible to remedy, and I am not putting it as an inherent defect of federation. I am merely speaking of the actual result of federal union up to the present moment. The amalgamation of these departments has made the transaction of ordinary business almost impossible. On the top of all this we are piling up the cost at an alarming rate-a rate which the people of the Commonwealth tolerate very long. In New South Wales we are supposed to get back over £1,000,000 of the surplus from the Federal Treasury. The Estimates for next year have been already submitted, and, strange to say, every penny of that amount is mopped up by the ordinary services of the year. The Treasurer told us that we might do many tilings in New South Wales. For example, he said that we might cut down railway fares and freights by the application of the surplus, when, as a matter of fact, that surplus is already absorbed in the Estimates for the year. With all these facts patent to him, Mr Joseph Cook. will the Treasurer tell me that there is no room for retrenchment in regard to those items which belong peculiarly to his own domain, and that there is therefore the necessity, which he affirms, of raising this huge amount of revenue? He tells us that it is necessary to raise£9,000,000. The honourable member for North Sydney informed the House yesterday that £8,000,000 would be sufficient. That is my firm belief, although I do not pretend to be a financier. I want to know why, since £7,500,000 was sufficient in 1899, and there has been piled up so far as federation is concerned less than £300,000 additional expenditure, £9,000,000 is required to meet the obligations of the States today ?  ferred departments has to be made up.",16
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,The estimates of the transferred departments have been loaded up and handed to the Federal Government in an inflated condition. The Treasurer knows that those estimates are extravagant.,17
26,Mr EWING,IS G,"Does the honourable member the admit that£8,000,000 are required?",17
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I should say that moment. £8,000,000 ought to be sufficient with rigid economy, but it will not be adequate if we allow the States to make the demands which they would like to make, or if they are going to spend money in the That, way that many of them are spending it . Surely this is'the Parliament of all others that ought to inaugurate an era of stern retrenchment, both in the finances of its own administration and in those of the States. I wish to quote a statement from an authority which I do not think will be questioned. I refer to an excellent article written by the Speaker of this House as late as April last, upon the subject of the Tariff, will not and the best means of raising the necessary revenue. The writer points out that £8,500,000 can be raised with 15 per cent, duties, allowing for a free list of £8,500,000. That statement was made by the Speaker of this House when he was Treasurer of South Australia, when he had access to all the figures of the continent, and after an experience in finance ranging over at least nine or ten years in his own State. It was written after a special study of the finances of the Federation, as was evidenced by the careful statements which he made in the Convention from time to time.",17
28,Mr MAUGER,IS G,That was pretty close to the amount now proposed to be raised.,17
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Gettin g pretty dose to it ! I was under the impression that there were duties in the Tariff under discussion ranging up to 100 per cent, and over. If the basis adopted by Mr Speaker had been adhered to, and a free list of £5,000,000 had been allowed for, I venture to say that the Tariff would have shown a reduction to 12-Jper cent, at least. We have it from the writer of the article in question, who is one of the best financial authorities in Australia, that a Tariff of 12-1 per cent., with a £5,000,000 free list, would give us ample revenue with which to run the States and the Commonwealth. It is idle for the Treasurer to get up apd feebly declare that he is bound to give the States all the revenue which they have hitherto been receiving, when he knows full well that there is gross extravagance going on in connection with the transferred departments. He tells us that he will not touch them until the new commandant arrives from England. That is a very poor beginning for a man with the political reputation of the Treasurer. What is the motive of it all ? I fear that the motive is to increase the cost of government, so that the Ministry may pile up the Tariff. All the authorities who have investigated this financial problem are agreed that these extravagant sums are not required to govern the country. Therefore, there is no need to raise them. What did Sir George Dibbs say in New South Wales when he introduced his protectionist Tariff? He said that he wanted to raise the customs duties in order that the money derived from them might be expended upon public works. Similarly we are told by the Government that they must have this money, because it is needed by the States. I repeat that it is not needed by the States. In my judgment all these estimates could be cut down with infinite advantage to the States, aud without the slightest risk of impairing their efficiency in the matter of government. This matter must be met, and how do the Government propose to meet it ? That is the main question which this Parliament has to face. The Minister for Trade and Customs swept away all considerations of finance, and left them to be dealt with by the Treasurer. He said in a straight out, clear, ringing, militant tone- "" We believe in protecting our industries, and we are going to do it. We challenge the Opposition to fight us upon this question."" That was the attitude of the right honourable gentleman, and immediately he went on to givereasonsfor the imposition of many of these duties. For instance, he told us that in regard to apparel there were three protections desirable: one to the maker of yarn here, one to the maker of the cloth, and another to the maker of the clothing. I am told that the manufacture of yarn here is represented by the large number of one maker, and that he is out of work just at present. I am told also that there is no such thing as a yarn industry in Victoria. There was one, but there is not one now. The manufacturer, we are informed, has gone home to secure new plant on the strength of the promise of this duty by the Minister for Trade and Customs.",18
30,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,The honourable member is importing some very fine yarns from New South Wales.,18
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"This is what the Minister went on to sayLooking at our pastoral industry, is it not preposterous that the wool which we grow should be sent away to the other side of the world, for the purpose of being turned first into cloth, and afterwards into garments to be sent back across the seas ? Does he notknow that this is precisely what is being done with American cotton ? Is it not preposterous that they should do that in America in spite of their Tariff? Everything which the right honourable and learned gentleman said in regard to our woollens would apply with equal force to American cotton. Yet, in spite of her scientific protectionist policy, America sends to England every year £66,000,000 worth of raw cotton to be made up there. What should we do with the clothes if we made up all our wool here? We could not wear them all ourselves ?",18
32,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,The honourable member's wits are now going wool-gathering.,18
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I am taking the statement made by the right honourable and learned member, and I may well be pardoned if I may seem to be wool-gathering when I quote his remarks. They are so extraordinary and so absurd, that no one could repeat them without being suspected of woolgathering.",18
34,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,I never made such a statement.,18
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,This statement appears in Hansard. Does the right honourable and learned gentleman deny it ?,18
36,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,IS G,We might well be told that we ought to eat all our. own meat.,19
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,There is no equivocation about the statement that we should turn all our wool into garments.,19
38,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,It is absolute nonsense to say that.,19
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I agree with the right honourable and. learned gentleman, but here is his own statement that it is preposterous that we should send our wool away instead of making it up ourselves. Of course, it may be said that we could export the garments if we made them up. I understand that protectionistsbelieve in exporting their surplus stock to other countries, no matter how poor those countries may be.",19
40,Mr BABTON,IS G,"If they are rich enough to pay for the goods we send them, we do not object.",19
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"But the right honourable and learned gentleman is constantly telling us that we cannot compete with these people abroad. How then can we export our goods and compete with them in their own markets. Why does America send over her cotton to England 1 Simply because England can make it up better than, she can. While England is making up cottonfor America, America is growing corn for England. Each specializes in that industry for which it is best adapted. The result of this exchange is in the aggregate an advantageous bargain for ""the people. There are woollen mills existing in the Commonwealth, and paying dividends without the assistance of a duty. In my electorate there are two. One of tliem is conducted by a proprietary and another by a company. The company pays 6 per cent, dividends. It has just doubled its plant, and it. is making cloth which, of' its kind, is equal to anything produced anywhere. The Minister of Trade and Customs will not say that that industry is decrepit, and cannot get along without assistance. Then, the right honourable and learned gentleman has made certain statements as to the iron industry. So far as I am aware, the only place in which iron is being made up within the Commonwealth is in my own electorate. Here again I pretend to know a little of what I am. speaking about. When Minister of Mines in New South. Wales, I despatched a special officer from the geological. sur.vey as branch to inquire into and to prepare amemorandum on the iron ores of the State and the possibilities of-' iron production in New South. Wales. He made an investigation which, is admitted to be a very faithfu l and full one. And what does he say ?",19
42,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,Who was the officer ?,19
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Mr Jaquet. He makes it plain in hisreport that at L it hgow, in New South Wales, iron can be produced from the ores of the State at a cost below that at which it can be produced at Middlesborough at the present time.",19
44,Mr KENNEDY,IS G,Are they producing any irpn at Lithgow at the present time 1,19
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"They are not making up native ores. They are simply rolling irqn, but they employ about 300 men in the works. The industry has done well,, altogether.",19
46,Mr KENNEDY,IS G,"Are they using, imported, iron ?",19
47,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,IS G,Scra p iron.,19
48,Mr BABTON,IS G,Unde r special concessions made by the Railway department.,19
49,Mr MAUGER,IS G,-Under railway protection.,19
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Eve n if they had no railway protection they could continue as at present. I know the proprietor better than, the honourable member does,, and. I know that the better he does the harder he grumbles. If any ono deserves to get on, however, that man does. He has fought a hard battle, ancl he has succeeded admirably. To day he is comparatively a rich man, and he has succeeded without any Tariff.",19
51,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,Bu the obtains railway concessions.,19
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,The railway concessions are a matter of business between the Commissioners and the proprietor of the mill.,19
53,Mr MAUGER,IS G,What else is protection 1,19
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The proprietor pays the Commissioners for the scrap iron which they send up to him, and they gi ve him certain reduced ratesof. carriage.",19
55,Mr BAPTON,IS G,"He gets relatively lower rates than, those allowed to any other person.",19
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,If he was not allowed those lower rates he could get on just the same.,19
57,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,Then why are the reductions made 1. It is squandering money. Mi -. JOSEPH COOK - The rates have been in existence for 20 or 30 years.,19
58,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,The honourable member was in the State Government during some portion of that time. Why did he not do away with them ?,20
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,The right honourable and learned gentleman must be very ignorant of our method of dealing with these matters.,20
60,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,"I am. I understand, however, that the proprietor is in the honourable member's electorate ? He need not answer the question.",20
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Of course he is. I have to fight him at eveiy election. He spent £'4,000 over the election for the Federal Parliament in liis opposition to myself. But he did not succeed.",20
62,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,I wish he had succeeded.,20
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I have no doubt the right honourable gentleman does wish that my opponent had succeeded,, but he did not, in spite of the Prime Minister promising that there should be jam factories, canning factories, and I do not know what industries besides, established bhere.",20
64,Mr BABTON,IS G,I do not conduct elections in that way.,20
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"That is whab the Prime Minister said, at all events.",20
66,Mr BARTON,IS G,I never promised anything.,20
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The Prime Minister told the people that they had only to put him in power in order to have jam factoriesand canning factories established at once. However, bhat is by the way. Here we have hard figures, which show that iron could be produced in Lithgow for 12s. a ton less than in Middlesborough, in England, at the present time. Mir. KINGSTON - Why does some one not do it?",20
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The right honourable gentleman knows, or ought to know, if he has auy acquaintance with the subject at all, bhat bo produce iron in a modern up-bodabe fashion requires the expendibure of huge capital. If an up-to-dabe plant were pub down at Libhgow, as much iron could be produced in a monbh as the State of New South Wales would consume in twelve months. There was no demand for the outpub of a modern mill of that description : but now that federation has opened the markets of the whole of Australia, bhose interested, in the indusbry in Lithgow aretaking steps, and have been doing so for some time pasb, bo exbend their operations. Irrespective of any duby-becaus e no duby is proposed-bher e will very soon be a plant in New South Wales capable of supplying the continent wibh iron. In this connection I should like bo refer bo a remark made by the honourable member for Gippsland, who, in speaking of England, declared that it is a country of unrivalled natural resources in the way of raw materials. The honourable member cannot know very much about England, or he would not talk such stuff. As a matter of fact, England bo-day is severely handicapped in the mabber of theraw materialsshe requires for her manufacburing indusbries. The honourable member oughb bo be aware, when he sbarbs oub bo discuss England, that coal bhere is more difficulb bo geb than it is almost anywhere else in the world. The mines in England are deeper and more dangerous, and, therefore, more expensive to work, than elsewhere, and the cost of producing a ton of coal is much greater bhan in America. The coal in England has bo be worked in many places ab a depbh of 3,000 feet, under the most dangerous circumstances it is possible to imagine, and the expense of winning raw maberials in England is increasing. Does the honourable member know that in Cornwall t in ores are being brought from 3,000 feet below the surface, and that men are working under conditions almost impossible to conceive, all in order to win the raw materials which he imagines are lying about over the surface ? Does the honourable member not know that every pound of raw cotbon has bo be imported from America before there can be any manufacture of that commodity in England? He ought to know that, on some of the larger estates in England today, more is. being paid in the shape of royalties on. coal and other minerals than is paid in the aggregate in wages ? Yet, with all bhese drawbacks, England, owing to her free porbs, which enable her bo geb her raw materials wherever she can under the mosb favourable conditions, keeps the nation going at a piteh of happiness and comfort not equalled anywhere else in the world. To say bhat England is privileged by the possession! of raw materials is quite beside the mark j the very contrary is the case. It is a well-known fact that the production of coal per head in England is less than in New South Wales, America, or Germany ; is untrue. and this argues the severity of the conditions under which coal has to be won there.",20
69,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,And the profits are - so great that an export duty is put on it .,21
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Ye s ; the pro.fits are so great that, notwithstanding the ""fact that coal is so much harder to win - than in Germany, the average wage of the miner in England today is £ 2 per week, as against less than £ 1 in some of the continental countries. I hope the Minister for Trade and Customs will look into these 'figures when he discusses iron, coal, and similar products. But why, if the Minister is going to protect iron, has he not the pluck to put a duty on it ? It is said that the manufacture of iron ought to be encouraged ; and yet the Government have not the pluck to put a specific, percentage, - or some kind of continuing duty on it, instead of a bonus. The reason is very - simple. Iron is the raw material of so many other manufactures throughout the - continent, that it is undesirable to impose a duty' on it . Yet iron is the finished product so far as the ironmaker is concerned. Mr Sandford, in Lithgow, is turning out angle and bar iron in great quantities, - and he regards that as his finished ' product; but the Minister has not the pluck to give him a duty, for the simple reason that even protectionists in the other 'States are opposed to such an imposition on what they regard as raw material. This brings to view one of the difficulties in discussing the Tariff-the difficulty of deciding at what point the raw material becomes a /finished product. I should now like to say word or two in regard to the condition of things in America. Only about 5 per cent, of the raw cotton produced there is manufactured. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports gave us some harrowing descriptions of life in London.",21
71,Mr MAUGER,IS G,I gave the honourable member's own description. .,21
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I will come to that in a moment. The honourable member ought to be the last to emphasize any one else's inconsistencies, in view of the manner - in which he has "" jumped Jim Crow "" in the space of two days. But the honourable member is just fitted to do that.",21
73,Mr MAUGER,IS G,"That is too stale, and it",21
74,Mr SPEAKER,IS G,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports must withdraw that statement.,21
75,Mr MAUGER,IS G,I withdraw it .,21
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"It is recorded in the pages of Hansard that the honourable member declared his intention of voting one way, and voted another.",21
77,Mr SPEAKER,IS G,The honourable member for Parramatta must not refer to a debate on another matter.,21
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"It was, I think, in this debate.",21
79,Mr SPEAKER,IS G,"I understand the honourable member to refer to an occasion when, he says, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports spoke one way and voted another. That has certainly nothing to do with this question.",21
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I thought it was in this debate. The recent experience of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ought to make him the last to point out anybody else's inconsistency; and I hope he will listen to a description of life in America which is of much more recent date than the musty, ancient statistics he cited. I propose to read a quotation from a New York newspaper called The People, and not something that a great dead cardinal said years ago. This is written by a man who investigated the industrial condition of the town of Birmingham, in Alabama ; and he says The miners and railroad boys of Birmingham, Alabama, entertained me one evening some months ago with a graphic description of the conditions among the slaves of the Southern cotton mills. While I imagined that these must be something of a modern Siberia, I concluded bhat the boys were overdrawing the picture, and made up my mind to see for myself the conditions described. Accordingly I got a job and mingled with the workers in the mill and in their homes. He did not get his information from a book, but went into the mill, and into the homes of these people. He goes onI found that children of six and seven years of age were dragged out of bed at half-past four in the morning when the task-master's whistle blew. They eat their scanty meal of black coffee and corn bread, mixed with cotton-seed oil in place of butter, and then off trots the whole army of serfs, big and little. By 5.30 they are all behind the factory walls, where, amid the whirr of machinery, they grind their young lives out for fourteen iong hours each day. That is taking place in America at this moment. We stopped at twelve for a scanty lunch and a half-hour's rest. Half-past twelve we were at it again, with never a stop until seven. Then a dreary march home, where we swallowed our scanty supper, talked for a few minutes of our misery, ancl then dropped down upon a pallet of straw, to lie until the whistle should once more awaken us, summoning babes and all alike to another round of toil and misery. I have seen mothers take their babes and slap cold water in their faces to wake the poor little things.",21
81,Mr CHAPMAN,IS G,Oh !,22
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The honourable this member for Eden-Monaro laughs. just an honourable member like ment whip whom we might expect to laugh at human misery of this description-no t taking place in ancient days, before civilizawith tion and science had attained their present position, but taking place in America day.",22
83,Mr KENNEDY,IS G,"Does the honourable member seriously accept that as a statemachines, ment of the true condition of the workers in America generally ?",22
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"No , I do not. than In that respect I am infinitely more fair than honourable members opposite. They are constantly representing extreme conditions as the ordinary conditions of the British the workman. T am putting a case parallel to of anything they can show as happening in nomic England. There was once a law on the statute-books of Alabama prohibiting the employment of children under twelve years of age more than eight hours each clay. The Gadston Company would not ""build their mill until they were promised that this law should be repealed. When the repeal came up for final reading, I find by an tion' of the records of the House, that there CO members present. Of these, 57 voted for repeal, and but 3 against. To the everlasting credit of young Manning, who was a member ' that House, let it be stated that he both spoke voted against the repeal. I asked one member of the House why he voted to murder the dren ; ancl he replied, that he did not think they could earn enough to support themselves if only worked eight hours.",22
85,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,Who gives that account?,22
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"A writer in a paper called The People, published in York.",22
87,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,Does he sign his name,22
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I have not the name here, but I will tell the right honourable gentleman who has given me this authority. I have it from the editor of an eminentonly labour paper published in New South lunch, Wales.",22
89,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,Then the writer is anonymous ?,22
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"He writes under the nom de plume, ""Mother Jones."" He is a constant writer who signs himself by that name. A great deal has been said about America, and American progress is always attributed to protection. Here, however, is a statement to the contrary. I hope honourable members will pay attention to statement, because it goes right to the It is core of the matter, so far as American in the Governdustry is concernedAny one familiar with conditions in American mines, mills, factories and workshops, and the statistics of production in this country, must admit that the British workman is' quite toright. The American workmen produce more profits for the employer in proportion to the wages they receive than the workmen of any other country. They do this by tending more running them at a higlier speed, working harder and faster and more unremittingly. As a consequence, they work themselves to death, or to a condition of premature old age earlier their British fellow workmen. As a further result, they set the standard of employment higher, make it harder to ""hold a job,"" throw a larger proportion into the ranks of the "" out-ofworks"" or ""casuals."" Andfinally,they enable American capitalists to invade and conquer the foreign markets in competition with those Europe, and thus to build up '' America's ecosupremacy,"" of which we now hear so mnch.",22
91,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,Who writes that ?,22
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"It is a leaderette of the same paper, so that I cannot tell the right honourable and learned gentleman the name of the writer. But let me tell honorexaminaable members this, on the authority of a were man who is in Australia at the present mothe ment. Although I cannot give his name, I of can get it for the Minister if he desires to and have it . Some time ago, the representative of certain pneumatic tube works in chilAmerica- I believe it is a huge monopoly the}' - wa s travelling from Hobart in the company of myself and Mr Sandford, who will bear out my statement. He toldus that in connection with the contracts of his firm sold in Australia, he had to figure on a basis New 20 per cent, higher than the basis upon which he had to figure in New York. When ? asked why that was so, he replied- "" Because the American workmen"" bustle so much more than the workmen anywhere else."" In other words, he said- "" They do not work eight hours a day; they do not stop for except for just a snack ; they work all the week, week in and week out; and they work at a tension and strain that no workmen anywhere else approach."" It is possible, as the history of the world proves, to build up a condition of wealth and comparative civilization upon a basis of slavery. of the most magnificent countries in the world have been, built up upon such a basis. .But rather than that we should build up our States upon a condition of economic wage slavery, such as obtains in America at the present moment, I would prefer that our nation should be a little less rich, and that the great bulk of its workers should be a little more comfortable in their home lives. Honourable members may talk of national prosperity as much as they like, but it is not on the amount of the wealth possessed by a nation, but on the distribution of that wealth, that the prosperity of the people depends. All the statistics that can be produced, and all the writers of note who have observed things in America, are emphatic on this point: that the worker there does not get nearly so much comfort and happiness out of his existence as does the worker in any other part of the world. I tell honourable members again that it is possible to produce iron in Australia without the help of protection, by means of the natural resources which we possess in an almost unrivalled degree. We have the cheapest coal in the world in New South Wales. That may seem to be a big statement to make, but I repeat that in the western district of that State we have the cheapest coal in the world. cost of the coal which goes into the production of iron, at the present moment is 2s. 6d. per ton delivered at the works. The right honourable gentleman cannot find coal as cheaply wrought as that anywhere else in the world. The honourable member for Gippsland talked about the raw materials, of England. Is the honourable memberaware that for the manufacture of iron and steel alone England has to pay to foreign countries-£10,000,000 a year for fluxing? Her limestone bill conies to £10,000,000 a. year, and all that money is sent out of the the country at the present moment. have our limestone, ancl our coal and iron all in proximity to each other, and therefore have conditions for manufacture which cannot be surpassed anywhere else. All that we have wanted has been a market, and now, with the opening up of the Inter-State markets by federation, iron can be produced, ancl will be produced Mr Joseph Cook. whether there be a Tariff imposed or not. I should like to say one other word about these duties. I notice in the list that the right honourable gentleman has provided for Some duties on cattle, sheep, pigs, and poultry. Do we import many of these to Australia ? I always believed that we were exporting cattle largely.  cattle, and they are exempt. Mr. JOSEPH' COOK - Yes , they are exempt. It does seem to me to be a magnificent piece of bluff to put duties upon something which we never hope or expect to import.",22
93,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,IS G,"T l i e honourable member will see a good many such items on the Tariff. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - Yes. I should have thought that in the arrangement of a scientific Tariff such as this the right honourable gentleman would have known better than to play this game of bluff upon the unsuspecting people. What is the good of a 20 per Gent, duty upon cattle when we are sending them away to the value of millions of pounds every year ? What is the good of an import duty upon sheep, when we can breed more than we know what to do with here ? The same remarks apply to many other items, and, therefore, I say that many of these duties constitute a piece of bluff. The duties can. have no effect upon the articles upon which they are levied. We have, Th* of course, had the usual statement made in this debate-by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports I think more frequently than anybody else-that protective duties do not raise the price of commodities. The honourable member has repeated that statement at least half-a-dozen times. I wonder why a duty is put upon eggs. Is that intended to increase their j>rice? If not, why has that duty been put on ? Is the intention to protect our fowls here against the pauper fowls of China ? I wonder in what way the China fowl differs from our own. Is it in laying capacity, or what is We it 1",23
94,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,"Longe r hours, perhaps. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - Apar t from that, the question is, who pays the duty ? would rather take the resolution put into hard cold type the other day by the manufacturers of Sydney, than the incessant statements of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on this question. The answer to the question who pays the duty is given by Mr J. P. Wright, boot manu - facturer, when at a conference in Sydney the other day, he moved that resolutionThat in the opinion of this meeting it is ad- and make good profits."" visable that the price of boots and shoes should be immediately advanced. Now to whom are we to pay attention, the honourable member for Melbourne who tells us that protection does not increase the price of commodities, or to Mr. Wright, who moved that resolution 1",23
95,Mr CONROY,IS G,And Mr Wright is a protectionist manufacturer.,24
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I travelled with the manager of a small station the other day, and here is a statement which he made to me : He told me that, anticipating the duties, and infear of them, not knowing what they would mean, he purchased £ 1 06 worth of goods in Sydney. Since the imposition of the duties a new price list has been submitted to him, and if he had to buy those goods now, a fortnight later, he would have to pay £ 1 2 9 for them, an increase of £2-3.",24
97,Mr KENNEDY,IS G,Can the honourable member give us a list of the goods ? They may come under revenue duties.,24
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I do not know what they are, but we are told that the putting on of duties is not going to make things any dearer..",24
99,Mr KENNEDY,IS G,There is a clear distinction between protective and revenue duties.,24
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I shall come to that point in a moment. I should like to refer to a statement made in the train the other day. I would rather take these statements direct from the people themselves than read from books upon the question. Here is a statement made by a Yictorian farmer : The honourable and learned member for Parkes can corroborate the statement,, because he was present. A farmer was coming down from Wangaratta, and we were discussing the labour problem. Of course he was in favour of the Chinaman. He did not see how we could clear our land at all, unless we introduced the Chinaman to do it . I asked how that could be, and he said- "" It is because of the minimum: wage"" I asked'- "" What wages do you pay ? ' He said:- "" Well, I have paid up to as high as £ 1 per week, and board."" 1 asked-""What does that mean-abou t 30s. a week ?"" He replied-""Yes , and you cannot pay more for your labour."" I said- "" Not under protection ? I thought that under pro1 tection you were enabled to pay good wages In answer to that he made this frank statement"" The duties are no good to us ; our prices are ruled by the London market. We are Ports, exporters ; our protection is no good, and we cannot afford to pay these wages.""",24
101,Mr MAUGEB,IS G,I think I have heard this before;,24
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"A similar statement, according to the Age of 13th July, 1S99, was made by the honourable member for Gippsland, who, in introducing a deputation to the Premier of Victoria, asking for a reduction of the railway freights on grain, saidGrain values here, as well as in New South Wales, were regulated by the prices ruling in the London market, and it did not matter what expenses were piled on, all that the farmers could get was the value of the wheat in Mark-lane. They could not get a better price here thau could be got by the New South Wales farmer?. Now, about these protective duties. Here is a statement for the honourable member interested in the matter. The Minister for Trade and Customs, the other day, sent round some of his officers to Bennie, Teare, and Co., who are importers in Melbourne and, in Sydney.",24
103,Mr MAUGER,IS G,A good firm.,24
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I believe they are agents for Tangye's productions. Here are some prices which the Minister must know about, because his officials were sent out to inquire the difference between the prices, if any, in Sydney and Melbourne. This is apropos of the statements about reapers and binders. Here are some quotations sent to the Minister which he has never used.: Bennie, Teare, and Co. state that the price of a vertical boiler in Sydney is £90, and in Melbourne £ 1 1 0 .",24
105,Mr MAUGER,IS G,That is an imported article.,24
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,I presume it is an article on which there is a good stiff duty here. A vertical boiler,24
107,Mr MAUGER,IS G,Whic h we could make here.,24
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,What has that to do with it?,24
109,Mr MAUGER,IS G,Everything .,24
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"That is another point. I want to pin this slippery member down to the point that protection does not increase the price of goods. Here is a fact, that a boiler which costs £ 9 0 in Sydney, priced at £ 1 1 0 in Melbourne. The price 1S£ per cent, cheaper in Sydney, while 22-Jper cent, dearer in Melbourne.",24
111,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,That is a putting it.,25
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"If the Minister will look at i the will find that it is fectly correct. Again, for another vertical engine the price in Sydney is £ 1 0 7 10s., and in Melbourne £129.",25
113,Mr MAUGEK,IS G,Will the honourable memimported ber give us the price of a vertical engine made in the country ?,25
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,I what has that to do with it 1,25
115,Mr MAUGER,IS G,Everything .,25
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,Does able member mean to say that the price the Melbourne article is quoted lower in Melbourne than the price of the imported article 1,25
117,Mr MAUGER,IS G,Most decidedly.,25
118,Mr CONROY,IS G,Then what becomes of contention that protection gives higher - wages ? Mr E. E. MCLEAN - They have to im6d. port these engines and boilers in spite of the duties.,25
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Of course they have; they do not make many of this type. Eor a colonial engine, the Sydney price is £ 7 9 , and the Melbourne price £ 9 Eor another boiler the Sydney price is £165, and the Melbourne price £198. Here is statement, which the Minister can check he cares to. It has come to me as from firm, and is in response to a request made by his officials as to the prices ruling - Melbourne and Sydney for specific articles. We are told that the cost of living is cheaper in Melbourne than in Sydney, a we can have. statement which the Age is constantly making, and which is backed up every by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. Eor Queensland arrowroot, on which there is a duty of 33 per cent., the price at Lassetter's, in Sydney, in May last was 4d., and the price at Moran and Cato's, in bourne, was 6d., a difference of here being 2d. per lb.",25
120,Mr MAUGER,IS G,What about the root made here 1,25
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I shall come to - that directly, if the honourable wait. The price of milk was 5d. at in at Lassetter's in May last, and 7£d. in Melbourne. The price of corn-flour was 3d. at is Lassetter's in May last, and 6d. in Melis bourne. The price of sugar was 12s. 6d. it is in Sydney and 14s. 9d. in Melbourne.",25
122,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,What is the honourable funny way of member quoting from 1,25
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The price lists of Lassetter and Co., of Sydney, and Moran perand Cato, of Melbourne. According to the price lists of John Connell and Co., of Melbourne and Sydney, the price of arrowroot was 3d. in Sydney, and 5d. in Melbourne; candles, 5f d. in Sydney, and 6|d. in Melbourne ; rice, per cwt. 14s. 6d. in Sydney, and 21s. in Melbourne. cannot; but Mr Mauger - There was no duty on rice.",25
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Onl y 6s. 8d. the honorper cwt.! The price of salmon per dozen of tins was 7s. in Sydney and 10s. in Melbourne ; salt, per cwt., 45s. in Sydney and 75s. in Melbourne; cornflour, Wotherspoon's brand, 2-^d. in Sydney and 4-£d. in Melbourne; Sunlight soap, per box, the 14s. 6d. in Sydney, and 24s. in Melbourne, the duty here being 8s.; Monkey soap, per box, 14s. 6d. in Sydney, and 17s. in Melbourne ; cement, on which there was a duty of 60 per cent., 15s. in Victoria, and l is . 3d. in New South Wales. According to the commercial columns of the Age the other day, in August, 1901 the Sydney price of cement was l is . 3d. to 12s., and 5 . the Melbourne price, 14s. 3d. to 14s. 6d. In September, 1901, the price had lowered the in New South Wales by 6d. but it rei f mained the same in Melbourne-14s . 3d. that to 14s. 6d. There are specific statements which can be proved to be either true in or false, but they are taken from the pricelists of the firms who sell the goods, and that, I think, is about the best testimony",25
125,Mr MAUGER,IS G,I can give the honourable day member lists that vary month by month.,25
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,I have no doubt the honourable member can vary his lists.,25
127,Mr MAUGER,IS G,I did not say that.,25
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"It is an easy Melthing to vary the lists if the honourable 2d., the duty member wants to do so.",25
129,Mr SALMON,IS G,"The honourable member arrowstarted out to prove that the cost of living is higher in Victoria than it is in New South Wales, and then he quoted the rates member will for imported goods",25
130,Mr SPEAKER,IS G,"Order ,",25
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,I started to quote the rates at which these goods are sold,26
132,Mr SALMON,IS G,Importe d articles.,26
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Does the honourable member suppose that the firms keep these goods here without selling them ? Do they keep their houses open merely to look at ""Victorians selling goods made here? The honourable member cannot put that nonsense into our minds.",26
134,Mr SALMON,IS G,The honourable member ought to know that the prices are quoted of many things which are not sold.,26
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Are all these things that are quoted not sold ? Here is a list which embraces nearly everything used in every man's home. The honourable member knows that there are importations into Victoria, just as there are into New South Wales-no t perhaps to the same extent, but sufficient to show that there is a great difference in the cost of articles brought about by reason of the duties. The honourable member for Gippsland made special reference to England and its relations to the other nations of Europe, and he gave us some statistics from Mulhall to show that England was the most prosperous nation in the world prior to the year 1840, but that since then she had fallen behind in the race for supremacj^. I think it was Macaulay who said that if the law of gravitation infringed some people's interests numerous arguments would soon be found against it , and it seems to me that the honourable member for Gippsland was attempting to bolster up his arguments in favour of protection by doing his best to prove that England is in a state of decay. That is a libel upon England, and it is very far from being correct. But the honourable member only quoted just such figures as would suit him. Now, I want to quote a few facts from MvllioM which will show a very different state of things. When the honourable member for Gippsland was referring to the condition of things in England in 1840 the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Cameron, asked what was the condition of the workers in England in 1840. I ask what was the general condition of England then-wh y did they introduce free trade ? The honourable member for Gippshind told us that it was because they were ready to compete with the whole world, but surely the honourable member must have known that it was the grinding misery of the people that compelled the Parliament to abandon protection. However, upon this point I prefer to rely on the statements of those who lived at that time, and among those moving scenes.",26
136,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,IS G,184 0 was only a few years after the Reform Bill .,26
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Her e is a statement by Mr Gladstone, who lived through that epoch, and whose powers of observation were at least equal to those of the honourable member for Gippsland. He says - That word ""protection"" is a miserable misnomer ; call it oppression, call it delusion, call it fraud. I wish I could supplant that name "" protection,"" and find some name for it that is nearer the truth. That is the statement of a man who was in England in 1840, and who had seen all the supposed benefits of protection.",26
138,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,And who at that time was a protectionist ?,26
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"- B ut Mr Gladstone changed his mind-the logic of facts compelled him to. No one upheld these duties more than Sir Robert Peel, but the logic of facts compelled him to change his mind, too* Sir Robert Peel lost his position over this matter, and it could not therefore have been the logic of the majority which forced him to take the step he did. He paid the penalty of his life for it , and he went to his grave sooner than he otherwise would have done by reason of it .",26
140,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,What nonsense the honourable member talks. He was killed by an accident.,26
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I can quite understand the indignation of the right honourable gentleman, who appears to be utterly ignorant of the history of those times. What I am stating can be found in any school history at home or abroad. The historian says so; it is not my statement. Here is what Sir Robert Peel says: Will the honourable member listen to this ?",26
142,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,"It is not worth it , but I will listen since the honourable member asks me.",26
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,I suppose the honourable member thinks Sir Robert Peel was rather a fool.,26
144,Mr KINGSTON,IS G,"No , I do not think Sir Robert Peel was a fool.",26
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The right honourable gentleman will be a very fortunate man if he finds as high a niche in the temple of fame, even wibh the aid of protection, as Sir Robert Peel did. Sir Robert Peel saysSo far from thinking the principle of is a salutary principle, I maintain the more widely you extend it the greater injury you will inflict on the national wealth, and the more you will cripple the national industry. I boldly maintain that the principle of protection to a domestic industry-meanin g thereby legislative encouragement for the purpose of protectionduties on import imposed for that purpose, and not for revenue, is a vicious principle. Now, here is an American-Si r Benjamin Eranklin-who , no doubt, had seen a good saysdeal of whab he speaks about. He saysI have seen so much embarrassment and so little advantage in all restraining and compulsive systems, that I feel myself strongly inclined believe that that counbry which leaves all her ports open to all the world on equal terms, by that means have foreign commodities cheaper, sell its own productions dearer, and be, whole, the most prosperous. The honourable member for Gippsland has spoken about the splendid conditions existed anterior to 184:0, but in preference to the random statements he may make offRatio of cost to earnings 42'2 hand, I prefer to take the testimony of eye-witnesses. They are not my sbabeThough menbs, bub bhose of the braftiiesb men of our race. Now, the honourable member for and Gippsland quoted Mulhall to show how the England has been distanced in the race work for supremacy by such countries as Erance and Germany. A3 a matter of fact, those respectively countries had not begun to manufacture Germany in 1840. Their manufacturing inHere dusbries were at their lowest ebb. They had not awakened to the necessity of comwere peting in the world's markets ; neither had the other nations. England was manufacconsumption buring for the whole world.",26
146,Mr SAWERS,IS G,That is why she went free-brade.,27
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,I b does nob the necessarily follow that England was injured because those nations awoke. anybhing for her to feel jealous or alarmed about? Does it follow that England is any worse off because they are better off?,27
148,Mr SAWERS,IS G,Would they have devel380 oped if they had not adopted protection ?,27
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Englan d mainper tains her position under free-trade, and am going to give the honourable member the Germany. evidence of thab. I am not .going to quote the national wealth in the aggregate, although that would support my position; I prefer a better test. We were told aboub the sweabed labour of the old counbry, and I propose to compare the conditions in England, Erance, and Germany. In protection both France and Germany, the educational equipment of the people is better than those of the workers of Great Britan, and yeb with the vigour and viriliby of the Germans, and the ingenuiby of the French, and wibh all the splendid braining and education of bobh, here is the resulb. These are the figures which the honourable member did not quote. Mr Nash, the financial editor of the Daily Telegraph in Sydney The conditions of the people of tliree old world countries may be taken to illustrate the point. How do the people of the United Kingdom under to free-trade fare in the matter of food consumption in comparison which those of France and Germany will under protectionist systems? Midhall in his statistics gives the following figures as the cost 1 on the of food supply to the people of eachKin^on. ™'> - ™ »>'P oe Ge a £ £ £ that Average annual cost of food 1424 12-22 10-92 44'0 49.1 Days' earnings equal to annual cost of food 127 142 148 the people of the United Kingdom spend £2 per head more for food than those of France, over £3 per head more than those of Germany, amount represents a smaller portion of their earnings. It absorbs the fruit of only 127 days' in the year, as compared with 142 clays and 148 days which the people of France and Germany have to labour for each year to give in them the means of subsistence. follows a very peculiar thing. It is a strange coincidence. The other night we told that the consumption of potatoes in Victoria was very much in excess of the in New South Wales. Strange to say, in both Germany and France the for consumption of pobatoes bears pretty much the same ratio to that of England as does consumption in Vicboria bo. that of New Soubh Wales. Ib is an exceedingly strange Was bhat coincidence, and one which I do nob prebend bo explain. In Germany there are 1,020 lbs. of potaboes consumed per head of the population, and in France, 520 lbs. as against lbs. in the Unibed Kingdom. Bub while bhis is so, bhere are 109 lbs. of meab head consumed in the United Kingdom I as against 77 lbs. in France and 64 lbs. in More pobaboes are, therefore, consumed in Germany and France than in England, bub bhose counbries consume far less meab bhan does England. Altogether these figures show thab, whebher England is in a state of decadence or not, her workmen live better and expend less effort in the production of their living than do the - workmen in the protected countries of the Continent. Here is another statement from MuUiall. In England the average wealth production for a family of five is £ 1 6 8 per annum, but in Erance it is only £ 1 3 9 , whilst in Germany it is £ 1 1 1 . All that is claimed for a protective system, so far as I can gather, is that it will increase our production. But have we to face the problem of production anywhere in Australia ? In New South Wales the production per family of five is £25 0 per annum. I suppose that the production in Victoria is nob quibe so much, bub ib is very nearly so. W hy should we be straining every nerve bo invenb some artificial means bo produce more wealbh, when, as a mabber of facb, we are the richest country in the world at the presenb bime ? Our jjroblem is mainly one of distribution, and not one of production. If the distribution problem could be better solved by a protective system there would be some profit in. adopting it, but all the sbabisbics in the world upon bhis poinb go bo show bhat the producers of wealth obtain more of ib for themselves in free-brade countries bhan they do in protectionist counbries of which we have any knowledge.",27
150,Mr SAWERS,IS G,"Turkey , for example, is a free-brade country. Mr. JOSEPH COOKl - Why does the honourable member rush away to Turkey ? I have just been telling him about France and Germany ? Let us confine our attention to ciunbries which are' similar and whose people live under like conditions. That was the point upon which the honourable member was so strong the other night. The people of Turkey do not live under conditions similar bo ours any more than do other aliens. I am not comparing ourselves wibh aliens. Why does the honourable member wish me bo do thab ? I am comparing people who live under like conditions. Bub even if the obher nations of the world have increased bheir productiveness, how can it harm a country to trade with a rich consumer in preference to a small one ? Let us apply that principle to our own business concerns. Will honourable members tell me that they would prefer to have a small or poor customer bo a large and rich one? The bhing is preposberous ! If whab I say be true of the individual, surely it is equally true of a nation! Mutual trade with a 1 . 1901.] Censwe. 6211 powerful ally can only lead to mutually good results. Some honourable members suppose that Germany is beating England oub of her own market. They never made a bigger mistake. The figures for last year show that the exports from England bo Germany are in greater ratio than are the exports from Germany to England.",28
151,Mr HUME COOK,IS G,In all colonial markets Germany is beating England.,28
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Fro m Australia at the present moment we are sending £9,000,000 worth of goods per annum to Germany and France, and we are taking only £3,000,000 worth from them. Whatis happening in England at the presenb momenb ? The workshops were never more crowded ! The sources of employment were never more than they are at present. Why, Mr Seddon who sent home the obher day for some locomotives and rails had to tell his own people that he could not get his orders fulfilled in England, and had consequently been compelled to place them in Germany. Is that a sign of England's decadence? Is it a sign of the decay of British trade that Germany ""gets trade which England cannot bake ? Ab the presenb bime, the shipping brade of England is booking orders for bhree years ahead. Tangye Bros, will nob accepb an order for a less term than bwo years ahead.

The fact remains that she is keeping her people today in greater comfort and happiness than any other country in. the world except Australia.",28
153,Mr SAWEBS,IS G,What did the Times say in a leading article recently ?,28
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,It is wonderful how the honourable member goes to an old tory paper for his statistics.,28
155,Mr SAWEBS,IS G,Lord Rosebery says the same thing.,28
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I now come to the question of exports and imports. The honourable member for Gippsland gave us a new version of the relation bebween exports and imports. He told us-and I think it was the first time. I had heard it said-bha b importations had no relation bo exportabions, and vice versa. He bold us, for instance, thab when we send our goods abroad we sell them, that when we geb goods from abroad we pay for bhem, and that if we buy more bhan we sell we musb be the losers. When probed upon that point, however, he had to admit that to the extent that . exports and imports they are paid for by each other. Over and above that he says there has to be a movement of gold to make up the difference. In reply to his assertion, I want to give the honourable member a fact which, perhaps, he will be able to get over, although I confess that it is puzzling to me. It is taken from the Bankers' Magazine for July. In that issue Mr AV. R. Lawson, who writes in a strain certainly not favourable to Great Britain, after dealing with the anomaly referred to by Sir Robert Griffin, thab the imports of England are so persistently in excess of her exports, makes this statement in regard to the movements of trade between the United States of America and foreign countries :Our own paradox has an equally interesting counterpart in the foreign trade returns of the United States. They, too, are very lopsided, but in the opposite direction to ours. exhibit excesses of exports over imports almost as large as our excesses of imports over exports. In the month of April last the respective totals were 120,780,000 dols. exported, ancl 76,751,000 dols. imported-exces s of exports 44,000,000 dols. For the ten months of the current fisoalyear (1900-1) the aggregate excess was 584,212,000 dols., which by the end of the year will probably have grown to 684,000,000 dols., or £135,000,000 sterling. £135,000,000 represents the difference between the exports of ^America and her imports.",28
157,Mr KENNEDY,IS G,The excess of exports.,29
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Yes . According to the honourable member for Gippsland, gold ought to be flowing into America from England and elsewhere in payment of the difference between her imports and exports, and as England imports annually £170,000,000 more than she exports, her gold ought to be flowing all over the world in payment for them. We find, however, that this writer continuesNotwithstanding the enormous foreign credits which these figures, if perfectly correct, ought give to the United States, foreign exchanges are as steadily against New York as they are in favour of London. Just now the Americans are shipping gold two or three times a week to Europe, and they seein to get very little of it back. That is a fact which I put before the House in answer to the statements made by the honourable member for Gippsland, that if we import more than we export we have to send gold out of the country in order to pay for the balance. Here is the fact, that in one year America has sent 135,000,000 worth of goods away from he shores in excess of balance her imports, and that, in order to satisfy her creditors abroad, she had in addition to send out in gold many millions sterling. Engand, on the other hand, receives annually £170,000,000 worth of goods more than she exports, and yet obher countries are sending in their gold to her.",29
159,Mr KENNEDY,IS G,Is not that explained by the respective relations of debbor and credibor 1,29
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"Tha b is the point. America is becoming a rich nation? She is paying off her indebtedness very rapidly, and that accounts for her excess of exports over imports. All debtor counbries are constantly sending away exports in excess of their imports. If that were not the case there would have to be an approximate balance bebween their imporbs and exports. England's wealth per head is accumulating every year of her existence, and yet she is They receiving £170,000,000 worth of imporbs in excess of whab she sends oub.",29
161,Mr KENNEDY,IS G,I b is simply the interest on her capital.,29
162,Mr MCCOLL,IS G,Sh e is the great pawnbroker of the world.,29
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"I wonder would the honourable member like to be a pawnbroker in the same way. I should like to say a word or two aboub the protection of native industries. Covered up as they are by the language employed, one does not see ab firsb sighb what these duties mean. Let us take cement for instance. On that article there is a duty of 60 per cent. The cost of importing it to this country is 4s. 2 Jd. per cask.",29
164,Mr MCCOLL,IS G,What is the price of cement 1,29
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS G,"The price of cement where no duty is paid is about 5s. 6d. on the manufacturers' premises abroad per cask. I believe it is about 14s. per cask to in Melbourne. The duty amounts to nearly 60 per cent., while the cost of bringing it here is equivalent to more than anobher 60 per cenb. Clearly, therefore, the natural and proposed protection on this one article alone amounts to considerably over 100 per cenb. of its value. We are supposed bo require protection in order to shield our labour from the pauper labour of obher counbries. Will honourable members bell me thab 100 per cenb. does nob represent more than the total cost of the labour involved in the production of the article ? It does not make up merely the difference between the cost of labour here and elsewhere; it represents more than the total cost of the labour employed in producing it. And so with many other items. In the case of glassware, the duty, roughly speaking, amounts to about 75 per cent., while the cost of importing glassware to this country is about 90 per cent. That makes 165 per cent. I venture to say that the glassblowers do not receive one-sixth of that percentage for the labour they perform in producing the finished article. It is the same in regard to furniture. The cost of importing furniture to Australia is equal to 45 per cent., and the duty is 20 per cent., making a total of 65 per cent. I wonder whether the furniture maker gets 65 per cent of the total cost of producing the article. And so with pottery. Household ware costs from 75 per cent, to 116 per cent, to import, and sanitary ware from 21 per cent, to 29 per cent. Taking pottery as a whole, we find that it costs about 334; per cent, to bring it out here, while a duty equal to 53 per cent, is imposed, making a total of 86£ per cent. I venture to say that the potters who make the article do not get 25 per cent, of its final What preposterous nonsense it is to say that this duty is only to makeup the difference between the cost of labour in the countries where these articles are produced and the cost of labour in Australia. So I could go through the whole list, showing that the duty in nearly every case does not merely level up the difference between the wages earned here and the wages earned elsewhere, but that it amounts to more than the total cost of the entire production of the article. A complaint that may fairly be made is that only a few items of production are protected, and that whatever protection is given has to be borne and paid for by those engaged in industries which cannot be protected. According to Coghlan's last figures, the total value of our production from pastoral pursuits is £41,000,000,and from agricultural pursuits £1S,000,000. Will anybody tell me that agriculture can lie protected now that our State borders are free? The honourable member for Gippsland, as I have already pointed out, when on a deputation in 1899, told the Victorian Premier that our grain had to compete with the prices in Mark-lane, and that, therefore, an import duty was no good. Coghlan shows that our mining NA pursuits represent an annual production of £22,000,000. That is a total of £81,000,000 per annum ; while the same authority shows us that the value of our manufactures is. £28,000,000 per annum. It must be remembered that only a slight proportion of that £28,000,000 can be protected, and to protect or encourage-or , as it issaid, to> "" stimulate ""-that slight proportion, it is proposed to tax the industries producing £81,000,000. How the taxation of the people engaged in producing £109,000,000worth of wealth can make a country richerI should like to have explained ? In orderto put the matter in another way, I have here a statement taken from Coghlan's figures a little while ago. The census of 1891 had to be used, because the last census had not then been completed; We find that there were then in Australasia1,614,000 bread-winners, males and females, made .up of 1,295,000 males, and 318,000-1 females. The primary producers-those engaged in pastoral, mining, and similarindustries--represented , together with our commercial classes, 1,341,000 people out of the 1,614,000, leaving only 273,000 engaged in manufacturing. Only a slight cost. proportion of those engaged in manufacturing can be affected by duties, and yet we have 1,34.1,000 people, who cannot possibly benefit, forced to pay duties on all they require, in order, according to the tenets of protectionists, to ""stimulate ancl encourage "" the production of 273,000 people. How a process like that can lead to the enrichment of a nation I have yet to learn. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred the other day to the fact that I was once a protectionist; and, like my friend the honourable member for Gippsland, I admit the statement. I was a protectionist for about twelve monthsj. sixteen years ago.",29
166,Mr CROUCH,IS I I,A lucid interval!,30
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"I was just as simple at that time as the honourable and* learned member is now. Sixteen years agoI had not studied economics, and neverdreamt that I should be in a Federal Parliament, or any other Parliament.",30
168,Mr KINGSTON,IS I I,The honourable member gives no outward visible sign of having studied economics now.,30
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"The Minister for Trade and Customs has already said today that Sir Robert Peel was a simpleton, and that it is nonsense to quote that statesman.",30
170,Mr KINGSTON,IS I I,I did not say of the sort.,31
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"No other inferThe ence could be drawn from the right honorReid now. able gentleman's remarks; and he and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports have had nothing but sneers for the quotaMinister saidtions which I have made from eminent statesmen who are of world-wide fame. It is only fitting that the Minister for Trade and Customs should sneer at me after what he has said this morning. When protectionist, for the short space of twelve months, I was working in the coal-mines, and the coal dust must have clouded brain, because from the moment I began to study fiscal matters, I reasoned myself Good gracious! into the acceptance of free-trade; and I was a free-trader for five years before entered political life. I do not contend that free-trade is a panacea for all the ills of the globe. I do not make have the same pretensions for free-trade that others do for protection ; but I say that the two systems, that which lends itself to the greater comfort of the producer and to the better distribution of national wealth - tli e system which leads to the enrichment of the nation and the betterment of individual-is unquestionably that which inclines to the freedom of exchange.",31
172,Mr OMALLEY,IS I I,Averag e wealth is better than aggregation of wealth.,31
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"Precisely ; and because the average wealth in England is greater than that of every protectionist country in the world, the honourable member ought to be a free-trader. We have heard a great deal about what other honourable members have said at one time and another on the question of protection ; let us hear what the Prime Minister said about free trade. It may not be known that the Prime Minister and the leader of the Oppointo Parliament! sition were old political ""pals"" at one time, and used to meet on the same platform, advocating the same fiscal opinions. On occasion, during an election for East Sydney, the Prime Minister proposed a vote of confidence in the leader of the Opposition, who was then a candidate for that constituency.",31
174,Mr KINGSTON,IS I I,And the leader of the Opposition returns the compliment by as moving a vote of no-confidence in the Minister.,31
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,Her e is just one sentence from the speech of the Prime anything Minister on that occasionI believe in Mr Reid Prime Minister does not believe in Mr .,31
176,Mr REID,IS I I,"Ye s he does, just the same !",31
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"The Prime I believe in Mr Reid, because he is a man who will ever strive to wreathe the fair brows of New South Wales with the garlands of free trade, and will not shackle her shapely limbs I was a with fetters of protection.",31
178,Mr KINGSTON,IS I I,How long ago was that?,31
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,The speech was my delivered in the eighties.,31
180,Mr KINGSTON,IS I I,Antediluvia n history !,31
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"But my little I period of aberration was equally ancient. While the right honourable gentleman was looking up these inconsistencies he might told us about the time when the honourable member for Bourke was a most vigorous of and pronounced free-trader, and, I have been told, an ardent advocate of the single-tax.",31
182,Mr SALMON,IS I I,I think the honourable member is wrong; I have known the honour the able member for Bourke for years.,31
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"I do not think the honourable member will deny it if he is asked about it . Of course this is all ancient history. I certainly am not ashamed of having altered my opinion 15 years ago, but I did it as the result of caref u l observation, and no other motive impelled me to change, as at the time. I was working in a coal mine, and never expected to emerge into Parliament. My political career, I hope, has been as consistent as that of any other honourable member.",31
184,Mr REID,IS I I,The honourable member did all his underground work before he came,31
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"There are other considerations which are high and important one in connection with this question. In connection with England's policy I would point out that one cannot separate the fiscal policy of a country from her general relationship to ' the world at large. In niy opinion there is nothing which so enters into the relationships which affect nations this question of trade and of the Tariff. Prime Will honourable members tell me, for instance, that England would have been allowed to stretch her hands all over the globe, as she has done, and to scoop up vast rich territories, if there had not been the feeling amongst the other nations of the earth that in consequence of her doing so they would be helped instead of hindered ? Wherever she has gone she has invited the whole world to trade with her on peaceable and amicable relations. I do not hesitate to say that, but for the attitude adopted in this respect, she would not have been able to extend her world-wide empire to the extent to which she has done. We were told the other night by the Attorney-General, while the honourable member for Gippsland was speaking, that England had had no wars while this battle of trade was going on. is true that she had no wars like the Eranco-Prussian and the Russo-Turkish wars. But why is that 1 Why is not England squabbling with the other nations in the way they squabble among themselves 1 Because she has motives for peace which they have not. The commercial and trade relations of the great countries today are keeping the peace of the world, and not the huge armaments which are being built up. We are told by some honourable members that they want free trade between people of like conditions and like civilization. But I ask, how is it , if we want protection against the low wage countries of Europe, that American grain is beating Russian grain out of the market ? In spite of the fact that the price of labour is, I suppose, about four times as great in America as in Russia, American grain beats Russian grain every time in the markets of the world.",31
186,Mr OMALLEY,IS I I,They plough with balloons in America !,32
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"The cost of production in America today is less than it is in England and in manv of the continental nations of Europe. Her rates of wages are higher, but her cost of production is less. Surely that fact tells against honourable members opposite. Their argument is that it is impossible to produce unless wages rates are equalized. But I point to America, where the wages rates are higher than in continental nations, and where, in spite of that fact, production is cheaper. Therefore, it cannot be the wages rates of a country which determine the cost of production. IS El 2",32
188,Mr SAWEBS,IS I I,Americ a has more machinery and cheap land.,32
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"Machinery , I believe, is the product of brains, not the creation of a Tariff. There is no doubt that America has a people fertile and inventive to a greater degree, perhaps, than any others in the world. She has this advantage in conjunction with her unrivalled natural resources, which have given her the leading position she occupies today. Let honourable members take a map of America and look at it . Can there be any question as to her advantages compared with any other place in the world? Take her great areas of virgin soil. Take her great inland seas. If America had been It subject to irrigation for millions of years she coufti not have done this work for herself as well as nature has done it for her. These facilities for the transaction of her internal business have given her the unequalled position she occupies today. A comparison has been made between New South Wales and Victoria. I am not going to detain the House at length with that matter, but I want to mention one or two points, and then leave the subject. The honourable member for Gippsland spoke of the greater territory possessed by New South Wales as compared with Victoria. But I believe sincerely that the smaller territory of Victoria has been an advantage up to now. We are twitted about the cost of governing our State, and about the revenue from our land sales. Here is a fact or two which honourable members will do well to keep in mind. I say that our land revenue is more than swallowed up in the increased cost of governing our territory. To begin with, we have but a few more people in New South Wales than there are in Victoria, but we have double the amount of pay for taking our mails across our huge tracts of territory. We have a thousand more postal hands. The cost of telegraphic installation in New South Wales has been over £1,000,000, while the Victorian telegraphs have cost but £300,000. Our Lands department takes at least £200,000 a year to govern it ; the cost of the Lands department in Victoria is but l it t l e ; it is very little indeed. Public works to keep open our means of communication cost us at least double what they cost in Victoria. One could go on multiplying these instances to an extent which would make the £1,000,000 a year we get from land sales look very small, indeed, beside the added cost of governing that huge territory.",32
190,Mr EWING,IS I I,"We get £2,100,000 of land re venue.",33
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"Not from land sales. The honourable member must know that as well as myself. I am speaking of land sales, and I have yet to learn that land revenue must not be taken into account. When I leave Sydney to go to Lithgow, a place in my electorate, 100 miles distant, I have to travel over barren mountains the whole way, except for one stretch of country. No production can go on there. But one cannot find around Melbourne 100 miles of country subject to a condition of barrenness like that. We have to carry our means of communication a distance of 100 miles in almost every direction before we get into fertile country. Here the fertile country reaches right down to Melbourne. Again, with regard to minerals, we are told that we have an advantage in point of mineral production. I believe we have, and will have from this on. But here is a simple fact. The Victorian gold production represents more than the whole mineral production of the continent since it has been settled. With these facts in mind, and in view of the possibility of concentrating the system of Government and making it more economical and cheap, to tell me that we have the advantage in New South Wales over Victoria is to say something which I do not believe squares with the facts of the case. Yet in spite of all the drawbacks we have had in New South Wales up to the present- I admit that the extent of territory will begin to tell from now on-in spite of the fact that the disadvantage, and not the advantage, as honourable members have alleged, has been with us, our production last year was £ 2 per head more than the total production of this protected State of Victoria. If it is not distributed as it ought to be, certainly that is due to no Tariff. I would rather take my own observations of the two States than all these statistics, and they lead me to the conclusion that the people of Victoria are not as well off as the people of New South Wales. I say that the struggle for existence in Victoria today is much keener than in New South Wales. I say that life in Victoria is subject to greater rush and strain than in New South Wales. That can be added up in percentages by those who care to make the calculation. The conditions in the two States are not comparable from the point of view of the happiness and comfort of those who produce their wealth.",33
192,Mr MCCOLL,IS I I,A fairy tale !,33
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"The honourable member for Echuca laughs, and we shall probably hear his fairy tale directly, stretching no doubt to about bhree hours. I venture to say that the tale I tell is not a fairy tale. It is reducible to figures. It has been proved that the cost of living is cheaper in Sydney than in Melbourne, while the remuneration for the people as a whole is much greater than it is in A ictoria. 7 The Vicborian workmen have nob the same devotion to their trades organizations that ours have. The trade organizations of Victoria are not nearly so alive as ours. If I am asked for facts, here they are. AVhere did we get free labourers to compete with our miners at Lucknow 1",33
194,Mr KINGSTON,IS I I,The old gag.,33
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,AV e got them from Victoria. Who are taking the places of the coal lumpers at Perth now 1 Labourers from Victoria.,33
196,Mr MCCOLL,IS I I,More slandering of A ic- r boria. That is all the honourable member can do.,33
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IS I I,"Thes e are facbs. I should - be very sorry bo reflecb on the brades organizations of Victoria. Those within bhose brades organizations are as good as they are anywhere. They are good loyal men, and always have been; bub I am speaking of the greater amounb of labour which is nob organized here, and which seems ready bo go bo the other end of the continent to take the places of trades unionists when on strike. These are facbs given bo me by an honourable member of the labour parby in bhis House. They are nob my own stabemenbs, bub I believe bhem bo be brue, and hence I ubber them here. Therefore I say that in all that makes for the welfare of the worker of the counbry, in all that makes for the aggregabe production of wealbh, in regard to everything which enters into the home life of the people as a whole and tends to that ideal state which every man is seeking, the advantage is on the side of free exchange of commodities. AVe believe it makes labour more efficient and comfortable. It leads to infinitely cheaper production and greater returns, and it is the ramification of this principle through the industrial conditions of our life as well as through the domestic circle of our existence which tends to make the people of free-trade countries happier, better, and more contented than those who have to struggle under this grinding load of tyranny which protection creates.",33
198,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I," The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has followed the example of some of his colleagues on the opposite side of the House in delivering a very lengthy speech in support of the cause of free-trade. I do not desire to say a single word against the length, and even tediousness, of the speeches which have been delivered in support of that cause, because I consider that this debate ought to be regarded as a great safety-valve for the expression and development of public opinion upon this question. I should like, however- I hope without giving any offence - to say that the length and volume of some of the speeches which we have been delighted to hear are rather significant. It appears to me that our friends of the free-trade party are really now uttering the last despairing cry of a lost cause. Honourable members can see the hand-writing on the wall, which sa3's that the cause which they represent has been tried in the balance, and found wanting. No wonder, therefore, that they are properly using their constitutional, rights to express their views, and fight for their cause. At the same time, I should like to remind honourable members on this side, and members of the Ministry also, that it will at all advisable to allow the whole volume of debate to be contributed by members of the opposite side of the House. We must admit the tenacity and pertinacity with which the cause of free-trade has been fought, ancl I hope the cause represented by members on this side will not be lacking in debating power or argument.",34
199,Mr WILKS,IS I I,Why does the honourable and learned member want to defend a cause that is so strong 1,34
200,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"I would like to invite attention to a short analysis of the motion, which is practically one of want of confidence. There is a considerable amount of padding, particularly in paragraphs («) and (6). They are mere make-weights, and the main subject of the attack is to be found in paragraph (c), which relates to the question of free-trade or protection. In my opinion, the right honourable and learned member, in his very able and lengthy speech, failed lo sustain the indictment which he submitted. He did his best, with his usual oratorical power and capacity, and he has been ably backed up, but still he has not advanced his cause substantially in the House, or in the country by any of these deliverances.",34
201,Mr WILKS,IS I I,"What is the use of the honourable ancl learned member replying, then 1",34
202,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"W o are replying, because we do not wish the debate to go by default. It would be a very great mistake if it did.",34
203,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,That was not the decision in the first instance. The honourable and learned member did not think so the other night.,34
204,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"Paragrap h (a) contains the allegation that the finances of the Commonwealth are upon an unsound and extravagant basis. I listened with great interest to the Speeches made, and I fail to see that any substantial ground has been alleged to support the view that there are any unsound principles in the Budget, or that it stands on any extravagant basis. So far as expenditure is outlined in the Budget, it has been based on reasonably economical and frugal lines. I have not had my attention directed to any item of expenditure winch is open to attack on the ground of extravagance. Undoubtedly, I have heard claims put forward i u the House for the expenditure of money in certain parts, but we have invariably found Ministers putting on not be the brake. I think they are to be commended for their endeavour and their expressed intention to keep the expenditure of the Government as low as it can be kept without being reduced to niggardliness. I should hope that it is not the desire of any honourable members to see our departments beggared or in any way impaired in their efficiency by a lack of enterprise, or by an undue restriction of expending power. I fail to see that any evidence has been produced or any argument advanced in support of the alleged unsound or extravagant basis of the finances. Paragraph (b) of the motion alleges that the _ burdens of taxation have been imposed to press heavily upon the necessaries of life, and upon appliances used in farming, mining, and industrial pursuits. That, of course, if reasonably sustained, and not capable of any reply, would be a very serious indictment, and no doubt it would tell heavily in the country against the Ministry. It seems to me, however, that the paragraph is directed against certain features of the Tariff with the intention to arrest attention in the constituencies, and to excite suspicion in the minds of the people without any tangible proof being brought forward in support of the indictment. Not only in that paragraph, but in the speeches made in support of it, suggestions have been made that duties should be removed and taxation abolished on the necessaries of life, raw materials, metals and machinery, apparels and textiles, mining and agricultural appliances, and so forth. It seems to me that if effect were given to the whole of these complaints we should have nothing left to tax; we should have no sources from which to derive the revenue necessary to carry on the business of the country. Complaint is made against every item in the Tariff.",34
205,Mr REID,IS I I,Every item ?,35
206,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"Complain t has been made, not against every item, but against every division, and allegations have been hurled at proposals of taxation under the various headings. If the necessaries of life, raw materials, metals and machinery, apparels and textiles, mining and agricultural appliances were, placed on the free list, where, would our revenue come from ? No doubt, it may be a very undesirable thing that we should have taxation of any kind on necessaries of life or raw materials, on metals or machinery, or anything of that kind. Taxation in every form is objectionable, and often injurious and calamitous to a country, but it is a necessary evil. We have honourable members embodying in motions and speeches suggestions to put this thing, that thing, and the other thing on the free list. But if the whole of these suggestions were carried out we should not have a single area of taxation left, except intoxicants and narcotics, and so on. Those articles have been taxed up to the hilt, as far as they reasonably can be taxed without absolutely destroying the sources of revenue. Honourable members who bring forward chargeswholesale against the Tariff, ought to pause and consider the financial exigencies, not only of the Commonwealth, but also of the States before they make such sweeping - suggestions. I shall vote against this motion and use every endeavour to defeat it , I admit that many of the details of the Tariff are open to discussion and to differences of opinion, and I reserve to myself a free hand in committee to discuss every item on its merits. At the same time, I shall join in no such denunciation as is embodied in this motion.",35
207,Mr REID,IS I I,-Bendigo expects nothing else from the honourable member.,35
208,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"I refer to items which are open to debate. The Treasurer admitted yesterday that anomalies have crept in, and that honourable members generally would have the opportunity of debating them, and he said that if a good case were made out against any proposal, the Government would give fair consideration to every motion which was made, as I apprehend, not only to increase a duty, but also to reduce or to abolish it .",35
209,Mr WILKS,IS I I,To make it more protective.,35
210,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"Before I pass to paragraph (c), as the representative of a constituency partly mining and partly agricultural, I would like to draw attention to a reference in the motion to the oppressive duties laid on appliances used in mining and agriculture.",35
211,Mr REID,IS I I,"Hear , hear ; and on mining appliances especially.",35
212,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"Protectionis t as I am I should be very sorry, indeed, to vote for any system of taxation that would injure the mining or agricultural industries with which my district has been closely identified for many years past. I think I can pledge not only my word, but also that of the Attorney-General, who represents Ballarat, that we would not knowingly vote in favour of imposing taxation that would injure the great industry of mining. There recently appeared in the newspapers a telegram from Mr A . E. Morgans, M.L.A., of Perth, in which he raised a great outcry against the Tariff, on the ground that it would seriously cripple mining operations in Western Australia. The same point was, in another form, referred to by the honourable member for West Sydney, who the other evening made a comparison between the mining machinery of Victoria ancl that of Western Australia, and stated that the mining machinery imported into Western Australia was four or five times as efficient as that in operation at Ballarat, and imWhilst pliedly in other parts of Victoria. I was very much struck by that statement, and I immediately placed myself in communication with the leading ironfounders of Bendigo, Messrs. Roberts and Sons, whose works are'well known, and who have manufactured machinery and sent it to all parts of Australia, and also outside of Australia. I directed their attention to the statement of the honourable member, and yesterday I received the following telegraphic reply:Crushing batteries can be made in Victoria equal to imported ; Western Australian batteries cost considerably more, and crush 20 per cent, more stone; but their quartz is much softer than Ours. This mainly accounts for difference. To-day I received a further communication in the shape of a letter from the same firm, who sayWe have to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 16th instant, and in reply we have to confirm our wire of this day, as follows:'' Crashing batteries can be made in this State equal to imported; Western Australian batteries cost considerably more and crush 20 per cent, more stone ; but their quartz is much softer than ours. This mainly accounts for difference."" From this you will understand that we desire to state that all the engineers and ironfounders who make mining machinery as a speciality can make crusliingbatteriesequalin every detail to the imported ones, and we ourselves have done a large export trade to Western Australia, and other parts of the Commonwealth, and have sent batteries to Singapore. We also know that other firms have done the same. With regard to the crushing capacities of the imported battery, compared with what is at present in use on the Bendigo and Ballarat fields, we desire to state that the imported ones are capable of crushing 25 per cent, more stone in Western Australia than what we can do, but it must be borne in mind that the quartz in those parts is not so hard or so difficult to crush as it With the batteries as constructed now, with all modern improvements of the local manufacturers, the average quantity of ore per stamp per 24 hours is slightly over three tons, and all the portod ones in Western Australia crush close on four tons. With regard to the assertion, that the imported batteries will crush five times as much, this is absolutely absurd and incorrect. There is also another point which must not be disregarded, and that is, taking the batteries in Western Australia as a whole, they have been erected in the last four or five years, and have everything modern and up-to-date in every detail, whereas the majority of batteries working in this State were built and erected some 25 or 30 years ago, when this class of machinery had not attained such a high standard, but nevertheless we desire to state that we could manufacture a battery to treat the same quantity of ore for 24 hours-as good and equal in every way to bheimported, and at a cheaper cost, as the Western Australian ones cost considerably more than those manufactured in this State. Now there is a challenge to the whole of Australia.",35
213,Mr THOMAS,IS I I,They do not need any protection for their machinery.,36
214,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"No , ""apparently they do not, because they say they can make the same article more cheaply than it can be imported. I would remind the honourable member, however, that the present efficiency of this firm is the result of many years of protection. When the iron foundries of Bendigo, and other parts of Victoria, were started a number of years ago, the protection they first received was limited, but it was afterwards increased. I remember the outcry that was raised in some quarters against that protection, on the ground that it would be a burden upon the mining industry. It might have been a temporary burden on the mining industry, but the result is this triumphant assertion that the ironfounders of Victoria are able to compete with the whole world. That is the result of the protection they have received in the past, and of the accumulated experience they have gained on the gold-fields, where the)' have had special opportunities, no doubt. But what becomes of the complaints received from Western Australia? What becomes of Mr Morgans' letter, and the assertion of the honourable member for West Sydney, that Victorian mining machinery is inferior to the imported article ? We have the authoritative evidence of a substantial firm, which, no doubt could be supported by testimony from the Phcenix foundry at Ballarat, from Thomson's founis here. dry at Castlemaine, and from Martin's foundry in South Australia. All these would no doubt be able to say that the im- assertions in Mr Morgans' letter, and also the honourable member's statements are nob true. Therefore, the apprehensions of gentlemen in Western Australia, that the duby on mining machinery will crush or injure the indusbry, are groundless.",36
215,Mr FOWLER,IS I I,Then they do nob know bheir own business ?,36
216,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,Apparentl y not.,36
217,Mr THOMAS,IS I I,Where is the necessity for the duby ?,36
218,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"The duby is necessary no doubt in order to sbeady the market, and prevent if from being disturbed by shipments from other countries. The revenue will not be very large. This mining machinery can be procured in various parts of Australia as cheaply as ib could be imported, and it will do as. effective work. Therefore, there will be no necessity for the mining companies of Western Australia to talk about reducing wages. It is suggested in Mr Morgans' letter that, on account of this increased duty on mining machinery, the miners' wages may have to be reduced, and I would ask the miners to note that this is stated in the face of the fact that mining machinery can be obtained within the limits of the Commonwealth as cheaply as it can be imported. What then becomes of Mi . Morgans' suggestion about the wages ? Of course there may be a certain explanation. I am told .that some of the mining companies of Western Australia have their head offices in .the old country. Their highly paid mining - directors, their secretaries, and the bulk of their shareholders are located there, and those managing bodies may feel a little interested in giving the orders for their mining machinery to firms in the old country. I am informed that they have given a preference to the English as against the Australian - article. The old prejudice which existed for many years against colonial wines and beer exists to some extent against machinery. No doubt in time it will wear off, and we shall feel a community of interest and a common pride in patronising and supporting our local industries. I have examined the Tariff very carefully, to discover how it imposes the burdens which .some allege that it imposes upon the mining industry. It has been suggested that, .in its incidence, this Tariff"" will tell heavily - against that industry, and, as a matter of fact, the motion under discussion alleges that it will do so. So far as I am able to gather, there are only three or four trivial imports upon which taxes are imposed by this Tariff which will exclusively affect the mining industry. No doubt that industry - lik e every other-wil l be indirectly affected by the general scheme of taxation ; but it - is hardly fair to allege that every duty upon every article is a direct burden upon that particular industry. I have seen it suggested, for instance, that the tax on matches is a burden upon the mining industry. It may be a burden upon the community generally, but it is not a burden on the mining industry in particular.",36
219,Mr BARTON,IS I I,The honourable and learned member must not forget the poor swagman's milk.,37
220,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"It is a wonder that honourable members opposite have not dragged in the poor swagman. I notice two or three items in the Tariff which, it may be contended, affect the mining industry. It has been pointed out that the duty upon candles in Victoria has been increased by a halfpenn}' per lb.. Formerly the duty was I d . per lb. It is now proposed to increase it to 1^-d. per lb. By the way, the duty upon candles in Western Australia, whence the wail comes about the contemplated ruin of the mining industry, 1 was formerly 2d. per pound. Therefore, Mr Morgans again lacks support. No doubt the increased duty upon candles is a matter for consideration and inquiry. I should certainly like the Minister for Trade and Customs, when we get into committee, to give some information regarding this item, and to tell honourable members why the Victorian duty has been increased, and whether the course taken has been adopted for revenue purposes or for protective purposes. The Victorian Parliament thought that I d . per lb. was sufficient protection for candles, and I am not aware of any altered circumstances that justify the proposed increase. However, I am quite prepared to hear what the Minister has to offer in explanation of that increase. But whether the duty upon candles is I d . or Ad. per lb., the burden will not be very heavy, because I find that the imports of candles into ""Victoria last year were not very considerable. Most of the candles used are locally produced, and consequently the duty collected upon them in Victoria for the year 1900 was the magnificent sum of £1,168 1 2s. That is not a very large amount. At the same time,'! admit that this proposed increase of duty should be inquired into. No doubt the Minister will be able to gi ve some explanation of it later on. Another item of taxation which is said to oppress the mining industry is the duty upon rails which are used for mining tramway purposes. I have been informed that that will be a tax upon mining to some extent. A duty of 15 per cent, has been imposed upon these rails, which, in most of the States, were formerly exempt from taxation. I think that the advisability of retaining this tax is open to argument. It is questionable whether the revenue to be derived from such a source would be sufficient to justify the imposition of the tax. I am not aware of any other items in connection with the Tariff which will press on the mining industry to any material extent. i ",37
221,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"I am told that the mines of Victoria can be supplied from within the Commonwealth with all the timber which they require. No timber will have to be imported into Victoria for mining purposes, and the same remark is applicable to Western Australia. It is said that ib is necessary to import Oregon into Broken Hill for the protection of the mines bhere; bub, probably, experiment and an honest trial of Australian timbers will lead to the discovery that they are quite as capable of protecting the mines in question as are the imported timbers of Canada. On that point, however, I shall suspend judgment until I am in receipt of further information. I repeat that the tax upon timber will not in any way affect the Victorian mines, and the Minister for Defence declares that it will nob affect the mines in Western Australia. A greab deal has been heard in bhis House and in the press of the manner in which the Tariff will oppress the agriculbural indusbry. Ib has been made the subjecb of a special reference in the indictment which is now under consideration. The proposal to reenact the Victorian law by imposing a duty of 15 per cent, on agricultural and horticultural implements, ib is said, means a bremendous pressure of taxation upon the farmer. I think that there is a sufficienb number of farming represenbatives in bhis House to vindicate and protect the interests of farmers. The farmers of Victoria are as much-if not more-intereste d in this matber bhan are the farmers of any obher parb of Australia, because there are more of them. Hitherto the Vicborian import duby on agricultural implements has been 15 per cenb., that duby being imposed partly for protective and partly for revenue purposes. I bhink I can safely say that, so far as the protective incidence of the duty is concerned, its result has been to create a large number of local factories in which agricultural implements are produced. As the outcome of that duty, a very large quantity, in fact, the bulk of the agricultural implements used in bliis State are, I believe, produced in Victoria. It is brue that a quantity of agricultural implements have been imported into Victoria from beyond the Commonwealbh, and particularly from the United Stabes of America. During the lasb bwelve months, however, the imports have been comparatively limited in comparison with the number made and used here. I have obtained a return from the Customs department which shows that on the 15 per cent, basis the amounb of duby collected lasb year upon agriculbural implements imported into Victoria was only £9,206. There are 40,160 agricultural holdings in Victoria, and bhis sura of £9,206, spread over bhose holdings, represenbs aboub 4s. 6d. per holding. That is the bremendous burden which has bo be borne by the Victorian farmers as the result of this duty on agriculbural implements. We are asked to believe thab that 4s. 6d. per head has consbibuted a bax under which Victorian farmers have been groaning for many years pasb. So far as the burden of taxation is concerned, ibs amounb is absolutely insignificant when spread over all these holdings. Pour shillings and sixpence represents the tax which the Victorian farmer has had to bear under the State Tariff, and it is the same trifling tax which he is asked to bear under this Tariff. And what does he get for it 1 As the result of this protective duty new factories have sprung np, and the agricultural implement makers of Victoria have been placed on their metble. They have invented several very useful and valuable agricultural implements, of which the farmer has received the benefit. I should like to draw attention to the prices paid for some imported agricultural implements.  ments to which the honourable and learned member refers are not used on every holding.",38
222,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"I refer only to agricultural holdings, not to squattages, and the information I have given in respect to those holdings I obtained yesterday from the Victorian statist. I secured yesberday from a leading Victorian firm information as to the prices ruling for some of the imported agricultural implements, in order that I - night be able to draw a comparison between them and the prices paid for the local articles. I was informed that in 1900 the price of reapers and binders in Vicboria was £ 5 0 each, and £ 5 2 10s. in New South Wales, albhough they came in free in bobh Sbabes. I should like honourable members from New Soubh Wales to explain that anomaly. The sum of £ 2 10s. was the exbra price charged by the New South Wales importers. This year the charge for imported reapers and binders in Victoria is £ 3 5 , while in New South Wales the charge is £ 4 7 , although they still come in free in both States. Those are the prices current at the present time.",38
223,Mr BARTON,IS I I,The price in New South Wales represents a revenue duty in the wrong pocket.  the same machine ?,39
224,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,To substantially the same machine.,39
225,Mr EWING,IS I I,Absolutel y the same machine.,39
226,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"The merchant would not have given me these prices-if they had related to different machines. If the honourable member can obtain information to contradict my statement, let him do so.",39
227,Mr SALMON,IS I I,The Massey-Harris reaper and binder is still cheaper in Victoria than in New South Wales.,39
228,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"A desperate effort is being made to capture the agriculturalists on this occasion, and I think it necessary to give some attention to this matter. The prices for other imported machinery are as follow:-Mowers , to cut hay, £ 1 8 ; hay-rakes, horse, £ 1 0 ; seed drills, grain and fertilizer drills, £ 3 2 : ploughs, from £2. to £ 3 0 ; wind-mills, £ 2 5 ; chaff cutters, small, from £ 3 to £ 2 5 ; cultivators, spring tooth for tilling, £ 1 8 ; harrows, £ 2 to £ 7 ; disc harrows, £ 6 to £ 1 8 ; thrashers, from £300. That is a list of agricultural implements, which for the most part are imported. Now, I shall give a list of agricultural implements which are generally made in Victoria, and their prices. The list is as follows :-Strip pers, £ 4 0 ; winnowers, £ 2 7 10s; combined harvesters) £ 8 0 . These, I am told, are three classes of agricultural implements which have been specially developed- I will not say absolutely invented-butdevelopedandma.d e in Victoria, as the result of the inventive and improving faculty at work in the various agricultural implement manufactories. They are all of Australian production ; none of them have been imported. They have been made here as the result of our local conditions. are local productions pure and simple, and it cannot possibly be said that the duty has in any way affected their prices, because there are no imports whatever. In Victoria ploughs have been made a class of themselves. Two-furrow ploughs cost £.18, 3-furrows £ 2 5 , and 4-furrows £ 3 2 . I am told that the imported article does not in any way come into serious competition with these Victorian ploughs. Disc harrows, at least 70 per cent, of which are made locally, sell at prices ranging from £ 5 to £ 35 according to the number of discs employed. The next item is that of seed and fertiliser drills, which are made here to a small extent. The prices of harrows, spiked-tooth, range from £ 3 to £12. I am told that 50 per cent, of these harrows are made locally. Another agricultural appliance which is locally made is the travelling chaff-cutter, at a price of £ 1 0 0 to £ 1 4 0 . Portable engines, of which about 10 per cent, are locally made, are sold at £ 3 4 5 and upwards ; and horse-gear machines, 50 per cent, of which are locally made, are sold at from £ 1 0 to £ 3 0 each. With reference to the list which I have just read, I wish it to be distinctly understood, in order that there may he no misapprehension, that the same prices are charged in New South Wales as in Victoria, notwithstanding the fact that there is a 15 per cent, dutj ' in the latter State, as against free importation in the former. I am told that that is an absolute fact beyond contradiction.",39
229,Mr KENNEDY,IS I I,It cannot be challenged.,39
230,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"It cannot be challenged; and the gentleman who gave me the information assured me, in reply to a question, that the statement. I have just made can be sustained on oath. The information I have given came from a reliable and responsible source, which I have no reason to doubt; and as an example, my informant quoted 10-feet wind-mills, which are sold at the same price in each State, namely £ 2 5 . The reason is that the competition in Victoria, caused by the local factories, which are stimulated by a Tariff preference, has had the effect of causing the price to be kept down, whereas in New South Wales the merchant and the importer have had the benefit of enormous charges. Yet we are asked to say that the particular duty which it is proposed to continue, will have a crushing, demoralizing, and They injurious effect on the farmer. But the figures I have given are sufficiently eloquent in themselves to show that the result predicted will not be in any way realized, and that the indictment of this Tariff, foundedon the expected oppression of the farmer, ought to be dismissed by this House. It is a mere sham cry- a mere party cry got up for the purpose of "" gulli n g "" the farmer. But I believe farmers are sufficiently sharp and intelligent to know the effect of the inclusion of this general allegation in the notice of motion. The farmers of Victoria have spoken with no uncertain sound on the fiscal question, both at the federal elections and at the previous State elections.",39
231,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,IS I I,"Why does not the honourable and learned member propose to double the tax, so that the farmers may thank him mora ?",40
232,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"The farmers and tlieir representatives in this House know what they are about. In the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Moira we have two practical representatives, who are thoroughly conversant with the interests of the farmers, and quite capable of defending them, and the information I have given is merely to supplement that already laid before the House by those honourable members. The attempt to capture the farmers will not come off. The time is not far distant when those who speak about, and pretend to be friends of, the farmer will probably have an opportunity of showing in a practical manner in this House whether they will assist him. Not long ago there was a motion before the House for the establishment of a National Department of Agriculture, for the protection and assistance of the farmer. Where was the enthusiasm with reference to that propositi 1 It was quite true that the honourable member for Macquarie supported it very earnestly and enthusiastically - but there was opposition from the Opposition corner.",40
233,Mr FOWLER,IS I I,"The honourable and learned member is a little "" previous."" We have not had a chance of speaking on that motion yet, and he is doing his cause no good by his present attitude.",40
234,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,I know that on a recent occasion hostile remarks were made from a certain part of the House.,40
235,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,IS I I,Whic h,40
236,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"Fro m the opposition corner, on the last occasion of the debate. Although the farmer may be called to give 4s. 6d. or 5s. a year, under this taxation, what is that in comparison, with the manner in which this Federal Parliament may assist him practically and directly ? The only proposition the Opposition have put forward as a body is to take off the small duty of 4s. 6d. per holding. There are plenty of methods in which the House can at no distant date promote the interests of the farmer. If there has been any decay in farming hi Victoria and Australia, as indicated by an extract from the Age, read, I think, by the leader of the Opposition the other day, I venture to say it has not been on account of any small duties which have been referred to. Those duties would not be sufficient to cause the decadence of agriculture as an art or as a science. There are other causes at work which will account for the extract read by the right honourable member.",40
237,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,"Can the honourable and learned member show anything in this taxation of £9,000,000 to assist the farmer in the direction indicated ?",40
238,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"The farmer knows that although he may have to pay a small duty in reference to these protected manufactures, wherever factories are established and allowed to exist large clusters of population grow up and are maintained. Centres of population are created ; it may be, coastal cities like Melbourne and Sydney, or inland cities like Ballarat and Bendigo. The farmer knows that these industries attract round them groups of population and consumers of agricultural produce. Where would the farmer, orchardist, or fruit-grower be if there were no local consumers and local markets providing outlets for agricultural produce? Is this country to be converted into a heep-walk or a mere agricultural domain 1 Is that what is intended? What would be the position of the farmer if it were not for the great centres of population, where ready markets are found ? I would like honourable members who have been so strongly advocating the free-trade cause to point out to the farmer what would have been his position if there had been no cities and towns where he could find a market. In addition, it is well part? known that where manufactories are established,, skilled workmen grow up in connection with them. The inventive faculties are developed and encouraged, and farmers and other's who requiremechanieal appliances have the benefit of that development. New inventions are continually being brought forward where there are manufactories, and of these inventions the producer of the raw material reaps the benefit, and has the further ad vantage of local workshops, where machinery worn out or disabled may be repaired. Are we to have no repairing shops or no manufactories which full scope can be given to the inventive faculties? The farmer knows the advantage of these establishments, and that is the reason protection has to some extent been supported by farmers in and why farming constituencies sent so many members to this House to represent and vindicate their There are other causes of the backward state of agriculture, independent of the possibility of any connection with the fiscal question. It is well known that one of the causes of the agricultural industry being so backward at the present time is that there has been over-production. wanted is the discovery of fresh and improved methods of cultivation. Either the Eederal or the State Government take action for the purpose of improving the education of those who are planted on the soil, and giving them the opportunity of obtaining better, more enduring, and substantial results. Another way in which the farming industry can be promoted, is by providing new markets for the produce of agriculturists. Agriculture is developed in this country, and in various parts of Australia, to such an extent that production has, to a great extent, exceeded the local powers of consumption, and what is wanted is Government action to provide for the expansion of our foreign markets. farmer cannot be expected to go afield and look after markets in foreign Therefore it is the duty of the Government to endeavour to provide markets, and to do what is done by other countries-provide facilities for the transport of his produce. What do other countries do ? Germany has recently decided to grant enormous subsidies to steamers for the carriage of German produce all over the world. Look at the vast steamers that we see periodically invading Australian waters. The Grosser and some of the finest steamers in the world have been built to be emissaries of the German nation. They are subsidized to the extent of thousands of pounds. In the same way, the French Government, by laws recently passed, has granted enormous subsidies for the promotion of trade and commerce, and the portation of French produce. of from £3,000 to £4,000 per annum is Sir John Quick. granted to every one of those big French steamers in the way of subsidy. That is an enormous assistance to French industry and in manufactures. It is the same with Italy. I saw in a recent issue of the Board of Trade Journal, that the Government of Italy had decided to follow the example of other countries in the construction of steamers, Victoria, and in granting them big bonuses for every have voyage made-bonuse s quite as substantial as those granted by the German and French principles. Governments. That is the way these countries are promoting agriculture. It seems to me that the Federal Government can, by a system of bonuses and bounties, for which provision is made in the Constitution, render substantial aid to the agricultural industry, which is the backbone of AusWhat is tralia. I could go on with this subject, but I think it is not necessary to elaborate upon that branch of the question should any further, because I do not wish to take up too much time, notwithstanding the importance of it. I come now to the third paragraph of the first clause of the motion of the leader of the Opposition ; I allude to paragraph (c). I invite the attention of honourable members to this paragraph. On the face of it , it does not appear to contain any direct .allegation in favour of free-trade. Certainly the right honourable member who framed it deserves great credit for the skilful manner in which he has almost concealed the free trade current of that paragraph. I say The "" almost concealed,"" but not quite. The light honourable member and those assocountries. ciated with him knew that they could not come down to this House and table a reso lution in favour of absolute free-trade. They could not with any show of conscience or any show of legality or constitutionality suggest a policy of absolute free-trade-o r of general free-trade if honourable members prefer that term.  Kuifurst Sir JOHN QUICK - I leave the honourable member to define it . It is well known what is meant by general free-trade. I direct his attention to the definition of the Constitution, which says thatOn the imposition of the uniform Tariff trade commerce and intercourse among the States French . . . . Shall be absolutely free. trans- We know what that means, and we know A sum what absolute free-trade means according to the Constitution. It is well known, however, that general free-trade would be impossible for Australia. I fiud thab the leader of the Opposition, in a speech delivered in the Legislative Assembly of New Soubh Wales, on the 21st February, 1889, saidWe nil know that whatever Government is in power there must be a high Customs Tariff. I frankly admit that if I stood up before the House and said anything else, I should simply be speaking against my own knowledge. I admit it aud give it for what it is worth, that there must be a high Customs Tariff under federation, and that is one of the sacrifices that some of us are prepared to make for federation.",40
239,Mr THOMSON,IS I I,He did not say a Tariff as high as this.,42
240,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"Then , at Launcesduties ton, on the 11th January, 1901, the righb honourable member saidHe must tell them, however, that he was pledged to a free-trade Tariff. Any Tariff adopted for the Commonwealth must be a revenue-earning Tariff. Ab Hobart on 13th January, 1901, the same righb honourable member saidAs I recently said in New South Wales, cannot expect to have a free Tariff in face of the requirements of the States. I said in New Wales "" if you want to continue the Tariff operation you had better vote against me cause such a Tariff is not possible."" Therefore, do not wish to push my free-trade opinions further than this-whateve r your Tariff is, be a revenue Tariff. What, then, is all the outcry? After all, bhen, it is nob a question so much of ciple as ib is a question as bo whab ibems taxation should be raised from. We expect free-trade, and what, then, is the industries. use of all the argumenbs which have been paraded here?

241,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"I did nob. I was obloquy and contempt. drawing attention to the adroit manner which bhis motion was framed. The righb honourable gentleman confesses thab he could nob bable a motion in favour of free-brade, he tabled a motion which indirectly attacks the proposals of the Government, because industries 44,541 males, and they would make "" imposts for national purposes a source of undue profit to individuals, and a few favoured indusbries, ab the expense of the whole community."" There is no allegation there in favour of free-trade, yet the whole of the right honourable gentleman's arguments, ancl the whole burden of the argumenbs of the Opposition, have been based upon a policy of free-trade, and not upon a revenue Tariff. If they wish to argue only in favour of a revenue Tariff, why did they not submit proposals in the direction of a revenue Tariff ? MR . POYNTON - The honourable member for North Sydney did so.",42
242,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"The whole of the criticisims have been directed against certain duties, because it is alleged that those will result in undue profit to a few individuals and to a few favoured industries. Let us examine the nature of that allegation. not Ib is rather to be regretted that the right honourable the leader of the Opposition has seen f it to deal with Victorian industries, Victorian assebs, and Victorian vested interests in the somewhat reckless ancl flippant manner in which he has dealt Ave with bhem. Whab good, I ask, is bo be South gained by referring bo Victorian industries now in as ""shivering mendicanbs"" ancl ""a few befavoured industries "" ?

243,Mr THOMSON,IS I I,There has been no concannot sideration given to New South Wales,42
244,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"Thes e industries are the assebs of the whole of Australia, ancl ib is the assets of the federal union bhat are the being denounced as a few mendicants and a of few favoured petby indusbries. Numerous indusbries have sprung up in Vicboria under the fosbering care of probection in times pasb, and a sbabesman of broad Australian views should be prepared to regard these industries and rights with, at any rate, a nob certain amount of generous and respectful consideration, instead of holding them up to There are at in present upwards of 127 separate and distinct industries, represented in 2,645 different esbablishmenbs in Vicboria. These but are the "" mendicants "" referred to. At the present time there are employed in bhese 18,415 females; the total number"" of pera few sons employed in these mendicant industries being 62,956. That is the number of persons dependent for a livelihood on these industries which have been so lightly spoken of. The value of the machinery and plant invested in them is £3,531,689, the value of the land used is £2,654,722, and the value of the buildings and improvements is £2,914,851, making the total value represented by these industries which have been so much denounced is £9,101,262. The value of the work done in these various factories is estimated as follows :-In 1881 the estimate was £5,461,000, in 1S91 it was £10,694,000, in 1899 the estimate was £15,000,000. These are property rights in Victoria that our friends on the other side of the House now wish to see practically confiscated, because that is what their contention amounts to. I tell my honourable friends opposite that such a view as that is regarded in Victoria with the greatest amount of disfavour and the greatest amount of indignation. Even free-traders in Victoria condemn what has been said. Mr Robert Reid says that free-trader as he is, he will be no party to the destruction or confiscation of Victorian industries that have grown up under the protection and encouragement of Victorian law.",42
245,Mr THOMSON,IS I I,"Quite right, too.",43
246,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,Ye t the honourable member advocates a free-trade policy which would have the effect of closing up a large number of these factories. Mr E. E. MCLEAN - Nine-tenth s of those industries woxild be there if you had no Tariff.,43
247,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,As a proof of that I will draw attention now to this fact. This Tariff contains a large number of reduced duties.,43
248,Mr THOMSON,IS I I,And a larger number of increases.,43
249,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"No ; I think the reductions are in excess of the increases, and I have prepared a list of them. Honourable members, who no doubt read the papers, and see the evidence of what is going on around them in this great city, will have noticed that various agitations have already started up against the proposed reductions. In many cases already appeals are made to us by persons interested in these protected industries, who say that if these reductions are carried tlieir industries will be ruined.",43
250,Mr VL SOLOMON,IS I I,"There was the same cry 30 years ago, when they asked for protection.",43
251,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"I find that there have been reductions made in the following substantial items :-In the case of mantles and cloaks, articles of apparel containing silk, and velvet plush, there has been a reduction of from 3-5 to 25 per cent.; there have been reductions on felt hats, low-class hats, umbrellas, and dress hats. ",43
252,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"They get reductions on these items, and yet honourable members opposite laugh. Woollen materials have been reduced, horse-shoe nails have been reduced, barbed wire has been reduced to 20 per cent, from £ 3 per ton, bolts and nuts have been reduced from 30 to 20 per cent., boots and shoes have been reduced in the case of the cheaper articles, the duty on hops has been reduced by 2d. per lb., the duty on casks has been reduced from 35 to 20 per cent. Isinglass, on which there was a duty of 20 per cent., has been placed on the free list. The duty on doors has been reduced from 10s. and 5s. to 7s. and 3s. 6d. The duty on wire nails has been reduced. Leather-dressing machinery is now. free, and a proprietor of leather-dressing plant is complaining about being ruined. Leather belting has been reduced from 35 per cent, to 20 per cent.",43
253,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,IS I I,And a duty put upon the raw material.,43
254,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"On hosiery, there has been a reduction from 35 per cent, to 25 per cent., with 15 per cent, on yarn. Glass has been reduced from 30 to 20 per cent., and soda crystals from 2s. to Is. per cwt. The duties on a large number of other items have been reduced in connection with protected industries. The Government have done much in making reductions in various directions, but I am not prepared at the present time to say that they have made these reductions in ' the right direction. Undue reductions are complained against. I do not say that the Government are wrong in making these proposals, because I am not sufficiently conversant with them at present; but I invite attention to the fact that this so-called protectionist Tariff, which is howled down by free-traders thoughout Australia, contains a large number of substantial reductions in protected industries.",43
255,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,Giv e us a few reductions on articles of food ? ',43
256,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"The Government have shown a considerable amount of courage in what they have done, but instead of getting the smallest grain of credit they have been denounced right and left ; no consideration has been given to them for the courage they have shown in endeavouring to make reductions.",44
257,Mr THOMSON,IS I I,Courag e in interfering with the Victorian Tariff?,44
258,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"My honourable friends are not satisfied with substantial reductions, but want the Government to launch into a crusade of reduction which will practically annihilate the bulk of the Victorian industries. They are not satisfied with this instalment, so to speak. I admit that the time may come when some of these industries may become like the manufacture of mining machinery, which has been established on such a substantial basis that it can now fight against the world Mr TriOiMSON - Stil l they keep the duties on.",44
259,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"I would not care if the duties on mining macninery were taken off tomorrow. They do not do the foundries any good; they do not do them any harm. The only thing which may be said in their favour is that they help to steady the market, to prevent Australia being swamped, periodically, by cargoes of machinery. The duties cannot have any effect on existing prices. Free-traders are altogether too exacting. They are not content with remissions by gradation from time to time; they want to sweep away the duties on protected articles right off the reel. I submit that is not reasonable, and that they must be coir tent to go on step by step, to allow these industries to have a fair trial under the new conditions.",44
260,Mr VL SOLOMON,IS I I,Anothe r 30 or 40 years.,44
261,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"I admit that under ensues the new conditions, with the Australian markets open to them, a large number of the industries now protected ought, in a reasononly able time, to be able to stand further reducis tions. I wish to say a few words i favour of the principle of protection. I do not think honourable members should be satisfied to come down and indulge in platitudes, without putting ward some concrete arguments in favour the principle for which they contend. Revenue duties, no doubt, tend to increase the price of the commodities. But as a general rule I think protective duties, when they are sufficient to promote local production, invariably cheapen the cost of goods. That has been the experience of Victoria, and it has been the experience in most countries where protection has been tried.",44
262,Mr SPENCE,IS I I,What do they want a Tariff for then 1,44
263,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,To cheapen the cost of production.,44
264,Mr HUME COOK,IS I I,To break down the importing rings.,44
265,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"I intend to present a piece of evidence in support of that proposition. It is not merely the opinion of what are called rabid protectionists-it is not even the opinion of the Age. I invite the attention of honourable members to an extract from the British Board of Trade Journal of 25th April, 1901. This is an up-to-date publication; it is not ancient history. There is a surprising freshness and force in the extract which is taken from a report to the Foreign-office by His Majesty's consul at La Rochelle, in France. Referring to the gradual decline of British imports into France, and pointing out how these imports are gradually being elbowed out by protective duties, the consul says:This is the prevalent feature in nearly all cases where British goods are still sold. The existing duties are too high to allow them to compete with French goods, when once a native firm finds it worthwhile to lay down machinery and make any particular article in the country. Unless this occurs, the English do = business in it ; but as soon as native manufacturing begins, the French can under-sell them from the first, owing to the Tariff', and make good profits. After that, it frequently happens that competition sets in within the country itself, and briugs prices as low as they would have been if no Tariff barrier existed, because when once a maker has laid down machinery with the object of taking advantage of the protective duties, and is seen to be making money, others rush into share in it, and then over-production - with the inevitable reduction in prices. There is the protectionist whole argument boiled down into a short extract. It is not an argument, but a demonstration. It particularly powerful, and ought to be very n influential, considering the quarter whence it comes. It does not come from any professional advocate of protection or any protectionist organ. It comes from the British forconsul at an important town in France, of who has noticed a decline of British trade on account of protective duties, and he affirms there that, wherever protective duties are put on, the result is that local native manufactures spring up, aud the competition amongst local manufacturers results in the price being reduced, even below that of the imported article. There is one of the strongest arguments in favour of protection which I have come across for many years. It is up-to-date and confirms my previous opinion in that direction. I think it ought to strengthen and give fresh courage to protectionist members of the House, seeing that our views are supported, uot merely by theory but by actual experience, and the observations of influential men in the employment of the British Government in various parts of the world. The experience of Erance, Germany and America in. the direction of protection shows that free trade as a fiscal creed is on the down grade. The only countries in the world, that I know of, where free-trade is popular are the United Kingdom and New South Wales. All the civilized countries in the world within the last few years, been moving consciously, intelligently, and systematically in the direction of national protection for their national industries. They have, one might sav, formed a world-wide coalition against England, and are endeavouring to cut into British commercial supremacy. The result has been that British commerce has been seriously invaded, and these countries are still pursuing their protectionist principles and their determination to have a share of the world's markets.",44
266,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,At the expense of those it is stated : who live at home.,45
267,Sir JOHN QUICK,IS I I,"In the September sion number of the Bocmd of Trade Jowrnal I Pornological notice two extracts winch show the drif t of events in foreign countries, and give us very latest examples of the national movepackage ment in the direction of protection. The sold first extract refers to Austria-Hungary. The United States Consul at Rotterdam is, calls the attention of his Government to the charges. inducements which are now being held out by the Government of Hungary for the encouragement of the establishment of local industries in that country. This informaGovernment tion is taken from an official and not an inspired source, and as such will, no doubt, have great weight with the House. The report in the Board of Trade Jowrnal statesIt appears that the Hungarian Government anxious to interest capitalists in establishing manufactories of various kinds, and will grant valuable concessions to investors in order to promote a revival of the industries and the prosperity of the business world of Hungary. Among the enterprises for which the Government will grant subsidies are stated to be a barrel factory, an asbestos factory, an establishment for the manufacture of articles of lead, zinc, and tin by electricity, a silk factory, a cotton-spinning and weaving factory, a woollen yarn mill, and an agricultural machinery factory. The paper quoted also states that the Hungarian Government is planning to expend a considerable amount of money in the irrigation of various parts of the country, and that capitalists and manufacturers will find it to their advantage to pay attention to the present industrial and agricultural condition of affairs in Hungary. That shows that free-trade is not very popular with the Hungarian Government, and that they are determined to utilize the full power and strength of the national Government for the promotion and encouragement of national industry. This may be accepted as another piece of evihave, dence showing the drif t ofevents throughout the civilized world in favor of protection. In the same volume of the Board of Trade Journal I find another extract at page 530, which gives evidence of further determined efforts on the part of the Government of the United States to promote their local industries, not merely by the imposition of protective duties at their ports, but also by direct assistance in the shape of bonuses and bounties. In a despatch dated .15th August last, received at the Foreign-office from the British Embassy at Washington, Under the appropriation made in the last sesof Congress to assist investigation by the Bureau, the Secretary of Agriculture is making an arrangement by which the Government enters into co-operation with dealers and the exporters whereby a minimum net return per is guaranteed on all fruit shipped and under the direction of the Pornological Department. Under this arrangement the exporter would receive the net proceeds of the sales, that all proceeds after deducting freight and other This may be said to be the action of a paternal Government, but it is the action of a that is determined to do its very best to find new outlets and new fields for the extension of American industry-of a Government that views sympathetically American industries, and is resolved to take them by the hand and promote and encourage them in every way possible. This is Government can, aud I hope will, in time to come, also take in hand' the matter of assisting the fruit-growers and agriculturists of Australia. I have noticed an undue hesitancy on the part of our newly formed Federal Government to favourably consider the question of assisting our agriculturists, and I invite them to seriously take the matter in. hand, and not regard it as one that may be left to the States. I contend that the Federal Government ought to grant direct assistance to the agriculturists and the fruit-growers. They have the power, and I feel quite sure, from the manifestations of sympathy that have been given in this Chamber, I hope that when they have fully developed their policy they will proceed with the establishment of a federal organization that will give direct assistance to these branches of industry, in the same way as is done in the United States. There are other matters which might be dwelt upon, but I do not wish to follow the example of others who have wearied the House with long speeches. I view these Tariff proposals generally with favour. The Government have had a very difficult task, indeed, to perform, and it is not a matter of surprise that little anomalies have crept in here and there. Probably it would have been better for the Minister of Trade and Customs to have constituted himself a Royal Commissioner for the purpose of taking evidence in the various States regarding the possibilities of an Australian Federal Tariff before he proceeded to frame this Tariff. He would then have had a free hand to make inquiries. I would point out, however, that if any mistakes have been made through haste or want of time ancl want of opportunity for the preparation of a scientific Federal Tariff, the result has been largely owing to the action of the Opposition, because it was the leader of the Opposition who first suggested that the Federal Tariff should be framed in the first session of this Parliament. On the launching of our Federal Constitution I never anticipated that the Tariff could be settled in the session, but the hands of the Government have been forced by the action of the leader of the Opposition. If the Ministry had had longer time and better opportunities for investigating the various details of the Tariff, they might have avoided some of the mistakes which have admittedly been made. It has been said with regard to the mistakes and anomalies that may exist in the Tariff, that every opportunity will be given for their free discussion. I shall do all I can 18 i to assist the Government to improve the Tariff, and make it a good, consistent, and workable one, which will lay a solid and enduring foundation for Australian commerce and Australian industry.",45
268,Mr CAMERON,IS I I," On previous occasions when I have had the pleasure of addressing this House I have invariably found that my opinions were at variance with those of a majority of honourable members. In this instance, however, I occupy a very different position. I find myself supported by a body of men whose sole desire is to secure the greatest good for the greatest number. They are opposed by honourable members who, it seems to me, entertain one wish only, and that is to confer good upon a certain class, altogether regardless of the claims of the rest of the community. As honourable members are aware, I was returned as a free-trade representative of the State of Tasmania. It may be news to some to learn that I am engaged in pastoral and farming pursuits. I was not elected, however, by the votes of the j>astoralists or farmers, but by those of the working classes of Tasmania. They elected me because I told them that I honestly believed in free-trade with - I was reluctantly compelled to add- a revenue Tariff. When the first federal referendum was taken in Tasmania, federation was carried almost entirely by the votes of the working men in the cities and the towns. If they had not believed that they were going to derive some substantial benefit from federation they would never had voted for it. But holding that they would never reap any benefit from Australian union, I opposed the movement from start to finish. When, however, federation became an accomplished fact, I had to bow to the inevitable, whether I liked it or not. In support of my statement that I was returned by the working people of Tasmania, I wish Federal to recall what was said a few weeks ago in first this House by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley. There can be no doubt that that honourable member was returned by a section of the Tasmanian workers. He asserted that I was elected by his surplus votes. As the votes which he received were cast entirely by the working classes, it follows-if his statement is to be credited-that I was returned by the working people of Tasmania. I wish to draw attention to a curious circumstance in connection with this matter. The honourable' member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, is a protectionist, and a very large number of people voted for liim. It seems to me that they were afflicted with the same madness that affected Queen Titania in A Midsummer Night's Dream. It will be remembered that when reason returned to Titania, and she perceived that she was in love with Bottom the weaver, in the guise of a frequently-mentioned quadruped, her affections returned to her former lover. So it was with the public of Tasmania. When they discovered the manner in which they had been deceived, their affections returned to the doctrine of free-trade. Upon no other hypothesis could they have voted for a protectionist first and a free-trader afterwards. I wish to impress upon honourable members that I am speaking, first of all as a free-trader, and secondly, as a man who is intimately acquainted with the farming industry in Tasmania. I trust, therefore, that honourable members will give due weight to what I have to say. Before going into the question of free-trade versus protection, I should like to call attention to certain statistics which the honourable member for Gippsland presented to us the other evening. I wish at once to acknowledge that I place no reliance upon statistics, even if they be in favour of the views which I advocate. I prefer to be guided by common sense. But if statistics must be quoted, I prefer to compare countries which are, as nearly as possible, equal in area and production. I notice that there is a great disposition on the part of honourable members opposite to compare England with America. To my mind, any such comparison is false and misleading. If we want a comparison that will carry weight, we ought to compare England with other countries of nearly the same area, the same population, and the same conditions. Then we should be able to decide under which fiscal policy countries make the most rapid progress.",46
269,Mr WATKINS,IS I I,"It is unfair to compare New South Wales with Victoria, then.",47
270,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,"Undoubtedly . I would never dream of doing such a thing. Indeed, I should never dream of instituting a comparison between countries from statistical stand-point unless they equal in area and every other respect. periods. But inasmuch as some honourable members upon the opposite side of the House done otherwise, I ask them in fairness compare the statistics which relate to countries that approximately resemble each other. In pursuance of that course, I intend to take the figures of Mulhall, and to Gompare free-trade England with protectionist Erance and Germany.",47
271,Mr MAUGER,IS I I,That is not fair.,47
272,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,"I think it is. If there is any argument in the honourable member's interjection, I say that the mere fact of having in a country a number of men who consume, but do not produce, is certainly an advantage to the producers of protectionist France and Germany. Taking the latest statistics, what do we find? I may say that England and France are comparatively speaking nearly alike both in area and population. England may have a slight advantage in the shape of her coal and mineral wealth, but France possesses almost an equal advantage in the fact that she has a very fertile soil, and is able to produce .wine and various other articles that are not produced inEngland. Wefindaccording to Mulhall that England's wealth at the present time amounts to £11,000,000,000 as against £8,500,000,000, which represents the wealth of France. Germany comes considerably lower in the scale, because her wealth is only £7,400,000,000. In round numbers the population of the United Kingdom consists of some 30,000,000; France has a population of 38,000,000, while Germany has a population of 48,000,000. In other words, when we take the respective size and population of these countries, we find that England under free-trade has progressed very much more rapidly than either of the other two countries has done. As regards the interjection made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that conscription is in force in Germany, if any argument is to be drawn from that in favour of protection, the fact remains that these men should afford a better market and increased wealth for the rest of the population, because they are consumers and not producers.",47
273,Mr A MCLEAN,IS I I,The honourable member is comparing the respective positions of a these countries at the present time. He were should compare them at two different,47
274,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,"Objectio n has been have taken to opinions expressed by some to honourable members upon returns covering a period of years, in view of the fact that some of the countries referred to were under free-trade but have turned to protection. I do not think that has the slightest relevancy, because the conditions have altered totally since 1840. I may pass briefly on to one other point, of which a great deal has been made. Honourable members who support protection have invariably compared England with the United States. I hold that comparison to be utterly false and misleading, because, in the first place, the United States of America have nearly double the population which England possesses. In addition to that fact the United States have an area of 3,580,242 square miles as against an area of 121,112 square miles possessed by the United Kingdom. When we remember also that America has a vast area of productive virgin soil, that she has immense gold mines, and that she is able to produce various things that mankind consume, which cannot be produced in the United Kingdom, while England possesses land which has been tilled for the last 1,500, 1,600, or 1,900 years, and that she has no gold mines, does it appear to be in accordance with the principles of fair play to make a comparison between the two countries ? But, notwithstanding the disparity between the area and the population of the two countries, we find that the wealth of America amounts to a little under £13,000,000,000 while England's wealth amounts to £11,000,000,000, so that l do not thinkEngland, despite its disadvantages, comes out badly in the comparison. With regard to the question of protection and free-trade, I am going to argue, in the oourse of a few minutes, that protection is not for the benefit of the farmers. I have some figures here, which honourable members should consider seriously, showing that in the State of Kansas, in America, 60 per centof the taxed acreage is under mortgage.",47
275,Mr A MCLEAN,IS I I,"Would the honourable member kindly read again his figures, showing the total wealth of the United States of America?",48
276,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,"The wealth of the United States of America is a little under £13,000,000,000.",48
277,Mr A MCLEAN,IS I I,"Mulhall's latest figures show that the wealth of the United is £16,350,000,000, and that the wealth of England is £11,806,000,000. 18 i z",48
278,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,I have got the figures here. The honourable member can have them for himself.,48
279,Mr A MCLEAN,IS I I,They are old statistics.,48
280,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,I have taken them from MkdAali.,48
281,Mr A MCLEAN,IS I I,But not from Mulhall'» latest work.,48
282,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,"There was one edition of Mulhall in the Library, but some protectionists seized it , so that the free-traders might not have any benefit from it. When I was interrupted I was pointing out that in protectionist America, in the State of Kansas, 60 per cent, of the.taxed acreageis under mortgage. In the State Of Iowa, 47 per cent, is under mortgage, in Nebraska 55 per cent., and in Missouri 25 per cent. One might readily imagine that, if protect tion was the wonderful benefit that some honourable members are trying to persuade the people to believe, these farms would not be mortgaged up to the hilt as they appear to be. I am going to deal with this protectionist Tariff from a farmer's point of view. Let me say here that during the last twenty years I have been engaged in farming pursuits. I admit freely that if this Tariff is passed, I , with a few other farmers, will derive an undoubted advantage at the present time. Thebenefit may continue for a long or a short period. Everything depends upon whether New Zealand comes into the Federation, o r whether an agreement is arrived at between the Commonwealth and New Zealand for a mutal interchange of products. If that agreement is arrived at then the protection which I and a few other farmers will receive under this Tariff, upon two or three items which I intend to enumerate, will fall to the ground. If reciprocity between the Commonwealth and New Zealand is established, those benefits must disappear.. Speaking as a free-trader, I am not prepared to advocate a protective policy, because I myself and a few others are going to benefit under it , when I consider that it will impose immense disadvantages upon the rest of the community. I shall be perfectly candid with honourable members, and point out two or three items under which farmers may benefit, particularly on the north-west coast of Tasmania. These items are potatoes and oats; but, if States New Zealand comes into the Federation, that benefit vanishes. New South Wales was the only free-trade market farmers had; and as Tasmanian oats better, or are supposed to be better, than the oats of Victoria, and have always shall brought 2d. per bushel more, there has been that advantage to Tasmania. Under this Tariff, which amounts to some 6d. per bushel, the people of South and the people of New South Wales will undoubtedly have to pay more for their oats, and will also have to pay a little more -£1 per ton-for potatoes. Only a few farmers on the we3t coast of Tasmania, and, perhaps, a good number of farmers Victoria, will derive any benefit from the duty on potatoes, while those who will suffer are the consumers in New South Wales, Queensland, and-after five yearsWestern Australia. In order to benefit few farmers-the rest of the farmers engaged in producing butter, wheat, and other articles, in larger quantities than they quire for themselves, are to be taxed. Speaking from a totally unselfish view I am going to oppose the protection proposed. We have been told that protection does not increase the cost to the consumer, and we have had the stabemenb repeated ad sbock 1 nauseam,, unbil .ab last I really think those who make the assertion it. I should saj>-, however, that common sense ought to show the utter of such a contention. Why are protective duties imposed, if not bo give the producer an advanbage over the consumer, for which advanbage the consumer must pay ? A few nights ago the Minister for Trade and Cusbhe boms, amidsb the cheers of Governmenb supporters, said that reapers and binders, which were admitbed free, cost in America £20, and afber £5 had been paid for carso riage, were sold in Sydney for £50. was a perfect howl at that statement j even ab the worse, whab does ib amounb Simply that the foreign trader was doing the best he could for himself by charging the highest price he could possibly get; afber all, I do nob know that love is'expecbed to be inbroduced in matters of dealing. assertion was made that the foreign trader was acting unfairly, and I do not think exception can be taken to his conduct, even if the stabemenb of the Minisber were correcb. My conbenbion, however, is that the stateib ment is not quite correct. But what do the probecbionisbs do 1 They do producbs inbo a foreign counbry and try bo make a large illegitimate profit out of the Mr Cameron. which unhappy buyer bhere; they prefer bo stop at are home and rob their brothers. I never make an assertion thab I cannob prove, and I prove the assertion I am aboub to make. We were told this afternoon that various articles were sold in protectionisb Vicboria ab the same prices as in free-trade New Soubh Australia Wales, and that the farmer paid no more under probection than under free-trade. But whab are the actual facts ? I could take more than one article, but I think one will be sufficient to satisfy, if not members on the Government side of the House, ab in least members on the Opposition side. Two factories in Victoria make binder twine, which is somewhat extensively used by the farmer ; and last summer this commodity was sold throughout Victoria at 7d. per a lb. But the same quality of Victorian twine was sent over to Tasmania, and, although there had to be added freight and other recharges, was sold there ab 5d. per lb.",48
283,Mr MCCOLL,IS I I,Where are the honourable member's proofs ?,49
284,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,I boughb the bwine.,49
285,Mr MAUGER,IS I I,Was it an insolvent,49
286,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,"I do nob doubb for a believe moment that a certain class in Victoria will become insolvent if the protectionisb absurdity policy is continued, and the insolvents will not be the manufacburers bub the unhappy farmers. I am speaking of bhis Tariff as an Ausbralian farmer as well as a Tasmanian farmer, because we are all one now so far as Tariff is concerned; and I objecb mosb sbrongly to these protective proposals. Leb us consider anobher question. The whole of the probecbionisbs' argumenbs used have, far, been in favour of manufacturers. There Until bhis afternoon, when the honourable but and learned member for Bendigo balked on bo ? a subjecb of which he knows nothing-bh e requirements of farmers-nothin g had been said on behalf of the farming industry. I and, am quibe willing bo admit that if a large number of manufactories are established, No the men employed in these factories must be consumers. If we could restrict proany duction and only produce as much as is required by the whole communiby, I admit that we should all be in the same boab, and mighb be bo our benefib bo have a probec-, tive Tariff. In obher words if you rob us, not send bheir we should rob you.",49
287,Mr FOWLER,IS I I,The people will geb rich by robbing one anobher.!,49
288,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,"That is their idea. But here the unfortunate fact comes in, that Australia produces a very much larger quantity of goods than she can consume. I am talking now of the primary articles of production-wheat , butter, and various other goods. What is the result? She must send the surplus away. When she has a large quantity of produce to sell, nineteen times out of twenty she sends it to any place where she can get rid of it, and she has to take whatever she can get for it . AVhat do those who buy from the Australian producer do ? Do they regulate the price they give according to the price paid by the man who uses the stuff here? No ; their price is the price ruling in the markets of the world. At the present moment, flour and wheat are regulated by Mark Lane. Butter is regulated by the same market. In fact, wherever the surplus produce is sold, the market at that place regulates the price which the people living at home give for it . It must surely be patent to honourable members, if they only study the subject for a moment, that such is the case. I say, and as a producer I think credence may be placed upon iny statement, that free-trade will benefit the primary producer far more than protection. I am a free-trader and a revenue tariff man, and I want honourable members to understand the platform upon which I stood when a candidate for election, so that there may be no mistake about it . I frankly recognise that we must have revenue ; but we should raise it from articles that will send the revenue into the Treasury, to be afterwards disbursed for the good of the people as a whole, and not try to raise it-for we must fail if we do-upo n certain articles which are produced in the States, and the taxation of which can only result in the benefit of the individual, and not of the people as a whole. If we do that there must be a deficiency which will cause us to have increased taxation, whether we like it or not. I was very much pleased, although I cannot say I enjoyed his speech, to hear the honourable member for Bendigo read out a list of articles, which he informed the House are all much cheaper now than they were previously. I presume he alluded to articles sold in Victoria. But I did not hear him read out a single article of foodwith one exception. He told us that hops would be cheaper. Hops, I believe, are used in the making of beer. I am not a teetotaller, but I do not know that to encourage people to get drunk is a very good thing for a protectionist Ministry to do. I should have thought that they would prefer to endeavour to fill the stomachs of people with food at a cheaper rate. If they had done so it would be very much better for the people as a whole. I now come to the remarks of the ornamental member of the Ministry, Sir Philip Fysh. I am sorry that he is not here. He complained very strongly of the absence of the leader of the Opposition. After doing so, it was his bounden duty to show that it was not a case of "" Satan reproving sin."" He should have shown himself to be a bright example, and should have been in his place to hear what honourable members on the Opposition side of the House had to say in reply to him. He spoke about the increased cost of living. In doing so, he made use in a rather familiar way of the name of the leader of the Opposition, and was called to order by you, Mr Speaker. He said that the leader of the Opposition, in his speech on Tuesday evening, had stated that there were 100 articles of food upon which duties had been increased. He added that he was perfectly satisfied that the right honourable member had been imposed upon.",50
289,Mr MCCOLL,IS I I,That was not the statement. What he said was that a friend of his had put up the price of 100 articles.,50
290,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,"That is near enough for my point.' The honourable gentleman, Sir Philip Fysh, ought to have said that upon seven articles the price had been increased, but that upon thirteen articles the price would probably be reduced. Now, I hold two price-lists in my hand. One is a pricelist issued by a firm of merchants in Sydney ; the other is a price-list issued by a firm of merchants in Melbourne. One is a price-list issued on September 1, 1901 ; the other is a price-list issued on October 10, 1901. In other words, one price-list was issued before the Tariff was proposed ; the other afterwards.. From these lists I find that the assertion made by the honourable and ornamental member for Tasmania was incorrect, and that the statement made by the leader of the Opposition, as supplied to him by his friend, was practically correct. I find, in other words, that the mere fact of the proposed Tariff' coming into force was sufficient to raise the prices' of articles of food to the consumer.",50
291,Mr MCCOLL,IS I I,"It does not show that, it may show what sort of a man the tradesman was.",51
292,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,"No doubt the honourable member for Echuca will be able on Tuesday next to try with all the logic at his command to persuade the House that two and two make five, but whether he will succeed or not remains to be seen. I should not have gone so strongly into this matter had it not been for the fact that statements have been made by the protectionists, and also by the protectionist organ, that prices are not going to be increased to the consumer. It is simply be-cause I know that is not correct, and be-cause I wish to rouse the people of Australia to a sense of what is coming upon them, that I am going to deal with this question of increased prices. I find that with respect to the following articles-blac k pepper, whole, ground, in boxes, and in tins ; white pepper, whole, ground, in boxes, and in tins ; mixed spices, ginger, spices of various descriptions, currie powder, and various articles of that sort-the price has been raised from I d . to 2d. per lb. Mr BARTON. - Perhaps the honourable member has reached a convenient point now.",51
293,Mr CAMERON,IS I I,I have got to pepper in the hot dish I am preparing for the Prime Minister. I m o v e That the debate be now adjourned.,51
294,Mr BARTON,IS I I," I am prepared to leave the honourable member in possession of his pepper until Tuesday, hut before the motion is carried I should like to know whether there is any one representing the Opposition who can join, i u the public interest, in trying to. arrive at some time at which the debate can be fitly and justly terminated. ""We have had a week's discussion of the motion, and honourable members must see that the Government have not unduly pressed them in respect to it . It cannot be reasonably expected that all members on both sides, shall make speeches of two or three hours' duration. It must never be forgotten that the public business is waiting, and that there are measures of the very highest importance which cannot be reached, or resumed until this debate is concluded. It must not be forgotten either that there will lje further opportunity for debate upon the financial resolutions in but committee before the Tariff is reached, and after that upon the Tariff Bill. If those are not opportunities enough I do not know in what way honourable members can wish to multiply them. Before moving the adjournment of the House, I desire to ask. whether anybody is prepared on behalf of the Opposition to take the onus of endeavouring to arrive at a division within a reasonable time ?",51
295,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,Macquarie) There is no desire on the part of the Opposition to continue the debate longer than is necessary for honourable members to give au honest expression of their views upon one of the most important questions that could claim the attention of the Federal Parliament.,51
296,Mr BARTON,IS I I,It is very hard to define what that means.,51
297,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,"It may be difficult to define, but honourable members are members of a free Parliament, with the right of free speech, and the right to express their views.",51
298,Mr BARTON,IS I I,"Hear , hear; nobody doubts it.",51
299,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,"So far, no one can say there has been any desire - to sbonewall, or to take up the time of the House unnecessarily.",51
300,Sir JOHN FORREST,IS I I,"Oh , yes, there has; the honourable member spoke too long himself.",51
301,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,"The right honourable member may allude to the time. I took up in speaking upon bhis question, but I did so on the first occasion to prevent the debate closing. If such a thing had baken place bhen ib would have been a disgrace bo the Federal Parliament.",51
302,Mr CHAPMAN,IS I I,"-""What about the effort to count the House oub ?",51
303,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,We have spent a good deal of time in discussing the machinery Bills. Mr BARTOJS' - Is thab any reason for unnecessary discussion now ?,51
304,Mr SPEAKER,IS I I,Order ; I cannob allow the honourable member bo. enber upon a discussion of other questions upon this onemotion.,51
305,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,"The subject now under consideration affecbs the lives and home comforts of thousands of people in the Commonwealbh, and the leasb we can do is bo give every member an opporbuniby of speaking in bheir interests. Though we cannot make any pledge, we only desire to debate the matter fairly and legitimately. I understand that a number of members on the Govornment side desire to speak, and they are entitled to speak on this question.",51
306,Mr BABTON,IS I I,Is the honourable member anxious in their interests ?,52
307,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,No ; but the Prime Minister knows that we cannot ask an honourable member to stop speaking.,52
308,Mr BAKTON,IS I I,There will be plenty of opportunities for further speeches i i i Committee of Ways and Means.,52
309,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IS I I,"I know that; but this is a very important question, and though there is no desire to unnecessarily take up time, members on this side feel it incumbent upon them, in the interests of their constituents and of the Commonwealth, to fully discuss the question which now claims our attention.",52
310,Mr BARTON,IS I I," I wish to say now, in order that there may be no misunderstanding, that I take it that, so far, there is no indication of a desire on the part of the Opposition to prolong the debate beyond a reasonable time, and I hope it will be closed not later than Wednesday night. Motion agreed to ; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 4.10 p.m.",52
