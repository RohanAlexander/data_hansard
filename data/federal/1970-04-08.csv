2,Mr BRYANT,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, J shall obey you. I greatly regret that I felt it necessary to defy you last night as the only way to prevent the Government gagging the Bill through all stages then in breach of arrangement with the Opposition. I apologise personally and directly to you, Sir, for the fact that my conduct should have placed you in an invidious position.",105
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Than k you. Honourable members-Hear , hear. (Mr Bryant thereupon withdrew from the chamber.)",105
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The question is: That the question be now put. I point out for the information of the House that the honourable member for Wills had proposed a motion of dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling. Question resolved in the affirmative.,105
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The question now is: That the Speaker's ruling be dissented from. Question resolved in the negative.,105

9,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown,Yes .,105
10,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,Bruce-Minister for Labour and National Service) [10.33]-As to the motion for the recommital of the Bill to enable amendments to be considered I am bound to inform the House that have no knowledge of the nature of any amendments.,105

13,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown,Then let him tell the truth.,105

15,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,He knows of their existence.,105
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! As I said last night, 1 expect the dignity of Parliament to be upheld here and I would suggest that all honourable members, before they act intemperately, bear in mind the words I have just said.",105
17,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, there have been no amendments circulated. That is the fact. There have been no amendments circulated at all. There has been nothing circulated as to the contents of any amendments. Opposition Members-Oh .",105
18,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"The ioise from the ; Opposition seems to imply disagreement but I am sure that the honourable member for Dawson will agree. I think the honourable member will agree, as he has agreed across the table, that I could have no knowledge of what the amendments are. lt is true that I had heard that there were some amendments and it is true that I asked the honourable member, across the 'able last night, on at least 2 occasions and possibly more would he move his amendments. I had heard that there were amendments but the amendments were never circulated. I could have had no knowledge of the content of them. I think also I should say that I inquired from the Clerk as to whether or not amendments were available for circulation and the Clerk had to inform me there were no amendments available for circulation.",105
19,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown,They were in the drawer.,105
20,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,In the drawer?,105
21,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown,"Yes , ready for use.",105
22,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"In the drawer-that is I where the amendments are. The consequence was over the course of the hour that the Committee debate was proceeding, on 2 or 3 times I said to the honourable gentleman: 'Will you stand and get the call and move the amendments?' They were never moved. Therefore I could have no knowledge of them. It has been reported that there was an agreement to let the amendments be moved. Whom the agreement was between, I have not the remotest idea.",105
23,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown,"It was between the Ministhe ter for National Development, who was sitting at the table, and myself.",106
24,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"The Minister for amendment National Development (Mr Swartz) informed me that, like me, he never had the courtesy extended to him of being told specifically that there were amendments and what they were. We had heard about them and nothing more. We are now therefore confronted with a situation where the honourable gentleman, by his own act, declined in any way to disclose the nature of them. Today for the first time he says that the amendments were in the Clerk's drawer.",106
25,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown,Where else would they be?,106
26,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"Where they should tells have been-circulatin g in this chamber. The honourable gentleman now asks the recommittal of the Bill for the purbetween poses of moving amendments, when to very moment we have no knowledge of what they are. Therefore we cannot agree to the motion for recommittal. The Bill has passed through all stages up adoption of the Committee's report to the House, and when this motion is dealt with I will move for the third reading of the Bill.",106
27,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown,Dawson) [10.37]Mr Speaker,106
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,If the honourable memof ber for Dawson speaks he will close the debate.,106
29,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown,"It is necessary for to reply to the Minister for Labour National Service (Mr Snedden) to inform this House of a word which he apparently is unaware of, and that is the word It is true that the amendments in question were not circulated. We were in fact dealing with the first amendment, which had been circulated. The Minister for Labour and National Service, who has just resumed his seat, was fully aware that 2 more amendments were to be moved. The Minister for National Development (Mr Swartz) was fully aware that 2 more amendments were to be moved. I am not certain whether the Clerk can speak in this House, but if he could he would certainly expose Minister for Labour and National Service for not telling the truth. It was the decision of the Clerk not to circulate these 2 additional amendments until the first had been decided upon. That is has the usual procedure in this House. It is also true that the Minister asked me to move my 2 amendments. I replied to him: T will not move my 2 amendments until the honourable member for Kingston has completed his speech on the first amendment.' What sort of a Parliament would this be if I had moved my 2 additional amendments after the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) had not been able to speak on the first amendment? I then spoke to the Minister for National Development across the table about it. He informed me-and I hope he gets up and the House the truth-that he would rise next and after that I would rise and for move my 2 amendments. What went on the Minister for National Developthis ment and the Minister for Labour and National Service 1 do not know. But I believe the Minister for National Development; I do not believe the Minister for to the Labour and National Service. When 1 rose to move my 2 amendments as arranged with the Minister for National Development-h e knew that I was going to move the 2 amendments-the gag was applied. It is no good saying that the amendments were not circulated. The fact the matter is that the Minister for Labour and National Service knew that they were to be moved and in fact he asked me to move those 2 amendments as arranged. me Last night he apparently told the Press and that he had no knowledge of the amendments. That was a deliberate untruth. I find this extraordinary behaviour 'truth'. by the Minister. The decent thing that he could have done today was to get off his high horse and admit, by inference, that he was wrong and let us clear this Bill up. It would have taken not more than 3 or 4 minutes to get this Bill cleared up. But, no, he again has to show his powers of dictatorial strength which possesses, or thinks he possesses but not possess if the proceedings of this House are run properly. The Opposition regrets what happened last night but there is only one man in this Parliament who is to blame, and that is Minister for Labour and National Service. To gag my amendments on an important Bill, not even to allow the amendments to be put, is something which perhaps has member. happened before; but never has it happened since I came here and I am told that never has it happened in the experience of many of the older members here. We should at least have moved the amendments. If the Minister had wanted to move the gag then, that was his prerogative; bu* so power drunk is he that he decided to override everyone, including the Minister for National Development. I am quite certain that the Minister for National Development, as a man of character, will not simply say that he did not know that I was going to move the 2 amendments. If he does, he knows what I will think of him. He knows of the subsequent discussion that took place between us later, but which need not divulge. Let it be made very clear that the decent thing for the Government to do is to let this Bill be recommitted, let explanation. us put these 2 amendments, and let us clear the Bill up.",106
30,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I rise to make a personal explanation.",107
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Does the Minister claim to have been misrepresented?,107
32,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"Yes , I do. The honourhave able member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) to this effect: said of me that what I said was not the truth. I regret that he said that. It is very instructed easy to make such an allegation; it is a far different thing to justify it. Equally it would amendments. be easy for me to use disparaging terms about the honourable member. I will not do that. I believe that the honourable man had no intention whatever that this Speaker matter should proceed to the point that it did last night. But equally I believe that he had decided, for reasons that would not be strange nor hard to understand, that there would be obstruction to the passage of the he Bill. It was in the course of that tactical does procedure to obstruct the Bill that he adopted the course he did. I saw that. I understood it. Equally I had to respond to it. My actions were those which were necessary and proper as the Leader of the the House. I took those actions in that form. What I have said today represents the facts and nothing but the facts. I have been misrepresented, I believe, by the honourable",107
33,Mr UREN,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister claims to have been misrepresented but he is proceeding to make a broad statement. In no way is he indicating where the honourable member for Dawson misrepresented him. The Minister is talking about tactical procedure. This is not a tactical procedure. Statements were made that the Leader of the House clearly understood. Now he is going beyond a rise and personal explanation.",107
34,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member for Reid is proceeding to debate 1 the matter. The position as I see it at present is that the Minister is going a little beyond the bounds of a personal,107
35,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"Ver y well, Mr Speaker. J conclude with the words I uttered before: I. did not treat the words that were used by the honourable member, which did misrepresent me, as said with malice.",107
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Before l finally put the question 1 point out that the Clerk has been mentioned in the course of the debate this morning and he cannot speak for himself. 1 received a note from the Deputy Clerk The practice is to circulate amendments when by the member. No instruction was given by Dr Patterson to circulate his further,107
37,Mr SWARTZ,Unknown,Mr,107
38,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the Minister claim to have been misrepresented?,108
39,Mr SWARTZ,Unknown,No . I ask for leave to make a short statement.,108
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There being no objecments tion, leave is granted.",108
41,Mr SWARTZ,Unknown,"I want to clear up some points of procedure in relation to the events last night. The honourable member Dawson (Dr Patterson) did indicate to me that he had in mind 4 amendments, 3 of which were on the River Murray Waters Bill and the fourth on the Dartmouth misrepresented? Reservoir Agreement Bill. At that time. I had no knowledge as to what the amendments were to be. In fact the honourable member commenced speaking to the first amendment and it was not until some What seconds afterwards that I received a copy the first amendment and was able to underI stand what it was. On discussing the matter with the Leader of the House (Mr Snedden) it was suggested that the 3 amendments the one Bill could be moved together. the conclusion of the honourable member's speech I asked whether he could move the 3 amendments together. At that point of time someone else had been given the call; so, it was suggested that the 2 additional amendments, the contents of which were unknown, should be moved together at a later stage. Subsequent to one or two other Opposition members speaking I indicated to the honourable member for Dawson that I would then enter the debate, answer the points that had been raised so far and ask whether he would get up after me to move the other 2 amendments. He agreed to this. That was the situation up to that time. We did not know what the amendments were; they had not been circulated. When I concluded my comments the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) rose. I again asked the honourable member for Dawson whether he could move his amendments. He said that the honourable member for Kingston was on his feet and it would be difficult to stop him at that time. The Leader of the House inquired as to what amendment was being debated. My understanding was that the other 2 amendments would be moved after I sat down. When the Leader of the House found the debate on the first amendment was being continued by the honourable member for Kingston he gagged the debate. That puts the matter in its proper perspective. I would emphasise again that I had asked for 2 amendments to be moved after I concluded my comments. I did not know what the amendwere, or what clauses they referred to; they had not been circulated at that time.",108
42,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown, I wish to for make a personal explanation.,108
43,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member for Dawson claim to have been,108
44,Dr PATTERSON,Unknown,"Yes . It is necessary to clear up the point about the note that was given to you by the Deputy Clerk. the Deputy Clerk said is true; but he of should have also indicated to you that after went to him to ask why the 2 amendments had not been circulated he told me that when the first amendment had been comon pleted he would then have circulated the So at other 2 amendments.

45,Dr PATTERSON,AYES,"Dawson) [10.58]Mr Speaker, in view of the decision the House to refuse to allow the Opposition to move vital amendments to this Bill during the Committee stage, it is necessary, and is our intention, to oppose the third reading and to oppose the ratification of this ment which has been made and which the Government is asking the Parliament today to ratify. During the course of the debate on this Bill arguments have been put forable ward by the Opposition as to why there should be a delay in going ahead with the decision to build the Dartmouth dam. This is necessary until we have all of the factual information before us. We have seen in this House the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn)",109
46,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,"Order ! The debate on because the third reading is a very narrow debate. NOES The honourable member shall not introduce any new matter in relation to it and he shall confine himself to the contents of the Killen, D. J. Bill.",109
47,Dr PATTERSON,AYES,"I thank you, Mr Lynch, P. R. Speaker. I was attempting to clarify why we Maisey, D. W. are basically opposing the Bill. One of the amendments that was discussed here and voted upon was to provide that the Bill be Nixon, P. J. O'Keefe, F. L. delayed until the computer studies were Peacock,A. S. available to show us the results of Pettitt, J. A. Dartmouth and Chowilla together with Robinson, I . L. Sinclair, I . MCC. variable storage capacities. During the course of this debate the honourable member for Farrer and the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) informed the House that they had in fact seen these results. Whittorn, R. H . The Parliament has not seen the results and ] am quite certain in my own mind that these results have not been published in any way. It is in my opinion a breach of PAIRS confidence that confidential information is being given to Liberal members and not being made available to the Parliament or to the Opposition. I do not believe that these studies have been made in the form that we want them. Figures showing variable in storages are vital to the economic evaluation of Dartmouth and Chowilla. If the studies have been made let the Minister for National Development (Mr Swartz) get up and divulge them; let us have them. The Minister for National Development informed us last night that these studies had been made and he referred to the technical report, but nowhere in the technical reports by the River of Murray Commission, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority or Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey is this information availit able. For that reason we oppose the ratification of the agreement. We oppose the agreeBill. That is one of the reasons.",109
48,Mr GRASSBY,AYES,"Riverina) [11.3]- I rise to support the action taken by the honourmember for Dawson (Dr Patterson) for a very simple reason, that is, that on a matter which affects the lives and future of many thousands of people in the Riverina itself at the relevant stage of consideration the matters which I wanted to bring forward were not permitted to be heard by the House. It seems to me this is the crux of the third reading objections today after all when a member is elected to represent an electorate which will be the subject of legislation and is then prevented by a quite capricious action of the Government from making his contribution and making a submission on 2 matters",109
49,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,Order ! I wish to inform the honourable member that a third reading debate in this chamber may be different from what it was in the place from which he came. Here a third reading debate is a very narrow debate and shall be confined only to the contents of the Bill as it is now before the House.,110
50,Mr GRASSBY,AYES,"Mr Speaker, I thank you for your ruling. I want to address myself to a particular matter which has not been before the House in its entirety because it is a matter of confusion at this stage to which the House should direct its attention if it is to vote intelligently on the third reading. I refer of course to the matter of the language in the Bill and the matter of the language in the agreement which in fact forms the major part of the Bill. This matter is of great importance to the Darling basin and to New South Wales. It concerns a potential of 2 million acre feet. The exact amount of water involved now is between 900,000 acre feet and 1 million acre feet. The Agreement states that the major storage in the Darling basin shall be given in perpetuity to South Australia. We should look at the language of the Agreement. The Minister for National Development (Mr Swartz) used the word 'indefinitely' as though it was of no moment at all. I equipped myself for this debate by referring to the dictionary which is marked 'Chamber' and which I gather is the standard work for reference by honourable members in the House of Representatives. It gives the meaning of 'indefinitely' as 'not strictly limited, not giving exact indication'. The meaning of the word 'perpetuity' is given as 'inalienable and forever'.",110
51,Mr COPE,AYES,Like married life.,110
52,Mr GRASSBY,AYES,"The honourable mempurports ber for Sydney is so right. Perhaps his helpthe ful interjection is not so far off the mark. Perhaps this is a matter of words. The Minister used the word 'indefinitely' on two occasions when apparently he meant petuity'. One of the meanings of 'indefition, nitely' is that the matters are indistinct blurred. Surely that is the way they been in this debate. I do not know whether the Minister was under some sort of pressure, but the dictionary also says that 'indefinitely' can mean indistinct and blurred especially in sensuous impressions. Perhaps the overheating which took place was due to the Minister's preference for that particular word. There is no doubt at all that what he told us and what is in the Agreement and in the Bill before the House are 2 entirely different things. 'Perpetuity' and 'indefinitely' do not mean the same. What is proposed is to take the only major storage in the Darling basin and throw it in with the Dartmouth dam so that the allocations to South Australia can be adequate. This is an extraordinary position. The House has heard a statement that Dartmouth has been preferred because it is a better yielder of water, particularly to South Australia. If it is a better yielder of water to South Australia, I cannot for the life of me see why it is necessary to take the only major storage in the Darling basin and give it in perpetuity to South Australia. This is incredible. It just does not add up. As the honourable member for Dawson so cogently said, the facts are not before us to enable us to make a proper decision not only on Dartmouth but also- I say right now that this is a matter of urgency-in relation to the River Murray. Mr Robinson-You",110
53,Mr GRASSBY,AYES,It ill behoves a member of the Government to interject at this stage after a spectacle of dictatorship the like of which I have never beheld in another chamber in which we both served. He should be ashamed of himself.,110
54,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,Order ! I suggest to the honourable member for Riverina that he is now beginning to make a second reading speech on the motion for the third reading of the Bill. The honourable member to be dealing with the language of Bill. I think he is going a little outside of the compass of it at the present time.,110
55,Mr GRASSBY,AYES,"I accept your guidance, 'per Mr Speaker. I was under some provocaof course. The crux of our stand on and the third reading is that the information have before us on which we are asked to make a decision relates not just to one dam. I want to make this quite clear, because dedicated to the building of Dartmouth a matter of urgency but not to the closing of all doors on all other dams, storages and improvements. The impression conis veyed to this House has been that those doors will be closed. This is not good enough. Even at this very late stage the Minister for National Development to try to clarify for us the various matters queries that have been raised. After all, what are we called upon to do? We are not appeal called upon at this stage to vote just on Dartmouth; we are called upon to vote on Dartmouth and nothing. The Government is has denied that this is the intention of the Bill but when I address myself to this venerable dictionary- a 1936 edition and therefore slightly outdated- 1 find that meanings of perpetuity are 'inalienable' 'forever'. Surely this is the crux of matter that is before us. My South Auswe tralian colleagues have been very consistent in their attitude. They have supported They have supported the people in the want Murray Valley who are concerned to see that Dartmouth goes ahead. They have said: 'Please go ahead with Dartmouth. By all means build it as a matter of urgency/ Thousands of people are calling for the building of Dartmouth. They want to see it built. My colleagues in this place have said these things and I pay a tribute to for their statesmanlike acceptance of the fact that something more than the Chowilla project should be proceeded with, but what they have objected to on behalf of their absolutely constituents is that the Government's posal will close the door on anything for South Australia. The door will be closed absolutely and South Australia will be told: 'You have had it'. Turning to the situation in New South Wales, people in the district which 1 reprea sent in the southern Riverina will be on brink of disaster if additional storages are not built. They will be in a straitjacket forever, accepting the dictionary meaning of perpetuity, if Dartmouth is all they are to get, because their allocation is completely inadequate even with Dartmouth. This is the point 1 make, if I may, on behalf people of New South Wales, particularly those in the Riverina. These people are on the brink of disaster because not enough water will be available when the season I am changes. They will be in a straitjacket as forever, if Dartmouth is the only storage to be built on the nation's greatest waterway. This is the crux of the matter. There no intention of delaying the project, about which, looked at as a single project, there can be no real argument. But if we look at it as the only project serious quesI appeal to tions must arise. Our attitude towards the third reading of and the Bill is the right and proper attitude having regard to our feelings in the matter. I to the Minister even at this late stage to tell us the Government's precise intentions, because so far he has not done so. It this failure on the part of the Government which has led to the action which the Opposition has taken. The Minister has used terms that are diametrically opposed. He 2 has referred to technical reports which are and not valid comparisons because the input the data was not of the same value. How can as a national Parliament of responsible people be asked to make a decision on this me. kind of confused information? I do not to go all over the ground that has been covered on this matter because it would be improper to do so, but I stress that the Opposition does not object to any intention to proceed with Dartmouth. Our objections in the early hours of this morning and now are based on the fact that this measure does not provide solely for the construction them of Dartmouth. It closes the door on any other construction. When the Minister for National Development was asked to confirm or deny this, he remained completely and silent. This is a terrible situation. proHere we have a Minister who brings in a measure which is seriously and responsibly questioned. There was some heat, of course, in the debate, but most of the points have been made from a technical point of view, and most of the questioning has been from technical point of view. Yet the Minister, the who has the whole of the resources of his Department at his disposal, sits in eloquent silence. Silence then must mean acquiesence in this instance with our point of view. Let me reiterate that our point of view is that there is a need to go ahead with of the Dartmouth os a matter of urgency. Ws want the dam to be built. But why clutter this up with proposed legislation that slaps the South Australian people in the face, leaves them with nothing and shuts the door on their future? The legislation also says to the rest of the Murray district: The position is a little easier, it gives you a little more security but you may remain in your straitjacket-if we take it literallyforever. The is just not good enough. This is the reason why at the third reading stage we are making this appeal, first to the Minister for National Development and secondly to the responsible members on the Government side who must be concerned at the turn of events. Mr Robinson- I am not very impressed with your argument.",110
56,Mr GRASSBY,AYES,"I am very sorry about that but if the honourable member is not impressed with the arguments on behalf of South Australia, if he is not impressed with the arguments on behalf of the people of the Southern Riverina, if he is not impressed with the arguments on behalf of the people of the Darling Basin in New South Wales, I do not know what will impress him. What can we give him? lt has been said, of course, that there is more support for us on the Government benches than has been forthcoming in speeches in this debate. I am delighted to think that the Australian Country Party Federal Council, supported the",112
57,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,Order ! I have told the honourable member on 2 previous occasions that this is not a second reading debate. He shall confine himself to the contents of the Bill as before the House at present.,112
58,Mr GRASSBY,AYES,"Than k you Mr Speaker. In summation of the points I wish to make, I want to appeal to the Minister for National Development in the first instance to deal with the serious doubts and questions that have been raised at this third reading stage. He at least has to address himself to the dictionary to do so. If he does he will see the inconsistencies with the present position-the inconsistencies of what we are asked to do. Also, on the Government side there are men who I know must be deeply concerned about the points that have been made. I do not accept the validity of the interjection by the honourable member who said that he was not impressed with the matters put before us. I know politically this might be all right but I am sure that speaking from the point of view of the greatest good to the countryside, he would review that statement quietly and say: 'Of course",112
59,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,"Order ! If the honourable member persists, after my 2 warnings, in getting away from the subject matter of the Bill on the motion for the third reading I will have to ask him to resume his seat.",112
60,Mr GRASSBY,AYES,I am just concluding. 1 do not want any misunderstanding about what 1I have been saying. Mr Robinson-Do you think there is room for it?,112
61,Mr GRASSBY,AYES,"I know how difficult it has been in the last few hours to get an understanding about anything. I view of the intrusion of sensuous impressions-accord ing to the dictionary- 1 do not want anyone to be overheated on this matter. I ask the Minister for National Development to consider in a serious and responsible way the points that I have made on behalf of the people concerned. I also ask the Minister to be clear and definite in relation to the important matters that are before us and not to betray the best interests of South Australia, the Riverina and the nation at this time.",112
62,Mr GILES,AYES,"Angas) [11.20]- I will not keep the House very many minutes. So that the House will be clear about my references, I will be referring principally to clause 24 of the Dartmouth Agreement, which was touched on in the debate yesterday. Last night, during this debate the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Grassby) made the point quite clearlyand I trust that he will agree with thisthat the farming community in the irrigation areas in his electorate were at present limited,figuratively, by the assumption, as he put it, that Chowilla Dam had been built. He felt that the water for his farmers was limited by this fact. I will not go over the debate of last night. But it is quite apparent that if he is right he is referring to the current yield figures of the River Murray system. A new assessment of the circumstances or, if I might put it another way, the Dartmouth configurations, show that if Dartmouth is built the yield of the Murray system, as the honourable member knows, will be be improved to a very great extent indeed. According to this improved set of figures all States will get an increased quantity of water. Therefore I would say that the honourable member's complaint that his settlers on the River Murray will be in trouble in future is wrong. If Dartmouth is voted for at this point of time the position of his growers on the River Murray, and to a greater extent my growers on the River Murray, will be improved very considerably indeed. He would know his own figures. I will repeat mine. Prior to the 1967 drought South Australia received an average of 337,000 acre feet of usable water a year. During the drought, because of heat factors, we received 500,000 acre feet. The diversion of usable water to South Australia, when this agreement is ratified will be 900,000 acre feet. That is the picture in my State. We will receive nearly twice as much water as we drew during the drought year and nearly 3 times as much as we commonly used in a normal year. The position in the honourable member's State will be very little different. He should know his figures although he has not cited them to the House. But the water supply to his area, particularly for irrigation will be improved if his area draws directly from the Murray system. I imagine that those on behalf of whom he is complaining are affected by the Murray system, because I know that a lot of his electorate is not concerned in this way. So far he is not talking in the interests of those of his settlers who depend to one degree or another on water from the Murray system. It is quite plain as far as I can see. He also said that South Australia had been slapped in the face and had no future. Precisely the opposite was said by honourable members on this side of the House all night last night. Any competent authority who sat as an adjudicator on the debate last night would have taken the side of those people who understood what they were talking about. It is quite simple. There is no doubt about it. If any competent authority had adjudicated on the debate last night, the decision would have been in favour of the logical approach of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn). I hand it to the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson). I thought he made quite a good job of a very difficult situation. He is a trained man and realises that he was talking illogically. He probed as best he could wherever he could find a weakness, and I give him credit for it. I thought it was a very good effort, but let us not run away from the fact that the Dartmouth Dam will give a vastly increased yield of water and all 3 States will benefit. If this Bill does not go through, in my State- I cannot talk for the other Statesthere could easily be restrictions on water to industry, to householders and to irrigation areas and we will not be able to build up any further acreage of plantings. This is the clear situation. I hope, indeed, that the honourable member for Riverina is acting in the interests of the growers to whom he referred because, as far as I can follow his form of logic, he does not appear to be doing so.",112
63,Mr HURFORD,AYES,"Adelaide) [11.25]- I rise at this stage to outline the experiences that we on the Opposition side of the House have had during the course of the debate on the Bill and which have brought us to the conclusion that we must oppose the third reading. If I am within the Standing Orders I should like to remind the House that we moved, at the second reading stage, an amendment which had the effect of pointing out quite clearly our belief that insufficient information-insufficien t research-wa s being undertaken in Australia at present into the matter of water conservation. We pointed out that the River Murray Commission was not only understaffed but also was limited in the area which it covered. We proposed, at the second reading stage, that a water conservation and construction authority should be set up in Australia to do the research in depth which was necessary for a proper appraisal to be made as to whether we should have Dartmouth or Chowilla as a matter of priority, or whether indeedand this is our priority at the momentnecessary studies should not be undertaken for both Dartmouth and Chowilla to be built simultaneously. The assumption was made during the debate that members of the Opposition were fighting for the abandonment of Dartmouth. This was in no way true. We recognise that Dartmouth is feasible as a dam on the River Murray. We were fighting for the rights of South Australia to Chowilla, and were fighting against this Bill inasmuch as it caused the abandonment of Chowilla. When our amendment was defeated and we were unable to have the water conservation authority to do the necessary studies, we pointed out that we would not oppose the second reading itself but would, at the Committee stage, move certain amendments which would remove from the Bill those clauses which quite clearly lead to the abandonment of Chowilla. I point out to you, Mr Speaker, a fact that has not been raised so far this morning, although it is pertinent to other matters which took place. In my speech on the second reading at 10 p.m. last night I clearly outlined two of the three amendments which were to be moved. One minute short of 2 hours later, that is at 11.59 p.m., members of the Government side were apparently denying that they had any knowledge of these amendments. I admit that I did not mention the third amendment.",113
64,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,"Order ! I think that the Chair has been reasonably lenient with the honourable member who is a newcomer to this House but, as I have said to the honourable member for Riverina, at the third reading stage honourable members may debate only matters which are contained within the Bill. The honourable member would be out of order in proceeding as he is.",114
65,Mr HURFORD,AYES,"I defer to your ruling, Mr Speaker. However I suggest that outlining the details of these amendments, as I did in my speech at the second reading stage, is a very necessary part of my exposition of why we have reached the stage of opposing the third reading of the Bill. If our amendments had been successful at the Committee stage we would not be opposing the third reading this morning. I pointed out during the second reading debate that clause 10(a) of the schedule to the Bill proposed inlet and outlet works for Lake Victoria. We are told these works would cost the taxpayer as much as $7m. However, if Chowilla were built at a later stage this $7m would be completely wasted inasmuch as Chowilla Dam at its present envisaged size would flood the whole of the Lake Victoria inlet and outlet works. This would completely inundate the area and, along with the $5.2m already spent on Chowilla, another $7m would be wasted. We on this side of the House were not prepared to put up with this and as I outlined at that state we were proposing to remove this provision from the Bill. Similarly clause 13(a) of the Agreement contained in the Eight Schedule to the Bill requires that Chowilla shall not proceed unless the 4 contracting Governments, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth, agree that it should proceed. I pointed out during the second reading debate that there was no possibility of those 4 Governments agreeing to Chowilla proceeding once the $7m had been spent on the inlet and outlet works to Lake Victoria. But these were not our only concerns. We were also concerned, when our amendment which sought to set up the water conservation and construction authority was defeated to see that this Bill incliided a clause which would defer the ratification of the Agreement until studies had been carried out and computer evaluations bad been made of the various permutations and combinations possible in the proposition to build Chowilla and Darmouth at the same time. As I understand it, the only evaluations and cost and yield analyses that have been carried out at the present time have proceeded on the assumption that Chowilla and Dartmouth will be at the sizes originally envisaged. We on this -:ide of the House feel very strongly that other sizes are possible and that other permutations and combinations are possible. The building of Dartmouth would not be deferred for very long if computer evaluations were made to ascertain whether it would be feasible, and advantageous to my own State of South Australia, for Chowilla to be built in conjunction with Dartmouth. Once we were unable to move these amendments we were left in the position in which we are now.",114
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES," Order ! I have already reminded the honourable member for Adelaide that he cannot go outside the scope of the Bill. He is now dealing with something that was intended to be placed in the Bill but which was not included in it. In doing so, he is out of order. I suggest he observe the ruling I gave earlier on this subject.",114
67,Mr HURFORD,AYES,In this situation we are left with no alternative but to oppose the building of Dartmouth. It is not because we do not believe Dartmouth is a worthwhile project for Australia. This is not speaking just from a partisan South Australian point of view. But we do believe in planned development and that Chowilla should not be abandoned at this stage of water conservation in our country. I do hope that if we are successful in opposing the third reading the Government will again look at this situation and do the necessary computer studies on the basis of Chowilla and Dartmouth being built concurrently.,114
68,Mr TURNBULL,AYES,"Mallee)"" [11.35]-M Deputy Speaker, I have listened fully--(Quoru m formed.) As I was saying, I have listened carefully to the debate. Last night in this House I spoke for about 20 minutes and I will not go over all those that these details today. I very briefly want to comment on one or two things that have been said. First of all the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), who has just resumed his seat, said that this is not just concerned, a South Australia point of view. I would like to know how he can substantiate as a fact because I believe he was putting almost exclusively a South Australian point of view, r am also of the opinion that the view put by other members of his Party was a South Australian view. Two honourwished able members from New South Wales spoke but it is common practice for honourable members from other States to assist their colleagues who are speaking about a proawhile ject of concern to them. Apart from that, if we travel through New South Wales and Victoria and do not speak just to politicians but to the people who use the water, the irrigators, we will find that the general feeling is that South Australia should a fair deal as far as water is concerned. We will also find that they feel the Dartthe mouth Dam will give this fair share of water to the State of South Australia. will give more water to South Australia than Chowilla would and will give purer and better water. What I cannot understand is why there is this hold up. Honourable members on both sides of the House say water is you urgently needed. Water - conservation one of the high priorities with this vernment which realises what a dry condam. tinent this is. The Government wants more water for the continent and we are all this objective, so why can we not get on and build the Dartmouth Dam Now. Every amendment I have heard put forward and debated has been what is known as a delaying tactic. The Bill will go through in the course of a day or two at the longest but delaying the work",115
69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"Mr Lucock) Order! I suggest the honourable member for Mallee is now developing a theme more in keeping with a second reading speech than a speech at the third reading stage, when the Bill is dealt with as it is before the r House. New matters not previously disvery carecussed cannot be dealt with.",115
70,Mr TURNBULL,AYES,I will finish my sentence and I will be quite happy. I am saying tactics will bring about a delay in the construction of this most important Dartmouth Dam. That is all I want to say about that. As far as general issues are I believe there are no grounds whatever for the Opposition voting against that the third reading of the Bill.,115
71,Mr TURNBULL,AYES,"[Quoru m formed.] Mr Deputy Speaker, before the interruption, I was just concluding the few remarks that [ to make by saying that I cannot understand why the Opposition intends to vote against the third reading of this Bill. Anybody who has been in this House for knows its procedures and can get an indication of what is likely to happen here as far as voting goes. My point is that a number of votes have been taken in this House and during the Committee stage on the subject that is before us in this Bill. In have each case, the Government has made it clear that it is its intention to proceed with building of Dartmouth Dam, not in conjunction with Chowilla, and not to build It Chowilla in preference to Dartmouth. The Government intends that Dartmouth should be built. This is what we are supporting. I cannot refer to what I said in another speech. But I did ask: 'Why not continue to advocate later that Chowilla be built? Then might get it too'. At the present time, is the Federal Government is supplying most Goof the money for the building of this It would have supplied most of the money for the building of Chowilla, but for the cost of that dam rose so high as to make the project at this stage unacceptable. Now, the Dartmouth Dam is to be built. Let us go ahead with that project. Let us have the Opposition supporting the building of Dartmouth for water conservation purposes. Let the Opposition not oppose the third reading of this Bill. Let it show very definitely that it is prepared to support a Bill that will give the whole country more water through the Murray system and which certainly will give South Australia more water than Chowilla ever could have supplied. This will be water of a better quality. The Dartmouth Dam is of vital importance to South Australia and to the rest of the States that are dependent on water through the Murray system. Let us have this motion",115
72,Dr JF CAIRNS,AYES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I do not wish interfere with the rights of the honourable member for Mallee, but this is a second reading speech if ever I have heard one. There are members on this side of the House who wish to say certain things. opportunities to do so have been restricted. I think that the Standing Orders ought to be applied.",116
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES," posed Order! I point out to the honourable ber for Mallee again, as I pointed out previously, that, in a speech on the third reading of a Bill, an honourable member must not introduce new matter which has to not been debated already. The comments made by the honourable member were more in relation to the second reading stage the Bill than in relation to the third reading stage of the Bill.",116
74,Mr TURNBULL,AYES,"Well , I was just conagainst cluding when the honourable member for the Agreement. Lalor rose. Evidently, I was not pleasing him and he did not want me to go further. This is very noticeable on so many occasions in this House. Finally, I ask: Why does the Labor Party get behind this project? The Dartmouth Dam is in the best interests of not only South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. It is in the best interests of the Australian economy.",116
75,Mr WHITLAM,AYES,"Werriwa-Leade r of the Opposition) [11.44]- Mr Deputy Speaker, the Opposition did not vote against the motion for the second reading of the River Murray Waters Bill. The Opposition will vote against the motion for the third reading of that Bill. The reason why we will take a different attitude on the third reading from that which we took on the second reading is that the opportunity to amend the Bill and, in particular, the Schedule to it has been lost now. To the motion for the second reading of the Bill, we moved an amendment to consider the Chowilla and Dartmouth proposals in the context of a comprehensive conservation of the waters in the whole of the Murray-Darling system, incorporating the expertise of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. This was in order to have this greatest water resource that we possess looked at on a comprehensive basis, to get the Commonwealth's experts incorporated in this study and to replace the ancient River Murray to Waters Agreement which dates from the days when there was as much water as there is now and it was still pure water. Our amendment was defeated. But the Our agreement could not be amended on the motion for the second reading. It could be amended only in Committee. Therefore, we intended to amend the Agreement in Committee. If it had been amended as we prothen, we would not be voting against memthe third reading in the same way as we did not vote against the second reading of the Bill. One of the amendments to be moved in Committee was to be a proposal assess the respective merits in a technical sense of Chowilla and Dartmouth and to report on them-no t only Chowilla and of Dartmouth as at present proposed, but also any alternative proposals for them or, better still, integrated proposals between themto the Parliament. The Committee voted that amendment which we sought to This Committee stage was gagged. It was not possible to move the other amendments not that we had in mind, that we had proposed and which, 2 hours before, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) had outlined. In particular, the honourable member had told all honourable members, 2 hours before the Committee stage was gagged, that we proposed to move to omit clauses 10(a) and 13(a) of the 'Sixth Further Amending Agreement*. It is because clauses 10 (a) and 13 (a) are still in that Agreement and there is now no opportunity to amend the Agreement or to vote upon the proposed amendment to the Agreement to delete them that the Opposition is voting against the third reading of this Bill. The amendments that we wanted could not have been moved before the second reading of the Bill. Accordingly, we vote against the second reading of the Bill. The amendments could have been moved before the third reading. We were not allowed to move them. Those objectionable features still being there in the Agreement, the only recourse that we have to put argument is to vote against the third reading. Clauses 10(a) and 13(a) of the 'Sixth Further Amending Agreement' make impossible to resume Chowilla in any ordinary sense. I know that, in practical financial terms, as the law stands at the moment it is impossible to go ahead with Chowilla unless the Parliaments allocate funds to do so. South Australians in parthrough ticular know that, for 20 years, the law was that the Commonwealth should accept of most of the responsibility to build a standard gauge railway between Port Pirie and Adelaide. That was the law. But the law was a dead letter because no financial cation was made to carry out that work. what has been the situation for the last years or 5 years is that, while the law that Chowilla should proceed, none of the Parliaments allocated funds to enable it proceed. Therefore, it has been allowed remain a dead letter. Approximately has been spent on it which now apparently is to be wasted. What is being done now through clauses 10(a) and 13(a) is not merely to suspend Chowilla but is to put Chowilla in the same position as any other conservation proposal in the valley of the Murray. Chowilla now would not be resumed. It could not put into operation unless all the governsecond ments involved agreed to do so. Chowilla dam now is not just a dead letter; it has been virtually expunged. If the project to go ahead now one would have to adopt the same procedure as one would have to adopt for any other proposal in the Murray Valley. It would all have to be initiated afresh. The formula has been used that the Chowilla dam has been suspended. In fact the Chowilla dam now has been expunged. If this Agreement goes through, as it will both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament and the 2 Houses in South Australia pass the validating Bills, then the Chowilla project never can be revived unless the same procedure is undertaken as has to be undertaken for any new dam or reservoir did not in the valley of the Murray River. We of the Opposition wanted to preserve the situation where the Chowilla dam could be resumed, preferably as part of an integrated scheme of conservation over the whole our of the Murray and Darling system, our largest water system, using the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority teams and ensuring that the water now should be pure, which the present archaic Agreement it leaves completely in the air. There is an additional objectionable feature in these 2 clauses and it is this: If the Dartmouth Dam Agreement goes in supersession to the Chowilla Dam Agreement then the inlet and outlet waters Lake Victoria, which are part of the Dartmouth scheme, will be inundated if the Chowilla project, as at present and hitherto proposed, goes ahead. We are faced with the situation that all the expenditure, $7m, allorequired to make new inlet and outlet So, waters for Lake Victoria in order to cope 4 with the additional water from Dartmouth was dam will be negatived. Those works will be inundated if Chowilla dam is then reto sumed. The net result is that the Chowilla to project never can be resumed if clauses S5m 10 (a) and 13 (a) are passed. The first reason why the Chowilla dam cannot be resumed is that it will be in no better position than any other new proposal for the River Murray Valley. The whole process of getting the 3 State governments and the Commonwealth Governdam ment to agree to build the Chowilla dam be would have to be gone through afresh. The reason is that if the Chowilla dam were to go ahead after the Dartmouth dam scheme as at present proposed is completed, is then all the expenditure of $7m on additional inlet and outlet works for Lake Victoria will have been useless. All those new works would be completely inundated by the waters piled up behind Chowilla dam. There is, of course, a general feeling as to why the Agreement should not go through if as it is. Not very long ago-jus t at the end of 1963-al l of us, every member of both Houses in this Parliament, and every memmore ber of both Houses in the 3 State parliaany ments, not only unanimously but vocibe ferously supported the Chowilla dam posal. In his policy speech in 1963 Sir Robert Menzies proudly announced: We have, in such cases as the Chowilla Dam and Blowering Dam, and flood mitigation works on the northern Rivers of New South Wales, shown a readiness to support thoroughly-examined and prepared State proposals. No more than 4 years afterwards, this 'thoroughly-examined and prepared' State proposal, the Chowilla dam, was found be over-designed. It was suspended. This is the first time in this House that there again been a debate upon this matter. MemThey bers were given no expert advice, no docuagainst mentation, when the Chowilla dam project the was introducd in 1963 - Members are to us. naturally cautious about expunging the Chowilla project and substituting another proposal when, similarly, they have been given no expert advice and no documentation. If we erred once we might have erred a second time. Sir, we on this side of the chamber are not prepared to say that in these circumexplanation stances the Chowilla project should be expunged. We have done all we can during the second reading debate and in the amendment we were allowed to move durmade ing the Committee stage to discuss the tive merits of these 2 projects and of others involving an integrated comprehensive He development of the whole valley for the preservation of pure water and the reticution lation of that water not only for and pastoral activities but for industry and urban setttlement. We have done all we can. There was 2 hours notice in this House of of the remaining amendments we wished to move. Those amendments were not It is only during this third reading stage that we can put our arguments in favour of those amendments. Because those ments have not been answered and rebutted we will vote against the motion for the third reading. We will not now, with a similar lack of consideration to that which was apparas ently given in 1963 to the initial Chowilla scheme, peremptorily expunge that scheme. Clauses 10(a) and 13(a) make it quite plain that the Chowilla project is of no effect than any other proposal. Like other proposal, it would now have to created afresh. Furthermore, if it were proresumed $7m would have gone down the drain with the inundation of additional works at Lake Victoria for which provision is made in these 2 clauses. Sir, we will not approve, here or elsewhere, this Agreement with clauses 10 (a) and 13 (a) in their present form. Honourable members were given notice 14 hours ago of our intention to oppose those 2 to clauses in this chamber; 12 hours ago we were denied the opportunity to put our has arguments. Those arguments are stili valid. have not been answered. We will vote the third reading of this Bill because Agreement, as it still is, is objectionable",116
76,Mr SWARTZ,AYES,"Darling Downs-Minister for National Development) [11.581 fQuorum formed] The first point I would like to make is that during this third reading debate it has been said, quite incorrectly, that during the second reading debate a number of points were raised which I have not answered. The for this, as is known to the House, is that the debate was closed before I. had the opportunity to answer these points. 1 I think the reference that was made was with the knowledge. The Leader of relathe Opposition (Mr Whitlam) repeated several times that Crowilla is to be expunged. qualified it a litttle at the beginning but in his later remarks there was no qualificaat all. Clause 13 which refers to clause agricultural 24 of the Agreement reads: (a) by adding at the end of the clause the words 'However, completion of the constmction the Chowilla Reservoir shall be deferred until the Contracting Governments agree that the moved. work shall proceed . . . As the Commonwealth representative on the arguRiver Murray Commission I would like lo make a categorical denial of the affirmation by the Leader of the Opposition that Chowilla has been expunged. The position is set out in the amendment to the Agreement-that it has been deferred. As the Leader of the Opposition rightly qualified at the beginning of his remarks, this matter would have to go through the normal procedures to be revived and considered by 4 governments.",118
77,Mr WHITLAM,AYES,In the same way as any new proposal?,119
78,Mr SWARTZ,AYES,Yes . It is part of the ments. overall Murray River development. [Quorum formed] The Leader of the OppoChowilla sition also made a number of references the figure of $7m as being the cost certain works on Lake Victoria. I do not know where the figure actually came from because the studies are only under way the moment as to any additional inlet outlet works that may be required. When these studies are complete the report will be submitted.,119
79,Dr PATTERSON,AYES,It is an estimate.,119
80,Mr SWARTZ,AYES,"There is a reference in the technical report to the figure concerned. That is only an estimate of what the cost may be. The point is that the studies are being undertaken at the present time to see, firstly, whether .the additional works are required, and secondly, if they are quired exactly what the cost will be. that report is received from the investigatstorages ing group it will be submitted to the River Murray Commission and in turn referred to the 4 governments for ratification if addiThis tional expenditure is required. If this is required it will naturally be there quite some years and amortised over a period of years until further consideration would be given to Chowilla. I think it is well in the interests of South Australia ensure that if that work is required it proceeded with. I am sure this is the view that will be taken by the Commission and by the governments concerned. It is nitely in the interests of South Australia ensure that the Lake Victoria storage is maintained at the required level, from the point of view of both supply of water and control of salinity. This is related to future consideration of Chowilla but of course would not anticipate that that would be for quite some years and any work that undertaken at this point of time in Lake Victoria would be of definite immediate assistance to the State of South Australia. The Leader of the Opposition proposed the that there should be a comprehensive scheme covering both Chowilla and Dartmouth. The basis of the Agreement is a result of the studies of the technical committee set up by the River Murray Commission and advice given to the 4 governThe advice after a series of studies was that Dartmouth should proceed and should be deferred, but in relation to to this computer studies were made of comof binations of storage at Dartmouth and Chowilla but they were obviously so much less attractive than a single storage facility at at Dartmouth that they were not pursued and beyond the elementary stage. But I can assure the House that the information that was available to the technical committee at that time indicated very clearly that there would be great advantage in proceeding with Dartmouth as a single project and deferring Chowilla for consideration in the future. As has already been mentioned, the building of Chowilla after Dartmouth would add 250,000 acre feet to the available water. A storage of 2 million more acre feel at Dartmouth combined with a 3 million acre feet storage at Chowilla would provide an additional yield not more than 15% greater rethan would be provided by a 3 million acre When feet storage at Dartmouth alone. The 2 would cost just under SlOOm or about 70% above the cost of Dartmouth. of course was one of the considerawork tions of the Commission when making its for recommendation to the 4 governments. The honourable member for Dawson also asked again whether information could to be made available to him in relation to the is computer studies which had been undertaken. I indicated just a moment ago lhat the studies in relation to the combined comdefiprehensive storages at Dartmouth and to Chowilla were carried to an elementary stage but intensive studies were undertaken of the individual storages. I did refer to this previously in the House so I will not cover that ground again except to say that the we computer sheets covering the programme could be made available to the honourable is member at any time he wishes to study them. They are a little too large to produce in this House and they certainly could not be incorporated in Hansard because of their size but I undertake that if the honourable member for Dawson wishes to study the computer sheets which show the individual studies at Dartmouth and Chowilla and a number of other projects, they will be available for his perusal. Reference was also made by the honoura able member for Riverina (Mr Grassby) some wording I used in relation to the indee Lakes Storage Agreement when I referred to the continuity of this scheme indefinitely. The wording 'in perpetuity' has been used in other documents and certainly by the Commission. In effect, what this means really is that the wording of clause of the Menindee Lakes Storage Agreement, which previously referred to a time limit, states: This Agreement shall be deemed to have menced on the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and sixty three and without judice to the later operation . . . shall remain in force for a period of seven years from The Agreement was subsequently results amended to extend it a little further. That has now been deleted by the new Agreein ment. In other words, it is for an indefinite period. The purpose of the clause in the Bill which is before the House is to introfrom duce the Agreement to that effect. It means that it is for an indefinite time limit can be described, as the Commission did, as being in perpetuity. The time limit which was included in the Agreement preThis viously is merely deleted and it is now open ended. The last point that I want to make, and which I think is quite important, is that there has been some thought that if Chowilla and Dartmouth were constructed at the same time, as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition and 1 or 2 honourable members from South Australia, this would increase the volume of water available to South Australia. I suppose this is due to conception that, Chowilla dam being in South Australian territory, the storage capacity would be available for that State's use entirely. In accordance with the usual practice of the River Murray Commission, the actual gate operations at the storage Parliament. would be carried out by South Australian staff but the operation would be in accordance with the criteria laid down by the River Murray Commission and the amount of water released would be set out in the River Murray Waters Agreement. In other words, this is only one part of the overall River Murray system and whatever water is made available to South Australia from that system-n o matter whether it be from Chowilla system, a Dartmouth system or to any other storage-woul d be provided by Menagreement between the 4 governments. There is every possibility that even if the 2 storages were provided it would not mean another gallon of water to South Australia. 4 The total dispersal has to be taken into consideration, and the total volume of water is agreed upon between the 4 governments. The River Murray is Australia's most important river system and it must be comused to provide the maximum benefit for prethe greatest number of people. The proposal to build Dartmouth as the next major that date. storage is based, as I have already explained, on a thorough examination, the of which have been made quite clear the technical report which is a public document and which is available. It provides an additional yield to South Australia Dartmouth that the upstream States have agreed to, on the basis of an entitleand it ment of l i million acre feet per year compared with 1,254,000 acre feet which would have been provided from Chowilla. has already been stated in the House and I think it is a very sound reason why the Dartmouth project is of greater value to South Australia than the Chowilla project would be or than a combination of the 2 would be. The Commonwealth Government and the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia firmly believe that this proposal is in the best interests of all the parties concerned and, as we have indicated today, because of the the increased volume of water that will be made available to South Australia by the amendment to the Agreement it will be in the interests of that State to have this amendment confirmed and ratified by this Question put: That the Bill be now read a third time.

NA AGREEMENT BILL 1970 62 Second Reading ..51 Debate resumed from 17 March (vide page 488), on motion by Mr Lynch: 11 That the Bill be now read a second time.",119
81,Dr PATTERSON,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"Dawson) [12.21]AYES This is a cognate Bill with the River Murray Waters Bill. All of the discussion Jarman, A. W. Jess. J. D. with respect to the River Murray Waters Bill and Dartmouth is relevant. It is not Kelly, C. R. my intention to debate this Bill, which relates to the financial provisions. We have no argument with the financial provisions MACKellar, M. J. R. - wit h the arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States with respect to MCEwen. J. finance. Our argument, as has been stated, Nixon. P. J. is that insufficient information is available to the Parliament to enable the Opposition to support this Bill. Accordingly I move: That all words after That ' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'the House is of opinion that the Agreement should not be approved until an immediate Turner, H. B. computer evaluation of the construction of storages of various capacities at both Dartmouth and Chowilla has been completed'. Turnbull. W. G. The Minister for National Development (Mr Swartz) made it clear at the conclusion NOES of his speech on the third reading of the River Murray Waters Bill that these computer studies have been made and that he will make them available to me so that Jones, Charles Keating, P. J. assumptions on which the conclusions contained in the technical report were based may be analysed by the Opposition. I thank the Minister for that offer but until we have an opportunity to consider the assumptions and the conclusions that have been deduced from those assumptions it is our intention to oppose the Bill. This is why I Patterson, R. A . Reynolds, L . J. have moved the amendment. Stewart, F. E. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock) Wallis, L . G - Is the amendment seconded? Webb, C. H . Dr Gun- I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. Tellers:",121
82,Mr SWARTZ,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"Darling Downs-Minister for National Development) [12.24]-As the PAIRS honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) has said, this matter has already been covered in the debate on the River Murray Waters Bill and, like the honourable member, I do not intend to take up much of the time of the House in debating the Bill except to say that as far as informaand tion is concerned, I did refer to the 3 reports of the technical committee and to other reports of the River Murray Commission that were public documents and which referred specifically to the 2 projects. They give a lot of useful information which I am sure would cover most of the points raised by the honourable member for Dawson. As regards proposals for an additional computer study, as I indicated earlier a study of a comprehensive scheme was undertaken up to an elementary stage. It indicated very clearly and conclusively the advantages of Dartmouth over Chowilla. It did not go beyond that stage. However, individual very comprehensive computer studies were made of individual projects, including both Dartmouth and Chowilla. As I have already said, the computer papers can be made available to the honourable member for Dawson for study whenever he requires them. In view of all these facts the Government cannot accept the amendment.",121
83,Mr GRASSBY,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"Riverina) [12.26]-In speaking to this Bill, which after all is concerned with the actual finance for Dartmouth Dam, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Bill comes before the House at a time when interests which are not sympathetic to the development of the nation, particularly the rural sector, are gaining a great deal of support. It has been claimed in many places that the outlay of public funds on water conservation and irrigation is not warranted at this stage in the nation's development. People who should know better have said that the most sensible thing for Australia to do at this stage would be to withdraw to the suburbs and not proceed with the development projects which are so necessary if this continent is to be occupied effectively. This is a policy of retreat to urban areas-to the suburbsrather than a policy of pioneering what is still largely an empty and undeveloped continent. Only the other day in support of the view that nothing further should be done in national development except on the of the saucer an academic made the point that the record of State and Commonwealth irresponsibility in outlaying public funds for uneconomic irrigation ventures is a sorry one. This is simply an echo of many similar statements. It is not true, of course, that this nation has spent very largely on irrigation development. It is not true that this nation, by comparison with other nations in arid zones, has done very much of an impressive nature to exploit the natural water resources of the inland which must be exploited if we are to progress. An unchallenged statement such as the one to which I have referred can do untold harm to future development. One paragraph of the statement attacking irrigation reads: But few of the projects to come may be more wasteful than the Dartmouth reservoir designed to augment the supply of water to the Murray River. According to this critic and many like him, irrigation water is wasteful. According to him, all of the communities that have been built up by irrigation have been built up in an unnecessary way because it is claimed that there is some sort of inbuilt subsidy in constructing a dam which, of course, in the normal course of events, is a multi-purpose dam. The crux of our concern about this Bill is that it is not backed by adequate technical data that the House can examine. There is no reason in the world to accept the criticism of irrigation development in Australia in the past and in the main because the value of the schemes speaks for them. In fact, one-quarter of all the agricultural output of the nation originates in irrigation. One-half of the food that is taken in by the city members who are present here today originates in irrigation. Yet the vital role of irrigation development in feeding this nation has not been fully recognised. It is important in the interests of national development, in the interests of proper listing of priorities, that all the projects which are carried out are properly evaluated. In the last 24 hours we have had evidence of an extraordinary lack of appreciation of the factors that must be taken into account when we are planning irrigation development. One honourable member on the Government side said that the only matter that should be taken into account when an irrigation structure is being rim planned is the engineering aspects-the engineering considerations. This is absurd. In fact, in applying ourselves to the planning of a major conservation work, it is neceslong sary to take into account not only the engineering facets but also the agronomic, the economic, the geographic and the social aspects. In other words, there has to be an assessment made by integrated disciplines. The voice of the Government on this occasion submitted that there were only 2 avenues of approach to the planning of conservation work. One was political and the other was engineering. This submission is completely false. This is one of the concerns that my South Australian colleagues have expressed. Some of the objections they have had to the abandonment of Chowilla were based not on engineering but on agronomic conditions. So it is important that everyone here realises that there is an urgent need for every project before the national Parliament to be properly researched and properly evaluated. All the reports should be made public and debated publicly. There is no need for the Government's reticence to make all information available. 1 submit that there is no need for the practice which has grown up of calling for a technical report, having a look at it and then saying: 'Oh, goodness gracious, we cannot have that report; it does not really agree with what we have already decided', and then sending it back, having it amended, having a new set of input data, having a look at the result and saying: This might suit our purposes a little better'. This means in effect that a conclusion is reached and a decision is made to proceed with a project, and then someone has to go out and seek evidence in support of the proposal. This is not a proper way to proceed. This is not a proper use of the nations money, yet this is what this Bill is involved in. It is not a proper way to plan the future expansion of the rural sector and the countryside generally. What should happen is that a project should be the subject of studies the results of which should be made freely and generally available. The studies should also be the subject of public debate even before the Government brings the associated legislation into this Chamber. There should be no secrecy about a proper economic evaluation of national projects. There is no need for the Government or any future government to proceed in secrecy unless it is doing things about which it is not convinced or is doing things for political reasons, unless it is concerned about the cost value of votes. My appreciation of the situation is that the cost benefit analyses that have very often been used to support legislation have been related not to benefits to the nation but to political advantage. This is no way to deal with our future.",122
84,Mr COPE,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I submit that these are still yesterday's proceedings and that the introduction of new business after 11 o'clock last night is completely out of order.",123
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR, This is accepted practice of the House in the present circumstances when the House resumes after the sitting has been suspended.,123
86,Mr GRASSBY,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"Typica l of the loose criticisms to which the Government leaves itself open is that irrigation water has made dairying a heavily subsidised industry, profitable along the Murray, but a heavier output to be sold in present export markets merely drags down the overall return to other dairymen including those struggling in marginal regions. The incredible thing about this is Mr Robinson-What authority was that?",123
87,Mr GRASSBY,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,What authority did the writer have? Mr Robinson-Who was the writer?,123
88,Mr GRASSBY,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"The writer in this instance was Mr Tom Connors who was writing in the 'Australian Financial Review'. I think Mr Connors was merely saying what many other people, particularly Professor Campbell, Dr Davidson and other critics of irrigation have said. He has merely followed all the efforts that have been made to limit national development. Mr Turnbull-Are you supporting that?",123
89,Mr GRASSBY,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"The honourable member for Mallee should know me better than to suggest that I have supported the critics of irrigation. I would expect to have the honourable member's support on these matters because it is only by way of efforts like this to question a situation, when there have been shadows, doubts, secrecy and inadequacies, that we can get something better. Let me make this position quite clear. I think that the honourable member for Mallee should stand in his place and say: ' I support the sound development of this nation. 1 call for all the reports and studies that need to be seen if we are to make proper determinations'. I do not want to proceed in secrecy. The honourable member should be saying this with me. If he does not, I am surprised and ashamed of him. Last night when we called for a cool, calm and proper economic analysis of the projects our appeal was categorised by Government supporters as sentimental slop. What stage have we reached when members of the national Parliament, in response to a call for proper examinations of data, describe it as sentimental slop? Surely to goodness they need to review their own position. By not proceeding in a sound way to a consideration of matters such as this, honourable members opposite are lending support to the critics of non-development; they are lending support to the people whom I would describe as little Australians because they are not interested in the wider development of the nation. They are quite content to concentrate themselves in suburbs and be bounded by the lamp post at the end of the street. Mr Turnbull-You have a city party there? You are the suburbs?",123
90,Mr GRASSBY,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"I point out that we are engaged in this debate because there was an unwholly mess made by the honourable member's administration. He is contradicted by members of his own party on this matter. I hope he faces up to them because they are wrong and he is right or vice versa. If he wishes to debate that matter, with your indulgence Mr Deputy Speaker, we will be delighted to oblige him. Mr Turnbull- I would be delighted to meet you anywhere, any time.",124
91,Mr GRASSBY,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"The honourable member is meeting me here now. He can follow me in the debate. I invite him to do so. I invite him also to say whether he is dedicated to a particular policy of inadequate analysis to which the Minister for National Development confessed in relation to the matters before us. He said that the matters had not been determined. He said he and his associates had not even made up their minds whether they could make use of the resources of the Murray for a further power station. He said that they had not made up their minds whether to spend $7m on Lake Victoria. He said they had not made up their minds whether they would proceed with anything further. They had not told us of course the real reasons why we spent $6m in umpteen years, left people suspended and then came along to 4 Governments and said: 'Look, we all make mistakes. It is all very sad, but forgive us. We will start again.' The Government is starting again. This is no way to run a country and it is no way to run a project, and to try to cover up the situation at the present time is just not good enough. It has to be brought out into the open. These critics of irrigation are simply trying to limit what we feel should be the balanced development of the nation. They are not dedicated to this at all. They have talked themselves into believing that the whole of our nation in the future should be a suburban collection. Strength will be given to that belief if we do not do the one sensible thing and ensure that every project that is brought to the national Parliament is properly evaluated, publicly discussed and publicly probed, and then we have all the data, including the inputs, before us. I do not know whether honourable members are aware that there is no magic in a cost benefit analysis. All that happens is that a whole series of arbitrary inputs are fed in and an answer is obtained. Let us be quite clear. There is no holy writ running through this. There is no reason at all why we should not as a nation and as a Parliament have all the relevant data, study it carefully, calmly and objectively, and say we believe this is valid or this is invalid according to the information we are able to get ourselves or according to our own knowledge. I am saying that the need for increased irrigation in this nation is linked with its ultimate destiny and development. If it is limited we will become a limited nation. But for a project to proceed properly and for it to be accepted by the great bulk of our people, who live in the cities and for whom we have a responsibility, we have to show that everything that has been planned and done is properly based. I make a plea that it be done in that way in the future and that what has happened on this occasion will never happen again.",124
92,Mr TURNBULL,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"Mallee) [12.43]- I will be very brief. I do not want to hold the House up. When the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Grassby) was speaking just DOW be made some statements regarding critics of irrigation. I put the simple question to him: 'Do you support this?' The answer I expected was: 'No, I do not support it.' Instead of this, he made a personal attack on me.",124
93,Mr FOSTER,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,He did not.,125
94,Mr TURNBULL,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,Of course he did. The honourable member can read Hansard. The honourable member for Riverina made a personal attack on me.,125
95,Mr FOSTER,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,The honourable member always comes off second best.,125
96,Mr TURNBULL,DARTMOUTH RESERVOIR,"No , I do not. I shall always resist in this House these personal attacks.
