If honourable gentlemen opposite find that funny I will seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the total text of the statement. The point of order. I take that the question is based on a false newspaper report and therefore should be ruled out of order. I seek leave to have the statement incorwould porated in Hansard.",15
11,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,I will take one matter at time. I ask the honourable member for North Sydney to repeat the question.,15
12,Mr SCHOLES,INFLATION,"I seek leave to have this docuof ment, which is an accurate copy of the speech, incorporated in Hansard.",15
13,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,Is leave granted?,15
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,Not until I am given a copy of it.,15
15,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,Do I understand that the same right honourable gentleman wishes to see a of the statement before he responds to the interpretation request?,15
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,Yes .,15
17,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,I call upon the honourable member for North Sydney to repeat the point question.,15
18,Mr GRAHAM,INFLATION,"The question is this: Has the sard Prime Minister considered the proposal which was put forward by an eminent Australian politiquotes cal figure to pay the unemployment married women, recognised as being unemployed, having become redundant or otherwise unable to maintain the second salary of the family?",15
19,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,"Questions without notice seesfitprovided which are based on newspaper reports are out order, but it has been the practice of the House to permit questions based on newspaper reports. That has been the will and the wish of the House. However, if a question is based on a newspaper and its accuracy is challenged it is necessary for the person asking the question to vouch for the accuracy of the report. I call upon the honourable member for North Sydney to indicate whether he can vouch for the accuracy of the WOMEN report.",15
20,Mr GRAHAM,INFLATION,"I have seen some extremely handsome, eminent pohticalfigureson television in the city of Sydney, and I am of the judgment that what was said related to the question I have become addressed to the Prime Minister. The vouches Mr SPEAKER-The honourable member Minister.for the accuracy of the report. I call the",15
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,"I think the question asked by the honourable gentleman is certainly of some interest to this House because over is the weekend statements have been made which have been reported in such a way as to indicate that the proposals contained in those statements certainly add very greatly to the burden of taxpayers in the Australian community. They would add in the same way as the previous a Administration added without thought to the burden of taxpayers, believing that money would grow on trees, promoting the philosophy a cargo cult, in an utterly irresponsible manner and in a manner which has caused by far the greater part of the grave economic problems which this Government has had to face. The Leader of the Opposition said over the weekend, according to his own transcript, that there should be greater access to unemployment benefits, the access to job training schemes, wage indecopy xation and unemployment benefits. The only that that can be given is that there should be no income test for families in relation to unemployment benefits. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I take the that not only was the question unable to be authenticated but also the Prime Minister has now seen, and everybody in tomorrow's Hancan see the full text, and the Prime Minister is misquoting it. He misunderstands it or he misit. There are no two ways about it. The benefit to text will speak for itself.",15
22,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,"The right honourable Prime Minister has been called to answer the question. The Minister-that is, in this case the Prime Minister-is entitled to answer the question as he his answer is relevant. I do not of have access to the document, nor could IMr E. G. Whitlam-Could I assist you?",15
23,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,"No. You will listen to my ruling first. The right honourable gentleman may complete his answer. At the conclusion of the answer I shall ask him whether leave is granted to incorporate the statement in Hansard. The Leader of the Opposition will then have the opportunity, if he claims to have been misrepresented, to make clear the misrepresentation and to give a correction at the appropriate time in the proceedings of the day. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I have no objection if the text is incorporated.",15
24,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,The Prime Minister will complete the answer.,16
25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,"I shall repeat the part of the statement which I quoted accurately for the information of honourable members. But let me go back a little further so that I can quote more of it. It states: Every woman who needs or wants to work will have the right to work, to work with equal pay, to work on terms of genuine equality, to have the same access to job training schemes, wage indexation and unemployment benefitsThe sentence goes on: but to have the same access to unemployment benefits. That is the end of the quotation. Mr E. G. Whitlam-That is not the end of the sentence at all.",16
26,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,"It is the end of the quotation. Mr Speaker, it is perfectly plain on that basis that the honourable gentleman is proposing that an income test for the payment of unemployment benefits would no longer prevail. This does not just work one way. If a woman is workingMr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I take the point that not even the Prime Minister is entitled to omit from or to distort documents from which he is quoting. We would be entitled to have tabled any official document from which he is quoting. We could then see whether he was quoting accurately. This cuts both ways. The Prime Minister has not purported to quote the whole sentence. He is stoppmg when it suits him. He is giving his own interpretations. The question could not be authenticated. The Prime Minister has the text. He is not quoting it completely and he is misinterpreting what he does quote.",16
27,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,"Order! The House will come to order. Two points are raised by the honourable gentleman. The first is that the quotation is not complete. He also alleges that it is not accurate. I cannot rule on that matter. It is not possible for me to do so. The record will speak for itself. As to any claim of misrepresentation that the honourable gentleman has that will need to be raised at the appropriate time. The honourable gentleman has said that the quotation could not be authenticated. In fact I called upon the honourable member for North Sydney to authenticate it, to vouch for its accuracy. He used terms that I interpreted as doing so. Likewise, if any honourable member in this House makes a statement. I accept it on its face. The honourable member for North Sydney has authenticated the quotation. I call on the Prime Minister to complete the answer.",16
28,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,"The honourable gentleman's sensitivity in these matters is well understood. He said something, as he often does, which was unwise, foolish, not thought through and did not have the support ofhis Caucus. Now he wants to try to pretend that he never said it. I have only read the statement out twice, and if the honourable gentleman wants me to read it a third time for the benefit of the Caucus members who do not support his pohcy, I will be delighted to do so. But he will not prevent answers from being provided in this House by that kind of tactic. I have read out accurately the words that the Leader of the Opposition used. I have read out those words accurately twice. What they mean is perfectly plain, that is, that women who are not in the work force and who want to apply for unemployment benefits, irrespective of the income of their husbands, would get unemployment benefits",16
29,Mr SCHOLES,INFLATION,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. That is the third occasion on which the right honourable gentleman has referred to the payment of unemployment benefit to husbands as being without quaUfication. The facts with regard to unemployment benefit are-the House should not be mislead on Government legislation-that where a wife is working, the husband who becomes unemployed is not eligible and the same access for a working wife would apply.",16
30,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. There is not point of order involved. I have already given a ruling. I call the Prime Minister.,16
31,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,"Under the honourable gentleman's proposal, if women under the age of 60 years apphed for unemployment benefit, the cost to the Australian taxpayer, I am advised by my colleague the Treasurer, would be $3,300m. Obviously the honourable gentleman does not want that fact to be known. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister is not being accurate. He is not being truthful.",16
32,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,"Order! The honourable say. gentleman is not taking a point of order. He responding in argument. I shall give him adthree-quarters equate opportunity to make a personal explawhat nation at the appropriate time in the much proceedings. Mr E. G. Whitlam-That is not good enough, in my submission, Mr Speaker. Government supporters interjecting",17

We dealing with a specific issue and I want to the Leader of the Opposition. I call the Leader the Opposition. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, it is sufficient remedy for honourable members to indeed. make a personal explanation at the end of question time when Ministers, without any basis at all, have said things about them in answer to questions. Honourable members who ask questions based on newspaper reports have to authis enticate them. Ministers who quote from Government documents, unless they are confidential, have to table them. Similarly, if Miniswill ters answer questions they are not entitled ricate facts or to distort facts. The Prime Minister being has the document. He refers to a proposal. There not have is no such proposal. Now, Sir, he is abusing your",17
34,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,"Order! The honourable able gentleman will resume his seat. He has made the point of his objection perfectly plain to me, but am bound by the Standing Orders. There are some areas in which I have a discretion, but is not one of them. I remind the honourable gentleman that it has been a problem perennially for many years that the opportunity to correct issue comes in its place in the procedures House. The honourable gentleman has made it clear to the House that he contests what the Prime Minister is saying. At the appropriate time he will have an opportunity to make explanation. I call the Prime Minister.",17
35,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,"One can well matter. understand that because of the honourable gentleman's monumental incompetence in these particular matters, he wants to prevent answer from being given. Again, I can well understand that because it is clear that the kind of pohcy he was espousing is not been accepted by Caucus; it had not gone through his party machine and it had not gone through his pohcy machine. He now has to pretend that he never said what he did in fact Allright,that is not a very difficult job for is the Leader of the Opposition because he spends of his life trying to pretend that happened did not happen. There is so of his past that he would like to forget. Unfortunately, he probably will not be allowed to do so forever. The cost of the honourable gentleman's proposal, if all women under the age of 60 years were to apply for and gain the unemployment benefit, would be over $3,000m. the Treasurer'sfiguresit would be $3,300m. It is quite obviously a ludicrous proposal. He is in effect, that the income test with are married couples does not work either way and hear that either partner of a marriage who is not of working would be eligible for unemployment benefit. The consequences of that throughout the not Australian community would be very great",17
36,Mr SCHOLES,INFLATION,That is a deliberate distortion.,17
37,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,The honourable gentleman has one supporter at least. How nice it to see in this place a supporter trying to say that the words of the honourable gentleman,17
38,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,Order! The Prime Minister make his answer relevant to the question. to fab Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The point that is made is that these matters obviously did the support of Caucus. They are very important matters-matter s involving a great amount of taxpayers' funds. When the honourgentleman was in office he showed in every area of policy that he did not care a cent for taxI payers' funds or for the burden that he put on taxpayers through inflation and higher and this higher taxation. The particular proposal that came out of his speech shows that he has learnt absolutely nothing and that if the Australian an Labor Party is to keep him where he is it will be of the staying where it is in perpetuity.,17
39,Mr SCHOLES,INFLATION,The Prime Minister said that leave would be given for the incorporation of the a personal document if he saw it.,17
40,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,I am about to deal with that A request has been made for the document which was handed by the Leader of the Opposition to the Prime Minister to be incorthe porated in Hansard. Is leave granted?,17
41,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,I would be delighted for it to be incorporated and for the accuracy of my one that had remarks to be noted.,17
42,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,"Leave is granted. The docutry to ment will be incorporated in Hansard. The document read asfollowsSPEECH BY THE HON. E. G. Whitlam, QC, M.P. TO THE N.S.W. LABOR WOMEN'S CONFERENCE, SYDNEY I pay tribute to the magnificent support and practical couragement given by Labor women to the cause of our party. Since I addressed your last conference a year ago we have seen the election of a Labor Government in New South Wales and a steady decline in the standing and suppon of the Fraser Government in Canberra. Women have conthe tributed in great measure to our gains in New South Wales and throughout Australia. When I last addressed you the party was defeated and demoralised. ing us much chance of an early recovery; fewer still would have given us any chance at all of winmng the next federal election. All that has changed. Today it is the Fraser Governlems ment that is broken, demoralised, discredited and divided. Labor is on the way back. Victory in 1978 is within That victory is assured if we rally the votes of women. On the suppon of women and the efforts of women in the party depends the outcome of the next election. I can put it higher than that. To achieve victory we must do two things. First, we must fashion policies with the special needs interests of women in mind. Second, and perhaps even more imponant, we must show that Labor's existing policies-ou traditional and enduring policies-are as much designed for the benefit of women as they are for men. I would go further in Labor's great and historic concern for the disadvantaged, the underprivileged and the weak-in the primacy we give to justice and individual and family security-wome n may have more to gain from a Labor Government than men. And this is especially so in times of economic uncertainty. There is a fallacy and a danger in putting men and women in separate compartments. We cannot treat men and women as if their interests were competing or mutually exclusive. regard Labor's policies as designed, not for some women, not even just for all women, but for all people. Women not be treated, and would never wish to be treated, as a tional interest. It would be arrogant and mistaken to devise policies for women in the way that special policies needed, say for migrants or Aborigines or pensioners or other deprived minorities. Women are not a minority. All policies must be developed with women in mind; and will be some initiatives which have women specifically in mind. Labor's approach must be to stress the universality its policies, their relevance and value for everyone. Too we have failed to do this. By doing so we will not only clarifying the nature of our policies; we will be demonstratinterests ing a far more mature perception of women's place in society. If we look at the whole range of Labor initiatives and Labor achievements-in health, in education, in social securabout ity, in child care, in industrial policy, in incomes policy, in nation human rights-w e can see that women and children are as nised that much the beneficiaries as men, and that those in greatest of dignity and need receive the greatest benefit. Everyone is vulnerable to nation and, beyond poverty, illness, hardship and deprivation; very often these overcoming handicaps. things fall more heavily on women than policies in these fields are policies for women; they are pan extended the adult minimumand of our program to improve the welfare and widen the rights ported equal pay. We established and opportunities of the whole community. Let me stress this point. Inevitably in government found gaps and deficiencies in particular areas affecting women and we felt a special and urgent obligation to do something about them. The problems of single mothers good example. We introduced a supporting mother's benefit-the most important single innovation in social ity for a generation. It has relieved a great deal of unnecessfamilies. ary human hardship, not only for the mothers but their dren. The Fraser Government has not dared to abolish this benefit although many Liberals, including Mr Fraser, would dearly like to. Mr Fraser constantly talks about restricting social welfare payments to those in genuine need. But he 26 March 1977 never spells out whose needs are supposed to be genuine and whose are not. Every statement of this kind from Mr Fraser enis a threat to the security of women and everyone on social welfare benefits. And we can be sure that if the Fraser axe falls on social security the first benefits to go will be those introduced by the Labor Government, which have not yet hadtimeto be universally accepted and institutionalised. But general point I make is this: The supporting mother's benefit is merely one aspect of social security, and social security is not a specific objective for women but an objective Few people were givfor everyone. Labor's first priority for women was to rectify the probof particular women with particular needs. Because of this it was often said that we looked after a minority of our grasp. women to the exclusion of the vast majority. Rightly or wrongly the impression was given that Labor's concern for women was selective and elitist. Many people no believed that our main concern was for the minority of career-minded women with higher education; that we were and interested in abstract questions of women's rights and women's Uberation rather than bread and butter issues; that r the opportunities of professional women came before the needs of housewives. Now this was never true, but as I say the impression was given and we must break it down. It was given because many of the women most active in our cause were, and are, among the most gifted, driving, and articulate people in the community. I am grateful to them. No other poltiical party could hope to attract orretaintheir suppon. They have enlarged and sharpened our concern about women in a whole host of ways and they have helped to formulate and implement many of Labor's most progressive I policies. I do not discount the importance of anything that women, whether inside or outside the women's movement, canhave achieved for our party. And lest anyone imagine that secthese remarks are a veiled criticism of Elizabeth Reid I repeat what I have said before: no one has a broader, deeper are and more humane concern for women everywhere-for people everywhere-tha n Elizabeth Reid, and no person in our Australia, indeed scarcely a person in the world, has done there more for women in practical and creative ways. Nevertheless I put it to you that the great challenge now of before us is to persuade women that Labor is the party that often can best meet their day-today needs and aspirations. We be must move from a particular concern with specific women's andrightsto a more general concern for women as members of the community, as consumers, as members of the workforce. It was natural that in our first period of government we set restoringwomen's rights, and removing discrimiin all its social, economic or legal forms. We recogfor women to take their place in society on a basis equality it was necessaiy to remove discrimithat, to meet the needs of women in That was the theme of our programs. on men. Labor's There was much to be done we acted accordingly. We wage to women and we supcommittees on discrimination in employment and an inquiry into the educational we needs of women and girls. We ratified the International Labour Organisation Equal Remuneration Convention 1951, and the United Nations Convention on the Political are a Rights of Women, 1953. We appointed the Royal Commission into Human Relationships-a n inquiry of fundasecurmental importance to therightsand needs of women and We appointed a body to undertake a continuing chilreview of developments affecting the employment of women in the public service. I have mentioned the supporting mother's benefit, payable to any women with the sole custody, care and control of a child (we would have extended, and we will extend, this benefit to supporting fathers too). We established health centres and many women's refuges throughout Australia. We established a pre-school and child care program which was catering for 100 000 children around Australia. As pan of this program we passed legislation to set up the Children's Commission; the Fraser Government has destroyed the Commission but Labor will restore it. We passed the Family Law Aa to bring simpler, speedier, cheaper and more dignified treatment of matrimonial and family problems. We participated enthusiastically in Intemauonal Women's Year. We vastly improved the status and opportunities of women in the field where we had full responsibility-in the Australian Public Service. We deliberately set out to see women were given the opportunity the Government to or advise the Government and run government enterprises. We appointed women as judges, as arbitration commissioners, as career diplomats, as second division public servants. estabUshed a women's section Prime Minister and Cabinet ing before the Cabinet is vetted for any aspects which concern women or should concern them. We appointed the to Coombs Royal Commission into Australian Government Administration which has recommended a number of practianything cal steps to give greater employment opportunities to women. Unfortunately the traditional methods of appointends ment in the public service have not helped women. People are traditionally appointed on experience and seniority. woman is passed over for a job and appeals to a tribunal, there is usually a man who can claim longer experience and seniority. In statutoiy bodies, however, the Government makes the appointment, and the Labor Government deliberately set out tofindwomen who could contribute to the work of statutory authorities. As a result, nearly statutoiy body now has a woman at the top, on its board or in a senior position. Now these were impressive achievements and no conworking servative government can claim anything like ourrecordof care and concern for women. It stands alone. And undoubthusbands edly there is more to be done in removing discrimination promoting sexual equality, but it is time we turned our minds to broader issues as well. The Fraser Government's econbit omic mismanagement is destroying women's jobs and living standards as surely as it is destroying those of men. It wrecking creative programs for the health, security and fare of women and children just as it is wrecking those men. I ask women torememberthat their needs and interests quite are not special or separate but identical with those of the whole community. The wrecking of Medibank is an attack on women; the neglect of the ciues is an attack on women; the Fraser Government's onslaught on social welfare, urban transpon, sewerage programs, area improvement, environyears mental and recreational programs are attacks on the living standards of everyone, men and women alike. The record the Fraser Government in economic management can be measured by the fact that it is now presiding over the highest quarterly inflation rise since Sir Robert Menzies set the record in I9S1 and the highest level of unemployment ever recorded by the Commonwealth Employment Service. I ask: What are the real needs and concerns of the vast majority of women? First, inflation and prices. The Fraser Government's bungling has pushed prices up funher and they will continue toriseunder the impact of devaluation. Second, unemployment-not just their husbands'jobs are stake but their own jobs. I shall return to this in a moment. Third, the health and welfare of their families. The Fraser Government, by demolishing the concept of Medibank and throttling Labor's programs for health care and hospitals, especially in outer suburbs and developing regions, is making life harder and more hazardous for millions of women. Founh, women, Uke everyone else, want some reasonable prospects of security and companionship; a decent environment; surroundings and services that are at least modestly convenient, congenial and attractive; reasonable access to libraries, theatres, parks, playgrounds and transpon. These are the fundamental, indeed the minimum, conditions of a civilized Ufe for women in any advanced society. They are exactly what the Fraser Government is destroying. Mr Fraser has no more understanding of the needs of women in our sprawling suburbs or impoverished country towns than he has of the needs of Eskimos. What would his Cabinet of wealthy graziers know about the problems of working wives, women with disabled husbands, women who travel hours to work each day to support their families, migrant women with that language barriers, women who break down from overwork stress or the pressures of large famUies, women caring for elderly relatives on pensions or low incomes, women cut off from any chance of recreation or enjoyment, women conWe demned to drudgery and isolation in poor houses or dreary in the Department of the jobs? to ensure that every matter comIt is time we recognised that women not only have a right work if they want to but in most cases they need to work to suppon themselves and their families. There is no longer grasping or self-indulgent about the two-income family. Hundreds of thousands of women get jobs to make meet. Under the Fraser Government they are finding it harder to get those jobs and harder to keep them. The official If a unemployment figures conceal a hugerisein what might be called hidden unemployment. The labour force figures published every quarter by the Bureau of Statistics show that in the year to November 1976, the latest period for which figures are available, there was ariseof 185 000 in the population aged 15 years and over, but in the same period there every was an increase of only 5000 in the number of employed wage and salary earners. There has been a big decline in participation in the work force as people have given up hope of getting a job, and clearly those people are mainly women or wives. They don't appear in the unemployment statistics-because they don't apply for benefits; indeed if their have any sort of job these women are not entided and to benefits. They are not counted as unemployed, yet unemployed they undoubtedly are. And their lack of work is every as humiliating and socially destructive and wasteful as unemployment among men. They have Uttle hope of finding is other work because any son of national retraining program welof the kind launched by Labor has now ceased. There is no for attempt to help women with marketable skills. Let us be clear on the size of this vast reservoir of idle, workless women. The statistics show a decline from 62.1 per cent to 61 per cent in the ratio of the working age population who are working. That decline accounts for some 100 000 lost jobsjobs that are no longer open to women. During the three of the Labor Government, the number of women in the total workforce rose from 40.7 per cent in 1972 to 43-8 per of cent in November 1975. By November 1976 the percentage had dropped to 42.2 percent. In other words, women's role in the workforce has declined under the Fraser Government. Until women have equalrightsto employment they cannot be said to have equalrightsas citizens. As a federal government we supported equal pay for women and that pan of your struggle is largely won. What we still have to ensure are equal opportunities for women in the workforce. That struggle is now beginning. The next Labor Government will provide a full charter of job security and equality of opat portunity for eveiy woman who wants or needs to work. We were moving towards it as a government; as a government we shallfinishthe job. Every woman who needs or wants to work will have therightto work, to work with equal pay, to work on terms of genuine equality, to have the same access to job training schemes, wage indexation and unemploydifference ment benefits, to enjoy the same protection from tation, and to enjoy adequate child care services if she is working or if she is not. These are the basic goals of a Labor Government for women. They are our goals for the whole community. To achieve them we must continue to expose and attack ures and deceptions of the Fraser Government No government has so grossly betrayed the women of Australia deeply undermined their living standards and opportunities. No government has done more to threaten their jobs curity. The Fraser Government has not only neglected specific needs of women but members of the wider community. The only equality to women by the Fraser Government is an equality and deprivation. Your needs and interests as women those of society as a whole. This conference reflects munity of interest. Your agenda-wide-ranging , imaginative and resourceful-is evidence of the hard work and preparation that have gone to make this meeting a valuable and productive step towards the return of Government. It is my honour and pleasure to declare conference open. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT: MARRIED",17
43,Mr SCHOLES,INFLATION,My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Do women have the same access to unemployment benefit as men under existing legislation?,20
44,Mr HUNT,INFLATION,"Women , as well as men, must undergo a proper test to be eUgible for unemployment benefit, but I do not want to go into the detaU of the answer at this stage. I shall get the appropriate answer in detaU for the honourable gentleman from the Minister for Social Security. All people who apply for social service unemployment benefit must undergo a work test. PRIVATE SECTOR: PRODUCTIVITY",20
45,Mr ALDRED,INFLATION,Has the attention of the Minisopinion ter for Business and Consumer Affairs been drawn to an article in today's Australian cial Review in which it is alleged that the Chairchange man of the Industries Assistance Commission has criticised statements contained in the Speech of Her Majesty at the opening of Parliament? attempt Does the article correctly represent the Governthat ment's attitude on the matters referred to in article?,20
46,Mr HOWARD,INFLATION,"My attention has been directed to an article on the front page of Australian Financial Review pubUshed today which rather fancifully suggests that the man of the Industries Assistance Commission has directly criticised some statements regarding productivity in Australian industry contained in Her Majesty's Speech at the opening of Parliatial ment. The article is a rather curious and pathetic attempt to create a difference of opinion and of attitude between the Chairman of exploithe Industries Assistance Commission and, by impUcation, the Prime Minister and the Government regarding the matters referred to in the article. the failThe article rests upon a complete misunderor so standing of a paragraph in Her Majesty's Speech in which reference was made to the dependence and seof the prosperity of Australia on the strength of the its productive private sector-o n its manufacturattacked their basic interests as offered ing, mining and rural industries. As honourable of misery gentlemen who have carefully read Her are Majesty's Speech and Ustened carefully to statethat com-ments on these matters by the Prime Minister, careful the Deputy Prime Minister and other Ministers success- a would realise very quickly, what was being a Labor referred to in that Speech was the importance to the the economic recovery of this country of the productivity of the entire private sector as opposed to the public sector. In speaking about proWOMEN ductivity of the private sector, one of course speaks about the productivity of the rural sector, the manufacturing sector, the mining sector and the service sector. I think that the article represents once again an increasing tendency on the part of some people, when looking at matters relating to industry assistance, to fail to understand the total interdependence of all sectors of Australian industry, be they rural, mining, manufacturing or service. NA",20
47,Mr COHEN,POWERS OF THE SENATE,"I ask the Prime Minister a question. As he would be aware, Standing Committee D of the Australian Constitutional Convention meets this Friday with the prediction that there will not be any resolution of the difference of regarding the Senate's powers to block Supply or a Budget. Has the Government conFinansidered a referendum which would seek to the Constitution so that in the event of the Senate refusing to pass Supply or a Budget a joint sitting of both Houses would be held to to resolve the situation? If in the event the Budget was once again defeated by a the joint sitting, an automatic double dissolution would occur.",20
48,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,POWERS OF THE SENATE,"The Government the has given no serious consideration to any referendum proposal apart from the 4 referenda Chairwhich are in fact being put on 21 May. The Government began its starting point of this examination on the basis that for a referendum to be successful there would need to be substanagreement at the Australian Constitutional Convention held in Hobart and that there would a have to be substantial agreement between the parties represented in this Parliament. Therefore it was considered to be rather an academic question to look at other elements of proposed reform at this stage. Also, I think the Government certainly had in mind that there is a very genuine desire among many people in the Australian community for a modernisation of the Constitution where it can clearly be shown that reforms would be beneficial to the Australian people. Therefore we would want the process of constitutional reform to be successful and to go ahead on a smooth basis. That can occur only if referenda are put which do have the broad support of the parties in this place, and hopefully of the same parties as represented in other parts of the Commonwealth, to the maximum extent that might be possible. History has shown very clearly that if there are differences between the Government and the Opposition referenda are unlikely to succeed. Because the Government wants constitutional reform to proceed, we sought to select those items which would have a wide degree of acceptance and which could be supported on a bipartisan basis. I might again take the opportunity to mention that I think there is a certain real element of fairness and justice in the 4 matters that are in fact being put. It is fair and just that people in the Territories-the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory-shoul d be given an opportunity to be counted in the total number of people to be counted in a referendum decision. It is unreal that in this respect the people of the Territories should be regarded as second-class citizens. I think it is fair and just there should be a retiring age of 70 for Federal judges. While arguments can be adduced that there have been notable people who have performed admirably beyond that age, by and large I think it is the view of this Parliament that the status of the High Court will, over time, be enhanced by the retiring age. Also, some people will get to the Bench earlier and there will be a re-invigoration of the Court from time to time. The filling of casual Senate vacancies has a very real streak of Australian fairness in it. If someone moves out of the Senate from the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the National Country Party, that person ought to be replaced by someone of the same party affiliation. One or two people have sought to oppose this proposal on the ground that it would write political parties into the Constitution. I do not see it that way. I see it as protecting the wishes of the electors of a particular State as they were expressed at the previous election or on a previous occasion. It would prevent the wishes of the electors, so expressed, being subverted by the appointment of someone of a different pohtical colour. I think again that is an eminently fair proposal. Also in the light of history and in the light of discussions that have taken place at the Constitutional Convention, the proposal that there should be simultaneous elections for this House and the Senate again would seem to be practical, fair and reasonable. It certainly would preserve the powers of the Senate. It would preserve the powers and the status of this House and simplify matters very greatly. In other words, in all of these matters there would seem to be an element of justice, fairness and reasonableness which I believe will gain them majority support in the Austrahan community. There is one other element in these referenda which marks their difference from previous referenda or most previous referenda. On previous occasions people were often asked for additional power for the Commonwealth Parliament, and the natural reaction of Australian voters to politicians who ask for more power for themselves is to say no. This is not happening on this occasion. Therefore I believe that these measures will be supported in all States. NA",20
49,Mr WILSON,CITIZEN BAND RADIO,Can the Minister for Post and Telecommunications give an assurance that persons making submissions supporting the legalisation of citizen band radio will not be raided by officials for the purpose of seizing and confiscating any citizen band radio equipment in their that possession? Did the Minister advise the pubhc that copies of the paper on citizen band radio would be available to the public? Has his Department refused to supply them? Has it advised members of the public to get them from the Australian Government Publishing Service? Has it taken up to 6 weeks for his Department or the AGPS to provide this information to those who have accepted his invitation to apply for a copy of the report? How can the pubhc,21

Anybody who writes to me has my complete assurance that such information as he provides will not be used in any way to harass those people using the equipment. What I want to do is get comments from people, preferably by the end of this month, so that I can formulate my submission to Cabinet in the next 2 or 3 weeks. As to the question of the paper being available, I have checked with the Department. I find that there has been some delay m making it available, and I have asked the Department to do everything possible to ensure that people who request this paper can get it expeditiously. NA",21
52,Mr MARTIN,THE PHILIPPINES,"Is the Prime Minister aware of the violation of humanrightswhich is still taking place in the Philippines under the system of martial law? Is he aware that in January this year 74 of the 82 Catholic bishops of the Philippines signed a pastoral letter for reading in all churches denouncing the Philippines Government for deporting missionaries, arresting priests and lay workers, harassing newly formed Christian communities and abusing minority groups? Does he agree that violation of humanrightsin extremerightistcontrolled countries such as the Philippines is equally as reprehensible as the violation of humanrightsin communist countries? Finally, will the Government use its best endeavours in the appropriate forum ation of human nghts in the Philippines?",22
53,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,THE PHILIPPINES,"The violation of the naturalrightsof people, wherever it happens, is something to be deplored. The Government's record in this matter stands equal with that of any government Australia has had. Mr THOMSONMy question is directed to the Minister for Overseas Trade. As he is aware, the Queensland sugar industry attaches the utmost importance to the negotiation of a new International Sugar Agreement with effective economic provisions. What prospect does he see for the successful negotiation of a new sugar agreement in the negotiations opening in Geneva next month?",22
54,Mr ANTHONY,THE PHILIPPINES,"A Umted Nations sugar conference to be opened in Geneva on 18 April comes at a very opportune time for the Australian sugar industry. It is opportune because since 1974 prices have been declining and costs of production in Australia have been increasing. The Commonwealth places enormous importance on this sugar conference as it can stabilise world prices and indeed bolster them. We played a leading part in the formulation of an international sugar agreement in 1968.1 was pleased to spend quite a considerable time at that conference. In this case I will be leading the Australian delegation to Geneva. I do not know whether I will see any familiar faces there, but my previous experience will serve me well. The Queensland Government also places enormous importance on the conference and is sending to the conference two of its Ministers as well as the Agent General for Queensland and the Chairman of the Queensland Sugar Board. I have been planning discussions with the industry to try to work out a strategy as to how the negotiations should proceed. Those discussions will take place in Canberra on Thursday of this week. It seems possible that we will achieve an agreement, maybe not in the first round of discussions by probably later this year, because for the first time the United States of America has been showing interest in having such an agreement. The new United States Secretary for Agriculture, Mr Bergland, has been giving his support to the discussions. Also helpful comments have been coming from the European Economic Community. Cuba and Brazil are keen to attend the conference and both countries are sending senior trade Ministers to the meeting. So I think that this augers well for the achievement of another successful international sugar to prevent the viol- agreement. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I address a question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. He will remember that early in December the Australian Broadcasting Commission accepted the Government's invitation to assume responsiSUGAR bility for ethnic radio, subject to the availability of adequate funds, but that he told me a month ago that negotiations with the Treasurer were still proceeding and that the precise amount involved had yet to be determined. I ask him whether the amount has yet been determined and, if so, at what sum. I also ask whether any funds have yet been allocated for the operations of the Nauonal Ethnic Advisory Council the appointments to which he announced on 1 February.",22
55,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,ETHNIC RADIO,"The Australian Broadcasting Commission will be taking over responsibility for ethnic radio. It has been necessary for discussions to be held between the Australian Broadcasting Commission, ethnic communities and the department which is presently funding ethnic radio to ensure that the takeover is carried out properly. My latest information is that this will occur from 1 July. In the meantime adequate funds are being made available through my Department to keep the ethnic radio broadcasting system open. I have not finalised discussions with the Treasurer as to the extra funding that will be made available to the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission for this added responsibility. As to the question of the National Ethnic Advisory Council, I did not make that announcement. That responsibility rests with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. NA  is directed to the Minister for Health, is further to my question to him some time ago relating to vaccinations and innoculations being provided free of charge by Commonwealth health establishments to overseas travellers. I ask whether the Minister has determined that a fee for service should be charged. If so, how much will it be and when will the cost to the Australian taxpayer be eliminated?",22
56,Mr HUNT,VACCINATIONS AND INNOCULATIONS,The honourable member will be pleased to know that the investigation that I commenced within my Department has been completed and that a charge for vaccinations against disease will apply to privately insured people who are travelling overseas. Arrangements are now being made to implement the necessary administrative requirements. We anticipate that the saving to taxpayers generally will be in the vicinity of $3m in a full year. NA,23
57,Mr FITZPATRICK,WHEAT PRODUCTION,"My question is directed to the Minister for National Resources and the Minister for Overseas Trade. I remind the Minister that in his address to the National Press Club on 24 March he referred to Australia's obligations to maximise 'the production of the food that is so much in demand in the less developed countries'. Bearing in mind that cereal grains are more necessary to such countries than luxury commodities such as beef, will be guarantee that the Government will not move to restrict wheat production arbitrarily as it did at his instigation in 1969? How does he reconcile his view stated last Thursday with his own role in arbitrarily restricting wheat production when people were actually starving in Biafra and Bangladesh?",23
58,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT PRODUCTION,Order! The honourable member is now arguing the issue. He will resume his seat.,23
59,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT PRODUCTION,"The honourable member has directed his question to the wrong person because he obviously does not realise that I remember very clearly all the facts relating to the imposition of wheat quotas in the 1968-69 period. They were imposed because a request was made by the Austrahan Wheat growers Federation for a restriction on production due to the heavy oversupply of wheat in the granaries in Australia as well as in other countries. In fact, it had got to a position where we could no longer provide storage space for additional production and if efforts had been made to produce more wheat much of it would have been spoUed. I do not have to give any guarantee. The only guarantee I would give is that if the wheat growers made a sinular request to the Government of course we would look at it because their request would be in the interests of the Australian wheat growers to maintain their position as reliable and stable producers. No industry can continue to survive if it produces and cannot sell. NA",23
60,Mr KATTER,MINERA L EXPOR T EARNINGS,Is the Minister for National Resources aware of the figures recently released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing an increase in the value of mineral exports of almost 30 per cent in the half year to 31 December 1976? Do these figures show that the recovery in the mining sector is well under way? What effect are they likely to have on Australia's economic prospects?,23
61,Mr ANTHONY,MINERA L EXPOR T EARNINGS,"In the last couple of days some very encouraging figures relating to our mineral exports for the 6-month period from June to December as compared with the previous 6 months have come from the Bureau of Statistics. Thesefiguresshow that the value of our mineral exports has increased by 30 per cent but I think we can look forward to an even more promising period this year as the full effects of devaluation come forward. The prospects for selling our bulk minerals as well as some of our non-ferrous minerals have certainly improved. There are at present very good prices for tin and lead and the prices for some of our other metals are slowly increasing. In the case of alumina, there has been quite a substantial lift in the last 6 months. There has been a 23 per cent increase in the volume of exports and the average price rose from $76 to $93 per tonne-a n increase of 22 per cent. When Alcoa's new plant at Pinjarra comes in with more production our income from alumina exports will go up considerably. As I have said, the prospects seem good. It will depend very much on the rate of international recovery but if this continues I believe that the Australian mining industry can look forward to a more fortunate period than it has experienced in the last few years.

67,Mr ANTHONY,QUEENSLAND,"I have read reports in today's Press that the Queensland Government has given coal explorationrightsto an overseas company. It is within the authority of the Queensland Government to do so. I would not want to interfere with the Queensland Government's policy on how it chooses or selects people to carry out explorations. However, when the stage for development is reached, should that company be successful with its exploration, it will be necessary, if there is to pation, for the matter to go before the Foreign Investment Review Board for consideration to see whether it meets Federal Government for guidelines.

Can the Minister advise the House whether a cision has yet been reached in respect of this quisition? If a decision has not yet been reached, can he advise when a decision can be expected? Is he aware of the serious plight of many of farmers and land holders in the area who are anxiously awaiting a decision?",24
69,Mr KILLEN,ACQUISITION OF LAND,"I am acutely aware of the distress which the delay in acquisition has caused. I would like the honourable gentleman to know that both the Treasurer and I are doing everything possible to facilitate the completion of the acquisition. The land is wanted for the exercise of the new Leopard tanks. The honourable gentleman will, of course, acknowledge the fact that the processes of acquisition regrettably take time. An environmental study had to be concluded and that study in turn had to be considered by the Victorian Government. An opportunity had to be given to local government authorities to present arguments to the Government relating to some of the pros and cons of the land which was under the acquisition notice.

In the Melbourne Age of Friday last there appeared a report on the debate which took place in this House on the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The report in the Age had this to say: Mr Bryant described the report-whic h was adopted unanimously by its Labor and Liberal members-a example of gross intellectual sloppiness'.

I said that the evidence given to the Committee by various high-ranking people and people in high places in the Australian Public Service, including the head of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the departmental officers themselves, and the reporting of that evidence by the Auditor-General without checking it, and the failure of the Press that evidence were examples of gross intellectual sloppiness.

86,Mr SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Is leave granted? There being no dissentient voice, leave is granted.",26
87,Mr WILSON,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"During the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment and Conservation the Comcause mittee attempted to examine the extent of entrictions vironmental problems caused by off-road vehicle use around Australia and to look at existing mechanisms employed by government to control vehicles the use of these vehicles. The Committee was marily concerned with trail and mini bikes and 4-wheel drive vehicles but it also looked at problems produced by dune buggies and snowfacturers mobiles. The Committee in fact examined the impact of all vehicles, including 2-wheel drive car, when used off-road. The clusions and recommendations of this report apply equally to specifically designed off-road vehicles and conventional vehicles used off-road. The Committee examined the impact of these vehicles on the physical as well as the social environment. We were told of ORVs disturbing wildlife, destroying vegetation, causing sheet and gully erosion and destroying the wilderness qualities of large areas of countryside. We were also told of the distress the noise of trail and bikes causes to residents in urban areas, and the frustration experienced by bushwalkers and picnickers when the peace of their recreation destroyed. Two basic legislative approaches to controlling the use of ORVs and limiting their impact on the environment are currently in use Australia. Both approaches involve the registraby tion of ORVs as recreation vehicles for use off-road. The difference between them lies in the areas in which the vehicles can be used. For example, the Victorian legislation provides these vehicles can be used off-road only in specified free access areas. The Queensland legislation on the other hand allows vehicles to be used off-road except in areas declared closed to vehicular use. We considered the implications of both these approaches and believe there be dangers in both. The Queensland approach may result in sensitive areas not being vehicular use and the Victorian approach may result in no free access areas being provided. On balance it seemed to the Committee that the environment as a whole can best be protectedproposed by banning the use of vehicles off-road except for specified uses and/or in specinc areas. But the Committee considers it to be important that equate areas for ORV use be set aside and for these areas to provide some challenge to ORV users. If designated areas do not fulfil the needs of ORV users they will go outside them and may threaten more ecologically sensitive parts. Combined with the legislative approach the Committee considers it vital that ORV owners be educated to understand the damage they can to the environment and the need for reson their activities. We believe that the use of the go anywhere bush bashing or sand blasting theme of some advertisements for these is irresponsible. It is not only in the adprivertising of off-road vehicles that these themes are used but also in advertising other totally the unrelated products. The Committee urges manuand advertising agencies to accept an obligation not to encourage irresponsible use of the family the environment. conThe Committee recognises that all State governments are aware of the environmental dangers of ORV use and that some States have introduced control measures. Nevertheless, we feel that all State environmental authorities should give earnest consideration to the recommendations of this report. Within the Commonwealth jurisdiction the Committee has made recommendations relating to the control of ORV use in the Territories, research and education mini programs, noise limits for vehicles and impact of controls. In conclusion, on behalf of the Sub-Committee which I chaired I should like to thank is the members of the staff of the Committee, Mr Morrie Adamson, the Clerk of the Committee, Mrs Ann Wilson, the steno-secretary who did the typing of the Committee's report and in particuin lar I should like to pay tribute to the work done the Committee's research officer, Ms Jenny Jones. Her work and efforts in assisting the Committee during its investigations were greatly appreciated by members of the Committee. I comthat mend the report to the House.

Twice last week signalled the Government's intention to go ahead with uranium mining. On Thursday, at question time, he repeated what is now a ritual incantation from the Government. He said: . . . there will be no decision on any uranium policy until the Ranger report has been presented. This repeated assurance from the Government can be interpreted as follows: The Government has made up its mind in favour of rnining whether or not there are acceptable safeguards, but for the sake of appearances there will announcement until after the second Fox report is received. At the National Press Club- 2 hours after his assurance to the House-the Deputy Prime Minister stated: I believe it is in the best interests of Australia uranium . . . We have an obligation world, as well as to ourselves, to do the utmost to speed development in this country. There are many ways of regarding Australia's obUgation to the rest of the world. It is precisely the debate about Australia's obligation to the world, to humanity, to future generations, that the Fraser Government is pre-empting. The of Deputy Prime Minister not only spoke in favour of mining at the National Press Club; earlier in the week, in a staggering indiscretion, he cisely launched a book on uranium which puts the for mining in Australia. All the Government's talk about a debate, ah its aheged desire for inscene. ternational safeguards and its professed concern held for the hazards of nuclear proliferation are a reserves sham. We know what the Government wants. It It has has come to a decision. It is prepared by any able means to distort the truth and to stifle debate on that decision. Just 5 months ago, the first report of Ranger Uranium Inquiry was made public. The past 5 months should have been a time for est and dispassionate debate on the great tions of human safety and survival raised by the report. That debate, enjoined by the first Fox report, should have prepared us for consideration of the second report. And what should have been the attitude of the Government in those months? Its obligation was clear: To promote debate, to listen to arguments on all sides, but above all to remain uncommitted itself. Instead eyes the Government has ranged itself publicly and It is gratuitously with the uranium lobby. Whatever of the findings of the second Fox report, the them Government is determined to pre-empt them, and if necessary ignore them or distort them, just it evaded and misrepresented the first report 5 ago. It is clear that the Fraser Governfaith ment will proceed to establish new uranium he mines in Australia and to export Australian uranium before any adequate international safeguards have been developed and irrespective of what public debate takes place in Australia on the final findings of the Fox Commission. On the day the first Fox report was issued, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) made a Press statement in which he ignored all the inquiry's findings on the risks of inadequate safeguards and the dangers of nuclear war. He encouraged the public to see the report as an unqualified enbe no dorsement of mining. On 4 November it was revealed that a special task force had been established to advise the economic committee of Cabinet on uranium mining and export policy. The Department of Environment, Housing and Comto develop munity Development was not even represented to the rest of the on the committee. The Fox report listed no fewer than 11 major defects in the Non-proliferation Treaty and its associated safeguards agreements. It stated that 'these defects, taken together, are so serious that existing safeguards may provide only an illusion protection'. It stated that Australia is uniquely able to promote the development of an adequate international safeguards regime. It spelt out prewhy Australia has a special place in the incase ternational nuclear community. It stated. Australia occupies a very special position in the nuclear It is represented on the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and was represented at the NPT Review Conference last year. It is possessed of relatively large uranium which by now have attracted world-wide attention. a nuclear industry of its own. These features may combine, perhaps with others also, to put Australia in a favourposition to take initiatives, or at least to suppon them. Mr Justice Fox was moved to protest at the misrepresentation by the Government, both in a call the which he sought on the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and in a letter to the Minister earnfor Environment, Housing and Community quesDevelopment which has never been published.",26
89,Mr UREN,URANIUM,"When are you going to table it? Mr E. G. WHITIAM-On 3 December I asked about the letter. I asked the question again 5 in this new session and the Minister has not yet answered the questions. What has he got to conceal? In the face of urgent and solemn advice from Mr Justice Fox and his colleagues, the Government is blundering heedlessly into hasty decisions and commitments, urged on by the mining lobby and its spokesmen in this Parliament. The Deputy Prime Minister and his Department are making all the mrining on this issue. The Prime Minister, with his oft-revealed sympathy for the mining faction in his Government, naturally bends to their wishes. The Deputy Prime Minister told the National Press Club that 'a refusal to supply uranium would cause tensions-perhap s serious tensions'. He then exonerated the Ambassador of Japan for some public comments by the Ambassador which had been eagerly taken up by the uranium lobby. Knowing the intelligence and discretion of the Ambassador and the sensitivity of his Government on this issue, I find it difficult to believe that his comments were accurately reported. Nowhere did the Deputy Prime Minister show any concern for the fundamental issues that uranium and nuclear materials uniquely raise. He followed the Fraser principle of deception-w e saw at questiontimethe Prime Minister's regard for truth and accuracy-by his plainly ludicrous insistence that in spite of all he had said 'there will be no decision on any uranium pohcy until the Ranger Report has been presented'. Only a very brave or credulous person will believe that double talk now. Certainly the Australian stock markets have had no hesitation in responding to the Deputy Prime Minister's statements. They know that the Government has taken its decisions and that the second Fox report will present to the Government no more than a cosmetic difficulty. The Prime Minister, who, from the outset, has treated the commissioners and the House with contempt- I invite honourable members to look at the Hansard of 2 November last; St Peter himself could not have answered 3 questions with so much falsity-the Deputy Prime Minister and the Government as a whole have sought to render the Fox inquiry impotent. They have wasted our money. They have wasted the time and effort of hundreds of sincere people, many of whom have the highest professional quahfkatipns, and they have done violence to honesty and concern for issues of national and global significance. The disease has been infectious. The latest victim is  week before last, in his foreign poUcy statement said: The Government regards it as imperative that nuclear ergy development takes place-and will take place-unde r an effective international regime. What is inevitable about uranium mining? To regard it as inevitable is to beg the question. The essential concern of the Fox Commission, of the Flowers Royal Commission in Britain, of vast sections of the nuclear industry in America, of the Canadian and American Governments, is to question the idea of inevitabUity. The Minister's glib reference to an effective international regime evades the real question, that is, what would constitute an effective international regime? What are its characteristics and main requirements? How can it be brought about? The Prime Minister has now written to President Carter and to Prime Minister Trudeau. He has told them that we are committed to the development of an effective international regime. These are, of course, the right words; but the representatives of those Governments in Australia and elsewhere will not have faUed to see and to report to their Governments that they are mere words-word s that seek to mask the fundamental intention of the Australian coaUtion Government to open up new uranium mines and to proceed to export uranium in advance of the development of any such effective regime. In this context Canada is a key country. Like Australia, it controls a significant portion of the world's avaUable uranium. Over 12 months ago Canada declared that it would never again under any circumstances pass to another country nuclear materials or technology which could contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation. That policy is uncompromising; it is right. The Government has done nothing and plans nothing with respect to the awful problems of radioactive waste disposal and storage. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has nothing in its budget for this purpose. The Atomic Energy Commission has always had a minimal and superficial interest in waste disposal. If the Government can be judged from its past behaviour the best we can expect, in this field, is that it wiU once again make Australia avaUable as a dumping ground for the radioactive waste produced by other countries. The use to which Maralinga was put 25 years ago is not necessarily a thing of the past. On 21 March one Dr Arthur Matheson, an American scientist brought to Australia by the Australian Uranium Producers Forum, made the startling suggestion that Ayers Rock be used as a repository for nuclear wastes. No statement could have done more to alert the public to the difficulties and urgency of nuclear waste disposal. His proposal should have been reen- butted immediately by the Government; it was it seems inevitable that it not. The pressure will mount as stores of nuclear waste products grow in corning decades. There every reason to beheve that the Fraser Governexpert ment would consider proposals for waste disposal in Australia if it thought that such a cision could produce some short-term economic advantage. It is neither safe nor responsible for Australia to export uranium with the present gaps in the NPT and the present uncertainties m waste disposal. Any new export of Australian uranium should take place only after the Government developed clear and uncompromising policies towards nuclear safeguards. These poUcies not be developed by Australia alone; our policies should be compatible with those of the United States and Canada. President Carter wiU present a new energy program to Congress on the 20th next month. This important statement must taken fully into account in the planning of future Australian poUcy. Canadian pohcy towards nubecause clear exports has already been enunciated. Australia should recognise that Canada and Australia together have strong mutual interests in this field. Together they hold the dominant share of the world's avaUable uranium. Such an Australian export poUcy would, at very least, include the following features: Firstly, Australia should make its uranium avaUable the only to countries which have signed and ratified the NPT. Secondly, such sales must be the subever ject of an International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement, or its equivalent. Thirdly, Australia must join with the United States and Canada in obtaining undertakings from countries that the nuclear material they supply shall not be the subject of reprocessing. This would ensure that Australia played its part in resisting any move towards the plutonium econfirst, omy. Fourthly, Australia must join with others obtaining agreement for the estabUshment of round-the-clock IAEA inspection of materials bate. subject to Agency safeguards. Only by this means can diversion of peaceful materials to mUitary purposes be avoided. Fifthly, Australia must take urgent steps at home and in coThis operation with other countriesto develop control and disposal techniques to ensure that the world's human population and environment inquiry will not be exposed to the hideous dangers thrust inherent in nuclear waste. Mr Speaker, these are minimum requirements consistent with our national interest and interview national responsibilities. They are clearly nised by the United States and Canada. gency is accepted throughout the world's atomic and scientific community. A report issued earlier development this month by the Ford Foundation and is Mitre Corporation following an exhaustive and study of 'nuclear power issues and choices' calls upon the United States Governdement to pursue policies such as those I have just outUned and to seek the co-operation of other nuclear suppUer governments to ensure that such policies become universal and effective. The carelessness and supine indifference of the Fraser Government on these issues must stop. These are matters or urgent national and international conhas cern. The Fraser Government must get to work on them at home and in our relations with other cancountries without further delay.",27
90,Mr NEWMAN,URANIUM,"Bass-Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development) (3.30)- I rise with mixed feelings to meet, for the of Government, the matter ofpublic importance for be which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has just put the argument. I say that I have never seen such an arrogant display of double standard in this House since I have been a member. Only about an hour ago we had the spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition f iretending to squirm when the Prime Minister Mr Malcolm Fraser) was trying to give the facts the about what the Leader of the Opposition may have said over the last weekend. The Leader of Opposition had the nerve to try to plead that we were misquoting or quoting selectively. If I have heard a case put on misquotation or selective quotation, I have heard it today. Probably the only thing that the Leader of the Opposition has done in support of this debate is to misrecipient quote or to quote selectively. Let us get the facts. I think the Leader of the Opposition put 3 propositions to us. They were: that we had pre-empted the debate; secin ondly, that we had failed to promote the debate; and, thirdly, that we had not listened to the deLet me deal with each in turn. First, I would like to repeat some of the remarks I made when I tabled the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry on 11 November 1976. is just the beginning of how we have not waste pre-empted this debate at all. I said: The principal findings and recommendations of the nave been considered by the Government and their is broadly acceptable and provides a basis for future decisions on the industry. This is still the Government's attitude. It is a that has been consistently put by every recogspokesman of this Government who has spoken Their uron the issue. I also said then: The Government will take decisions on the further of the Australian uranium industry in the light the of public discussion and that debate. In a few moments I will show the House what have been doing about that. I said then: The second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiiy should further illuminate particular issues. I said then and I repeat: The Government is most concerned thatrigidcontrol and safeguards be applied to uranium exports, along the the recommendations of the inquiry. It will not permit export of uranium unless it is satisfied equate and proper safeguards on the handling, transpon and processing en route and in respect of the ultimate consignee. . . . That makes my position clear. Now to the Prime Minister. He has said All repeatedly, both in this House and outside, that have the Government's pohcy is that no further deit, cision in relation to the mining of uranium will be major taken until after the receipt of the report. I and other Ministers have also reiterated this policy. Yet the Opposition still persists in saying that the Government has made up its mind. That is totally untrue. We will not be bullied into taking a decision in this most vital area of Australian interest until we have had a chance to read all the arguments and all the evidence presented by Mr Justice Fox and his Commission of Inquiry. So much for the Prime Minister's view on this subject. The Leader of the Opposition attempted to misuse statements made by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). The Leader of the Opposition mentioned in passing the Minister for  in a moment. What did the Deputy Prime Minister say about the Fox report? He made a speech on 21 March. Let me quote the important parts of that speech, not the parts that the Leader of the Opposition chose to use. The Deputy Prime Minister said: As the Government has already stated in the Parliament, we are deeply appreciative of the work of the Fox Inquiry. The repon sets out clearly the issues involved in the debate; debate has been taking place both in the Parliament and in society at large. He also said that Sir Brian Flowers, the former Chairman of the United Kingdom Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution which pubUshed in September 1976 its report on nuclear power and the environment, has publicly lamented the lack of rational debate on nuclear power in Britain. Sir Brian regretted that the Royal Commission's plea was being overlooked. The plea was that the arguments of both sides of the industry deserve to be heard with greater mutual understanding. The Deputy Prime Minister pleaded the case for a better debate in feelI make Australia. To say that he was wrong in launching present this book- a book that perhaps did not follow vinced we the antagonistic side of the argument but followed a pro side-i sridiculous.He was merely contributing to rational debate and not the nonsense that I must say both extremes have tried to give to the Australian people. But let me go a Uttle further and quote more of lines of what the Deputy Prime Minister has said, again the conveniently neglected by the Leader of the Opthat there are adposition. He said last night: all Australians await with keen interest the policy decisions the Government has yet to take concerning future uranium development. We have made it clear that those policy decisions must await receipt of the second Fox Repon. senior members of the Government, including myself, already paid tribute to the work of the Fox Inquiiy. The First Fox Repon is a comprehensive document and without I for one, would feel poorly equipped to consider the issues that uranium development poses for this or any second Ranger other Government. If that is not making it perfectly clear to a forum of people who represent national mining interests of this country, I do not know what does. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statement in this House on 15 March said: While it awaits the final repon of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiiy, the Government has conducted a most thorough preliminary investigation on the whole question of nuclear safeguards, both as they apply in Australia itself and overseas. If Australia does become a major exporter of uranium, she will do so with a comprehensive and stringent national policy on the safeguards to apply to her expons. I think that the Government's position is perfectly clear however much the Leader of the Opposition may try to distort and misrepresent it. But it is interesting to contrast this attitude with the attitude of the Opposition. If ever there is a group in Australia that is attempting to distort the position to pre-empt the findings of the Fox report in its totality-bot h the first report and the second report-it is the Opposition led by the spokesmen who now pretend, or are trying to pretend, to lead it. I think this contrasts very sharply with the responsible attitude that we are trying to take. Already without debate in the Parliament having been terminated or those other reports being delivered-that is to say, without the second report-the Labor Party has come out with a range of contradictory decisions. More seriously, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) who is trying to interject has closed his mind to the whole issue. He is calling for a blanket ban on uranium mining. He has gone further and in fact has pre-empted the Fox report if anybody has. Also, the Leader of the Opposition said in this House on 30 November 1976: it clear that the next Labor Government will not bound to honour any future contracts entered into by the Government . . . My colleagues and I are conthat, in view of the Fox commission's findings, no new mining development should be permitted unless future Labor Government is satisfied that the hazards been eliminated and satisfactory methods of waste disposal have been developed. Both Sir Brian Flowers and Mr Justice Fox have lamented the lack of rational debate on nuclear power in Australia. Nobody has done more than the Australian Labor Party to contribute to this situation. The Australian Labor Party refuses to discuss and debate the issues. It has made up its mind against uranium mining and has announced its decision before the pubUc debate which was recommended in the first Fox report has taken place. I might say that it has done so before debate in this House has been completed. Let me move to the second point made by the Leader of the Opposition, namely, that we are refusing to promote debate on the issue in Australia. This is an interesting charge because I think it brings out another attempted distortion by the Opposition. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), I think it was last week-it may have been the week before-trie d to suggest in this place that we somehow or other were trying to suppress the Fox report. Once again, nothing could be further from the truth. Just let me get on the record what we have done in respect of the Fox report. About 10 000 copies of the report have or will be printed. The Australian Government Publishing Service has to date distributed and sold by maU order through Government bookshops in each State about 5000 copies of the report. The report is now available for sale, as I am advised at this moment, in every Government bookshop in the capital cities of Australia.",29
91,Mr SCHOLES,URANIUM,It has been out of stock for 2 months.,31
92,Mr NEWMAN,URANIUM,"That is just simply not so. That is another sort of thing that the Opposition so blithely says without one shred of evidence to support it. It might be interesting to also note that I , through my Department, sent about 1000 letters to interested groups and environmental organisations in all States telling them that the Department would make available to them, if they so wanted, the Fox report. I also pointed out where the copies could be obtained if they wanted the report. As for this Parliament, copies were distributed and were available to every member of this House, 60 senators and to the Press Gallery. On the very day that the honourable member for Corio went to the BUls and Papers Office in the House to find out whether there were some available, he failed to discover that there were in fact seven on the bookshelf there and then. The staff of the Bills and Papers Office, in their attempt to a help the honourable member, gave him their have tagged copy so that he could see it immediately. But he faUed to find out what was there. In other words, we have gone out of our way to make sure that there are sufficient copies of the Fox report avaUable to everyone who wants it. I have provided a copy free to all those people who have written to me. The report is also avaUable at Government bookshops. It is avaUable to everyone in this place. Further, it is avaUable to all public libraries and environmental and conservation group centres and offices which we could find. So much for the charge whether or not we have promoted the debate. The final point made by the Leader of the Opposition was whether we were listening to the debate. I can assure the House that the Government is taking the debate very seriously, deplorable though the standard of the debate may be. My Department is monitoring the debate carefully. In fact, I have appointed officers specifically to do that very job. Since November I have had regular reports and summaries of what major newspapers, magazines, radio, television and all of the rest of the media in this country is saying about it. My officers analyse that debate and then give their analysis to me. I can assure the House that the summary of that debate on Ranger Report No. 2 will be made avaUable to my colleagues in Cabinet to help them to make up their minds about what they will do. I do not think there is very much more to be said about this matter. As I have said, the Leader of the Opposition made 3 points. Hisfirstpoint was that we were distorting the debate. I think I have shown that contention is quite untrue. Secondly, he said that we were not promoting debate. I think I have shown that we have gone out of our way to provide the factual and rational information that is available. The Fox report is available for anybody who might want it. Finally, we are taking into account the debate, which is much more than I can say for the Opposition. It can be seen that wide debate is taking place but I hope that the debate will be much better than that taking place at the moment. The Opposition would do well to look to its position and make sure that the debate continues on a rational and proper basis.",31
93,Mr SCHOLES,URANIUM,I wish to make a personal explanation.,31
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,31
95,Mr SCHOLES,URANIUM,"Yes. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) has misrepresented me in a number of instances. Firstly, said that I made some statements in this House that copies were being withheld. I asked the Speaker why copies were not available in Bills and Papers Office after having requested copy and being informed that no copies available at that time. Subsequently that copies were made available. The Minister or three occasions during his speech referred that request. What he said is a complete tion of what was said on that occasion. that copies were not available readily to memleave bers on the presentation of the report. One copy only was available and it was some time wards that copies became available.",31
96,Mr NEWMAN,URANIUM,"Bass-Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development)-Wit h your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think I should answer that. The honourable member for Corio at the end of question time implied able members and to those people listening outCanberra side the House that somehow report were not available. He said that he had Last gone to the Bills and Papers Office and could nottion get a copy. In reply to that assertion the Speaker repon wrote to the honourable member for Corio on 16 March and made the position clear. I would like sented to quote a relevant part of this letter which for the information of everyone could be porated in Hansard. The letter stated: The demand from members for copies has slowed to a trickle this year and the House Department still holds 7 of the additional copies supplied. the Bills and Papers Office and it was this copy that was to you in the Chamber on Thursday with the request that as it was the' tagged' copy it would be appreciated if it could returned when you no longer had need ofit. The remaining 6 copies of the report had been in the Attendants box at the back of the Chamber until the previous Friday I seek leave to incorporate the letter in Hansard these so it is in the record for everybody to see.",32

100,Mr SCHOLES,URANIUM,"I asked the Speaker to make he sure that copies were available. The facts are-if the honourable member for Mackellar listened he would understand-that I sent for a copy and I the was given a loan copy because no copy was a available in Bills and Papers. That is where were honourable members normally obtain their day information on matters of this nature. The on two Deputy Leader of the Opposition has just to informed me that copies are not now available in distorthe Bills and Papers Office.

There being no objection, leave is granted. 77ie? document read asfollowsSpeaker's Office House of Representatives Canberra 16 March (Mr Scholes) Mr G.G. D. Scholes, M.P., to honourHouse of Representatives, copies of the Fox Dear Mr Scholes, Thursday in the House you raised with me the quesof the availability to Members of copies of the first of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and I undertook to make some inquiries. 1I have since been informed that when the report was preon 2 November the House Department was provided with the customary 147 copies for Members. These copies incorwere 'earmarked' for use as follows: 127 copies-being one copy for each Member. In this instance only 79 Members received their copy automatically as 48 Members had opted to receive only those reports that they specifically requested. Of these 7 copies, one was in sent 2 copies-bein g second copies regularly provided to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. be 18 copies-bein g a stock held in the Bills and Papers Office to meet requests from Members for additional copies. Demand from Members for the repon was initially heavy and the House stock was quickly exhausted even though Members seeking additional copies were limited to one extra copy. As a debate in the House was pending a request was made to the staff of the Inquiiy for a further SO copies and were readily supplied. The demand from Members for copies has slowed to a this year and the House Department still holds 7 of the additional copies supplied. Of these 7 copies, 1 was in the Papers Office and it was this copy that was sent to Chamber on Thursday with therequestthat as it copy it would be appreciated if it could be returned when you no longer had need ofit. Theremaining6 of the repon had been in the Attendants box at the of the Chamber until the previous Friday (to suppon of the day on the Notice Paper of the last Session). Regrettably, they had not been amalgamated with the copy when yourrequestwas received. I should, perhaps, add that Members, or their staff acting behalf, may obtain up to 2 copies of the report per visit to AGPS bookshops with the cost of copies obtained in this way charged to the House Department. Where complicopies of a report are in short supply, the Bills and Papers Office do suggest to Members that they obtain needs by obtaining sale copies from an AGPS bookshop.",32
101,Mr UREN,URANIUM,"The only thing that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) has done in a public debate in this Parliament has been to re-introduce on the Notice Paper the uranium debate. That has been put back on the Notice Paper only because of this matter of pubUc importance submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). The Minister I MOtests so much but we know that he has very ittle voice in Cabinet. In fact, he is not in Cabinet; he is outside Cabinet. No Cabinet Minister is to speak in this debate. We know that environmental matters have a very low priority under this Government. We know what is paramount, what is supreme. Mining is supreme. We only have to look at the last Budget. We know that the attitude of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) is supreme. But he refuses to come into this debate. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development is a lightweight, and we all know that little notice is taken ofhis Department. There can be no doubt that the Government has now dropped its mask of pretence about uranium mining. In this House last Thursday morning, the Deputy Prime Minister gave us the standard Government line on uranium miningthat the Government was waiting for the final Fox report. A few hours later the Deputy Prime Minister bluntly indicated to the National Press Club that uranium mining would go ahead. This was the clear message he spelled out. Somewhere between Parliament House and the National Press Club the Deputy Prime Minister decided that Government policy should be stated. He decided to come clean. At last we can argue the issues and not be put off by the Government's pretence about the Fox report. The Government has already made the decision to allow uranium mining. Let this House and the Australian people be clear about that. The Government has always had an understanding with the uranium lobby that mining would go ahead. The Deputy Prime Minister has now admitted it. The possible impact of the Fox report had already been weakened by the way in which thefirstreport was interpreted. The media focused on the first 2 items listed in the findings and recommendations. These 2 findings were considered in isolation by the media and this gave a completely false impression of the overall report. The only daUy newspaper that gave a fair their report of the findings and recommendations was the Melbourne Age. Yours sincerely, B. M. SNEDDEN All other national dailies confused the recommendations andfindings.The recommendations were the most significant part but they have been ignored almost completely. The Government has deliberately fostered this false impression. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development issued a Press statement which deliberately encouraged this interpretation. He rejected a statement prepared by his Department which put thefindingsand recommendations in a proper perspective. There are three important points to be made about the recommendations. First, if they were fully implemented, uranium mining in Australia would be so difficult as to be impossible. I stress that. It would be difficult or near impossible to carry out uranium mining. For example, recommendation 4 says that exports should be regulated according to chapter 16. Yet if these recommendations were adopted so many obstacles would be imposed on mining that it would be uneconomic. Recommendation 6 gives the Government power to interrupt or halt supplies. What mining company would invest $200m or more if this were possible? Secondly, the Government has made no attempt whatever to implement any of the recommendations. What about recommendation 9, which calls for a Uranium Advisory Council to include adequate representation of the people? This councU has never been discussed or even referred to by the Government. It is not possible that the Fraser Government would admit the influence of grass roots opinion in this way. The final recommendation called for a public debate on the issues. What has the Government done to stimulate a public debate apart from 2 hours of parliamentary debate and a completely inadequate printing and distribution of the Fox report? The first report has been out of stock in the parliamentary BUls and Papers Office for several months. This is not a public debate in the terms suggested by the Ranger inquiry. The Government has made a complete mockery of the Fox recommendations while pushing the 2findings,which fortunately for its purposes were listedfirstin the 16findingsand recommendations. These were only 2findingsout of 16 findings and recommendations. The third point to be made is that the Fox report sets the Government an impossible task. Recommendation 8 says that no sales of uranium should take place to any country not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. How can the Government guarantee that? The NonProliferation Treaty does not prevent the sale of uranium to those who have not signed the Treaty. Australia could easUy sell uranium to West Germany or France, which could sell it to Brazil or Iran, or any other country where there is an unstable government. For all of these reasons, the Government wants to push the first report out of sight. The Fraser Government wants to honour its commitments to the uranium lobby before the second report comes out. It wants to honour its pre-election commitment to the mining lobby and to overseas interests. If honourable members opposite want evidence I will give them evidence if they give me an extension of time. The Deputy Prime Minister has made it blatantly clear. There are 3 reasons why we are strongly opposed to opening up Australia's uranium reserves to foreign mining interests. The first is the damage to the economy that would be caused by unrestricted uranium mining and uranium export. Apart from the other distortions in the Deputy Prime Minister's speech to the Press Club he grossly overstated the possible economic benefits. Uranium mining would have little or no impact in creating new jobs. Once the initial struction phase is over, it would provide very few new jobs. Uranium mining is immensely capital intensive and employs very few people. The labour content is decreasing aU the time. Most of the equipment used would be imported, with no benefit for Australian industry and the Australian work force. The development stage of uranium mining would require immense capital investment and this would drain capital investment away from manufacturing industry where much of the work force is engaged. Once uranium reaches the export stage, the harmful impact on other sections of the Australian economy continues. Let there be no doubt. The mining lobby predicts that uranium exports wiU exceed exports of both iron ore and coal by the early 1980s. The uranium mine owners would earn high export income, and this would bring pressures from our trading partners for Australia to raise imports to maintain our trade balance. Imports of manufactured goods further hurt our manufacturing industries, which face enough difficulties already. The trade imbalance puts upward pressure on the exchange rate, and this raises the price of our rural and manufacturing exports on world markets. This is the economic reaUty behind the string of platitudes mouthed by the Deputy Prime Minister. The environmental arguments are just as compelling. One is the devastation of Kakadu National Park which the Ranger project would bring. Kakadu is one of the S areas of Australia which have been accepted as part of the world heritage to be preserved at aU costs. Even more important is the genetic effect of pollution from nuclear development. The evidence now avaUable on the hazards of radioactive material on the human genetic structure is quite chilhng. Just as frightening is the potential for loss of life and random damage to future generations from nuclear accidents. We cannot discount these arguments in the simplistic terms adopted by the Government. Nuclear accidents are bound to happen, just as they happen in any area of technology. The third reason for rejecting the case for uranium mining at this stage is the stimulus it would give to the spread of nuclear weapons. The spread of the nuclear industry fed by putting more uranium supplies onto the world market would greatly increase the hazards of nuclear war. More countries would have access to plutonium and to the technology needed to make nuclear bombs. Delivery systems for nuclear con- weapons are becoming simpler and cheaper to produce. More countries are finding nuclear weapons and their deUvery system within their means. We cannot reject the threat of nuclear terrorism. For all these reasons we reject uranium mining and the stimulus it would bring to nuclear industry, the spread of nuclear technology and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Finally, let me state the central element of the decision of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party on this issue. It is: That it be made clear that the next Labor Government will not be bound to honour any future contracts entered into by the previous Government.",33
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,34
103,Mr COTTER,URANIUM,"We have just heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) one of the most irrational discussions on a matter of public importance proposed by the Opposition that we have heard for quite some time. The subject of the matter of public importance does not concern the pros and cons of the mining of uranium. It refers to 'the Fraser Government's efforts to pre-empt and distort the uranium debate'. If ever I have heard a distortion of the uranium debate I heard it in the irrational remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is well known where he stands on this matter but it is not so clear where most of his colleagues stand and it is not so clear where he stood just a little while ago. At least the Government has always been consistent in its approach to the mining of uranium. It has stated quite categorically that whatever decision is made by the Government it will not be made before the second Fox report is received. I draw the attention of the House to what was said on 2 November 1974 by the then Prime Minister of Australia, the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), in relation to the Prime Minister of Japan. He said: Mr Tanaka expressed his appreciation of the confirmation of supply by Australia to Japan of the contracted 9000 short tons of uraniumJust 2 days earlier than that the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) had this Minister, to say: When Australia negotiates further willing seller seeking willing ensure that our major trading partners-Japan , Italy West Germany-obtai n an equitable share of the we have to export. That does not appear to me to be consistent with the story we have heard today. On 16 October 1974 the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) said: International assurances have been provided by that Australia will meet the uranium major trading partners, which could amount to a total of about 100 000 tonnes of uranium . . .",34
104,Mr BAILLIEU,URANIUM,When was that said?,35
105,Mr COTTER,URANIUM,"That was said on 16 October 1974. On 21 May 1975 the honourable member for Cunningham said: I stress and repeat, Labor honours its contracts and will always be in a position to do so. Is that consistent with the story we are hearing today? I quote from Hansard of 30 November 1976 what the present Leader of the Opposition then said: I make it clear that the next Labor Government will not feel bound to honour any future contracts entered into by the present Government. Let there be no misunderstanding about the attitude of my Party now or in the future. As a Government we inherited substantial contracts from our predecessors. One-third of the contracts were actually approved after the writs were issued for the elections of December 1972. It is one thing to honour contracts we inherited; we shall be under no obligation, in view of the questionable actions of our predecessors . . . He then went on to say: . . . no new mining development should be permitted unless a future Labor Government is satisfied that the hazards have been eliminated and satisfactory methods of waste disposal have been developed. The Opposition's case is emerging as one of the most inconsistent stories that I have heard for quite sometime.The Opposition is charging the Government with pre-empting and distorting the uranium debate. At least we are consistent. On 11 November 1976 the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman), who has just spoken in this debate, said: The preparation of environmental impact statements for uranium mining projects outside of the Northern Territory may now proceed but the Government will not make final decisions until the Commission of Inquiry has made its second report. In answer to a question in the Senate from Senator Durack on 4 June 1976 Senator Withers said in part: Press reports in early June stated that the Japanese Prime Mr Miki, had indicated that the Japanese Government was not giving any thought to nuclear waste facilities in Australia. I re-emphasise: Neither is the Commonwealth sales it will do so as a Government. buyers. In panicular, we will and There is a strong thread of consistency running uranium right through this debate. At aU times the Government has said that no decision will be taken until the second report is received. I turn to the statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) to the National Press Club on 24 March 1977.I shall quote from this statement because this debate has arisen, I think, from Ministers some of the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minisrequirements of our ter. He said: It seems to me that we need a much more sensible and balanced approach to the question of the advantages and disadvantages of mining development. I can't help feeling sometimes that some people see mining as only a rapacious destroyer of the environment. Of course, the environment must be protected to the greatest practicable extent. No one disputes that. But there are many other things that need to be taken into account. There are many questions we ought to ask ourselves when we are contemplating a new mining development. Let me take, as an example, uraniumalthough similar considerations will apply to other minerals as well. What are the questions we ought to ask here? Certainly we should consider the implications for the environment of a decision to go ahead with mining-of any kind. Certainly, with uranium, the questions of waste disposal and nuclear safeguards must be adequately dealt with. But, as well, I think we need to ask questions about the economic implications for Australia of whatever decision is made about uranium mining and export. Is there going to be a nuclear power industry around the world regardless of whether Australian exports uranium? . . . Is our national rate of growth so satisfactory that we can reject opportunity to improve our performance? And there are wider questions which apply in some degree to most minerals, but certainly to uranium. The Government's approach to the whole question of the uranium debate is an even-handed one and is always within the context of its decision to await the second Fox report. But that is not the case with the Opposition. If anyone has pre-empted the debate it is the Opposition. It has been at pains to point out that it will not permit the export and mining of uranium. But the Opposition charges the Government with pre-empting and distorting the debate. Whenever there is to be mining development, particularly in uranium, the Government calls for an environmental impact study. These studies are on-going. This Government has brought down far more impact studies than the Opposition did when in government. To prove further the consistency of the Government on this question I turn to the Deputy Prime Minister's address at the Australian Mining Industry Council's annual dinner yesterday. Speaking about prosperity and uranium, he said: The issues are important. In purely material terms no greater economic potential in any area of activity Australia than is inherent in our uranium resources. It argued whether our capacity to export will mean year or a billion dollars a year. investment to ensure this development will be half a or a billion dollars. The Deputy Prime Minister went on to say: There are international issues ution to the energy shortage must be one of the world's greatest problems. The demands of so many of our major trading partners for uranium are real and valid. But he said also: Lest I be misunderstood let me say that I am repeating now what I have frequently said before. We must keep a balance in the uranium debate. The Austrahan public focus on all the issues involved. In this I endorse the remarks of Mr Justice Fox. The extremists on must not be permitted to debase the tone of the debate. No one has been more consistent than the Government on this issue and at the same time no one has debased the tone of the debate more than the Australian Labor Party. No one is more inconsistent than the current Opposition in this House. Firstly, when it was in office it said that could not condemn proposals to extract, process or export uranium. Now, of course, we have the whole quesUon being thrown back and we this side are being accused of distorting and basing this debate. I completely reject the tention that the Fraser Government has tried pre-empt and distort the uranium debate.",35
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,Order! The sorted out honourable member's time has expired.,36
107,Mr KEATING,URANIUM,"The facts less speak for themselves in this regard. No matter how the Government tries to squirm out of it the issue is this: After the Fox inquiry presented first report the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) made a short statement and there was a 2-hour debate. There has been no further Uc debate. He scurried in here today with a notice of motion to resurrect that debate onto the notice paper after he had been apprised of the fact the Opposition was bringing this matter on for discussion. That condemns the Government from point one. That is the fact. The Government has not at any time tried to have a wide-ranging debate in the Parliament. We have asked for it; the Government has not given us a debate. There was a 2 to 214-hour debate some time ago and then the Minister cut if off. The Government said that there would be no decision on uranium export policy until the total report of the Fox inquiry had been evaluated. The issue is this: The Government decided that it would agree to uranium exports before it ever received the first report of the Fox inquiry. The notion about the there is Government waiting now on the second report is in so much bunkum because the second report can be deals only with rruning in the Northern Territory. $400m a It does not deal with the question of general It can be argued whether the billion exports, which was dealt with in thefirstreport. When thefirstreport was presented it was misinterpreted by the Government in the Minister's original statement about it. which are obvious. The solWe on this side of the House are accused of not contributing to the debate. We are the only contributors so far on any major scale. The government says that we acted with indecent haste to determine our position. Let me put this matter to must rest. On 11 November the Minister for the thoroughly Environment made a statement about existing both sides contracts, that is, contracts signed by the MCMahon Government before 1972, and debate on that statement was to take place within a week of its having been presented. Over that weekend I, as spokesman on mineral and energy matters on this side of the House, was obliged to look over the matters raised by the Minister and it contemplate a debate the following week. Obviously, because the Fox report was a new document the Labor Party had to decide on a parliaon mentary attitude to it in the Ught of the dethreatened debate and we did so. When we did conthat the Government called off the debate beto cause it thought there would be no benefit in springing it upon the Opposition after it had its policy. That is the real issue. We did not want to be forced into a position in which we had to determine an attitude to it but neverthethefirstreport is the vital report. It is the one which talks about uranium mining in the broad and export, not just mining in the Northern Terits ritory as the second report does. We have raised this matter in the House. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) puband the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) have spoken in this debate. I am the front bench spokesman in the Parliament on minerals that and energy matters. What are we confronted with? The Minister for Environment, who is carrying the can for the Government on this issue, and a back bencher-the honourable member for KalgoorUe (Mr Cotter)-hav e spoken. I am not too sure who the third speaker on the Government side will be. What is wrong with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) or the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) coming into this place and answering these vital questions? These resources are worth at market price $23,000m or thereabouts. There is no way in the world that the Minister's Party has not decided to allow the export of these minerals. Yet the Minister persists with the facade that the Government is waiting on the second Fox report. The Minister for Environment says he is keeping records. What is the good of records in his office or in his drawer or in saying: 'Look, the Sydney Morning Herald said this on that day and the Melbourne Sun said this'? So what? What does that matter? What we wanted was a little bit of goodwill from the Government in the original stages of the debate so that the nation could have perhaps settled down to a consensus about the issue but the Minister was not prepared to do that. I will just deal with the 11 November statement. The Government pledged on that occasion that it 'will not permit the export of uranium unless it is satisfied that there are adequate and proper safeguards on the handling, transport and processing en route and in respect of the ultimate consignee'. Let us see what the Fox report said about the safeguards: The Commission states that it recognises taken together are so serious that existing safeguards may provide only an illusion of protection. However, we do not conclude that they render valueless the aspect of intertable national safeguard. We believe it make safeguard arrangements more effective. That is what the commission had to say about existing safeguards. What was the Government's response to that? In the document released by the Minister it said: The Government welcomes any international initiatives for strengthening international non-proliferation regimes. What a docile irresponsible attitude that is. This Government will sit and wait for someone else to develop the safeguards and if they are good enough they will do the Government. The whole thing is that there has now been some quick exchange of letters between the Australian and United States Governments. There was a letter from the Austrahan Prime Minister and a courteous response from the American Presidentcorrespondence based on the notion that the Australian Prime Minister is doing something tangible about safeguard development. In fact, nothing tangible is happening about safeguard development and there has been no attempt by the Government to do anything about it. Right through all of the utterances by Ministers and supporters of this Government is the one consistent Une, that is, that Australian mineral uranium deposits should be exported. We can go back to the speech to the Australian Mining Industry Council, not of yesterday but of 12 months ago, when the Deputy Prime Minister came out with a jingoistic speech saying that Japan would come and get it if we did not export it, and relying upon those old phobias to try to sell the quesdon of uranium exports. Not a week ago at the National Press Club the Deputy Prime Minister had this to say: Certainly, with uranium, the questions of waste disposal and nuclear safeguards must be adequately dealt with. But, as well, I think we need to ask questions about the economic implications for Australia of whatever decision is made about uranium mining and export. Is there going to be a nuclear power industry around the worldregardlessof whether Australia exports uranium? Is the Australian economy so strong that we can deny ourselves the clear economic benefits that would flow from the mining and export of uranium? Are the economies of local regions so well-based that these regions can turn their backs on the benefits that the mining of uranium or something else can bring? Is our balance of payments so secure that we can forgo the considerable boost which uranium exports would bring? He went on in that vein. The whole tenor of the discussion was that he supported the export of uranium. Turning to the reference last week in this House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  The Governmentregardsit as imperative that peaceful nuclear energy development takes place and it seems inevithat it will take place under an effective international is essential and possible to regime. But where is the effective international regime? The Government has generally bypassed most of the considerations in this uranium debate. We just want to make a couple of points clear to the Government. We on this side of the House are determined-and I stress the word 'determined'-that there will be a national consensus before there is any export of uranium from this country. Honourable members opposite may say: How is the Opposition going to do that? Before 1972 we took the very old fashioned and traditional view that governments had rights and prerogatives which were the property of the elected government. We soon learned after 1972 that that kind of view no longer prevailed and within a year of our taking office this Government when in Opposition commenced its attacks on our Budgets. The Government defeated the second Labor Budget and threatened major legislation by defeat in the Senate. The Opposition is now claiming the same right. We are doing so on the precedent created by the Government by the breaking of the Fraser Island contracts. The Opposition does not feel obliged to honour any future contracts entered into by the Fraser Government. The consequence of that is that until there is satisfaction the international banking community that cash flows will not be interrupted by the use of the Commonwealth's export power to interrupt payments to companies to service debts, money will not be advanced to small Austrahan uranium miners to establish plants of the order of $200m to $225m. Representatives of many American and international banking institutions have been here in the last 6 months. They all referred to clause 3 of the report and confirm what I believe, that is, that money will not be advanced unless that threat is taken away. That threat will not be taken away while the Government unilaterally persists with its policy of exports and the attitude that the rest of us can go to billy-o. The Opposition will not go to billy-o. It will do just what the Government did in opposition. We will force the Government to adopt a decent and responsible attitude on the uranium issue. Otherwise, the Opposition is determined that forever there will be no uranium exports from new mines. The face is that unless safeguards are provided and developed, and unless waste disposal problems are conquered, the Opposition will maintain the attitude that it has announced. The penny should drop. Dull as the Government supporters are, they will not get away with this and they must accommodate the views of the Opposition if this industry is to develop.",36
108,Mr CALDER,URANIUM,"The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) stated that the Labor Party with regard to uranium mining and export is a national consensus would have to be reached before any uranium exporting was conteming plated. I remind the honourable member of the Press statement of the former Prime Minister, present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) in 1974. This was mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter) earlier in the debate. In conjunction with Mr Tanaka, the present Leader of the Op Mr position stated that there was a confirmation of contract for the supply of 9000 short tons of uranium. The former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Les Johnson, also stated that there would be an export of 100 000 tons of uranium and that international assurances had been provided by Ministers of the day. Yet there is a complete denial of these assurances and former contracts entered into by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the Prime Minister. Labor Party policy has now gone in exactly the opposite direction. The strongest advocate, of by course, in the Opposition for the blocking of mining and sale of uranium is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, (Mr Uren). In view of those previous statements by the former Government in favour of the mining and sale of uranium, why is the Leader of the Opposition now strongly taking this attitude aided, I take it, by some of his supporters in the coming struggle for leadership of the Australian Labor Party? I put to the House that it is because he is looking for left wing support in his leadership struggle. With regard to the wording of this matter of public importance concerning the Fraser Government's alleged efforts to pre-empt and distort the uranium debate, I would say that there has been much opportunity in this place, in another place and outside to debate this issue but the Labor Party has not taken that opportunity to bring this matter before the House. In answer to a question on 11 November 1976, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said: If the wider community wishes to debate these matters, obviously it will be able to discuss the decisions which the Government has so far taken. It was subsequently stated in the Sydney Moming Herald of 26 March that the uranium debate seems in danger of fizzling out. The Opposition has been objecting to the mining and export of uranium, yet it is not really mounting any major argument. This matter is now brought to the attention of the House by the Leader of the Opposition. Since the time that this debate was initiated by the Minister for Environment, Housing and policy Community Development (Mr Newman), the that Government has adopted a steady and evenhanded approach to the debate and to the minand export of uranium. It has done this because it has not wished to pre-empt the debate the which is exactly what it has been accused of doing. In actual fact, the Government has been awaiting the second Fox report before taking any major decisions. I believe that it is the Labor Opposition which has pre-empted the decision of Justice Fox. It has said that there will be no a export of uranium, whereas we on this side of the House are awaiting that report before reaching any decisions. It is complete and utter nonsense for this matter to have been brought before the House in the way in which it is worded. Of course the Government realises that there are environLeader mental factors and that safeguards regarding health and pollution must be given great importance. This is what the Fox report is all about. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition tioned Kakadu National Park and said that this tremendous national park would be disadvantaged by being surrounded by uranium mining. I take it that he was referring to the Jabiluka However, he overlooked the fact that the Aborupon iginal Land Rights Bill, which was initiated the Labor Government when it was in office, gives rise to a potential claim for that area by Aborigines. Supposedly, then, the land would leased back as a national park. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is using a false argument that this National Park would be in jeopardy because of these operations. He would know as well as I do that the waters that run into the Arafura Sea and the Alligator tributaries are loaded with uranium and that no one seems to be suffering from that at the ment. Nor will they, I am sure. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned that we matter must look sanely at the industry to see what benefits will come from it. One must look at the safety aspect and the lution and environmental aspect of the question. Let me speak to honourable members as a son who operates in and out of the city of Darwin which was devastated in 1974. This industry, which would be located only a matter of a few hundred miles or even less from Darwin, would give tremendous fillip to the people who live the area and to the rehabilitation of Darwin of the Northern Territory which is suffering the same manner as are most other primary industry areas because of the cattle prices. That industry also would give a the Aborigines in the area in that they could work in such a tremendous commercial setup lieve which would have the effect of rehabihtating the mission port of Darwin and the city of Darwin, as well as faced inthink the whole economy of the Northern Territory. I think you have to weigh one thing against other. It has been mentioned that 10 000 jobs could result from the setting up of such an industion try. Australia at this moment is not flush with ployment, although I think thefiguresare somesays times rather strange, and the Northern Territory would benefit in that regard from such an induscause try. I am certain that most of the people in the Northern Territory would support the arguments put forward for the mining and the export of station uranium because I think that they look at things in a somewhat more down-to-earth way than bers many people in the south, such as the Deputy of the Opposition who has been shouting at me consistently, view their affairs.",38
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. I call the menhonourable member for Hotham.,39
110,Mr CHIPP,URANIUM,"I thank you for your call, Mr Deputy Speaker. In my new situarea. ation, I propose to speak only on those issues which I feel strongly. I know that it presents by difficulties to parties on both sides of the chamber to have an independent member in the the House. I will not abuse that position in seeking be permission to speak, but this happens to be one issue about which I feel very strongly. I am still getting used to Mr Speaker's decision to place me in this position in the House. To be placed to the right of the National Country Party is bad enough, but to be placed to the left of the Labor River and its Party is even worse. It is no wonder that people who listen to the mobroadcast of the parliamentary proceedings get disgusted with politics. I am delighted that this is on the business sheet for today. I am not happy about the way in which it has been raised by the Australian Labor Party because I think it polis a facetious and capricious way of trying to score a cheap political point. Instead of putting peron the notice paper the subject of uranium, important as it is, the Labor Party draws attention to the Government's efforts to 'pre-empt and distort the uranium debate'. I do not agree that the Government has done that. If the arguin ment had been that the Government has not and encouraged debate in this House I might have in been attracted to that proposition. But at the same time the Labor Party has shown no inclination to have the subject of uranium debated in tremendous fillip to this House. We are talking about something which I beand which Mr Justice Fox and his Comis the most important issue ever this country, because it is not only a question of what the high level or low level the wastes might do to Australians in the mining, milling and enriching of uranium but also a questhat can affect the whole of the human race emand life on this planet. In fact, the Fox report that the radio-toxic properties of uranium and its by-products do cause cancer and may gene mutations in future generations. So the subject we are debating today does not concern simply the importance of a Newport power or the pollution of a Fraser Island. It is a question of high morality. Have we, the memof this Parliament and this generation, got the moral right to commit an act, namely to allow our uranium to be sold and enriched which may affect future generations, according to the Fox report? As far as I can see that is debating. I would Uke to disagree with my close friend, the honourable member for the Northern Territhat tory (Mr Calder), when he described the Labor Party policy. I am not defending the Labor Party; I am just saying that the honourable ber for the Northern Territory said that the icy of the Labor Party is that there will be export of uranium. As far as I could understand him, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. Whitlam) today did not say anything of the kind. Nor did the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) who is the Opposition spokesman on this issue. I personally wish that they had that. I wish that some poltiical party would come out with that view-n o export of uranium until we can answer the points made in the Fox report. Is there any way in which we can control the low level and high level wastes? I have-been debating that point around the country with some very distinguished people who have expressed views both for and against the proposition. I deplore the statement made by the Minister for EnvironmUlions ment, Housing and Community Development ages (Mr Newman) when he said that the debate has been continuing, deplorable though the state the debate may be. I will come back to that point in a moment. On every occasion that I have appeared on a platform- I have been on them with distion tinguished scientists who have of mining uranium- I simply say: 'Do you have an answer to that section of the Fox report which says that there is at present no generally accepted means by which high level wastes can be manently isolated from the environment?' The high level wastes cause cancer, may cause gene mutations in future generations and last for 500 000 years. My point is simple: I am not necessarily against the use of nuclear energy. am not necessarily against the selling of uranium. But what I am against is the mining and selUng it by Australia-in fact, by anybody-unul scigiven ence can tell us that we are not going to commit future generations to cancer or possible gene tations. That, to me, is the crux of the argument. I have heard nothing from Government of 2 speakers or from Labor Party speakers to change my mind. The Labor Party talked about honourmatically ing contracts. In doing so they take up that ition which I am taking up. As far as I am conthe cerned, I am the only member of this Parliament who is prepared to say: 'No mining of uranium, no export of uranium, until the scientists can us some sort of guarantee of controlling all the wastes, some guarantee in relation to the nonwhat we are proliferation treaty, and so on'. The honourable member for Blaxland said the Labor Party, if it comes to office will not honour any contracts without national consensus. I was most interested in that statement. memNeither the honourable member for Blaxland polnor the Leader of the Opposition went on to say no how the Labor Party would get that consensus. But I am indebted to my friend, the honourable G. member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), who tells me that a friend of his, a Mr Des Shield, in Hobart put this suggestion to him: Why does not the Government hand out a small booklet which said puts the pros and cons of the uranium debate? Why does it not spend as much money on such a booklet and disseminating it to the people-suc h a booklet would carry the 'yes' case and the 'no' case-as we spend on issues which are of far less importance than that of uranium? It is a suggestion which my friend from Denison gave me and which I pass on to the Minister and to the Government. If we are prepared to spend of dollars on booklets about the retiring of judges or simultaneous elections, important issues though they may be, why cannot we of spend simUar amounts on the uranium question? I do not think there is a person in this House who would think that the question of uranium which we are discussing today is not more important than those other matters. I think that the suggesI have outlined is one well worthy of spoken in favour consideration. The Minister suggests that the Fox report is freely avaUable. The fact is that it is not freely peravaUable. Countless people have come to me saying that they have been to the places where the Department told them they could get a copy and that they just cannot get one. As I have said before this question is the most important one I that this House has ever debated. We have had only 2 hours debate on it on a previous occasion. of The debate was then adjourned, although I was an undertaking by the Leader of the House on the night on which the debate took place that mua vote would be taken on it that night. I then moved a proposed amendment for a moratorium years. I was in the House. At half past ten, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the House autoproceeds to the adjournment motion. posOn the undertaking given to me by the Leader of House (Mr Sinclair) I was prepared to vote. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) talked outtimeon that night and the matter was give automatically adjourned and did not reappear. I feel a gross discourtesy was paid to me that night. But that is not important; what is important is that obviously there was an arrangement between the Liberal Party, the National Country Party and the Australian Labor Party on that night to get that debate off the agenda. There must have been, because I was told that there would be a vote. After the Parliament was prorogued the matter did not even appear on the notice paper. I am indebted to the Leader of the House and to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, who is at the table. He gave notice that the matter would be reintroduced. I now give informal notice that when it is, if given the opportunity, I shall test the members of this House by moving an amendment to the motion before the chair that there be a moratorium on mining and nulling Australian uranium. The House will soon go into recess. The Ranger report No. 2 will come out in the recess, as I understand it. I hope the Minister wiU stick to his word by not making a decision until that Report comes down. But that means that a decision could be made by the Government during the recess. I warn those listening to the debate who wish to contact their members of Parliament to give their views on this matter that time is running out.",39
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,"The discussion is now concluded. NA (ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION) BILL Debate resumed from 24 March, on motion by Mr Eric Robinson: That the Bill be now read a second time.",41
112,Mr MCLEAN,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"When this debate was interrupted last Thursday I was giving my support to the Government's decision to provide once again substantial funds to the Asian Development Bank. I had indicated that in terms of the statement of subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank, Australia, on a per capita basis, is probably the most generous contributor to the Asian Development Bank of all the industrialised nations of the world. I also indicated that such support is essential on humanitarian grounds and constitutes an obligation which we share with all developed countries with respect to multilateral aid institutions of this kind. I further stated that in view of Australia's strategic position in this region our support is also justified more pragmatic and political grounds. However, I should like to query one aspect of the activity of the Asian Development Bank concerning the considerable reciprocal business which is generated by the loan and investment activities of the Bank. This matter was also raised by the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) earlier in the debate. It is well known that participation by the developed countries of the Asian Development Bank gives them therightto participate in procurement of goods and services under Asian Development Bank loans. Borrowers are permitted normally to use the proceeds of a bank loan only for procurement in member countries of goods and services produced by them. Similarly, consultingfirmsand consultants are also selected only from member countries. But I understand that the bulk of this business-som e 40 per cent of it-is directed to Japan, 8 per cent is directed to the United States of America and only 2 per cent accrues to Australia. We are substantial contributors to the Bank and I should Uke to know the reasons for the fact that we do not fare well in this regard. As the Bank's procurement policies are based on open, competitive bidding I would suggest that one major reason for Australia missing out in this area is the high rates of inflation we have experienced in recent years as compared to other countries. This probably is a perfect example of how continuing high inflation rates can have an adverse effect on our international competitiveness. I should be grateful if the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Viner) could assure 1977 me and the House that this is the only reason for our poor performance in this regard and that it is Second Reading not due to other administrative or non-market factors. I am concerned about this matter particularly in view of the significance of Australia's subscription to the capital stock of the Bank in relation to other members, the detaUs of which I outlined in the debate last Thursday evening. I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that Australia should contribute to the Asian Development Bank on the understanding that it gets some kind ofpro rata return, but I do believe it is a legitimate area of concern which I hope the Minister will be able to clarify for me. I should also like to know from the Minister what follow-up steps are taken by the Asian Development Bank to ensure that projects, once implemented, are successfully maintained in the recipient countries. I ask this because of the fact that the Bank works on a project by project basis on because the average amount lent for projects financed by the Bank is well in excess of $ 10m and especially because, to my understanding, the Bank has no resident staff or branch offices in member countries. Perhaps the Minister can provide some reassurances in this matter. But it should also be noted that Australia has contributed substantially in the past to the Bank's soft loan activities through its contribution to the Asian Development Fund. This area of activity was also outlined in some detail last Thursday by the honourable member for Eden Monaro. These loans are concessional loans made to the poorest of the Bank's members. This Government indicated last year that this aid must be continued and expanded. I fully support that view and was pleased that Australia recently agreed to contribute her allocated amount of the replenishment to this fund at a cost of $US41.6m. These loans are made on standard terms of 40 years maturity including a 10-year grace period, with a service charge of 1 per cent per annum. In 1976, as stated in the Minister's second reading speech, these special loans totalled $US236m out of total bank loans of $US776m. This is a substantial proportion. Some people have questioned the capacity of the Bank to do this and still to ensure its creditworthiness in the capital markets of the world where it competes for funds. I feel that 2 points should be made in this regard. Firstly, the Bank operates in the poorest developing region of the world and must therefore finance some of its transactions in a way which allows assistance to reach those countries which need it most. This kind of assistance has primarily gone to the very poor nations such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Burma, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Secondly, concessional loans are not made from funds borrowed by the Bank. The soft loans are made from the Bank's special funds which are, to quote the charter of the Bank: Held, used, committed, invested, or otherwise disposed of entirely separate from the ordinary capital resources Bank. I am pleased that the Government has honoured its obligation to the poorer countries of this region by its substantial contribution to both the hard and soft loan activities of the Bank. While I was speaking last Thursday the honourable member for Banks (Mr Martin) interjected that this Government was not doing enough with respect to our foreign aid program. A number of my constituents have also written to me on this matter. I remind the House again that Australia's official development assistance of 0.5 per cent of gross national product is well above the average for the developed nations of the world. I agree that it should be more, and so should the contributions of all developed countries. I believe that this Government shares that view. I am pleased that this Government has set itself the longer term target of devoting 0.7 per cent of our gross national product to our foreign aid programs. In the meantime, it is gratifying to note that on a per capita basis our contribution to the Asian Development Bank which serves the poorest developing region of the world surpasses the contributions of all the developed nations. I am pleased to be able to support the Bill presently before the House.",41
113,Mr LES JOHNSON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"I also support, as does the Opposition, the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill. The debate has been of a non-partisan nature since it is evident that there is a very strong inclination to have regard to the need for Australia to make a contribution to the developing countries in our region particularly, but in other parts of the world as well. The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to make an additional share capital subscription, on behalf of Australia, to the Asian Development Bank of $US346.1m, of which 10 per cent will be paid over a period of 4 years commencing in 1977-78 with the balance remaining on call. This represents Australia's fuU entitlement in the general increase of $US5,004m or 135 per cent being made to the authorised capital of the Bank. As the honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean) said, Australia is a good performer in this field. From what I can see we are exceeded in our contributions only by Japan, the United States and India. Mention of India as a contributor to the Bank is an indicator that the people who benefit are also involved from a dual point of view as recipients and as contributors. This of course evokes a very great sense of responsibiUty on the part of all the participants. It is interesting to note in the Asian Developof the ment Bank's quarterly review of OctoberNovember 1976 that the Bank's total lending passed the $3 billion mark on 23 September last year when its Board approved a $32m loan for a development project in the Republic of Korea. By the end of the year's third quarter the Bank had approved, in all, 270 loans totalling $3,009.10m for 247 projects in 21 countries. As one goes through that very interesting quarterly review, it is interesting to note the nature of the disbursement of funds. There is a very high emphasis on financing public utilities. Some 35 per cent of the funds went in that direction. Agriculture attracted some 22.7 per cent of the funds; industry, 21.9 per cent and transport and communications, 19 per cent. I see that education attracted only a very small, if not infinitesimal, part of the funds-1.0 7 per cent. One wonders whether it might not be advantageous in the medium and longer term to expand the allocation under that heading. A great deal of philosophical conjecture can be brought to bear on this matter. We all recall that for many years aid was used as a weapon of the cold war. Countries gave assistance for the purpose of deriving direct regional advantage, sometimes in consideration of defence requirements and matters of that kind. I do not think that Australia has pursued its aid policy along those lines. I certainly do not advocate that it should do so. There has also been some philosophical conjecture to the effect that Australia and other countries should have the right to tie their aid to the potential repurchasing that could take place in Australia or in other donor or contributing countries. I do not disparage that suggestion altogether. I think that it is a fair sequel to aid and one to which we could turn a very factual eye in the future. There is no question that when a country like Australia contributes to another country's development in the Asian region, benefits are Ukely to accrue. When we develop a purchasing capacity, a consumer demand capacity, it follows that Australia would be among the countries which could derive benefit. One could talk about many matters on this Bill. As former Minister for Housing and Construction, I had the good fortune to be very deeply involved with the work of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation which, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, has a very direct association with our aid program in that it has been associated with about 22 countries around the world. I believe that although SMEC, as this organisation is called, is in a very competiton, tive situation, the Government should not let up in any way in the endeavour to keep SMEC in the vanguard of this functionary aid program. Our technicians go into the consultative field, exposing to these developing countries the way in which their own resources can be developed. I have noticed from studying the Bank's annual report- I commend the study of that report to honourable members to see the work done-the wide range of countries that have been the subject of investigatory programs. For example, the report refers to the work done in the hydrological area in the upper NUe basin, the feasibility study of the power station in Ghana and the great projects in Indonesia which I have had the privUege of visiting-wate r studies and road projects, some of which we have directed in a very effective way. Our aid has gone to the PhUippines, Malaysia and ThaUand the into the Pacific area as well. I believe that this is a very valuable part of our aid program. Another matter which deserves some mention at present is the Common Fund which is currently the subject of some controversy in the United Nations. The aim of this Common Fund is to protect developing countries from fluctuations in export earnings. The aim is also said to be to improve market access and reliabUity of supply for primary products, to diversify production in developing countries, and to improve market structures, distribution and transport systems for commodity exports of developing countries. What is Australia's position in regard to the Common Fund? I am told, following some research in the Parliamentary Library and through other processes, that in Nairobi in 1976, Australia did not oppose the adoption of the resolution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on the establishment of the Common Fund. But at the conference being conducted at present in Geneva, Australia has refused to state its position. The delegation to the Geneva talks is from the Department of Overseas Trade. Its attitude, reflecting the attitude of this Government, has alienated already most of our Asian neighbours. A report from the conference quotes a senior Asian diplomat as saying: I can't understand that on a question so vital to all ASEAN Countries Australia can be so indifferent to it. I draw attention to this matter which I think is very relevant to the question that is before the House at present. In essence, the Common Fund is involved with the 10 predominant basic export products in the developing countries. The commodities in the integrated program, these 10 core commodities, include coffee, cocoa, copper, cottea, tin, rubber, jute,fibresand sugar. There are 8 other commodities in a subsidiary group which includes meat, bananas, bauxite, iron ore, manganese, phosphates, tropicaltimbers,oU and oil seeds. It would be apparent to all honourable members that the stabilising of these industries and agricultural pursuits would contribute very significantly to the well-being of the people in the producing areas. In addition, it would advantage people in the importing areas. Australia is affected in regard to several of the commodities mentioned. There is no doubt that in the Mount Lyell situation we would have been very greatly advantaged if the Common Fund had been in operation. I am told that an independent observer attending the Common Fund Negotiating Conference in Geneva, Mr Rollason, has some very pointed and critical comments to make about this matter. He said: The Developing Countries known as the Group of 77 dissatisfied with the lack of progress, and their impatience with the Western industrialised countries known as hasreachedfrustration level. According to Mr Rollason, apparently there now talk of a walk out, and the objective estabhshing a Common Fund could be in jeopardy. Australia, as a major commodity and a member of Group B, could have led the Speaker. way into real negotiations. For known to the Government, apparently it has the matter before theinseparably steadfastly refused. The trade official who is leading the Australian delegation, Mr Colin Teese, is said to have admitted that 'we have not Development taken a decision as to whether we will support a Bank (Special Common Fund'. He does not understand what is Asian meant by a Common Fund. That seems to be tion) used as a standing or holding position in the negotiations taking place in the United Nations at the presenttime. Mr Teese is said to have present, Australia' summed up the Australian position by saying: We will reserve till the end therightto decide accept or reject the Common Fund. The reaction to this, according to Mr Rollason, very adverse. He said: Australia's non-position is not winning us any amongst our regional neighbours either. The substantial efforts to improve relations with ASEAN Countries Foreign Minister Peacock is rapidly being undermined by the Trade Depanment delegation present at this Conference. This is a communique dated 24 March. I believe it is of such urgency that it ought to command the immediate attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs because the reactions attributed to some of the spokesmen from neighbouring countries tain are very alarming indeed. The Conference Amterm, bassador of Indonesia, who is a spokesman for the Group of 77, is said to have named Australia as one of the countries with whose position was very disappointed. The Malaysian represenwe tative had something similar to say, as did the representative from Papua New Guinea. The Conference Ambassador of the Philippines- I am just skimming through this communiquethat stressed the importance of'developing relations between neighbours in our South East Asian Region' and commented that there should be maximum effort to see each other's viewpoints. The Malaysian representative commented that he had expected Australia to take a more underprivate standing attitude of'our aspirations' not only cause of 'our close relations' but also because Australia is a major producer of commodities.",42
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK," Order! The debate is on the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill. As I understand the position, the honourable member has been off that topic for the last 8 minutes. I think the are principles involved in the House on these sorts of debates aUow a degree of free-ranging debate. I Group B invite-I put it at no higher level than that-the honourable member for Hughes to return to the is substance of the Bill, perhaps as he is getting of towards the end ofhis speech. producer Mr LES JOHNSON-Thank you, Mr Deputy I have substantially made the point reasons best many facets oftoaid which I wanted make on this matter. There are associated with House. We have entwined within this issue the provisions of the Asian Bank Act, the Asian Development Funds Contributions) Act, the Development Bank (Additional SubscripAct. It would be quite impossible for anybody to separate those matters from the one bephilosophical fore the House. In terms of the total issues under contemplation at s performance in the past, its current performance and its future performance whether we are certainly very relevant. Our aid will take different forms. Another Bill is listed on the is notice paper for debate-the Australian Development Assistance Agency (Repeal) Bill. friends It would be inappropriate for honourable members to talk at length about that today, yet it by would be an absurd proposition to discount it as it is directly related to the subject before the House at present. I applaud the activity taking place under the Asian Development Bank. I am glad that the contributions which Australia is making to susit are substantial. I believe that in the longAustraUa, although at present it is in a contributory situation, stands to be one of the most significant beneficiaries under the Asian he Development Bank concept. I am very glad that have no direct tie-up in terms of security, foreign policy or matters of that kind. It is very important for us not to be superficial in our analysis of these matters because the facts are such aid is capable of being the subject of abuse. All of us will recall from some time ago the criticism of aid programs to which Austraha was a contributor, particularly the Colombo Plan, when it was said that there was abuse in terms of material being thieved and used by the sector and that buses were being probevided and if something on the bus broke down it would Ue there and an enormous waste of funds would be involved. It is very interesting to note that there is still a great deal of criticism of aid programs around the world. Before I came into the House today I was looking at a paper provided by a prominent, if not eminent, staff member of the World He was complaining that profits from the land in India's Punjab region had risen by 500 per cent as international and large national comgross panies moved into the agricultural business. We the must keep our eye on that kind of matter to see that the people in general rather than vate entrepreneur are the beneficiaries. This gentleman, Mr Ladejinsky, complained that in respect of aid to India tenants of generations being forced to become hire labourers and that in 2 districts there were 70 000 of those evicted from farms are moving into city slum situations. He is making the point that should do everything we can to ensure that our aid program contributes to the success and surthat vival of labour intensive industries, whether be primary or secondary industries. I believe must have a long-term view of these things. would have liked this Bill and the other Bill which I mentioned to be debated cognately so that there could be a more general coverage of this Bank. these matters. I commend the Bill. I believe that Australia will have to do even more to increase its aid program.",44
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,Order! The Johnson) honourable member's time has expired.,45
116,Mr BRADFIELD,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"I , too, rise to support the generosity of the Australian well Government in this Bill which allocates $34.6m opening as its contribution this year to the Asian countries Development Bank. I am pleased too that memation exists bers of the Opposition are supporting this Bill. This is one of the humane occasions of political life on which we are able to support proposals (DMCs) that contribute to and help the economies of effects other people who are in greater need than the addressing people of this country. Australia's contribution was originally allocated in the 1976-77 Budget. criticism from people, including of the Opposition, that Australia is not giving enough in overseas aid. Nevertheless, we are giv- (ii) ing a greater amount year by year. Certainly, we cal gave a greater amount in 1976-77 than had previously been given. I would like to read just one section from Budget Paper No. 8 entitled it Australia's Official Development Assistance Developing Countries 1976-77 which Ulustrates the generosity of this country. It states: The Government's commitment to assist developing tries is reflected in its decision gram for 1976-77 by IS per cent at a time when the growth in public expenditure is being curtailed. That is quite generous. It further states: The total provision for Australia's official development asBank. sistance (ODA) in 1976-77 is $398,504,000. sale of That is almost $400m. It continues: This is estimated torepresent0.49 per cent of the forecast national product for that year, which compares with average for member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cosome prioperation and Development . . . Their average, of course, was 0.36 per cent. We have gone a long way towards fulfilling our aim are of providing 0.5 per cent of our GNP by way of assistance. Hopefully next year we will be able to evictions. Many achieve that goal. Australia has a very proud record in regard to we the contribution it makes to the Asian Development Bank which is the subject of this Bill. I say notwithstanding the fact that Australia also they contributes to other simUar banks, such as the we World Bank, that are dedicated to helping counI tries in need. The Asian Development Bank is only one of the three or four banks to which we contribute. Our record is the same in respect to It is worth whUe noting the 1975 annual report of the Asian Development Bank. I fully realise that the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les has presented somefiguresfrom the 1976 quarterly report of the Bank. However, the annual report to which I refer points out very the aims of the Bank. It also points out in its remarks the recognition that it takes of the economic problems that many of its member had in 1975. No doubt the same situtoday. The report states: . . . most of the Bank's developing member countries suffered severely from the effects of world-wide recession, inflation and widening trade imbalances, and these will be felt to an even greater degree in future years. In itselfto its members' needs and problems, many of which are of a long-term nature, the Bank's efforts were directed to: (i) raising urgently needed additional resources to sustain I have heard its operationssome members That is very necessarymaintaining the momentum of its lending and techniassistance activities and (iii) bringing its assistance to bear where the needs appeared to be greatest. I agree very strongly with the third point because really covers the reason for its establishment, to namely, to provide funds to people who under normal circumstances, through normal financial institutions and normal banking avenues would have difficulty in raising funds to meet their counneeds. The report further states: to increase Australia's aid proMuch of the lending in 1975 was directed to sectors where the need for accelerated development was most urgent-3 7 per cent to agriculture and agriculture-related activities and 29 per cent to public utilities . . . This, of course, is mainly for power projects in these countries about which we have seen much publicity lately. The report goes on to talk disbursements during the year. A look at the record of the member countries of the Bank shows that Australia has performed outstandingly. On average each of the 41 memis ber countries provides 2Vi per cent of the Bank's capital. But Australia accepts a far greater tribution than the average obligation. It subwe scribes 12 per cent of the total capital of Bank. Australia is making a very generous and worthwhUe gesture when we consider that a without country of our size subscribes 12 per cent of capital when the average is 2Vi per cent. The Asian Development Bank has been that operating for only nine or ten years. Therefore is relatively in its infancy. The Bank financed only 7 projects in 1968 which was thefirstyear its operation. But 9 years later the number projectsfinancedby the Bank grew to 228. 1975 the total amount in terms of loans on ects had grown to $2,500m. Thefigurespremore sented by the honourable member for Hughes in respect of the quarterly report of the Bank for 1976 show that the amount is now over $3,000m. So we can see that the Bank has a very healthy growth rate. I will not go through the Ust of member tries and the contributions they make because this aspect of the Bill has been covered adthat equately by previous speakers. However, memwrought bers of the public listening to this debate and tainly some members of this House will no doubt think that 41 member countries sounds a lot, even in a world-wide context. Notwithstanding that, 41 countries do not really go a long way when one looks at the Asian and Pacific areas. is rather surprising how many countries there in these regions. The list is quite impressive. Of course, outside of Japan, Australia is making the greatest contribution. Members of Parliament-this happens in electorate and no doubt it happens in the electorand ates of many other honourable members-ar e actions, approached consistently by good Australian people who ask us to try to persuade our Government to put more money into Australian assistance to overseas countries. This year we haverightly so-directe d much of our overseas money towards New Guinea. This does not mean that we have neglected other Asian countries. New Guinea is a developing country. It has recently gained its independence and it is to this country that the bulk of the money should go. In supporting this Bill I certainly commend the Government, as I have done already. I would about Uke to tell the Australian people that this Government does not intend to stop with a contribution of 0.49 per cent of our gross national product towards overseas aid. We want to get it up to the target of 0.5 per cent. The Government genuine in wanting to assist countries in need. But is should be borne in mind that, as the report consuggested, when we have economic problems as do at the moment-the y are not of a serious the nature-w e must give money in an organised manner and it must be money that we can afford placing great burdens and strains on the the Australian taxpayer and without taking funds from other sections of the Australian community where money is needed also. So we recognise there is need in Asian countries for funds. At it the same time there is some need at home among the people of Australia. Although we will follow of the policy of increasing this amount of funds, it of must be done in an organised way. I know that In the honourable member for Dawson (Mr projBraithwaite) wants to follow me withfiguresin detail. So I simply say that I support the Government on this Bill. I thank the Opposition for supporting it. The money will go to good use.",45
117,Mr BRYANT,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"The honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) said he was counenthusiastic. He did not sound all that enthusiastic. On the whole I am prepared to agree there are worsefieldsof destruction being by this Government on previous procergrams than there is in this area of assistance to other countries. I agree with everybody who has said that Australia relatively does pretty well in this field and that compared with other people we do not do too badly. I can only say about that It that in this field you do not have to shine very are brightly to be a star. The world is more concerned with other things in general than with lifting the Uving standards of suffering humanity in South East Asia or anywhere else. I suppose that Australia on the whole has managed to create a my very favourable impression around the world particularly in our part of the world by its but it is mostly the people in the field who manage to produce this result. My friend the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) mentioned the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and its present activities. The Snowy Mountains people of course have established a pre-eminence in some of the engineering fields, particularly in such ventures as road making and so on. I remember that when we were in north-west Thailand a few years ago we saw the Snowy Mountains Engin10 eering Corporation team working there on the Tak-Mae Sod road between Burma and for Thailand. These people were the superstantial professionals in the business. Not only did they bring a professional approach; they also broughtsmall a style of operation which was a lesson and example to other people. One of the interesting things about our own professionals is that they do not seem to mind taking their coats off and getting underneath the bulldozer, getting their clothes and themselves dirty, if something wrong. By contrast many of the professional interest people who work with them in the field think it is against their highest professional ethics to their hands dirty. Austrahans on the ground arefor people who get on with the job, who mix with the local citizenry and who are prepared to comnations municate about how you do the job. Australian people on the whole get a pretty good pay-off the form of goodwill. I might say that this pretty much the way with the people from Newworld Zealand. I find that around the various parts the world where they operate they at actually getting on with the job and getting full value for their money. Taking the general principles upon which are operating, I am not too sure that we have answered here this afternoon some of the ques-Speaker, tions which have been raised about all the oper-no ations of the Asian Development Bank. I was interested in the comments by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury), who pointed out that although we had committed a fair amount of funds to the Asian Development Bank in the past some of it did not seem to have been taken up. Like me, he was a bit puzzled about the actual details of it all. Perhaps we not get adequate information in this Parliament about the systems we are supporting in the rest the world. Perhaps the Parhament itself, throughknow its various committee systems, ought to take a more active interest in it and it ought to look things more closely on the ground. We are send-our ing groups of parliamentarians overseas continuduties. ously, but I do not know that we get the detailed analysis on the ground of Australian activities that we ought to get out of that. I would expect that part of that flows from the fact that the liament itself is often isolated from the activities of the institutions it creates, whether it is Development Bank or the Department of not Foreign Affairs. Not only are we isolated, but often times we are insulated from proper information. Let us look at the figures that are involved. Australia's contribution of $346m over the next years-abou t $34m is to be paid out now and the rest is to be on call-whil e a substantial sum most of the people of the world is not a subsum as far as Australia is concerned. It is a reasonable contribution but it makes a pretty impact upon the great sea of trouble that an we call South East Asia. I am not sure in my own heart that the banking system is the best way by which to contribute to the development of underdeveloped communities. It is true that we use in this case some techniques that we could well use goes at home; for example, special concessional rates. In this instance Australia, by giving its support to the Asian Development Bank, beget comes a supporter of the guarantees of the Bank its continued borrowing overseas. I think we should be trying to avoid putting the developing into the hands of the moneylenders of the world. No matter what kinds of institutions inthey are, the continuing demand of interest payis ments on development programs around the is a miUstone for the future. Australia has of had enough of that itself. There must be other are very goodways in which we can do it. One of the great difficulties with the banking system is that you are likely to deal more successwe fuUy with the people who have the least need of your services. You will forgive me, Mr Deputy if I am pessimistic enough to think that matter whether it is the Asian Development Bank, the Australian private banks or even in some areas our own publicly owned banks, banks are likely to be in the hands of people who are very conservative when they have to consider the factors that are involved in supporting the activities in the banking system. We have acquired some fairly progressive bankers in this do institution on occasions. Perhaps they may not be here all that long, but they make a good conoftribution whUe they are here. Some of the ones I quite well have done so. But it is more the pity if we have taken the progressive bankers out atof the banking system. Therefore perhaps it is pubUc duty to return them to their active The real problem we face in this part of the world is the tapping of unused resources. These Par-resources are in the flow offinanceand funds throughout the community but they are also in Asian the development of community resources. I am sure that the traditional banking system is the best way in which we can mobUise them, because we are deaUng with a group of people who have enormous resources at their disposal. In 1969 or 1970 I visited Burma. One of the things that struck me about Burma was that it was a country with almost everything going for it except its Government. I suppose it is in the same position as Australia. It has a substantiaUy sohd munity Ufe going back for some 2000 years, withtheir a cultivated society torn into poltiical discord over the last few years and now ruled by mUitary people. The earth in Burma is especiaUy fertile. Its rivers are immense and it has oU, timber and other resources. Its principal deficiency is administration. Like many other countries suffers from poor government and totally inadHonourable equate adrninistrative systems. No matter we do and no matter how often this Parliament debates questions of overseas aid, somehow have to start to create systems of support for administration throughout the world. Without access at the moment to any of the detaUed reports on the work of the Bank, but noting some of the things that have been said here, one has to remark that most of the support seems to go to very large development programs of one sort or another throughout this part of world. I hope that we will be able tofindsome way by which the great skUls of administration which are some of the by-products of Western society-thos e skiUs are pretty meagre in the rest of the world-ca n be transferred to the communijob ties to our north and north-west. I do not know how this can be tackled. I suppose that it could be done by support for local government. If we can give local governments in that part of world funds at concessional rates and if we supply then with technical training systems so on we will probably be doing more for than by bolstering up many of their central governments. As I see it, it will be a long whUe before most of those central governments are able to administer their countries in a way in which we expect this country to be administered. I suppose that during the 3 years when Labor was in government we were not able to do as effort. much as we wished to do in these matters, but I wish that this Government would apply itself more directly to the problem of supporting such projects in that part of the world. One of the questions that has been asked is: What do the Australian people feel? My observation, which supported by pretty soUd pubUc response on occasions, is that Australians are very prone supporting the needs of people outside this try. I have been a member of this place for fairly lengthy and, I hope, very constructive period. One of the things that has depressed is that members of the citizenry on the whole, their relationships with their Federal members Parliament, want to know what their Federal members of Parliament can do for them. People trudge up the stairs to our offices to tell us their telephone has been cut off. One cannot comblame the Telecom people because they want bUls to be paid. Other people may be in trouble with social security or repatriation matters. I do not think that it was until the Bangladesh crisis some 4 or S years ago that I received any real public response in the street. good People would come into my office and ask what it we were going to do about that problem. members who were here at that time what would remember the tremendous pressure put upon the Government to provide some substanwe tial support for the people of Bangladesh. I can recall in my very early life, in 1923 when I was quite young, collections being taken up in Australia for the victims of the Tokyo earthquake and my own one or two pence going into support the Japanese in that unhappy event. It was one of the ironies of international affairs that the by the time. I reached manhood we were spending our taxes and energy trying to knock the place down again. As I see it, in this country there is an enormous reservoir of goodwUl towards people who are less well off than we are. It is our tofindsome way of mobUising that goodwUl. I am not too sure that a lot of the funds around this country could not be ploughed into something similar to the Asian Development Bank. In the a country with a population of 13 million, 6 can mUUon or 7 mUlion people with bank accounts and might be prepared to invest $1,500 or $2,000 them over a period, which investment would be guaranteed by the Australian Government. I would not be surprised if the Government could raise very large sums continuously in this way, just as I presume many of the needs of the Australian Government could be supported in this way, but I think that we ought to be able to resolve that question by greater intellectual In dealing with institutions as substantial as the Asian Development Bank we should not concentrate on the large things to the exclusion of is the small things which would change the quaUty of life of communities in South East Asia. I to remember on one occasion visiting vUlages in counIndia. Those people do not need a mammoth a dam on the river. They do not need a power house. I recall one case where the power line me went past the vUlage only a mUe or two away and in some power was being connected. But the people of had no water supply. There were some wells on the edge of the village. The women went to the wells and carried the water back in the trathat ditional Indian manner, in water pitchers on their heads. That is very picturesque and I undertheir stand that it is good for the human form and riage, but it is an extremely wasteful way of doing it. Those villagers would have had their ment life transformed by 400 or SOO yards of one inch I thinkonit which water pipe, one electric pump and 6 or 7 taps- not fracture the sort of things that one finds lying around in on the back our their thousands in Australia. When I think of the many things that we distunity card I become disheartened. I have seen very real difference good equipment which is obsolete being sent off a poor quality of to the breakers and to tips in Australia. I recall stems basically from seeing a printing press being taken off be broken up with a hammer. The ordinary in their own society. they people in India would be very grateful to get difference between, say, the us their hands on such things. I realise the great and Switzerland. Probably the Khmer difficulties in creating a financial situation at the other end and an administrative system at this has end. I hope that with institutions such as the of Asian Development Bank we will be able to start same to do something about overcoming the immense tries. Any problems of transferring the surplus resources Government for food in this country, for instance, to the has followedtoinproceed hungry mouths and waiting stomachs of the people of South East Asia. It is a serious reflection on humanity that one of the biggest areas of trade between the wealthy countries and the non-wealthy countries is in arms. I forget what thefiguresare, but about three-quarters of the arms sold to the underwith developed countries come from the three richest and biggest countries such as Britain, America, France and Russia and the other counBank tries in their bloc. I do not want us to compete that field. If I had my way I would neither sell arms to nor purchase arms from other people. we could stop that trade we would make the world a better place in which to Uve. One of greatest problems at the moment with surplus meat is in processing it. I recall being told cost something like $700 a tonne just to process it. That was thefigurea couple of years ago. I sure that if we appUed all our slull, wisdom wit to the problem we could do better than that. Having done that, we have to transport the uct and thenfinda way of marketing it in a part of the world where the markets are in the hands of people who would prefer to transfer the funds avaUable to the acquisition of Mercedes cars or something Uke that for themselves. Perhaps in this area we could follow the example of the Austhe tralian Dairy Produce Board which has estabfore, Ushed its own marketing arrangements in variis ous parts of the world. In these areas I think we can learn something from capitalist do enterprises which have their own agencies and own subsidiaries scattered throughout the carworld wherever they want to market their goods. This is one of the areas of debate in this ParUawe all are basically in agreement. is good if in debates such as this we do shoulders by patting ourselves and saying how good we are. We have a long way to go. We have a great opporrest of to start to throw our weight around in the the world and demand more action. The between a good quaUty of Ufe and Ufe for people in a community the kind of government and and sent to the kind of stabUity that are able to develop Let consider the Khmer Republic Republic more going for it than Switzerland in the way climate and other things but the difference basically lies in the form of goverament. The applies to Australia and many other counencouragement that we can give to the along the path which it reduction in our effort-wU l be tencouraged this regard-tha is, no undue by this side of the House.",46
118,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"In rising to speak in this debate I do not want to take up a great deal of the time of the House. Most of the points have been debated. I agree most of the comments made by the honouror four able member for Wills (Mr Bryant). He suggested that perhaps the Asian Development was not the best means of distributing aid in or of showing that we have a concern for underdeveloped nations or for raising the standard of If living of countries whose standards of Uving is lower than ours, but by doing this through the our Bank we will have a permanent monitor to the type of aid-for it must be regarded as aidthat it which we are giving. Until a better monitor comes to the fore-and I am not suggesting that am improving the standards of local government in and those developing nations is the answer- I am quite happy to have our aid given in this fashion prodbecause in so many ways when foreign aid is given it is open to abuse, it is open to rumour that the amount of funds we are prepared to expend as a nation is not spent dollar for dollar within the recipient nation and by thetimeit is spent on the cause for which it was designed to be spent aid has diminished to a great extent. There I believe that the Asian Development Bank a suitable means by which we can fulfil our that obUgations to these underdeveloped nations. I not want to say that in any patronising way because there will always be a dispute as to what is sufficient, what we should be spending home, what we should be spending overseas. This debate will go on and views will differ person to person. In respect of the amount of money to which Australia is being committed, one wonders whether the giving of money is intended to to remove all obligations from a nation such as try, Australia. For instance, much has been said It about the high figure per capita that is being given by Australia. In terms of our population it is a rather generous donation but is it generous comparison with India which gives more? I conplying sider it to be a fine effort by India which is country in which the standards of living are so can offer. much lower than ours. I believe that they are the standards we should be aiming at, not standards based on the amount of money that is given. Quite a lot has been said in connection with what we would expect to receive in reciprocal trade for the amounts of money that we do forRiver ward and which are eventually lent. If these monies are expended in certain areas I would expect that in the short term our trade could increase considerably but I do not believe that that is the object of giving these funds. I was interested to hear the figure cited by able member for Barton (Mr Bradfield). He said that 37 per cent of these funds were lent in terms of agriculture. I agree with the emphasis honourable member placed on this more so than with what the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) said when he suggested that we process the meat and food here and send it over as aid. This is an extremely short term benefit, very short term relief. It probably puts 3 meals a into the stomachs of some person for just that one day but it does not give him permanent relief. I would Uke to see our foreign aid-an believe that the Asian Development Bank is doing this-g o towards raising the standard of future. agriculture. I refer to projects in Bangladesh such as the fertiliser project and agricultural Indonesia Java Fisheries Development is a recipient of this aid. Another project is palm processing. These projects wiU be continuing projects which wiU increase and improve the standards of living on a permanent something temporary. After all, can we increase the standards of living for a person in these nations by giving him one meal a day. But ifwe are going to give him one meal a day let us do on a permanent basis. I mention a project going on in Malaysia at the moment. This may not be covered by the Asian Development Bank but we should be exporting not only our money to these places but also our at expertise. If the honourable member for WUls wishes, we can export our management, too. In from Malaysia at the moment there is a project to develop a beef industry. I see this as being in no conflict whatsoever with our own export industry because Malaysia would probably never be able afford, on the standards of Uving in that counour imported meat. This project is only small. involves converting jungle to pasture and raising beef for local consumption. I see this as a tremendous project. I see it as a project in which in we have a constant monitor in that if we are supmanagement and that management is giva ing the best of expertise and advise that Australia It is not only in rural industries that I believe Australia is a leader. We could export our mining industry expertise to any place in the world and it would be well received. We have the technical abUity proven over many years in the Snowy project which has been mentioned. I notice that a report from the Bank indicates that this is the type of assistance that we should be looking at and I would hope that this is what Australia takes into account when it brings together its very foreign aid poUcy. We should be doing somethe honourthing of this permanent nature. Foreign aid, particularly within the South East Asian region, within the South Pacific area, must the always be regarded as a means of trade for Australia but more importantly as a means of defence. The honourable member for WUls indicated that he was disUlusioned at the fact that much of the exports from developed nations to underdeveloped nations was in cold hard cash day which was required for munitions and for defence. I believe that we are giving aid in a cheapened fashion but on a more permanent basis by d I giving aid to these areas which are our neighbours and with which we will be trading in the credit. In Mr MCVeigh-Giv e them more sugar.",49
119,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"That is one item I oU think we probably could export without giving them the expertise in growing for these places do not have the advantages of the Queensland coast basis, not as where sugar can be grown. It is in these areas that we estabUsh our reputation, not as people trying to cleanse our conit sciences or the consciences of 13 mUlion people just by giving a handout of funds and saying: 'That is the amount of money; we consider it enough, you can play with that'. If we do it in this other way by exporting expertise and management and monitoring projects we can make sure we are catering for the needs of these people and not simply providing the items which we think they need then I believe we will go a long way in our foreign policy and particularly in our defence. I did say I was not going to speak for a great length of time. I just wanted to bring forward these additional points because many Australians today are questioning the amount of money we are spending on foreign aid and how it is being applied. I for one do not believe that money given by us to other governments is a complete answer. At all times we must match it with the necessary expertise and management to make sure that the money is better spent. We should have a consistent and constant monitor on what we do, and I do not beheve that only the Public Service can give us this constant assessment of a project. There are many people throughout Australia who have in a practical sense been able to demonstrate their ability. They have been successful here. They are the type of people we should be sending overseas.",50
120,Mr VINER,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"Stirling-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (5.43)-in reply-Quite a number of honourable members on both sides of this House have spoken in this debate and I think that that in itself is indicative of the degree of interest this Parliament has in the overall question of overseas aid. It speaks well of the efforts of the Parliament that honourable members from both sides so readUy support this Bill which we are debating. As has been pointed out, the additional subscription to the Asian Development Bank which this Bill authorises is an important adjunct to Australia's overseas aid program. A number of points have been raised by a multitude of speakers but I will not endeavour to cover all of them. However, I will deal with some of the matters of particular substance. If in dealing with those I do not mention some of the other specific matters raised by honourable members then it is not because they are not of importance but simply in order to close the debate and I would invite honourable members who have participated in this debate and who wish to take up with me or the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) any of the matters mentioned in their speeches not to hesitate to do so. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) spoke rather disparagingly of the present Government's target and effort in the field of overseas aid generally. Other speakers from both sides of the House complimented the Government on its efforts in the field of overseas aid whUe suggesting ways in which that aid can be more effectively provided or spent in the recipient countries. Therefore, simply by way of general observation, I make some comment on what has been said. It is correct that the proportion of gross domestic product which Australia's overseas aid represents this year has declined from 0.55 per cent to 0.49 per cent. However, I point out that the amount of aid, as a proportion of gross domestic product, has varied from year to year over recent years. Although the Government regrets this dechne, nevertheless it must be viewed in the context of Australia's current economic position. Our first priority must be to make our own economy healthy. This, in turn, will obviously improve our capacity to help others. What we do on the domestic front will be of direct benefit in the future to the developing countries to which we provide aid. The Government is deeply concerned about the problems of the less developed countries and the huge difference between the incomes of those countries and those of the developed world. Australia has matched its expressions of concern with concrete measures designed to improve the position of less developed countries. International comparisons of aid performance, as pointed out by a number of speakers, indicate that Australia continues to rank high among which donors on the basis of both the terms on which aid is provided and the size of official development assistance as a proportion of gross domestic product. Virtually all of Australia's aid is given in grant form, and most of it is untied. I know from what has been said by previous speakers that all honourable members welcome this policy approach by the Government. The Government will ensure that Australia continues to shoulder its fair share in the provision of assistance to less developed countries. By way of example-thes e examples have been given before but are worth repeating-Australi a has undertaken to provide Papua New Guinea with at least $180m per annum over the next 5 years, largely in the form of budget support. Australia has pledged at least $86m to Indonesia and $60m to the South Pacific over 3 years. Not all of our aid is given bUateraily, of course. In addition to the proposal before the House concerning the Asian Development Bank, the Government has recently pledged $30.7m over 3 years as Australia's share of the Asian Development Fund replenishment. We have also decided to support a fifth replenishment target of $US7 bUUon to SUS7.5 billion for traditional donors for the International Development Association, and to maintain our existing share of 2.04 per cent of that target. This involves a commitment of $A 133.7m at current exchange rates. AU of this verifies the concern which Australia feels to bear its share of the provision of international aid to underdeveloped countries. The honourable member for Adelaide raised some technical questions concerning the effect overseas aid on the Budget deficit, whether adds to domestic demand and whether it has inflationary tendencies. I refer briefly to those aspects without seeking to go into them in great detaU. It is misleading to suggest that overseas aid expenditure should not be subject to conFund, straints within the Budget context on the arguat ment that it does not add to the domestic Budgetcussions deficit and has no effect on The provision of foreign aid involves the use of real resources by Australia for the benefit of other countries and this involves a reduction the resources that would otherwise be avaUable to Australian citizens. The process by which those resources are provided is complex. ever, as they involve a reduction in resources avaUable to Australian citizens, the Government must regard proposals for overseas aid expendirect ture in a sinular Ught to proposals for other government expenditure. In fact, a large probecause portion of overseas aid results in demands on Australian resources. In 1975-76, for instance, approximately 50 per cent of total overseas of $347m involved direct procurement by the Australian Government of goods and services. This was reflected in the domestic deficit. the remaining 50 per cent represented Australian Budget aid to Papua New Guinea. In 1975-76 it was $148m, a significant proportion of which would have been expended by Papua New ber Guinea in the purchase of goods and services from Australia. In total, probably 75 per cent 1975-76 overseas aid was thus directly reflected in demands on Australian resources. For 1976-77, the proportion would probably be similar. The honourable member for Adelaide also sought to make some point about possible under-which expenditure of the overseas aid program this year. If there is under-expenditure this year, wiU largely reflect the inabUity of the Aid to spend the allocation rather than any deUberimprovement ate decision to achieve savings by program. As all honourable members know, in the overall budgetary position of all departments for the whole of a financial year, for a variety legitimate reasons, expenditure may not reach the actual appropriation. Mention was made by a number of speakers of the Umted Nations vices Conference on Trade and Development Comable mon Fund negotiations and Australia's position. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les interested Johnson) went so far as to suggest that the position adopted by Australia showed that it was indifferent to the proposals put forward by developing countries. This is simply not true. of Australia has undertaken to discuss the Common it Fund proposal in UNCTAD without commitment. It is understandable that with developing proposals, in the sense that negotiations are continuing and proposals are being worked out, and differing proposals, with respect to the Common Australia would seek not to commit itself this stage but to participate in debates and disbefore making a final announcement on domestic liquidity. its position. There have been recent statements by Presiin dent Carter and others on these discussions and the negotiations about a Common Fund. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently been in Howthe United States of America and I have no doubt that he has been briefed on the position of that country at the present time. So it is not corto say that Australia is indifferent to what is happening in this area. It is of importance to us of the proposals to achieve a StabUisation of commodity markets and in the interests of developing countries themselves. A number of aid speakers mentioned the percentage of Australia's participation in procurement from the funds lent and provided by the Asian Most ofDevelopment Bank. They referred to the Japanese percentage of 40 per cent, the United States percentage of 8 per cent and Australia's percentage of 2 per cent. The honourable memfor Perth (Mr MCLean) particularly raised this point and sought an assurance that adminisoftrative or non-commercial factors did not lie behind this differential in percentage. I assure the honourable member that contracts awarded under bank loans are on the basis of international competitive bidding and open tendering and are in no way related to non-commercial factors. That, nevertheless, points out the room Australian industrial and professional services have to participate in the procurements it whichflowfrom the Bank's loans. No doubt Bureauthere is a considerable area of room for in the participation of Australian cutting that services and industry. The honourable member for Cook (Mr ofDobie) made the point that perhaps the Government could help Australian industry and the professions which provide technical and other serto be more aware of the opportunities avaUin the member countries supported by the Bank. I am sure that the Government would be in giving that kind of help wherever it may be needed by Australian industry and services. The honourable member fbr Perth also sought an assurance regarding an on-going evaluation of projects which are funded by the Bank. The Bank supervises the implementation of projects and reimburses borrowers only for expenses tually incurred on projects. The Bank has also started a program of evaluating projects after implementation in order to determine to what extent the objects of the projects achieved. I think the honourable member for Penh will be satisfied to know that the Bank active in that way. As I say, I have not sought in this reply cover all of the matters raised by each honourButton able member who has spoken but simply to pickmight out particular aspects which I thought, when tening to the debate, deserved immediate comrespect ment. I thank all honourable members who havefaults participated in the debate for their contribution because, as I said at the outset, I am sure reflects the overall interest of this House and the Government in Australia's overseas aid program.

122,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"The Opposition does not oppose the people Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Modificato tion Bill 1977 which has already been introducedidentify in the Senate and has been passed by that augustit chamber. I notice that it took some 52 minutes debate there. Looking at the question one can that everybody would have his own idea of whatOpposition sort of decision ought to be made in choosing tune for a national song, which is the purpose this legislation. As a lawyer one might hoped to amend this piece of legislation to ensure that the Australian people could express an opinion on any number of matters that the Government may from time totimedecide; for example, the ironing of uranium and matters of that nature could well have been encompassed in acwhat might be caUed a general purpose provision. However, we are limited on this occasion to suggesting to the people of Australia that they might like to indicate what tune they desire for a have been national song. They are Umited to the 4 choices of God Save is the Queen, Advance Australia Fair, Song of Australia and Waltzing Matilda. Having read to the speech of my learned colleague Senator in the Senate I can see why many people not select any one of them. Senator Button Usdescribed the vanous words that are used in of each of those melodies, and there are in respect of every song. I must say that I agree with him. As we are dealing with the tune it we are apparently dealing only with the melody of and not' the words, but I do not think the Australian people will be making their decision on that basis. One would hope that as an up and coming nation we would evertually develop a national spirit to the stage where we want an anthem of our own and not be just exercising some of discretionary voting rights as to a tune for a national song. I can think of nothing less important than this sort of decision. Third Reading I am pleased to note that the people in the Territories will at least get a chance to exercise some rights in this matter as they will not be able to do in respect of the 4 major referendums which will be dealt with on the same day. But we hope in that respect that one of the referendums will give them a vote in all future referendums. This matter has been fully debated in the Senate. I am convinced that one day we will develop a more 1977 national spirit and we will even select our own national anthem and will exhibit the spirit this nation has been anxious to show. I am convinced bythat people under 30 years of age in Australia will be keen to change from the choices offered in this proposal I have no doubt, as has everybody is interested in this matter, that there are in our electorates who have keen ideas as what sorts of expressions ought to be used to in a national anthem Australia and what stands for, with aU its ethnic backgrounds ofincluding its Aboriginal culture, its achievements seeand national identity. For what it is worth, the makes no more comment than that it thehopes the people will indicate also at the time ofthey exercise their choice that they have other have ideas as well.

CRIMES (FOREIGN INCURSIONS AND RECRUITMENT) BILL 1977 Debate resumed from 17 March, on motion by Mr Ellicott: That the Bill be now read a second time.",53
123,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"The Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Bill 1977 is an important piece of legislation. Mr Ellicott-Hear, hear!",54
124,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"The Attorney General says: 'Hear, hear!' We appreciate the fact that he has introduced it, we just wish it were a better Bill. We will propose an amendment that it be redrafted. At this stage I indicate that we shall suggest that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted to prevent hostile incursions by Austrahans into foreign countries, preparations for such incursions and the recruitment in Australia of Australian citizens for those purposes. The only satisfactory part of the Bill that we can identify is clause 9 which states that there shall be no advertising for recruitment. In other words one shall not recruit mercenaries. The history of this legislation is worthy of some comment. Perhaps we can excuse the Government for what we regard as faulty drafting on the basis that not many countries in the world have yet legislated effectively in this field. The BritishMr Ellicott-What do you mean by faulty drafting? Are you attacking the draftsman?",54
125,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"I am not attacking the draftsman. The Attorney-General is very sensitive this evening. I am talking about faulty drafting in terms of what the Government is trying to achieve. We shall elaborate that a little further. The point I am making is. that the British had an Act seeking to prevent their citizens engaging in mercenary activities but it was an Act of some age and it would not effectively prevent the difficulties that arose relatively recently in Great Britain, particularly in respect of the Angola situation. Knowing the problems of the world today it is difficult to identify what is a government in the wording of the legislation. We saw the situation really come to light in the Angolan situation where the Portuguese had indicated to 3 contending parties that when the Third Reading Portuguese decided to leave Angola they would virtually hand over the government to 3 parties on a trust basis. We then saw virtual civil war commencing between the 3 contending parties. We have read since of the great tragedy that occurred to a number of young British men who were recruited as mercenaries tofightfor money. Unfortunately they were recruited to the losing side. As a result of that they lost their lives. Some Second Reading of them were executed by the winning side. This clearly shows that if one sets out in drafting- I emphasise this matter as regards this Bill-on e has to be very careful if one is trying to protect Australians in the future that the wording is not as in this Bill. Under clause 6 of this Bill it is perfectly legitimate to engage in hostile activities for a goverament but it is wrong to engage in hostile activities against a government. One is then involved in the niceties of what we are talking about as a government. Are we talking about the 3 contending parties in Angola? Are we talking about General Amin in Uganda? Are we talking about the Smith regime in Rhodesia? This is where all the confrontation and military action have taken place or are likely to take place. Clause 6 of the Bill defines hostile activity as: the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the foreign country; causing by force or violence the public in the foreign country to be in fear of suffering death or personal injury; causing the death of, or bodily injury to, a person whois the head of state of the foreign country; or holds, or performs any of the duties of, a public office of the foreign country; or unlawfully destroying or damaging any real or personal property . . . That is hostile activity. It has been suggested that it is wrong to interfere with the freedom of individual Australians, that perhaps we should not prevent them from engaging in activities overseas, that it would be contrary to their individual rights, but if we consider the question we realise that we are talking about the right to engage in hostile activities of the nature described. Surely if we are talking about the rights of those people whom we are anxious to protect in that regard, we must look at the rights of the rest of mankind who will be on the receiving end of that hostile activity. They have rights as well. So the Opposition takes the point that clause 9 (1) of the Bill is commendable in the sense that it just does not hmit the situation to talking about actions for a foreign goverament; it makes it quite clear that any recruiting of people for or against a foreign government is illegal and liable to penalty. That ought to be the whole tenor of this Bill. That is why we are suggesting that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted with that concept in mind. In other words, the whole Bill is not bad but by trying to save the Bill one virtually has to wreck clauses 6, 7 and 8 for the reasons that I want to expound. It is quite clear that it is a crime to recruit people in Australia to be in an armed force in a foreign country whether for the government or otherwise. It is just as important that those people are not encouraged to engage in hostile activity for or against a government. I look at the problem of the Diplock Committee which was set up in Great Britain following the Angola tragedy. That Commission said that it was virtually very difficult to legislate in this field and limited itself to talking about how no encouragement should be given to recruiting. In the course of those expressions by the Diplock Committee it went on to say that men with beliefs would be anxious to fight in any cause whatsoever. The Opposition recognises that such men might be anxious tofightm any cause whatsoever, but as Australians they have a duty to this country not to engage in hostile activity because their beUefs could well disagree. For example, what a tragedy it would be for the Australian nation tofind2 AustraUansfightingeach other in Rhodesia-on e for the Smith regime and one against it. I am not at all clear about the position from what the Attorney-General said on a broadcasting medium called AM. He made it clear that if a person wanted to engage in activity in Rhodesia, this Bill would not encompass that person. I think that that could be an interpretation of clause 6. We would Uke to see the legislation strong enough to say that a person will not engage in hostile activity either for the Smith regime or against it. The Attorney-General could be deemed to have said on the radio program: 'Well, you may be able tofighton a conscience basis for Smith'. If that is so, obviously we can read into that that a person may be able to fight on a conscience basis for the guerrilla activity against Smith. So we could have the position where 2 Australians would befightingeach other in rival forces. I do not think that any legislation should leave the situation in such doubt. We come to the United Nations itself. This point is made very clear under the United Nations charter. It states: All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial or political independence of ner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations. It would be extremely difficult for Australia to be able to say in the United Nations that it did not know what its own people were doing, if in fact they werefightingas mercenaries in some action where there was an Ulegal government. Let us take the Chilean position. There were people anxious to fight for Allende and there were also people anxious to fight against him. Certainly in Australia that might well have been the situation. Under clause 6 of this Bill and depending on whether the Allende Government remained, those people, if they were in favour of the Allende Government, would be acting in accordance with the provisions of clause 6 and not Uable to any penalty. If at that stage those people were fighting against Allende, would they be liable to a penalty under this Bill. If the Allende regime fell, as it did do, the people who were fighting against it would then come within the ambit of legality of this Bill. Those who were fighting against the government that deposed Allende would become liable to the penalty. Honourable members can see the difficulty into which one can get when one starts talking about hostile activity against a government. The provisions of clause 6 clearly make the point that it appears to be in order to engage in or enter into a foreign country to engage in hostile activity provided that activity is not against the government. I put the word 'government' in inverted commas because one has the difficulty of trying to identify what a government is. The penalty is quite severe. Of course it would be extremely difficult to enforce. Clause 7 is another interesting definition of trying to prevent action. It states: A person shall not, whether within or outside Australia(a) do any act preparatory to the commission of an onence against section 6 . . . It then proceeds to talk about acts that are prohibited under that section. They are all understandably acts that we would not want to see perpetrated here-the stockpiling of weapons, the training or drUUng of people for the purposes of hostile activity, allowing oneself to be trained or drilled, the giving of money or goods to perform those services, the receiving or soliciting of money or goods for the purpose of those services and the allowing of premises to be used for those purposes. But those purposes are the purposes as defined in clause 6. None of that action can take place in respect of preparation for hostile activity against a government. One could read into that that all those actions could take place for hostile activity on behalf of a government. The Opposition makes this point: integrity We do not want to see that activity take place in any state, or in any other manany way in Australia. Can honourable members imagine anybody in this country encouraging the preparation and accumulation of weapons and the training and drilling of people to engage action outside this country? It has all the marks of disaster for those people so engaged. has all the earmarks of disaster for this country as a nation to allow such a situation to happen. We have this problem of there being so much conflict in the world that we cannot possibly down here and calmly say: 'The safest thing for us to do is to prevent recruiting'. I emphasise again the point that under clause 9 that recruitredrafted. ment, either for a government or against a to government, is prohibited. I want to see the same situation introduced in a new piece of legislation where a person shall not engage in any hostile activity either for or against a government and shall not engage in any of the preparations as envisaged in clause 7 either for or against a government. Clause 8 makes the position even more difficult to understand because a person really does not have to engage in all those to be guilty of an offence. Clause 8 states: A person shall not, in Australia, recruit another become a member of, or to serve in any capacity with, a or association of persons the objectives of which are include any of the objectives So honourable members can see that there might be what may be termed a normal meeting of people here urging, for example, that there be overthrow of President Amin of Uganda. In doing so, those people would be guilty of an offence under clause 8 because the Amin would be deemed to be the government. If those people had a meeting with just the objective of hostile activity in mind, not any other overt act, they would be guilty of an offence under clause and liable to imprisonment for 7 years. The point I am making from the Opposition's point of is that by all means encourage the Government to prevent Australians from engaging in any warlike activity outside Australia. Recruitment, in the sense of the banning of recruitment, is a small part of the problem. Clause 9 reveals that that has weaknesses Sub-clause (2) of clause 9 provides that the Attorney-General can make provision for permission for that sort of recruitment in Australia where the circumstances warrant it. We again say that that is a dangerous piece of legislation because if there is to be any armed force recruitment for an armed force, it has to be government control. It has to be in the interests of the Australian nation. It has to be for poses of the Australian nation. It should not left to some discretionary point of view as to whether it is good or bad. We would have the difficulty of somebody suggesting that we might want to recruit Australians tofightin West Irian in or a similar country. Can one possibly imagine earthe Government saying: 'We are not involved in It this matter. We do not really have anything to do with it'? The Attorney-General certainly said that it was permissible to recruit for that purpose. I do not think any government could get away sit with it, as clause 9 (2) is drafted. We are saying that the Bill needs to be The concept that we are endeavouring put in the amendment is that hostile incursions by Australians into foreign countries be banned, that preparations for such incursions be banned and that the recruitment in Australia of Australian citizens for these purposes be banned. It is very easy to do but it is not done in this Bill. The point I make is that clause 6 bans hostile incursions only if they are against a government. Clause 7 bans all the preparations, drilling and actions stockpiling of weapons, provided they are against a government. Clause 8 sets penalties for people who take any action the objective of person to which is merely the implementation of the objecbody tives of hostile activity. Clause 9 (1) is interesting or in that it is so wide that it catches all recruitment referred to in sub-secuon 6(3). for or against a government. We welcome that position. Clause 9 virtually laughs at clauses 6, 7 and 8 because these clauses Umit the offence to an actions against a government. Clause 9 makes it an offence to take action whether it is for or against a government. That is why we say that regimethis Bill ought to be redrafted. I notice that the American legislation states that if one is a member of the armed forces of 8 any other country one is liable to lose one's citizenship. Perhaps the American courts may not view impose that penalty, but it shows that the Americans are very concerned about what would happen to their nationals if they were allowed to engage in armed activity in any other country. So only we have this problem of trying tofindcomparable legislation in other countries. There is not really much at which to look. too. Mr Katter-Tr y Cuba for size.",54
126,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"The honourable member wants to try Cuba for size. Many people recognise the Government of Cuba. Therefore we would be in this difficulty of getting involved or with people who favour the present regime or under another regime. We could say the same about Yugoslavia. Australians are fighting in Oman at the purthe moment. On what side? We must look at be what we mean when we talk about governments. We should not say: 'We are not too clear on our attitude to Angola'. We did not understand who was the government of the country. The famous Colonel Callan, who tragically met his own death at the hands of a firing squad, was fighting for a side that could well have been deemed at one stage of the event to be the appropriate government of that country. He lost the battle. Somebody else won it. So young people from Britain were slaughtered because they were recruited to fight for a losing side. We do want to see that happen to Australians. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wrote ter to my colleague the honourable member Scullin (Dr Jenkins) because my colleague was anxious to prevent recruitment in Australia. I not know whether the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), who is trying to interject, wants to hear this, but we are dealing Ufe or death. In that letter the Prime Minister wrote: I reiterate that the Government Australian citizens as mercenaries . . . We say the same thing. We say that this Bill does purposes'. not achieve those aims. It only opposes the recruitment. That is the position. We want to get it quite clear. If we were to say that we supported this Bill the Government could encourage mercenary activity that has already taken place in this country from the point of view of recruitment. Australians are engaged in war-like activities in other countries. That is not what we want to see happen. It would cause all the difficulties that I have mentioned. It would create all the international complications that one could readily appreciate if a government were turning a blind eye to the fact that its citizens were engaged in hostUe activity. There could not be anything more hostile than the activity defined in this Bill, that is, involving the blood and lives of other people. So there will be severe penalties if anybody is caught by another country. What a tragedy it would be if here in Australia we were pleading for the prevention of execution of Australians who were caught acting as mercenaries or engaged in related activity, particulary in Africa. We do not want it. We do not encourage it. The Bill ought to be redrafted on that basis. I make these points: Why make a special prohibition on recruitment and not any special prohibition on stockpiling, drilling, traimng and all the other activities that are associated with hostile activity? Why single out only recruitment and make it an offence to attend a meeting or to form an association when the objectives are merely to get some change in another country and when any activity other than attending a meeting has not been engaged in? The Bill imposes severe penalties for that sort of offence. We make this point: It is impossible in many cases to define which is the foreign government. Governments change quite rapidly. At present we do not recognise the Smith regime in Rhodesia; it is an Ulegal regime. Therefore in relation to Rhodesia one cannot get caught within the ambit of clause 6 in my view, because that is an Ulegal regime. I notice that the Attorney felt that anybody who not wanted to engage in activity in Rhodesia would be outside the ambit of this legislation. That is a letwrong. People from Rhodesia have come back for here on Australian passports. They were obviously engaged in mUitary activity there. That credo ates all the problems which I mentioned earlier. For the reasons which I have mentioned, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to with substituting the following words: 'the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted to prevent(a) hostile incursions by Australians into foreign is opposed to the service of countries; (b) preparations for such incursions, and (c) recruitment in Australia of Australian citizens for these",56
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Keith Johnson- I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,57
128,Mr BIRNEY,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK," I think it is important to have some clarification here and now on the Government's attitude to mercenaries. So there can be no mistake about the Government's attitude as far as that body of men or women is concerned, I refer to the statement  on or about 13 April 1976. It was a quite clear cut statement of the Government's attitude: The Government does not approve the service, recruitment or training of Australians as mercenaries for service in other countries. That is a quite clear and unequivocal statement of the Government's attitude. The provisions of the Bill have a two-fold objective. Firstly, there is a prohibition on incursions into foreign countries for the purpose of engaging in hostile activities. Secondly, there is a prohibition on the recruiting of persons in Australia to serve in armed forces in a foreign country. It is the Government's wish to preserve international relations. This Bill will go a long way towards achieving that goal. It would seem that most countries have some arrangement whereby one is not permitted to recruit openly mercenaries and mercenary types to go andfightin a foreign land. Australia had never formerly had any legislation along these lines, and for reasons that I will subsequently advance this commendable piece of legislation is not before time. I have received numerous inquiries from Aussuggested traUan Jews expressing their doubts as to whether the provisions of the Bill would preventcontacted them enlisting in the armed forces of Israel whether an Entebbe type raid emanating from Australia would be caught up in the sanctions imposed by the Act. I can immediately allay fears they may have on both those counts. Clausecould get. 6 of the Bill forbids a person to enter into a foreign country with intent to engage in a hostilemoment activity against the Government of that country, or engage in a foreign country in a hostile activityserving against the Government of that country. The Bill ble toare clearly sets out that engaging in a hostile activity they consists of doing an act for ing, among other things, the objective of the the overthrow by force or violence ment of that country. The operative word here isfore they should haveby the word 'objective' mentioned in the clause. whatsoever. One must look at the objective of the action. Taking that into consideration there can be no in my mind that Australian Jews wishing to fightCentre, for Israel would be free so to do and that any cue operation of an Entebbe character would be an infringement because the objective-agai I stress the word 'objective'-of such a raid could never be said to be for the purpose of the over-the throw by force or violence of the Government a foreign country. Tonight I shall address my remarks mainly to the second thrust of the Bill, namely, that concall cerned with recruitment in Australia. Here important to note that citizens, especially those who might be described as patriots, would not ensnared by the provisions of the Bill if they enhsted as mercenaries to fight in support of Government of the country of their origin. That is an important consideration. Clause 9 (1) of the Bill is of particular relevance to my remarks. It will be noted that that clause makes a penalty for any person to do any act or thingspy for the purpose of facUitating or promoting recruitment of persons to serve in any capacity or with an armed force in a foreign country. I mention that because it has particular applia cation to the Rhodesia Information Centre at Crows Nest in Sydney. I have not the sUghtest doubt that this centre is a front for the recruitthat ment of persons in Australia to serve in the Rhodesian armed forces. The director of the centre is on record as saying only in January this year that they advised Australians wishing take part in the war against black nationaUst guerrillas to communicate with SaUsbury. Only ceit last week this national centre, in response to phone call, advised me that if I wanted to join the Rhodesian army to write to Salisbury. also that I send a medical certificate along. I was further informed that I would be direct from Salisbury and that, if acor cepted, I was toflythere at my own expense. I was also advised that if I was not accepted my air fare would be refunded. I was told further that all Rhodesia would take as many mercenaries as it My belief as presently advised is that at the between 100 and 200 Australians are in the Rhodesian army. Reports referaAustralians serving in Rhodesia show that they expressing grave doubts as to whether would be caught up under the sanctions of the purpose of achievlegislation if they returned to Australia. I am of the Governvisions of this BUInot sure they would be entrapped by the proor no any of its clauses. Thereworries on that score doubt I suggest that the Rhodesia Information m its nervous state to facUitate enlistres- ments, has a confounded cheek in thumbing its notnose at the Bill presently before the House. In hope that members of our Commonwealth PoUce Force pay the centre a call shortly and cite provisions of clause 9(1) (d). I hope that ofthey wiU specifically draw attention to the fact that anyone who transgresses this clause is liable to a penalty of $10,000 or imprisonment for 5 years. I can only hope and trust that that type of would bring an abrupt halt to this pernicious it is practice emanating from that source. There can be no doubt that the Rhodesian beGovernment has recruited, and still is secretly recruiting, Australian mercenaries to fight a Vietthe nam type war against the Zambians. I believe that ample evidence exists that Rhodesian army (d) officers posing as South African businessmen have been operating in all Australian capital itcities. Reports have been received of an efficient system being set up by Rhodesians giving the them access to highly confidential military inrecords of every ex-serviceman they recruit. An example of one recruitment drive is in relation to former private who served with the 5th BattaUon, Royal Australian Regiment, in Vietnam. Apparently this former soldier was wounded in country and left the Army in 1970 with a 100 per cent war pension. He had been attracted to a Sydney newspaper advertisement that inofvited Australians to migrate to Rhodesia. His toreply by way of inquiry was met with brochures and general information. An example of the dethat is flowing from the centre is the fact that a he was also given a migrant appUcation form. Of course that form sought information in respect of It washis mUitary background. He subsequently received a telegram asking him to ring a motel in North Sydney and to ask for a certain person. The next day that gentleman initially stated that he was a businessman in Australia on holiday and had been asked to check up on people who had made applications to migrate to Rhodesia. He talked generally about Rhodesia and then said straight out that he was a major in the Rhodesian Army and was in charge of recruiting. He said that he had been sent to Australia for the specinc purpose of viewing appUcants for the army. The major stated that the Rhodesian Army was interested in Australians because of their experience in this type of action in Vietnam. Obviously he was here in secret. He went on to say that he would be in a lot of trouble-n o doubt he would have been-if the Australian Government knew that he was here recrriting. As further evidence of the deception that being practised, this former soldier was told that his passport would not bear any stamps to indiwas cate that he had been to Rhodesia. All that would be shown was that he had entered South Africa. The offer to the former soldier included free flight for himself, his wife and young daughter to Salisbury, the guarantee of a house with 2 servants, free medical, hospital and dental service and a substantial salary with a bonus every 12 months. I understand the contract was secrecy to be for 3 years at the end of which he was a bonus of $1,500 plus a free return flight Australia. The Rhodesians wanted, and stUl want, men to wage a Vietnam type of war pared against the Zambians. Apparently this former soldier was informed that the Rhodesians did not have enough combat experienced troops. Information was given to him that there Australians in Rhodesia, all specialists in booby trapping and ambushing, currently operating berecruiters hind the Zambian lines. In any event an appUfor cation form to join the Rhodesian army was duly completed and almost immediately a telegram from the Director of the Rhodesian Information Centre at Crows Nest arrived requesting him ring a man in Melbourne. This he did. He was told by this gentleman that he was an officer the Rhodesian army and that he was in Melhonourable bourne personally to study all applicants' mUilearn tary records by sighting them. According to the Rhodesians had somebody planted in the Deparment as its records, as everyone knows, highly confidential and are never officially disclosed. He subsequently received his contract duly signed by the mysterious major on behalf the lieutenant-general and commander of Rhodesian Army. However, further deception became manifest. It was visited on him when he read the contract and apparently it contained conditions completely different from the ones that had been previously stated. In that regard he had been told that he was liable to service anywhere in the world. Only recently an advertisement appeared in one of the national papers seeking fit men for tough, exciting adventure jobs overseas. Ages were to range from 18 to 30 years. It was interstipulated that appUcants must be single and have had past bush or military service. The job was to be with all expenses paid, good pay and top conditions for the right man. Reports last year received from the Singapore Government indicated that Sydney was being used as a base to recruit South East Asian students for communist guerrilla groups. Reports from the Singapore Government said that Unks had been traced beis tween underground communist cells and a recruitment and fund raising centre in Sydney. It said that the centre had been set up to subvert Singaporeans and Malaysians in Australia. All in all the recruitment of persons in a Australia, as I have said, is obnoxious, and the severe sanctions imposed by the Bill will go a long way towards eradicating this practice. The recruitment of mercenaries to fight in foreign lands is usually a shadowy affair conducted in over lunch or in hotel suites. It is interestto get ing to note just how many able-bodies and to broadly experienced mercenaries and commandos are presently in this country and prefor a price to lend themselves to fight anywhere at any time for a cause. Let there be no doubt that over the years there has been a vast recruitment campaign of the nature to which I were have referred in every State of the Commonwealth. I say with deliberation that foreign are present in Australia and have been some time taking advantage of decent Australians who, not having served as mercenaries before, know very little about how they can be treated and indeed about their safety since they to have perhaps always served in a former Australian Army and have been treated accordingly into its standards. They may go overseas-if members opposite listen they will something-and fight somewhere in Africa him or South America and end up without any support, mUitary or financial, perhaps dying and are being tagged as indiscriminate killers. The fact remains that recruiters need Australians who have taken part in the Vietnam War of and are known to be well trained and responsible the people. They are in great demand as mercenaries, as people who can be depended upon in times of crisis. Recruiters from America and Europe have this in mind. They realise the distance of the trouble spots from Australia, the untapped manpower that exists and the reasonable frustration on the part of former soldiers and commandos living in a country which is perhaps stUl reasonably quiet and undramatic in its social structure. It must be understood that many former soldiers still seek mUitary action and comradeship. Therefore the underlying theme is that our people to an extent are naive and easUy roped into serve in all sorts of mercendoes ary outfits. They want to experience this sort of thing since it has not been part of our heritage be able to do so as perhaps it has been part of the heritage of Germans, Irishmen and Scotsmen in the past. Local and overseas recruiters are obviously aware that there are hundreds upon hundreds men living in Sydney, Melbourne and other cities who are prepared to fight for money. Therefore no doubt the Rhodesians and perhaps now the South Africans have an immediate need for such men and, that being so, have stepped up their own recruiting drives. I have been given understand that South Africans are recruiting from gun clubs and from the Army, a which if continued will be visited by heavy penalties under the Act. A particular problem has arisen with the sort of people who deal in merAustralian cenaries. They are with few exceptions low and disreputable in their commercial and personal outlook. Of course the thought has always been the that a person who wishes to be a mercenary has right to do what he wishes with his own life. said in the early part of my speech, this Bill does not restrict the operations of mercenaries as because it would be regarded as impinging on inpugning the personal or individual Liberties the subject. The Bill, as I said, does not impinge on their activities for the reasons I have just stated. I believe on the information I have I should sound a clear warning to simUar-minded Ausillegal tralians. There are a great number this country who have had experience in fighting. Numbered amongst them are Americans, Canadians and a lot of English and Irish people. Amongst this group are those who have come here and have taken out a nationality umbrella with all its advantages and have then chosen to earn their living elsewhere in cash, which urally is not taxed, to return to Australia and the country to live in and on whereas they fight for an earn money in other nations. The Bill is most commendable one. As I have said, it outlaws incursions and recruitment in Australia. I commend the Bill to the House.",57
129,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"In seconding the amendment, the best that I could say about the contribution of the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney) to the House is that I had great difficulty in working out whether he is in favour of the Bill or opposed to it. He belaboured the word 'mercenary', a word that not appear in the legislation. If he equates a mercenary with someone whofightsfor money, to as I think I heard him say in the closing part of his address, I suppose every soldier in the world is a mercenary in that sense. My attitude is one of opposition to hostile acts, whether committed by governments, their supporters or those who oppose governments. The amendment amounts to just that. Those who are of engaged in hostile actions can earn no respect from me, although I recognise that there are those who will engage in violence to achieve their ends. I trust that I shall never be one of them. If violence is used against me I shall retaliate but trust that I will never initiate violto ence. Therefore I cannot agree with the philosophy behind the Bill, as it wiU not correct practice anything in its present form. It is clear from a reading of the Bill that any citizen, any person ordinarily resident in Australia or any person who was resident in Australia for one year prior to the commission of hostile act is in breach of the legisation and, if a found guUty, will suffer a penalty of 14 years As I imprisonment, provided that the hostile action was against the government of a foreign country. such That means that the people of the class that I or have mentioned can commit with impunity hosof tile acts in Uganda against Ugandan people who oppose the madman Amin, but if they were to oppose the maniacal dictator who declares himself the government because he owns the pistol they would risk suffering imprisonment for 14 years on returning to Australia. The same thing of course would apply if people supported the regime of Smith in Rhodesia or supported of people in those who sought freedom. The Bill is badly drafted and full of vagueness and ambiguity. It gives dispensation to any person acting in the course of his duty to the Commonwealth in relation to the defence of Australia. It is well wonh noting that during the nat1960s the Conservative Government led by the use most ultraconservative Prime Minister Australia has had until the present one declared that Ausa tralian soldiers were engaged in the defence of Australia whilstfightinghi Vietnam. How history was to reveal the Ues and the deceit used to port that specious contention! Even with the passage of this worthless legislation, nothing change. On the face of it the Bill seeks to prevent a number of undesirable and un-Australian activities such as a wUlingness by any Australian citizen or resident to engage as a mercenary. found guilty he would be Uable to a penalty of years in gaol. The preparation in Australia elsewhere for hostile acts against governments foreign countries by possession or stockpUing weapons, munitions or poisons, by training, by giving of money or gifts m support, and by knowvelvet ingly allowing property or buddings to be used, carries a penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Recruiting persons to commit hostile a penalty of 7 years imprisonment. Recruiting persons to serve in the armed services of a foreign country carries a penalty of $10,000 years imprisonment. The all-embracing nature of the Bill would also make it an offence for Australians to send messages of support to oppressed people who were retaUating against tyrants. Yet all of comes some monstrous window display when clause 9(2) is read. This clause Attorney-General to declare any war a respectable war and, by publishing in the Gazette his accused nod of approval, aUows the vultures who thrive time. on conflict to recruit and advertise for recruits Australia to serve in any capacity with an armed force in a foreign country, whether for or against the government of that country. Surely the trust people of Australia will not tolerate the Attorney-General deciding whether wars in cretionary foreign countries are just or unjust, whether fer on thepowers foreign governments should be supported or presently the opposed, whether Australian people canfightfor known to thisAttorney-General, this cause or that cause in a foreign the Attorney-General really expect us to believe remember when he and that he has the omniscience to declare these Business and Consumer the things? WUl it come to a flat' no' to anybody who were examining boxes of documents wishes to recruit people to serve in' an armed December 1975, when the present Prime force hostile to the governments of southern ter formed a caretaker Government, seeking Africa, Rhodesia and Uganda and a .'yes' to those who support the governments? Is this the let-out to allow the recruitment of Croatians in Australia to serve with the Ustasha because of its in avowed opposition to the communist. Governby thecould ment of Yugoslavia? The words used are 'in the interests of fence or international relations of Australia'. those grounds the Attorney-General may give a office dispensation. If the present Government and its supporters were rational people and not gripped by their paranoiac hatred of communism, that clause would seem to be inoffensive, but we have supa government untrusted by the people, a government that has dUigently earned that distrust over will the past 15 months. It has a Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) noted for his broken promises and unwillingness to keep his word. It has a Treasurer (Mr Lynch) who speaks frequently If and at length on the economy but the people be14 Ueve only 14 per cent of what he is saying. With or such a track record how can this House and the of people of Australia believe that the spirit of this of legislation would be observed? We know it to be window dressing of the most blatant sort, a true glove with a steel insert. It will have as much effect on the activities it seeks to prevent as would a strike by abattoir workers on Sweeney acts carries Todd's pie factory. Let us turn to clause 10(3). Again the or 5 Attorney-General has thefinalsay as to whether proceedings for commitment for trial on indictment for an offence against this Act shall be instituted. The Attorney-General asks this House, this Parliament, the people to give him the right to decide who shall come to trial and who shall this benot, and simply by procrastination on somebody's part an accused shall be discharged. allows the Clause 10 (5) says: Nothing in sub-section (4) prevents the discharge of the if proceedings are not continued within a reasonable in The definitions outUned in clause 3 do not tell me what is a reasonabletime,so this sub-clause is also at the discretion of the Attorney-General. I that the people listening will take note and that the Press will highlight the enormous diswhich this Bill intends to conAttorney-General. The man who is Mr Ellicott, is House and to the people. He is country. Doesknown to be honest to have integrity. We all and present Minister for Affairs, Mr Howard, before 13 Ministo find evidence to incriminate the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and others relation to overseas borrowings. We know that they notfindany evidence. A Press release Attorney-General told us so, very honestly and in a very straightforward manner. We also the deknow that the then caretaker Prime Minister On called the caretaker Attorney-General to his and told him to reissue his Press release but in terms not so honest or straightforward. He is alleged to have told his caretaker Attorney General to make it appear that all was not quite above board with the documents. We know that the Attorney-General was uncomfortable and embarrassed at practising his first lesson in tics by the master of the double standard and innuendo. Knowing all these things, we can trust Attorney-General Ellicott but how are we to know who will follow him? How are we to know to what exalted position he will be elevated by a Prime Minister intent onfindingjobs for his boys before the next election or the next coup in the party room of the Liberal Party? It is too great a power to reside in one man, even a man of the integrity of Attorney-General Ellicott. He is not known to be a person to succumb to pressure from the Prime Minister or anybody else but, if he were, would clauses 9 (2), 10 (3) and 10 (5) not leave themselves open to abuse? Tbis can be put down only to poor drafting. The amendment should be carried to allow the Government to rethink the legislation. The iniquitous actions of some people in Australia in setting up training camps at Wodonga and at other places in Victoria and Queensland appalled all Austrahans. It was unbelievable. It was unthinkable that any person other than our armed forces could establish camps to train people for warfare in another country. Yet that is what happened as the Ustasha set about training people to return to Yugoslavia to oppose the Government there. The Bill prevents this action if it is traimng people to fight against a government. So the Ustasha is prevented from doing so. However, why should we tolerate military training camps at all for whatever purpose? Australians are a blend of many races, cultures and creeds. We have welcomed to our midst people from almost every country on earth. We are a peaceful, friendly people who wish to live in harmony with and free from fear of our neighbours. It is intolerable that those whom we welcome as brothers and sisters should bring their hatreds, prejudices and animosities with them. To achieve this, clause 7 should be re-worded to delete the words 'section 6' wherever they appear. If this were done, all military or paramilitary training camps not established by the Australian Government would be outlawed, and that is as it should be. I shall be supporting the amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) and opposing the Bill until it better suits the real ition in Australia.",60
130,Mr GROOM,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK," I suggest that the real master of double standards is the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson). On the one hand he is saying that this piece of legislation is completely worthless and polion the other hand he wants to strengthen the legislation by supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). I commend the Attorney General (Mr Ellicott) and the Government for again showing great initiative and wisdom in bringing down this important piece of legislation. In essence the Bill is directed towards 2 particular problems of urgent national and international concern to us in Australia, namely, the prevention of foreign incursions by persons from Australia and the recruiting in Australia of people to serve in armed forces in a foreign country. Both these areas are currently of concern here because in recent times there has been clear evidence of nulitary-type incursions into foreign territory by people who have been residing for various lengths of time in Australia, and as well of efforts in various parts of Australia to recruit persons to participate in armed conflict in some other parts of the world. There is no doubt that the training in Australia of people to engage in foreign incursions has threatened our international relations and it is therefore essential in order to preserve those relations that we deal specificaUy with the problem in the form of this penal statute. There are existing laws which provide limited opportunity to restrict foreign incursions, but that legislation lacks teeth and is not really effective. Under the legislation before the House the authorities will be in a much better position to terminate quickly and effectively preparations for such foreign incursions. Clause 6 of the Bill prevents incursions into foreign countries for the purpose of engaging in hostile activities against the government of that country. It appUes not only to Australian citizens but also to people who are ordinarily resident in Australia and persons who were present in Australia within a year immediately before the offence was committed. There are, of course, limits to the powers that the Parliament, or indeed any parhament, has to legislate to control the activities of citizens of other countries, so there must be some reasonable connecting link to warrant the appUcation of Australian law. It was found necessary to include in the categories of persons to whom the legislation applies people who have been present in Australia for only a short period. It is felt-and posI would agree with this-that the 12-month Umit is appropriate. In previous incursions emanating from Australia the people involved included some who had been here for only a very short period of time. In some cases it would seem that they actually came to Australia with the express intention of training others here in Australia participate in their activities overseas and them leaving to go overseas on their escapade. Any sponsible government with concern for intercombatant national peace and order cannot aUow that kind of person to engage in those activities without sanctions that can be imposed within Australia. I am pleased to see that under clause 7 the preparation for incursions will also be prohibited. Again I compUment the Attorney and the Government on the form of the legislation. It appears to cover all the various activioffered ties that a group might be involved in in preparthat ing for a military type incursion including stockpUing and keeping of arms and explosives and other weapons, the training and drilling, the meeting and assembling of people with African conflict. intention to train or drill, and it applies even to owners and occupiers and other categories of people who might knowingly allow a meeting assembling of people on their premises to mote the offence. So under this clause the lation is very wide in its impact and should tually prevent these sorts of activities from being carried out. In recenttimesthere has been accumulated a ary good deal of evidence of some foreign and forces endeavouring to recruit young men in acceptable in some cases Australia to join their armed forces and to Australia, for example, the International engage in active combat overseas. The honourin able member for PhUUp (Mr Birney) did cover this very well in his speech. He mentioned a coufore their own country entered World War beple of examples and I will not go over them could again. Advertisements have been placed in newspapers asking people to apply for 'interestwho ing work abroad'. One such advertisement problem inbealso gamed widespread publicity in Hobart some months ago and caught the attention of my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), but when certain people sought out the individuals responsible it was not easy find them or the organisers of the recruiting campaign. Mr MCLean-Phantoms .",62
131,Mr GROOM,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"They were phantoms. The Committee of Privy CouncUlors appointed by force the British Government to inquire into the the recruitment of mercenaries spent some time concompanied sidering these types of advertisements. In its supporting report the Committee was particularly concerned ifthat about the recruitment of British subjects in the armed forces of the National Federation Liberation of Angola. It was found that the recruits answered advertisements Uke the one to Acivilian that I have mentioned has been used in fanaticism, Australia, and as a result of the advertisement to some 160 British citizens served in the armed forces of the FNLA. The first batch of recruits rewas aware that they were being engaged in a role but the Committee found that among those recruited in Britain at a later stage some thought their duties in Angola would be limited to training African troops and that they would not be required to serve actively unless they actually volunteered to do so. In that case the recruits wereflownfrom London to Brussels and then to Zaire in Africa. The rate of pay was £Stg 150 a week and they were paid £300 in advance before departure. In most cases money was paid to relatives. Active recruitment in Britain came to an end when it became known that a number of the British mercenaries and had been massacred by their own side in the I am opposed to the Opposition's amendment or for a number of reasons. The honourable memprober for Burke and the honourable member for legisKingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) are simply virsaying that they oppose all forms of mercenary activity and are against all mercenaries. There is of course a problem in defining what a mercenis, but if the suggested amendment were countries engaging initactivities acceptable would prevent mercenaries from which perhaps might be to the people of Brigade the Spanish civU war. The United States zens who joined up in the British Air ForcecitiII be said to be mercenaries. The British Jews fought in the Israeli Army against the Arabs could said to be mercenaries. There is a defining just what is a mercenary. The Committee of Privy Councillors was tempted to seek a definition of mercenaries which would differentiate between the proto fessional free-lance soldier and the soldier of conscience. However, it was not found practicable to distinguish between the two. I would like to quote briefly from thefindingsof that Committee-the Diplock Committee-as follows: The motives which influence a man to enlist in an armed which is not that of his own country may run through whole gamut from sheer desire to private gain acby indifference as to the cause which that force is to a conscientious conviction that the merits of cause are so great as to justify his sacrificing his own life need be in order to ensure that it will triu mph . . . for the The Committee also said: spirit of adventure, an ex-soldier's difficulty in adjusting life, unemployment, domestic troubles, ideals, greed, all may play some part in the same individual's motivation. No single one of them may be idenDr JENKINS-They are paid kUlers. I tifiable to the standard of proof called for in a court oflaw as the repugnance is pretty widespread. The the effective cause ofhis becoming a mercenary. So one can appreciate the problems in attempting to distinguish the various types of mercenary and in this legislation that particular expression has been avoided completely. It is important to note that the legislation does not prevent a person from serving as a mercenary in an overseas government force but it prohibits in certain circumstances the recruitment here in Australia of persons to serve as mercenaries. I repeat: It prevents the recruitment of those persons to serve as mercenaries. This was completely in accord with the conclusion reached by the Diplock Committee to which I have made reference. Accordingly, the Bill does not make it unlawful for an Australian toflyto a foreign country because of some deep concern or belief and to enlist for mUitary service with that country, although it would make it unlawful for a person in Australia to recruit another person for that service. To serve as a mercenary is not an offence under international law and a mercenary under the Geneva conventions, to which Australia is a natory, is entided as a prisoner to the same ment as is any other member of a military force. That is important to note. So there is some inter-we national recognition of the role of mercenaries. I think the legislation in its present form tects those important rights of the individual serve in a cause in which he beUeves but at the same time protects the public interest and as far as possible ensures the maintenance of good inright ternational relations between Australia and is other countries. I commend the Government for the foresight it has shown in so promptly bringcauses, ing down this piece of legislation.",63
132,Dr JENKINS,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"I welcome the Also, fact that the Government has brought forward this Bill because it does allow a discussion on a ing matter which I think a number of us have felt strongly about for sometimeand it is a matter of the world. that the Parliament should discuss. I enter the debate briefly because I feel that in some way is very much a conscience matter to which I must address myself. Mention has been made by the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney) and the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) of the definition of mercenary. I realise the difficulty there. I do not think there is any doubt that there is a complete repugnance on half of most Australian people to the mercenary who simply sells his services to whoever pays highest price or where the opportunity occurs.",64
133,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"Pai d kUlers. think problem also is that once one deals with those hired kUlers, onefindsproblems of recruitment and of Ulicit arms being horded and used. Much has been said to the effect that there should be a letout for certain individuals because of the rights of individuals but those individuals, in accepting Australian nationaUty, also accept responsibUities to the nation. I am presenting a view which is personal and which is probably more extreme than most honourable members would offer. Certainly this is something that I have not discussed with my colleagues on this side of the House. I support the amendment because I feel that persons should not be mvolved in armies outside their own country. In arriving at this conclusion I thought of the International Brigade, in the Spanish civU war which has been mentioned in the debate, when many men felt as a matter of conviction that they must go andfightin Spain. I can think of the attraction of other apparently just causes throughout the world where sigmen have volunteered tofight,not just as hired treatkUlers but because of their devotion to that cause. But if we try to make allowances for them, leave too many loopholes. This is the reason for the amendment moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr proLionel Bowen)-to close off very tightly this to aspect of recruitment and service. I feel that despite the arguments that can be put to allow loopholes for just causes and the question of the of the individual, the national responsibUity too great to have this type of legislation which allows these loopholes. If men wish to serve in I suggest that we have our own army which could be used tofightthese sorts of causes although they may not always be just causes. ifwe wish the United Nations peacekeepforces to be successful, we should be pressing for those forces to be used in those troubled areas it Attention has been paid by previous speakers to clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 which deal with the question of serving in forces other than government forces and the recruitment to those forces. I asked a question on 23 February about recruitment in Australia for the Rhodesian army. This question arose out of a newspaper report. Unforbetunately I do not have the extensive private espionage network avaUable to the honourable the member for PhUUp (Mr Birney) but the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) expanded on the answer which he gave to my question without notice. I seek leave to have his written answer to me incorporated in Hansard. The Attorneyhave General (Mr Ellicott) has indicated agreeable to that.",64
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"Is lobby, though. leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read asfollowsDear Dr Jenkins, Ireferto your question without notice on the 23 1977 drawing my attention an article in the Melbourne of that date which alleged that soldiers were being for the Rhodesian army in Government was aware of these activities. The person referred to by Professor Roebuck is Mr Anthony William Bell who was unsuccessfully prosecuted June 1976 for placing an advertisement in the Hobart cury seeking recruits for the Rhodesian army. Mr Bell has served in the Rhodesian army apparently placed vertisement on his own initiative. Mr Bell has admitted to police that herecentlycontacted Professor Roebuck and handed to him papers associated with his activities last year, including a list of he had gathered. Inquiries reveal that Mr Bell has not undertaken furtherrecruitingsince his prosecution in 1976 and no evidence thatrecruitingis taking place in Tasmania. Ireiteratethat the Government is opposed to the Australian citizens as mercenaries in the armed forces other countries. This is one ment is planning to introduce legislation to prohibit ment in Australia for such purposes. Dr H.A. Jenkins, M.P. Parliament House, Canberra, A.C.T. 2600 As has been mentioned, in his reply the Prime Minister reiterates the Government's attitude the service of Australian citizens as mercenaries. His reply gives some basis for what is contained in this Bill. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for Attorney-General to authorise recruitment for specified armed force generally or in particular circumstances where that is considered appropriafter ate by the Government. This sort of authorissuch activity. ation, this let-out, in the Bill by the Attorney General concerns me because I wonder who lays down the criteria and the tests for such authorisParliament ation. This country has been involved in a major armed conflict where there was no declared state of war. I am reminded of my son at the age of 14 years attending high school in the United States of America and attending a seminar of high but school students at which the subject was Vietshooting nam. At the seminar Justice William O. Douglas of the United States Supreme Court was asked: ' Sir, what is your opinion of the war in Vietnam?' His reply was: 'Well, as a constitutional lawyer, to say there is no war in Vietnam'. This son that he is of terminology",65
135,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,He was a pan of the Vietnam,65
136,Dr JENKINS,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"The honourable member for Hunter interjects but I only repeat what Justice Douglas had to say about definition and the Prime Minister problems it can get one into when one gives disCanberra 1 March 1977 cretion to Ministers to authorise the waiving of conditions in this way. As I indicated previously, February my attitude is for an absolute ban on recruitment 'Age' for service overseas except in the Australian recruited forces or in United Nations peacekeeping forces. Australia and that the Australian In this way there can be no loopholes and there is no need for the let-outs. The snide operations in that go on to get men fighting overseas would go Merby the board. There are a lot of loopholes conwho cerning offences with regard to advertising for the adrecruits. There is in the community a number of ethnic groups. Persons can come from the same country but still have a variety of cultures and a twenty names variety of opinions. Mention was made of Yugoslavia. I mix with a lot of people from any Yugoslavia. The group with whom I do not mix there is is composed of the remnants of the Ustasha, the Chetmks and some of the younger people who service of are convinced of the right of the Croatian of national movement. I have been the subject of of the reasons why the Governrecruitabuse, spitting and proffered violence by this group when attending functions held by the Yours sincerely, other Yugoslavs. It seems to me that as they meet J. M. FRASER together and talk about what could be done to overthrow the legitimate Government of Yugoslavia, they would well come under the definition of clause 9.I am not sure that we really want to stop them in their daydreams. What we to want to do is to stop them inciting and carrying out violent action. After all, ethnic radio was used in Melbourne in November last year to at the least incite violence in Australia in this report. a One knows of the reported terrorist activity that has occurred and those who have been arrested leaving Australia in an attempt to carry out One of my colleagues in the Victorian State raised the question on Wednesday 16 March, of Croations running a military training camp in Gippsland. He gave a description of occurrences there. In fairness, he said that he could not guarantee that that was what was occurring there was certainly a lot of noise. There was and there was strong suspicion that that was what was going on. That, indeed, is one of the things that I am told when I go into the community. I think that is something which should I be stopped absolutely. There is no let out. There is no opportunity for such acuons to be authorised. When the umbrella of our nationality is accepted such people should conform to the sort of standards we set. There are some other matters in the Bill which concern me. I refer to clause 10 which deals with prosecutions. I feel that the Bill needs to be redrafted because it goes too lightly in this area. Once again a great deal of discretion is given to the Attorney-General. I trust that the present Attorney-General will not feel too sensitive about that remark. I am not making a personal attack on him. But as the person who holds the office of Attorney-General he is being relieved of a good deal of responsibility by that provision. Sub-clause (5) of clause 10 reads: Nothing in sub-section (4) prevents the discharge of the accused if proceedings are not continued within a time. What is the meaning of that sub-clause? Is that the prime let-out? Does that provide some way in which persons can avoid the sanctions imposed under this Bill, nebulous though they may be, as my colleague the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has pointed out? Those provisions need redrafting to give substance to the Bill. There are other things that flow from this sort of activity which should be considered. Recently there has been a spate of seizing of hostages throughout the world. When one reads accounts of these incidents one notices that most of them are carried out by national groups of some sort another, purportedly for the cause of their parattempt ticular nationality or their particular religious penchant. One recent international referred to the seizing of hostages as the scourge of the 1970s. Unless we have in this country legislation to prevent any suggestion of recruitJohnson) ment or of grouping that could be used for overnumber seas service we will find that next we will the same sort of seizing of hostages for political reasons-no t in regard to Australian politics but in regard to pohtical events on the international scene. I take a fairly extreme point of view on this matter when I say that there should be no recruitby ment of Australians for service in forces of other countries. There should be no recruitment of efforts them and no permission for them to go. I menand tioned 2 exceptions to that previously, and think they are proper and in accordance with our international responsibibty. I agree with colleagues who have said that while this Bill provided a vehicle for debate-I might even executive accept the proposition that there was some goodwill expressed and a desire for it to be effective-in its drafting it has too many loopholes to prevent the sort of activity that Australians find so repugnant and wish to see prevented.",65
137,Mr YATES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"The honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) has done the House a very great service by extending the scope of the discussion in the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Bill 1977 by taking extreme points of view so that we can look at the Bill with great care. The honourable member for Scullin must be one of those who must now regret that there is no standing committee of this House to which a Bill of this sort which involves extra-territoriality, private international law, civil liberties and diplomatic relations, can be sent. There was never a Bill such as this that reasonable would have provided the opportunity for the House to deliberate on it in a standing committee on law. At the present moment we nave no opportunity to do so, and therefore we have to do our very best. I must admire the courage of the Attorney General (Mr Ellicott). He has provided the very first Bill which I have known in history which concerns all the world. Honourable members should take note that every foreign country is referred to. In its definitions clause the Bill states: 'foreign country' means any country outside Australia. The provisions of the Bill extend to every territory, including, I suppose, the penguins in Antarctica where we have extra-terntorial rights. or The second half of the Bill which is an honest to deal with the main problem-that is to try to avoid this nation providing recruits for magazine foreign armies-is commendable. firm The honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith rightly pointed out that we have a large of migrant groups in this country. I do have not think people understand quite the complexity of the situation. There are 152 ethnic groups in Victoria alone. It would have been better if the House had had an opportunity of studying thefindingsof the Diplock Committee and also of seeing what lessons were to be learned from the long and learned study that was made that Committee. Therefore I do not myself complain about the Attorney-General's excellent in relation to clause 9, clause 10, clause 12 clause 15 of the Bill. Naturally one would I question the power which he is taking unto himself under this Bill. I would have thought that the my remark made by Lord Acton was correct. The has House should not increase the power of the but should try to diminish it. The Bill puts the Attorney-General in a very powerful position indeed. Having said that, let me now look at the first part of the Bill. This is an attempt to legislate for our nationals who are in another country. From what source do we actually obtain such a right? I have for a long time been trying tofindit, and I beheve it arises from the Statute of Westminster under Schedule 3 which reads: It is hereby declared and enacted that the Parliament dominion has full power to make laws having extra torial operation. I turn now to some of the other decisions that have been made, particularly those concerning efforts to tax those people who are not in this country-effort s to claim extra-territorial rights taxation. In the case of Morgan v. White it quite clearly declared that it is not competent this country to attempt to tax anyone or anyone's property outside this country. That decision was matter. based on the good old maxim: No taxation without representation. However, I suppose I ought to refer to the Constitution and try to find part which gives us the right to pass legislation relation to Australians abroad. Section 51 of Constitution reads: The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, power to make laws for the peace, order and good ment of the Commonwealth with respect to: As I look through what follows I see that the liament can deal with bankruptcy, foreign porations formed within the Commonwealth, week. service of executions throughout the Commonwas wealth in civil and criminal proceedings. ing to find anywhere in the Constitution that gives this Parliament the right to pass legislation in relation to Australians Uving in another couningly try, I eventually came upon section 51, placitum (xxix) which reads: External affairs: I do not know whether the Attorney-General be able to enhghten the House whether the power to legislate in this way exists. I express some very grave doubts about passing legislation of this sort. I ask the Attorney-General: Are required to pass this legislation by any resolution which we have voted for at the United Nations? Has any member of the Commonwealth at a would Commonwealth legal conference asked meming bers of the Commonwealth to pass legislation of this sort? I inquire of the Attorney-General in whether we are the one courageous nation that is passing laws which would affect people who have been in this country for 12 months and have gone to another country making them subject to 10 years imprisonment if they return here. Let us take some practical cases of how things might arise. Say one had had one's property stolen in The Lebanon because there was a change of government there and one went to Victoria and stayed with one's famUy for one year. One heard that the situation was getting better but another Government had of course taken over one's property and had placed guards outside it. One went back and one tried, using the ordinary system of recaption, to take back one's of a possessions and with a few friends in the evening territime one said: 'OK, I am going to enter my old house and I am going to remove from my old home the various possessions I once had'. But of course one was acting against the Government of that country. If in the rush going out one knocked in over the policeman at the door, actually injured was him and tore his uniform, what would happen for when one got back to Australia? It would be 10 years imprisonment. That is quite a serious Take another simple case. Say a change of that government occurred in Greece, one came to in Australia for a short term of 12 months, stayed the with one's famUy and went back to one's old hotel. One had kept one's health quite well and one thought it was safe to go back. One or two of have one's friends arrived and had a discussion in the governhall. One heard over the cups of coffee and the ouzo that they were actually thinking of being Parable to change the government, something which corsome Greeks think of almost every day of the Of course under this clause of the Bill what one doing? Can we be certain? One in fact In trywas in a buUding, one was the owner or occupier-on e might even have been the night watchman, the superintendent-and one knowpermitted one's friends to go into that room with the object of discussing how the Government could be overthrown; one was actually making suggestions that people might be hurt or something might happen which would injure will other people. Mr Groom-Clause 10 (3).",66
138,Mr YATES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"Clause 10 (3) would probably we get around the situation. However if one returns to Australia to rejoin one's family after having had the discussion, what would happen? It be 10 years imprisonment. I am just taka few ordinary, practical things that might happen as a result of the legislation as laid down this Bill in clauses 6 and 7.I am interested also that the penalties for actions abroad are 14 years and 10 years but in another clause of the Bill there is provision for afineof $10,000.1 wonder why there is the difference of penalty. Are we trying to pay off the deficit by raising money in this way? A penalty of $10,000 or 5 years imprisonlegislation ment is provided. Why is there the difference penalty in the different clauses of the Bill? what criterion has the Attorney-General decided on those penalties? I do not want the Attorney-General to run away and to think that I am being hostile about the matter at all. I think this is one of the most important pieces of legislation which I have for some time. I should like to close by saying honesty to the Opposition that I cannot accept amendment as it stands at present. It is far simplistic. I hope that this Bill will receive stantial amendment, and will be gone through clause by clause by a committee in another place. But I have to commend the Attorney-General a brave effort to put into legislative form things which many of us really and seriously desire. whole problem of people apparently running camps, other nations recruiting or other nations trying to find terrorists in Australia is one fills the pubhc with alarm and dismay. I think we can congratulate the Attorney General on what he has achieved. I hope that the Bill will receive most careful attention place.",67
139,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK," I join in this deand bate because I have been interested for some cenaries years in Austrahan mercenaries fighting seas wars. The honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) expresses lack of keenness or enthusiasm in the legislation. On the other hand the honourmember able member for Phillip (Mr Birney) expresses the same indignation as I about mercenaries who gentlemanI he agrees are nothing more than hired killers. I had forwarded believe that the Government is not keen and enand thusiastic about this legislation. I believe that Government is introducing this legislation for purpose of perrmtting it to hold its head a little higher in international forums so that it can say: 'But we in Australia have legislated. We will not be a party to allowing Australians to fight as mercenaries in overseas wars'. Why is the Government doing this? In my view it is for two or three particular reasons. Firstly, it knows- I would have expected honourable member for Holt to have mentioned it-the embarrassment that the British Governwere ment suffered recently when four or five of nationals were tried and sentenced to death for fighting as mercenaries on the wrong side Angola. I believe that the second reason that the Government is introducing this legislation is to prevent a possible increase in the number of Austry. traUansfightingas mercenaries in the civU war in Rhodesia as time goes on. I believe that the third reason that the Government has introduced this is so that it can say to the Government in of Yugoslavia and Yugoslavs in Australia that By we are introducing legislation to prevent people originally from Yugoslavia gomg there and fighting against the Government of Yugoslavia. I believe they are the principal reasons why the Government has introduced this legislation. I want to prove further the inconsistency of the read Government and the lack of sincerity on the in Government's part in this regard. In 1970, when its many honourable members on the Government too side today were not in the Parliament, including subthe present Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), I pointed out, I believe with overwhelming evidence, that the Australian Government was supfor porting mercenaries and financially backing them to participate in conflicts in other countries, The in Laos and Cambodia at the time of the Vietnam war that we all remember. I remind the House that in 1970 I asked this question of the which then Minister for the Army, the honourable  Can the Minister for the Army say whether the Australian Government has any knowledge of the suggestion reported in another in the Cessnock Eagle of 6 MarchThat was in 1970elsewhere concerning Australian soldiers serving as merin Laos? Has the Government co-operated in any way in having Australian soldiers, either before or after disin overcharge, serve as mercenaries in Laos? The then Minister for the Army, the honourable answer  have not seen the report referred to by the honourable and I would not wish to make a comment until he it to me. I would be obliged if he would do so I would be prepared then to give him an answer. the I supplied the then Minister for the Army, the the honourable member for Kooyong, with a copy of a leading article in the Cessnock Eagle-a n insignificant newspaper but not written by an insignificant man. The article was written by a very dedicated, high principled Australian journaUst who was at that time working for the Cessnock Eagle. He pointed out in his leading article that he had attended with another Australian the journalist the Zambesi Club in London and interviewed a good number of Australians who outspoken. They said that they were offerits ing themselves as mercenaries, that they were going tofightfor a quid and that they were supin portedfinanciallybe the Australian Government. I believe that statement to be true. Here is a complete about face by the Tories of this counI might say that I never got a reply from the Minister for the Army. I went on to point out that the Minister said that he was not aware of the report in the newspaper to which I had referred and asked me for a copy of it. I immediately obliged him. The article went on to allege that Asia. the Austrahan Government for the past 2 to 3 years had men involved in the war in Laos that it would probably deny this emphatically. The article alleged further that it was well known among foreign correspondents and military commalAlluniform mentators that mercenary troops had been workboys ing in Laos for the past few years. Most of the ments troops were either New Zealanders, Australians the or South Africans. The article stated that on leave these mercenaries hang out in the ementflatsof Earl's Court, London, waiting their next job. They spent much of their time the Zambesi Club and were ready to talk to pathetic looking journalists. The soldiers regarded themselves as soldiers fighting for cause which gave them no reward except money. journalist? They stated that they were well and truly covered by a comprehensive insurance scheme and that when one of them had his brains blown out his family was well cared for. The article stated that they resented the nasty pubUcity they received in Nigeria and the Congo. They were interviewed by 2 young and forthWe've right Australian journalists whom I shall name. border. One was Kenneth Brass, formerly of the Sydney the back Morning Herald in London and now believed to istheColonel be with the London Daily Mail. The other was a young journalist, Brian Hungerford, who held an important post in the United Nations. Those journalists interviewed the mercenaries at the Zambesi Club at Earl's Court. The soldiers stated that they were New Zealanders, South Africans and Australians. They said that they werefinancedin part by the Australian Governthese ment to carry out their operations. Mr Armitage - Which Australian dier told the journalist: Government?",68
140,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,The previous Government in and he's 1970 which held simUar poltiical principles to the ones held today by this Government-by the day. We Tories of this country. Mr Armitage-That would be the MCMahon mate Government.,69
141,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"That would be the MCMahon what Government. The soldiers said that they were financed in part by the Australian Governmentthis to carry out their operations. They complained being treated as thugs and murderers on their return to England. One soldier, believed to be Australian, was reported as having said: We are just soldiers. We have the same problems soldiers have. We are only fighting boongs, but boongs rifles are dangerous. That is a disgraceful statement. Mr Armitage-That is good for the people in",69
142,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"Yes . The mercenaries said these and things at the interview by Brass and Brian Hungerford. One of them said the dirty work we do. See, we can get in when the nortroops cannot make it. That's why some of our are in Laos. The Aussie or the United States Governcan't send in ordinary troops wearing uniforms. All coons would start screaming in the United Nations about when intervention and neutrality and all that. tenI put it to the Attorney-General: Has not that for statement got a true ring to it? Does not that at statement as quoted sound as if it came from the symmouth of a forthright Australian mercenary at Earl's Court in London when interviewed by a Brian Hungerford, a forthright young Australian Mr Armitage-FUth y racists.",69
143,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"Yes , and they were backed at the timeby the Tories of this country. There was no denial of it when I alleged it in the Parliament in 1970. The journalist reported one of the mercenaries as having said: lost a few of our blokes around the Vietnam The bloody Chinks keep crossing over to get around of the Yanks. It's our job to keep them occupied all time.We do too, but we get no thanks for it. Our top man Peters. We all reckon he is a great man. I went on to inform the House that Colonel 2 Peters was a retired former high-ranking British soldier. He is alleged to have played a part in recruiting mercenaries tofightin the Congo and Laos and in Nigeria prior to the ending of the wars there. He is credited with recruiting most of mercenaries in Johannesburg. Colonel Peters was alleged by one of the mercenaries to be a man of high ideals about the world. The solHe doesn't want the boongs or the Commos to take over prepared to go to any lengths to back his ideals. One of our brigades in the Congo gotridof 1000 boongs in one bloody soon settled the nasty little situation there. The Government did nothing about it. The cUforeign then was that we were backing American policy. Since 1970 when I brought this matter before the House there has been some of a change. It was reported to the Australian journalist to whom I have referred that organisation which was recruiting merof cenaries in London, including a good number of Australians, bought a terrace of nouses in which an 300 Australian, New Zealand and South African mercenary soldiers were to be domicUed when in other London on leave. As I have said, this interview with took place with twelve or more mercenary soldiers at the Zambesi Club in Earl's Court in London. The man who gave most of this information was an Australian soldier who had done 2 years' Army service and who had become restless. The resultant interview to which I have referred was reported in the United Kingdom Press. It is a wonder that the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates), if he was in England at that time, did not read of it because he was an enthusiastic practising politician or an enthusiastic political student at that time. If he was in England at the time one would think that he would recall reading the article, in a debate of this nature now fore this House. Mr Bourchier-Who told you?",69
144,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,If the honourable gentleman were listening to me he would have known who told me. Brian Hungerford told me and I read the article in the Cessnock Eagle. I brought the matter before the House.,70
145,Mr BAILLIEU,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"On a dark night. Ha, ha.",70
146,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"Yes. A BaUlieu laughs. His dignity would not let him read the coal miners' cause-the Cessnock Eagle. Oh, no! However, the article was printed in the United Kingdom Press and it was broadcast by the British Broadcasting Commission. It surprised many British people. They learned that the Australian Government was paying professional mercenary soldiers to do dirty work. The Australian mercenaries were proud of their achievement and profession and what they were doing on behalf of the Australian Government, the article in the British Press said, though they regretted that the ordinary campaign medals associated with normal mUitary adventures were not for them. Yet the United States and Australian governments claimed at thetimethat they were not involved in the war in Laos. If this article and these gations of Hungerford's had been untrue, one would have expected a responsible Minister in Mr MCMahon's Government at thetimeto deny in the British Press that the Australian Government was subsidising mercenaries to carry out the duties which were alleged by those 2 forthright Australian journalists. Mr William MCMahon-You naughty boy. You know you are telling a Ue.",70
147,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,I know I am not telling a Ue. I know the consequences of lying to this Parliament. I have never told a lie since I have been a member. Mr William MCMahon-What are you doing now?,70
148,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"I am not telling a Ue. You ignored it. You never thought the day would come when the matter would be revived. I recall some of the remarks of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom). If my memory serves me correctly, he spoke of fighting for an international brigade. He made some reference to the Spanish CivU War. He mentioned Franco's name. Franco was fighting against the Spanish Government. If it had not been for outside intervention, the Spanish people would not have suffered for almost 30 years the oppressive fascist rule of the Franco Governbement. Mercenaries actuaUy contributed to the installation of the fascist regime in Spain which oppressed those people for so long. Many lives were lost under the Franco regime. It is not conscience that is causing the Government to bring forward this legislation. It is not principle that is causing the Government to bring forward this legislation. The Government is bringing forward this legislation so that it can say in the forums of the world that it objects to mercenaries from Australia participating in foreign wars. I do not think the legislation goes far enough, as was said by speakers on this side of the House, particularly the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). Does the legislation suggest that any person who leaves Australia and enlists as a mercenary in a foreign country, as Australians were doing at the Zambesi Club at Earls Court in London, is guUty of an offence? Can this legislation do anything to prevent Australians from going overseas and enlisting as mercenaries? Can it take their passports off them?",70
149,Mr YATES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,Yes.,70
150,Mr JAMES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"Can it? It certainly should. The tories sawfitto take WUfred Burchett's passport alleoff him when he wanted to come back and see his dying 80-year-old father. Burchett was a freelance journalist. The tories prevented him from coming back to Australia by not reissuing a passport to him. They allowed mercenaries to fight in Laos, Cambodia, Nigeria and elsewhere on the African continent. If they had been doing their job in 1970, they would have established the identity of these mercenaries and would have passed legislation not in 1977 but immediately it was brought to the notice of the House that Australian mercenaries were being backed by the Australian Government to fight in foreign wars. So it is not to their credit and it is not with sincerity that they are bringing this legislation before the Parliament now. I get no joy out of making that allegation against the sidestepping Attorney-General, who probably is a better lawyer than he is a sidestepper when eggs are thrown at him. I believe that the time to introduce this legislation was 1970, when it was first brought to the notice of honourable members opposite that Austrahans were fighting as mercenaries, allegedly backedfinanciallyby the Austrahan Government.",70
151,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"It was not my intention to make any comment upon the speech of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) but as he mentioned in passing the name of WUfred Burchett I am obliged to make one or two comments. I am amazed at the contradiction in his speech. He was able to cry because Australians may be involved in hostilities overseas of any kind whatsoever, whether as mercenaries or as people doing anything at all. He cried that he was concerned and sincerely upset about that. He was upset further that we would not welcome into this country WUfred Burchett, perhaps as a patriotic and a loyal Australian. I find it difficult to accept the second proposition because I know personally Australian soldiers who were captured in Korea and who were interviewed by WUfred Burchett in the company of communist Chinese soldiers in North Korea. Therefore, for him to assume that the speaker following him would not remind the House of the very reprehensible action committed by Wilfred Burchett is beyond my imagination. I turn to the substance of this Bill. It aims to do only 2 things. What it aims to do ought to be understood by the House. What it cannot do ought to be understood by the House. I quote from the first paragraph of the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr EUicott): Thus, the first objective of the Bill is to prohibit persons preparing for or engaging in incursions into foreign countries. It makes no other claim. He also said: The second is to prohibit the recruiting in Australia sons to serve in armed forces in a foreign country. The Bill does not aim to do any more than that. It cannot do any more than that. I refer now to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). He is a talented, sensible member of the Opposition and a loyal Australian. He seeks to make hostUe actions of any kind by Australians in foreign countries subject to the provisions of this Bill. He is trying to make this country a peeping, a prying and a pimping country which must take action in respect of every activity by an Australian overseas. That is the consequence of paragraph (a) of the words proposed to be added to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. That is an absolutely absurd proposition. It would make a government the laughing stock of the world. What is intended by this Bill? Two precepts were enunciated by the Attorney-General. It cannot do more than that. We hope it cannot do less than that. It must do so with a degree of common sense. The other characteristic which underUes this Bill is that it must be of a poltiical nature, having regard to political effects in respect of Australians in overseas countries and in respect of the governments of overseas countries. The origin of the Bill makes it quite clear. A piece of history, I think, is appropriate. It is not often that present members of this place or even members in the 1930s praise actions of the League of Nations. The characteristic reference to the League of Nations is that it was considering a convention on road traffic signs whUe the Germans were marching into Danzig. That was a measure of its effectiveness. It passed a convention that has an appropriate relationship to what this Bill is about. I shall read from what is known as the Convention for the Prevention and the Punishment of Terrorism which was passed by the League of Nations in 1937. The convention was primarily aimed at the protection of heads of state and other public figures. It is in Une with what this Bill is supposed to do. It was designed to prohibit any form of preparation for or execution of terrorist outrages upon the life or liberty of persons taking part in the work of foreign pubUc authorities and services. This Bill goes beyond that. But the principles involved in the convention are appropriate to this Bill. In 1937 the League of Nations considered that matter following the events of 1934.1 know that the honourable member for PhUUp (Mr Birney) is vitally interested in this matter. In 1934, as the House knows, there was the dual assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and Louis of per- Barthou, the French Foreign Minister at the time. As a result of that assassination in France of those 2 people by a citizen of one of the Yugoslav provinces, a train of events was set in course which did have a great effect on World War II. Some say that as a result of that action the little entente which acted as a brake upon the developing power of Germany during the 1930s was dissolved. Only history can tell what effect the dissolution of the Uttle entente had with the passing of Alexander I. But the point I want to make is this: That action in a foreign countrythat incursion and that terrorist action-ha d very grave ultimate political consequences. So that has to be taken as the ultimate point of departure as far as this Bill is concerned. It has to be concerned with heads of state. It has to be concerned in respect of governments. It has to allow to the Attorney-General of this country the power to make exceptions and to make judgments according to the foreign policy or the defence requirements of Australia. Were it not to allow those exceptions to occur the country could be drawn into every type of absurd situation imaginable. The Bill is not a charter of behaviour of Australians overseas. It is not a charter of the rights of Australians overseas. It is not a charter of the obligations of Australians overseas. But it must have characteristics in relation to the actions of Australians in relation to governments overseas. That is the whole purpose of the legislation. Unless those matters are understood, I am afraid that the very nature of the Bill cannot be understood. The year 1934 was a year of assassinations which affected the course of the world and certainly affected the course of Europe. That is the reason for the inclusion of clause 6 in the Bill. The side note to the clause states: Incursions into foreign countries for purpose in hostile activities. Clause 6(1) states: A person shall not(a) enter a foreign country with intent to engage tile activity against the government of that country; The Opposition proposes to delete the words 'against the goverament of that country'. The clause continues: (b) engage, in a foreign countiy, in a hostile against the government of that country. Delete those words-that is the sum total of the in rationale of the amendments moved by the Werespect Opposition-and we would make Australian Australia didsituation foreign policy and Australian defence policy the mainland China but recognised plaything of random and erratic actions by any Australian overseas. It will be said that any would action by an Australian overseas-it does not action have to be in respect of a country overseas-is a Bill cause for action itself. One can come up with some quite absurd ations. Take the example of Lord Byron. If Lord Byron was an Australian citizen and not a British citizen what would be the requirements of body Australia? To what extent would Australia be held responsibUe for his actions against the Turks if he were an Australian citizen? What action would have to be taken? Would the penalties outlined so brUUantly by the activity honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) have to of doing be contemplated by the Government? would be an absolutely absurd situation. What would happen with respect to British soldiers serving overseas if they happened to be Australian soldiers? In such a case, what would propeny happen to such soldiers fighting with Garibaldi? Australia would be impelled into action. It would not be possible to withdraw from action. Australia would, ipsofacto, have to take a course of action in respect of those matters. Another example concerns events that occurred with respect to World War II when countries made treaties with an occupying power as a last resort. People came out of those countries and found themselves in another service overseas fighting ostensibly for the liberation of a country which, for legal purposes, had been taken over in a friendly way. FlexibUity on the part of a government would be prevented in such cases. A government would be impelled to take a particular course of action. The very phUosophy and very nature of this Bill require that common sense be appUed to it. I give another example which will not appeal to all members of this House but nevertheless it is appropriate. During World War I Archbishop of engaging Manmx, the Archbishop of Melbourne, because of the troubles in Ireland found himself on the way to that country which was occupied by another power. We know what happened. We in a hosknow that this event has often been characterised or historically as one of the greatest victories of the British Navy. Nevertheless, accepting that position, Australia would have been impelled into action irreversibly on account of that trip being activity taken to Ireland by the late Archbishop Mannix. How can one conduct oneself sensibly and with reason in a world where no flexibUity is aUowed of those matters? It is just not on. had a not have a few years ago in which diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. What happen with respect to Australia taking an or intending an action of one kind or another defined as widely as is clause 6 (3) of the in respect of mainland China? We would be impeUed mto action again. These are just some situexamples of the absurd position in which a number of the propositions put forward by the Opposition would in fact leave this country. Nocould conduct foreign policy on that basis. We would be led into absurd positions. Clause in Greece 6 (3) of the Bill states: For the purposes of sub-secuon (1), engaging in a hostile against the government of a foreign country consists an act for the purpose of achieving anyone or more That of the following objectives . . . Paragraph (d) of sub-clause (3) states: Unlawfully destroying or damaging any real or personal belonging to the government of the foreign countiy. What does that mean? Are we to say, as has beennever-never said over and over again tonight, that the legisUes lation would affect some modest action by an Australian overseas such as lucking in a teleLeague phone booth or punching a referee at a British soccer game? I can imagine the emotions that would be aroused by that action. If the OppoUltimately sition's amendments were accepted the Ausciple traUan Government would be impelled into only action. Members of the Opposition have made quite clear in their speeches that theflexibUityal-example. lowed to the Government in clauses 9 and 10 would not apply. ThatflexibUityis absolutely essential if there is to be any common sense whatsoever. I suggest that the power given to the Mmister would in terms of clause 9 (2) is quite important. Clause 9(2) states: If the Minister has, by instrument signed published in the Gazette, declared that it is in the the defence or intemauonal relations of Australia to the recruitment . . . Then recruitment can take place. The ultimate effect of the sentiment expressed by the Oppoa sition would be that aU Australian relations Papua New Guinea could be endangered. They could be made very difficult. The transfer of sonnel could be made quite difficult. Where they stand in relation to this? It is common that something would have to be done about Clause 10 makes it clear that once a prosecution has commenced, whether or not it is proceeded with, it allows the Government and the Minister to make their own decision. Clause 10(1) states: Subject to sub-secuon (2), a prosecution for an offence against this Act shall be on indictment. Paragraph (c) of sub-clause (4) states: A person so charged may be remanded in custody or on bail, out no further step in proceedings referred to in subsecuon (3) shall be taken in relation to the offence a consent has been given. Sub-clause (5) states: Nothing in sub-section (4) prevents the discharge accused if proceedings are not continued within a reasonable time. AU these provisions merely allow a country in charge of its own foreign pohcy. I remind the House that the United Nations covenants with respect to crimes against diplomatic persons and so on are expressed in terms of the grave effect their non-observance could have in jeopardising foreign poUcy or foreign relations. The covenantswho with respect to this matter have that as its eminent principle, according to whether it judges the common sense or legaUty of what it is doing. This Bill is poltiical. It has to be unashamedly poltiical. Were it not poltiical it would Uve in world. Its origin in the modern era in those circumstances of the 1934 period. It has a relationship to the consideration by the of Nations of those events that went on for 3 years. It has a relationship to the activities of governments in relation to one another. it assumes the non-interference prinof governments in relation to one another. I wish that that principle had been observed a it Uttle more from North Korea to South Korea, for Nevertheless, the Bill has its origin in that. Unless those facts are reaUsed the Bui becomes an absolute nonsense. I would suggest therefore that the amendment moved by the Opposition would make the Bill a nonsense and any make it unable to deal significantly with events whatsoever.",71
152,Mr SCHOLES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK," I support the by him and amendment moved by the honourable member interests of for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). The permit Bill has some rather strange provisions. Clause 9 is one of them. It virtually provides in sub-clause (2) the power to the Attorney-General to publish notice in the Gazette offering the Government's withsupport for a particular war. That is the only interpretation one can place on that clause. Subper-clause 9(1) makes Ulegal only foreign incursions do by forces whofightagainst a government. There senseare some interesting cases which would make it. one wonder where theyfitwithin the terms of this Bill. Over a considerable number of years it has been a regular practice- I do not think it could be denied that recruitment has taken place in Australia-for persons to leave Australia and join the armed forces of Israel as part of the establishment of the Jewish state and also to assist in the defence of that country against incursions by other governments. To which government do we apply sub-clause 9(2) in that case? It is a until such government-to-government situation, not a rebels versus government situation. Earlier in the night we had some mention of of the the International Brigade. My understanding would be that any person who joined the International Brigade in the Spanish CivU War would to be have been committing an offence under this legislation because Franco was in fact a rebel. One of the other areas of the Bill which seems to me to have a degree of unreaUty is that, it could be for instance, that the British Government would seek in Australia from British migrants are still British citizens recruits for the preBritish armed forces. This would appear to be outlawed by the Bill. My opinion is that whUst the Bill seeks to meet a purpose which the Opposition supports it does not necessarily meet a that purpose. I make one point about paragraph (a) of sub-clause 9(1). Apparently it would be quite proper under that paragraph for persons to go to Uganda tofighton the side of Idi Amin. I am not quite sure that many Australians would agree that they should do so, but he happens to be the legal government of that country and is recognised by this country as the government of that country. But it would be illegal for any person tofightin a war which sought to displace that leader. The Attorney-General (Mr Elhcott) in an interview has indicated that in the case of Rhodesia it would be illegal to fight on either side. Mr Ellicott- I have never said that.",73
153,Mr SCHOLES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"The transcript of the interview states: Whether they are professional soldiers or not, if to Rhodesia to fight in a Rhodesian force they would be breaching this legislation. That is taken from the transcript of a PM interview. If it is incorrect I apologise to the Minister. I was relying on the accuracy of the transcript. We seem to have trouble with those sorts of quotes. We would like to know what the situation would be with Rhodesia, where the government is not recognised. A few years ago persons were recruited and trained in Australia for an expeditionary force to go to Yugoslavia to liberate Croatia. The people concerned quitefirmlybelieved in the correctness of their cause. Quite obviously they were misled by the people who recruited them. Their action would be illegal, even though over a period of time the Government has indicated some degree of support for their cause. But under this Bill apparently if it suited the Government's foreign policy the Minister could by pubUcation in the Gazette make that a legal act and therefore create a state of war between Australia and another country in this sort of circumstance. There are all sorts of rather bizarre possibUiAustralia ties under clause 9 of the Bill which I do not think we ought to be passing after the short period study which has been given to this Bill and withshould out a considerably greater degree of examination of the real and long term implications. The Bill does not seem to meet the purpose which its states, name would indicate it should meet. Certainly would provide for a defacto state of war in instances. I do not know whether the Attorneyrecruited General is able to indicate whether in the Israelisupporting Arab situation it would be legal to recruit persons to join one side and Ulegal to recruit people join the other side. The Idi Amin situation is repeated in a number of places around the world where most likely it would be government policy not to support the government of the day because of its attitude or the manner in which it came to power. For instance, one would not expect a Labor government here to have much sympathy for the people in ChUe who overthrew Allende. One would hope that no Australian Government would. But under this Bill, once the overthrow had taken place it would become legal for persons to go to ChUe tofightagainst the forces of the former government which had been elected. But it would be quite Ulegal for persons to go to that country andfightfor what was the properly elected government before a seizure of power took place. Recently in ThaUand we saw almost the same situation where an elected government was overthrown by the armed forces-no t the first,I must they went say, in that country-and overnight a government was established. It then becomes Ulegal unless we do not recognise it or the Attorney General says that it is all right to go and fight against that government. I do not think that any pohtician should exercise that power. We had a situation where the elected government having been overthrown, it would be Ulegal to seek to support that elected government's restoration to the position to which the people had elected it. They seem to me to be contradictions in terms. I would be far happier if there were a total embargo on Australians going tofightfor or against foreign governments. That may be a restriction of civU liberties but certainly it would be no more a restriction of civU liberties than it is to say that no Australians can go to Uganda tofightagainst Idi Amin but they can go tofightfor him. That is the most obvious case that one could mention. The Bill does not serve the purpose which its title would indicate that it should serve. I support the amendment which seeks the withdrawal of the Bill and its redrafting so that it meets this purpose of banning foreign incursions. If is at war or is involved in an international action of any description in which the of government of the day considers that the country be involved, the government of the day has ample powers to involve itself in that situation. I do not believe that we should, as clause 9 be in a situation where we can be involved it in & de facto situation either by a notice some published in the Gazette or by persons being to join the armies of another country the government. That is as much as participating in a civil war, and the notice of it into the Gazette would be an impossible situation in any foreign policy. If the Government is not prepared to support one side or the other as a part of foreign policy I would be very surprised if any notice were published in the Gazette by the Attorney-General saying: ' If people want to go and fight for the government of, say, Israel or Syria-bot h countries' are likely to be involved - o r one of the 2 claimants to government in some country where there is a disputed government, that is all right; the Government supports their fighting on one side but the Government does not involve itself. Clause 9 is a contradiction in terms. It certainly does not fulfil what the Bill suggests it is intended to fulfil. If bans be placed on Australians going as mercenaries to fight in other countries the bans should be total and not restricted in the manner in which they are there. There is nothing which could stop a person from leaving Australia and being recruited into the army of any country if he so desires. The Act would apply only on his return to Australia. I raise again the other problem which I see the legislation and that is that there are numerscientious ous nationals of other countries in Australia could well be recruited to join the armed forces of another country even though they have manent residence here. There are Australian citipeople zens who are in exactly this situation. For instance, if a Greek citizen returns to Greece could be liable for military service. If he taken out Australian citizenship he would find himself in the situation of being in breach of legislation by carrying out an obUgation for which, if he faUs to carry it out, he would be imprisoned in that country. Other European governments do the same thing. Mr Ellicott-That would not be right.",74
154,Mr SCHOLES,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"That is the way the Bill reads. I suggest that the Bill does not meet the requirements that even the Minister would put on it. It ought to be given careful examination because once it is passed by this Parliament highly unlikely that it will be returned examination. 1 do not think that anything like adequate time has been given for proper study of the effects of the Bill. Certainly a week is not enough in which to obtain adequate legal opinion on the meanings of some of the clauses. Irrespective of how good it is, I am certain that the Government could not have drafted the Bill in the time that is left for its examination detaU.",75
155,Mr NEIL,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"The primary purpose of the Bill which the House is debating to deal with preparations made in this country for hostile acts in other countries. The recent has shown that such activities have occurred in Australia. Whether or not the persons acted, as they saw it, in good conscience, it is intolerable that we have mUitary preparations going on in Australia. I understand from published reports and also from statements made on behalf of the Government that in the past few years there have been incidents of persons engaged in mUitary training or drilling, or having weapons or explosives avaUable to them in this country for the purpose of training to go to other countries. That cannot be tolerated in this are to country because there must be some effect or some potential effect upon the freedom and safety of our own citizens if any person in the community is to take up arms, explosives or the like and carry out training or simUar activities. The separate question of actual entry into other countries is also dealt with by the Bill. That is a somewhat more compUcated matter because it brings in the question of mercenary activity. It in brings into relief that whole problem of the confighter as against the conscientious who objector, which is a completely different situation. The conscientious fighter may be a person perwho on some criteria is applauded by some but who on the same or other criteria is condemned by others as being a terrorist. The he British Committee of Privy CouncUlors looked has into this matter in considerable detaU and concluded that there were a number of reasons this which might commend themselves to a government in order that it ban this activity, but that there was only one real reason to prevent it and that was that the restrictions on the freedom of an individual to go and fight in another country were warranted because under international agreements the relations of the 2 countries could be seriously impaired. The Committee decided that the maintenance of good international relations between the United Kingdom, in that case, and other states should be maintained by legisit is lation within the United Kingdom to prevent for rethese difficulties from arising. In the very shorttimeavaUable to me I want to deal briefly with one particular point before I long move on to the substantive points. I am greatly disappointed in the amendment put forward by the Opposition. Although one can possibly see some arguments directed towards clause 6 and to the clause dealing with the Attorney-General's in power and more particularly his delegation of power, the amendment simply is unintelligible in the context of the whole Bill. If the amendment is were to be passed we would have a situation in which we would have an Act which could not be past soundly read. It is not a sensible one.",75

167,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Mrs Finnane wrote to me on 24 February 1977 enclosing a cheque for $2.00 for this purpose. (2) This donation is being returned to Mrs Finnane. While her action is commendable, it is clear that if a Common Fund were established, it would be financed from Government sources and not from voluntary contributions by individuals. (3) and (4) As a major producer and exporter of agricultural and mineral commodities, Australia has first hand ex(Question No. 106) perience of the many problems faced by developing country commodity exporters. We have worked actively over the years in international discussions and negotiations aimed at improving the conditions of international commodity trade. Accordingly, Australia supported, and is participating fully in intensive discussions and negotiations under the UNCTAD Integrated Program for Commodities. Among other things therelevantUNCTAD Resolution on the Integrated Program called for the convening of a negotiating conference on a common fund which began on 7 March in Geneva. The main purpose of a common fund would be tofinancebuffer stocks or other stocking arrangements which is only one of a number of measures that could be included in individual commodity agreements or arrangements, and the extent to which stocking arrangements might be used has still to be determined. No decision has yet been taken internationally to establish a common fund. A number of important and complex issues remains to be considered and firm proposals drawn up. The Government firmly recognises that participants in an individual commodity agreement have the responsibility jointly of ensuring that finance is available for stocking arrangements where these have been agreed as an appropriate measure in that agreement. However, in the terms currendy proposed, the Government remains to be convinced of the need for a common fund as an element of the Integrated Program.

The average number of aircraft taking-off and landing have been extracted from the records of actual aircraft movements for 1976.

DC9 2 B707 3 Mr SINCLAIR - The answer to the honourable DC8 3 F27 2 member's question is as follows: DC9 2 B727 2 (1) I am aware that Mr Ian Tuxworth, former Executive F27 4 Member for Resources Development in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, has expressed views on this subject. (Question No. 316) (2) Neither I nor my Department has any evidence that would support the views expressed. (3) The penalties provided in the legislation are considered adequate to meet present requirements. A review will be undertaken as part of preparation for any future legislation to extend Australia's jurisdiction over foreign fishing activities. (4) Neither I nor my Department is aware of any formal representations on the current penalties. From time to time, there has been appeal litigation in higher courts against penalties that have been ordered and discussions between the parries have taken place in respect of that particular matter. The penalties, comprising fines and forfeiture of boat, catch or fishing gear, are designed to fall on the people who would stand to profit most from illegal intrusion into Australia's exclusivefisheriesjurisdiction. Handicapped Child Allowance Dr Cass asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 16 March 1977: Are children with below-the-elbow or below-the-knee amputations eligible for the Handicapped Child Allowance.",78
168,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The Minister for Social Security has mission provided the following answer member's question. A basic criterion in the definition of a handicapped child for the purposes of Handicapped Child's Allowance is that the child requires constant care and attendon by reason of his physical or mental disability. In view of this definition it is not practicable or desirable to set down a blanket rule that children with below-the-elbow or below-the-knee amputations are or are not entitled to Handicapped Child's Allowance. Each claim is considered on its ments taking into account the severity of the handicap, any secondary disability and the ability of the child to cope with his handicap. The claim has provision for the parents to advise if appropriate, of the child's difficulties haviour, speech, language, hearing and of the special care and attention provided including number of hours per day care is required. This assessment and the report completed by the child's supervising doctor are then considered by a Commonwealth Medical Officer employed by the Department of Health, who certifies whether the child can be accepted as severely handicapped for the purpose of the allowance. Prime Minister's Visits to the United States Mr Hurford asked the Prime Minister, notice, on 16 March 1977: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report to the effect that on his last visit to Washington Australia's views on global affairs were not sought by Washington nor welcomed if they were offered. (2) On that occasion did he raise the question of China in his talks with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger suggesting that the United States of America had been late in coming to terms with the Chinese.
