1,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,"I think it right to bring under the notice of the tain irregular proceedings in relation to the conduct of the business of the House which transpired during the course of last week's sittings. When the proceedother ings were resumed after the luncheon adjournment on Friday, it was reported to me that the mace had been removed by some unauthorized person. I had a search instituted, and at a later hour of an attendant recovered the mace, which had been secreted under one of the Oppothe sition benches. In connection with this episode, the names of two honourable meming bers of this House have been published the Argus newspaper. Perhaps the honthat orable members concerned may desire to offer an explanation of the incident to House. About the same time, T missed the Speaker's copy of May's Parliaagree mentary Practice from its accustomed place on my desk. This was recovered a late hour at night by one of ants, lying open, face downwards, in a fuel locker in the north lobby. All the Prime reference marking slips, which I had inAffairs)Minister serted for convenience of ready on points liable to crop up during various terference stages of the proceedings of the House, were missing, and have not since been covered. I discovered, subsequently, that affair other papers, typed, and in manuscript, what action having special reference to authorities and prepared at the House of Commons' decisions relating to member, or any one rulings I had given, which are the subject liament, has been guilty of notices of motion of dissent on the things that have been reported business-paper, were missing from my desk. In the early hours of the morning, Speaker, when a division was about to take place, is the attendants reported that the keys had been removed from the chamber doors on privileges either side of the Speaker's chair, and thus to the doors could not be locked during the the divisions. And, later, it was reported to does notchamber, me that the communication door leading is imperative, therefore, from the passage behind the Speaker's possible, how these things occurred, chair into the Queen's Hall, had been act accordingly. locked, and the key removed. The interference with the exits and entrances to the chamber is, in my opinion, a matter of very grave importance, involving, as it does, the obstructing of honourable members in the performance of their legitimate duties in the House. The several matters mentioned, I think, should be noticed by the House, as every honourable member is personally concerned in anything affecting the rights and privileges of members, and the honour, dignity, credit and repuHouse certation of Parliament.",12
2,Mr HIGGS,PARLIAMENTARY,"Capricornia) [2.34] As I have been mentioned in the Melbourne Argus, and, I believe, in certain newspapers, as having had something to do with the removal of the mace from the table, and the placing of it under one of the seats in this chamber, let me say that I respectfully decline to say a the day word one way or the other about matter. As to the removal of your books and papers, Mr Speaker, the lockof doors, and the stealing of keys, I by know nothing. I am very sorry to learn you have been embarrassed, even temporarily, by the loss of your documents. the You had a very strenuous time during the last sitting, and although I do not with many of your rulings, as is shown by the notice-paper, I sympathize at deeply with you in any embarrassment to the attendwhich you have been put.",12

If any connected with Parof any of the by Mr. the manly course for him to take to say so, and to apologize for having committed an undoubted breach of the of Parliament. If the tearing pieces of books, and interference with locks and bolts of the doors leading to this is to be permitted, one know where matters may end. It to find out, if and to",12
4,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,There is one thing you omitted to mention-the interference with the hells in the garden.,13
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY,I do not think that there has been any interference with the bells.,13
6,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,No interference with the bells has been reported.,13
7,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY,Were not the bells interfered with during the whole of last week?,13
8,Mr HANS IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARY,"We have not heard of it , nor has the honourable member.",13
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY,"I regret that an honourable member who is afflicted w deafness was occasioned inconvenience. Like every other honourable member, sympathize with him in regard to what occurred.",13
10,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY,The bells do not in the garden. The honourable member f Denison and myself were nearly caught the same way.,13
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY,"Whether the fore."" bells ring there or - not, that is a little trouble which is easily understandable, and can be quickly set right. These other it would not yield. matters are of consequence. The Government will consider between now morrow what course it is best to pursue regard to them.",13
12,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY,"Wide Bay) [2.38] - I think you did right, and performed a public duty, Mr Speaker, in reporting House the regrettable incidents that occurred during our last sitting. Every honourable member feels that he should able to lay down, in any part of the ing, his papers, private or otherwise, anything else belonging to him, in the tainty that they will be permitted to remain unused and undisturbed by any one but himself. Confidence in this matter has long been felt by every member of pose? Parliament. I have no doubt that the events reported were the result of a guided prank; they were not, I hope, effect of malice. As to the locking of doors, I am afraid that I have some ing knowledge of honourable members playing pranks of that kind at times, though such conduct is not to be defended.",13
13,Mr HIGGS,PARLIAMENTARY,But it would not be to trance to the chamber. the interests of the party on this side lock doors during that debate.,13
14,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY,"I am not speaking now of parties in any way. Neither of these acts can be defended, and they are much to be regretted. Property of all kinds belonging to honourable members ought to be left undisturbed, for we shall thereby preserve not only our own dignity, but the dignity of Parliament.",13
15,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY,"Maribyrnong) [2.41]. - I should like to make a statement at this juncture in reference to an incident in which the honourable member for Brisbane and myself took some little part. On Friday morning, about 2 or 2.15 o'clock, I happened to be reading one of the morning newspapers in the passage just outside one of the doors referred to. i th The honourable member for Brisbane, in passing, congratulated me on looking so I comfortable. Just then, I happened to glance through the glass door, and saw that the wooden door beyond was closed. ring I drew the attention of the honourable o r member for Brisbane to the fact, and in said, "" This is rather extraordinary; I have never seen those doors closed beThe honourable member then opened the glass door, and tried to push the wooden door open, but found that He thereupon exerted a little more vigour, and the two and todoors burst open. We examined the in doors, and found thab the wooden door had been locked, and that the key was missing. I do not wish to introduce anything of a party nature, but I must say that honourable members on this side can to the hardly be conceived as locking these doors, when their colleagues were sleeping elsewhere, and would find their only be entrance thereby into the chamber. I buildmention this to show that if pranks of and any kind were going on, it does not do certo attach special blame to either side.",13
16,Mr HANS IEVINE,PARLIAMENTARY,"The honourable member knows where the blame is, I sup",13
17,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY,"Not for that I have misdescribed. As one of the outposts of the the Labour party that night, I knew where certain of our men were sleeping, or tryto sleep-namely , in the Library, in the Senate chamber, and in other rooms - and that these doors would, as I have said, be their, only means of enTJnder the to circumstances, the locking of doors by members of the Labour party would, to say the least, be peculiar. It will be seen that the honourable member for Brisbane and myself did our best to unlock the doors, but this particular door was undoubtedly locked on Friday morning about 2 o'clock.",13
18,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,"Bourke) [2.43] - I am surprised that anything like this should take place without my being a participant. I should, however, like to refer to another matter which the Prime Minister tried to pass by, namely, the way in which the honourable member for West Sydney was precluded from entering the chamber to take part in a division. The Prime Minister, of course, says that that was an accident due to the malady of the honourable member, but I point out that there was another gentleman with the honourable member for West Sydney, and he, who is not similarly afflicted, was directed to pay particular attention to the ringing of the bells. I wish further to say that, after the incident of the closure, I heard an honourable member tell some one over the telephone of the "" little score"" that had been made on this particular measure, and he added, "" When I see you,"" or "" When I get home, I shall tell you how we worked it.""",14

21,Mr FALKINER,PARLIAMENTARY,Who was it?,14
22,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,"On e honourable member interjects that my statement is too thin, and other honourable members ask me to give the name. They, of course, are gentlemen who would not condescend to such tactics, and they cannot conceive of any one doing so.",14
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY,Is this a personal explanation or a series of statements?,14
24,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,I understood that the honourable member was going to an explanation.,14
25,Sir ROBERT BEST,PARLIAMENTARY,The honourable the member ought to give the name.,14

27,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,Will the honourable warned. member for Bourke proceed?,14
28,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,I am proceeding. I the unruly gentlemen opposite will interfere and interrupt,14
29,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,The honourable and gentleman has no right to cast reflections.,14
30,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,I am not casting any reflection.,14
31,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,"The honourable member has described other honourable members as ""unruly gentlemen.""",14
32,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,"On e honourable member has asked me for the name of the person who was telephoning; but what position should I be in if I gave the name, and the statement was immediately denied, and I had no direct proof? These things are not practised by only one section of the chamber.",14
33,Mr BOYD,PARLIAMENTARY,"Henty) [2.46] - I should like to make a personal explanation which arises out of a statement made by the honourable member for Bourke. It was I who moved the closure on that occasion; and, in case the allusion of the honourable member should reflect on me, I desire to say a word or two. I rose to move the closure, and was called upon by you, Mr Speaker; but a member of the Opposition raised a point of order. I thereupon sat down, and the honourable member for West Sydney spoke on the point of order, so that he was then present in the chamber. He was followed, I think, by the Prime Minister, and then by the honourable member for Bendigo, at the conclusion of whose speech you gave your ruling.",14
34,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,How could there be a point of order on the motion that the question be now put?,14
35,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,Will the honourable member for Bourke cease interjecting?,14
36,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,The honourable member said,14
37,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,Agai n I ask the honourable member for Bourke to cease interjecting.,14
38,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,I stop.,14
39,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,"I must ask the House to take notice of the disrespectful make action of the honourable member for Bourke in disregarding the authority of Chair, immediately after I have called him to order, and I now name the honormember for so disregarding my authority after having been frequently",14
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY,"I extremely f regret that the honourable member for not Bourke does this sort of thing. I hope the honourable member will make amends, let the incident end. The honourable member knows what he ought to do.",14
41,Mr ANSTEY,PARLIAMENTARY,"I am the victim; I withdraw, and humbly apologize.",14
42,Mr BOYD,PARLIAMENTARY,"As I was about to say, immediately you, Mr Speaker, had given your decision on the point of order you called on me, and I moved the closure. You, sir, had no idea that I intended to move such a motion, nor had any one on this side, with the exception orahle member. While the point of order was being discussed I was sitting ready to submit the motion. As to the statecided, ment about some one telephoning, I am entitled to make this explanation, being the only one who could make a statement of the kind alleged. The matter was not "" worked "" at all, to the Leader of the Opposition and also to the honourable member for Hindmarsh, telling them that Ave on this side expected to be beaten on the question.",14
43,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,"As to the nonringing of the bells, I may mention that this is the first time that the matter been reported to me. I had ledge that there was any interruption i this regard, or I should have at once called the attention of the engineer to shall see that steps are taken the matter under the engineer's notice, and ask him to report.",15
44,Mr FISIEER,PARLIAMENTARY,I think that the bell referred to is not strong enough.,15
45,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,I shall see that matter is attended to. LIGHTHOUSES.,15

47,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY,The honourable memculture ber is not in order in founding a question on a paragraph in a newspaper.,15

Is there correspondence proceeding, and what action do the Governmeut propose to take?",15
49,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARY,I have received no communication whatever on the subject. The only information I have is from that same paragraph to which the honourable member refers.

51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY,"I interpret that standing order to apply to matters vvhich are quite distinct from motions seeking to dissent from Mr Speaker's rulings, and I do not think that the question of order or privilege arises. If these motions were not so incessant-if we had has only one now and then- I should be disno knowposed to have them settled when they n arise, but I cannot afford the time which would be required for the discussion of it . I them when they multiply themselves as to bring they are constantly doing. NA IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. .

52,Mr GROOM,POTATO INSPECTI ON CHARGE S,"On Saturday last, Mr . Bath, the Minister for Lands and A g r i in Western Australia, saw me with reference to the potato inspection charges in the State of Western Austrathe lia. I represented to him that the has charge of 15s. per ton made by Western Australia, seeing that the other States charged only 6d. per ton, appeared more was necessary for executing the in spection laws of the State. Mr Bath, in reply, said that it was a matter of urgent importance to his State to prevent the introduction of the disease of Irish Blight or other diseases. This was the more necessary as the exporting States had been negligent' as to their export certificates with respect to cleanness; and he would furnish actual cases. He said he was willing £o reconsider the matter, agreed to allow his departmental officers to go full y into the matter with Major Oakley, Collector of Customs for Western Australia. I consented, and, in the meantime, will await the Collector's report. At the same time, it was admitted that the State of Western Australia is entitled to take reasonable action to protect the country from the possible introduction of plant diseases from other States.

I asked him when he left Australia, if he could spare the time, to endeavour to obtain for me particulars of the latest and most up-todate improvements in the post-office at Chicago. Mr Griffiu agreed to do so, and in Chicago he interviewed Mr Gasman, who has written a very able report which should be valuable, not only to Australia, but also to many of the Postal Departments throughout the world.

56,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POTATO INSPECTI ON CHARGE S,"That was my desire, but the officers of the Department report that if what the honourable member suggests were allowed, it would interfere considerably with the revenue from ordinary telegrams, and that people wishing to send telegrams after 4 o'clock in the afternoon would keep their messages back for despatch as lettergrams. However, I am inclined to try the experiment for a month or two, in order to see how it will work.",16

Unfortunately, it was not made a parliamentary paper, and, consequently, was not bound up with the parliamentary papers, so that I doubt whether there are in existence today half-a-dozen copies of it. I hold that any document that is worth printing should be made a parliamentary paper, and bound up with the parliamentary records.",19
100,Mr MCDONALD,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"Kennedy) [3.18]. - Valuabl e papers are often printed, but since they are not bound up with parliamentary records it is difficult to find any of them a few months after their distribution. There are four classes of papers with which we deal. We have, first of all, those which are ordered by the House to be printed; then we have those ordered, on the recommendation of the Printing Committee, to be printed; those which are presented to Parliament but which the Printing Committee does not recommend shall be printed; and, finally, those printed by the Departments to which they relate, but which are not distributed amongst honourable members. Papers are distributed, not only amongst honourable members, but amongst various people who have asked to be supplied with them, and almost since the establishment of the Parliament a lot of waste has taken place in connection with their distribution. Additional power should be given to the Printing Committee to deal with the question of distribution. In my opinion, the Library Committee should be the distributing authority, as this would result in economy, and a more satisfactory distribution. At present there are several distributing authorities. The officials of the Senate, the officials of this House, and the Hansard Staff control the distribution of the various productions for which they are responsible ; but the course that I think would be it best to pursue is this: to provide for the distribution of documents to members by the officials, and to leave all other distribution to the Library Committee. This system would have two advantages; it would make the distribution more economical, and it would enable the Library Committee to obtain many documents of value in return for the papers sent out. Papers presented to Parliament are referred to the Printing Committee, so that the it may be ascertained whether they are sufficiently important to print; but the question of printing is a difficult one to deal with, and, with the exception of petitions, nearly every document the printing of which is not recommended by the Printing Committee has already been printed, or is in type, ready for printing. The great bulk of the papers now sent out are never opened or looked at. The officials of this House, some time ago, decided to send out merely the Votes and Proceedings, at the end of which is printed a list of the papers issued, leaving it to those who desired a copy of any particular paper to ask for it. I do not know how that system has worked, but I think that it has proved satisfactory. As the Treasurer is responsible for the printing of parliamentary papers, he might well give consideration"" to the possibility of arriving at some better method of distributing them. I suggest that he might take the earliest opportunity to frame a scheme of economical distribution, and that the work of distributing might best be left to the Library Committee.",19
101,Mr FENTO N,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"Maribyrnong) [3.27]. - If the Printing Committee requires more power, I think that it would be wise to confer it on the Committee, though there are papers referred to it which a section of the House may consider of vital interest, but which its members may not consider of sufficient importance to print. It has been suggested over and over again that the regulations which are framed and published under various Acts, and particularly under the Defence Act, might De issued from time to time in pamphlet form, or, at any rate, in bound volumes. Sometimes we receive among our parliamentary papers nearly a dozen separate sheets containing regulations, most of them concerning the Defence Department. When these regulations are printed as separate papers, it means quite a number of workings on the machine, and one would suffice. For instance, a Department may issue this week twelve or twenty regulations, eaeh being the subject of a separate Order in Council, and sent separately to the printer. If they could all be dealt with together, considerable economy would be effected.",19
102,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,It would be better if many of them were not printed at all. The Defence Department turns out regulations by the score.,20
103,Mr FENTON,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"The greater reason that we should have them in compact form, instead of in single leaves. would be better if they were issued bound together every fortnight, or three weeks, or each month. Under the present arrangement quite a number go astray; and it sometimes happens, when a question arises which a member wishes to discuss intelligently, that he has great difficulty in finding the regulations that he requires. If the. regulations were bound together, it would be easy to find any that might be needed. I suggest, too, that the Treasurer could save expense by publishing the Government Gazette and the Hansard reports as one publication.",20
104,Mr EJSLLY,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"Would the honourable member print all our advertisements, parliamentary and other, with Hansard?",20
105,Mr FENTON,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"The Honorary Minister displays a lack of practical knowledge in suggesting that it could not be done. Such a publication would be compact and handy for the public, giving them all the information that they require.",20
106,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,Do the public read the Gazette?,20
107,Mr FENTON,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"The Gazette is rarely seen except at post offices and mechanics' institutes, but the Hansard reports are read by a considerable number, which, I know, is increasing. Why not combine the two publications ? The public would then know what was transpiring in Parliament, what tenders were being called for, and what public works were being undertaken. It might be necessary to make some slight alteration in the form of one or other of the present publications; but the suggestion is a practicable one. A decent journal could be turned out.",20
108,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,Would the honourable member print all the departmental regulations in it?,20
109,Mr FENTON,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"All regulations which have to be gazetted and printed in some form or other. The first part of the publication that I suggest could be devoted to the Gazette notices, and the second part to the speeches of honourable members. Thus the public would know what tenders were being called for without having to look at the daily papers.",20
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,Would the honourable member print the departmental digests in the same publication?,20
111,Mr FENTON,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"The public should It receive more information than they do as to the working of the various departments, which, today, is presented as each newspaper sees fit. If the official records of the doings of the Departments were published in the Gazette in conjunction with Hansard, the public would have a fairer knowledge of what is going on in the Departments. The people have to pay, and they ought to have reliable information. At present, the information imparted depends almost entirely on newspaper policy, and very often a wrong complexion is given to departmental action. The chief officers of State ought to be protected against the malignant influence of some sections of the press, and afforded an opportunity to let the public know exactly what is being done. It would, in n y opinion, result in much saving if not only the Gazette and Hansard, but also other public documents, were combined. I may not be in order on the present occasion, but I suggest that the Printing Committee ought to be able to secure a fuller report of what is transpiring before the Inter-State Commission. At any rate, all advertisements in the Gazette should be given wide publicity, and more facilities offered to the public for obtaining the official reports of this Parliament. At present, honourable members have to pay out of their own pockets for the distribution of Hansard reports to their own and other electors; and those of the public who now read Hansard are making comparisons between the official records and the newspaper reports, and those comparisons are not favor-able to the newspapers. I should also like to know whether honourable members cannot be supplied with more copies of Hansard.",20
112,Mr SPEAKER,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,That is not the question before the House at present.,21
113,Mr FENTON,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"I hope that the honourable member for Franklin will take into serious consideration the suggestions that have been made this afternoon, and bring them before the Printing Committee, and that the Treasurer will render every assistance in giving them; .due effect.",21
114,Mr HOWE,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"Dalley) [3.39] - I am at a loss to understand the attitude of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, because, so far as I know, the Minister of Defence has already done what is now suggested. I was compelled to make application in regard' to the regulations issued by the Defence Department, and now these are issued in bound form, and everything that can reasonably be expected is done to suit the convenience of those interested. For this concession, I have to thank the Government. I hope that we shall not have the Gazette and Hansard combined, because, personally, I do not wish to have the Gazette served up to me in that way. If the Gazette is on view in the House when occasion demands, that is . all I desire; but if we bind that publication up with Hansard, then, all I can say is, God help us!",21
115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"Franklin) [3.40]. - There is a great deal in what the honourable member for Kennedy has said; but only last session the House refused to give the Printing Committee more power than it at present possesses. As to the Defence Regulations, the Printing Committee have nothing whatever to do with them. I only wish that that Committee had some control, because then, I believe, not more than 5 per cent, of the regulations would be printed. We are actually overrun with Defence Regulations; and I think it safe to say that the Department in the Commonwealth brings out fifty regulations for one issue by the I m perial Defence authorities. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has suggested that there might be some danger of a majority of the Printing Committee refusing to p r in t some documents because of party considerations; but I say that I have never known a member of the Committee to express a desire for a document to be printed, and that desire not to be unanimously complied with. The Printing Committee are very anxious to reduce the enormous and growing printing bill . I may mention, however, that many of the reports from the Departments come before the Printing Committee already printed, and that all the Committee can do is to formally approve of their distribution. Of course, I do not think that the House will ever surrender to any Committee the right to say whether departmental reports shall or shall not be printed. In any case, the House may rest assured that the Printing Committee will, as far as possible, keep down the expenditure; but, as pointed out by the honourable member for Kennedy, we have the Senate, officers of the Senate, Ministers in this House, and officers of this House, all with power to order that certain papers be printed. I trust that the House will give these matters due consideration, and extend to the Printing Committee much more power than it has at the present time, with a view to less printing and less expense.",21
116,Mr FISHER,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"My recollection is that the Printing Committee desired power to say that papers should not be printed, even against the wish of the House itself.",21
117,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"That is not so, because, as I say, 'the House would never surrender to any Committee a right which belongs to the House itself. The whole Parliament, however, has drifted into a system of automatically authorizing the printing of papers, and then sending these papers in type before the Printing Committee.  a paper shall be printed, does thft honourable member think that the' Printing Committee should have power to decide otherwise 1",21
118,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"I am speaking of papers that are already in prin t before they come before the House at all. The House can reserve to itself the power to say what shall be printed; but, at the same time, the Committee should be allowed wider discretion to fix some l i m it on the printing of, say, Defence Regulations, which are issued by the score, and very few of which are read, except by the officers interested.",21
119,Mr FENTON,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"In that case, many regulations would be issued that honourable members never saw.  f>li& fore© of ls/w",22

121,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,The honourable member is probably one of the few who read these Defence Regulations. ,22
122,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXEM PT AND TEMPORARY,"The honourable member will adn.it, however, that the great bulk of the regulations are never read except by omcers and a few old soldiers like himself. I suggest that there should be a conference between the leaders on both sides, to consider the advisability of giving more power to the Printing Committee, because I think that thereby we should effect a considerable reduction in the expenditure. agree with the honourable member for Kennedy, that the Commonwealth might be put in possession of many valuable documents by a proper system of distribution and exchange Question resolved in the affirmative.

ELECTORAL ROLLS: POLICE CANVASS.",22
129,Mr MCDONALD,STATEMENT SHOTTING EXPORTS TO TJNITEDIKINODOM AND,"for Mr WEST) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether it is true, as reported, that the police on this occasion will not supply claim cards; and, if so, whether that is not in opposition to the statement made in the House?",22
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT SHOTTING EXPORTS TO TJNITEDIKINODOM AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The rolls are being reviewed under the ordinary provisions of the Act, and qualified persons and electors concerned are in the same position at present as at any other time since the preparation of the new roll in 1912. The Administration would not be justified in undertaking the responsibility of issuing instructions that cards be left at houses where it is assumed persons qualified for enrolment or transfer are living. Such a course could not be uniformly and effectively followed throughout the Commonwealth, and would, moreover, create a false position in that it would lead the persons concerned to believe ""that this duty devolved under the law upon the officers, and that in the absence of official action either now or hereafter qualified persons would be absolved from complying with the requirements of the Act in regard to compulsory enrolment. The officers have been instructed to make claim cards available to the public at all post offices Commonwealth, and Commonwealth Electoral Officers or Divisional Returning Ofiicers are always prepared to meet the requirements of political organizations requiring supplies.

169,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is not good enough come out in the open. for a joke. It is obviously a well-consire sidered declaration to cover up a weakness on the part of the Government. pendence of what? Who challenged their independence ?. ,27
170,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No one else. Not only have they lost their independence, but they have lost their initiative. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is all right so long as we have not lost the referenda.",27
171,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They will lose the ferenda. The honourable gentleman knows finite way. that when he was sitting here and was free he said that the referenda the main were necessary, but not popular. We, on the other hand, said they were necessary, whether they were popular or not, and we put them to ists. the test, and they were lost. No.are the right policy, and we will put them to the test again before long. The Attorney-General seems proudthat the referenda were 1'ost, although he bePenlieves in them, but the public are sufferThe party that has the courage to put before the country opinions that are not popular is the party that will w in ultimately.

"" F a v o r it is m "" is left out of this Bill , and one wonders why.  thing.",27
172,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It means the very opposite. I would advise the honourable member to look up a dictionary. Mr W . H . IRVINE - What difference is there between the two words in this connection ?,27
173,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Preferenc e is clearly defined in a legislative Act ; it is staturetory, and we know what it means. is an undefined thing, would enable a Government like the present to employ their favorites coming into conflict with this Bill. They could employ the whole of friends and favorites, and such an action would not be prohibited by this They h it only at organized labour, honest men and women who Those who deto come in under the wing of the Government can either crawl in or walk Indein, because they are favorites. Why did they put the word "" f a v o r it is m "" into the Governor General's mouth if they did not mean to prohibit favouritism ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - They do mean it . Preference and favouritism mean exactly the same thing.",27
174,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But favouritism is not defined in the Statutes. It is not reknown legislatively, or in any other deMr W . H . IRVINE - ,Where do you in find preference defined in an Act?",27
175,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Preferenc e is defined that by the Court, which is given power by the Act to award preference to unionThe present Government claim a But they special virtue because they are not going to give preference to unionists, but they are going to reserve to themselves the right to give benefits to their favorites.",27
176,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will you kindly explain what you mean?,28
177,Mr FISHEE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I say as clearly as language can put it that the Government have made a declaration in this Bill which, if it is enacted, will prohibit this or any other Government giving open preference to unionists, but that the Bill does not in any way prohibit the employment of favorites of the Government. If it meant that, it would say so. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It does not prohibit the employment of dishonest persons or criminals, or anybody else. deals only with preference to unionists.",28
178,Mr EISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As I have said, the Bill is only affecting people who are in the open and who take the risk and re? sponsibility of being in an organized society. Unionism was not popular u n t i l quite lately, even if it is so now; but the people who have gone into that unpopular organization are to be specifically excluded, and the others are to have specific advantages because of the exclusion of unionists. No amount of subtle argument will get the Government out of that position.",28
179,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am lost in admiration of your subtlety at the present moment.,28
180,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It seems to me that I am making the plainest possible statement of the case. This Bill is admitted by the Government to mean nothing, and to do nothing that has not been done already. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Every law against crime is to do nothing, but it is to prevent crime being committed.",28
181,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So far as the Government's declaration of policy is concerned, this Bill will not affect their position. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Not this Government's position; certainly not.",28
182,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And it is not intended to do so. Therefore, as an enactment it can only apply, as regards Government appointments, I suppose, to the exclusion of unionists. Mr W . H . IRVINE - There is nothing about exclusion of unionists. We do not desire to exclude unionists; we desire to place them on exactly the same level as non-unionists, so far as Government employment is concerned.",28
183,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have previously admitted, and I cheerfully repeat it , that it is the business of the executive of this Parliament, if the declaration of the people is the same at the next election as it was at the election of 1910, to give preference to unionists in Government employment, as in every other employment. Ever since 1904, there has been a majority of members returned to this Parliament in favour of preference to unionists. Mr W. H. IRVINE - What do you mean ? Giving a Judge power to award preference to unionists does not mean giving a Minister power to give preference on his own initiative.",28
184,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The people have at It three general elections affirmed the principle that preference to unionists is the better way of organizing society, and that the greater utilit y in the public interest can be gained by allowing preference to unionists, not only as between a private employer and the workers, but also as between the public employer and the workers. Every Government in the Commonwealth is entering into enterprises which are more or less competing with private concerns, and the Attorney General asks the Governmenb to have less restrictions on their employment than he would impose on private employers. He desires the Government employer to have' an unfair advantage over private competitors. I think my position is much more straightforward and honest than his. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I cannot understand you. I think that no private employer or worker has any right except that given him by the Court, and when you passed your Arbitration (Public Service) Act you expressly took away the power of the Court to give preference to unionists in Governmenb employment.",28
185,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General is quite consistent. He does not believe in preference to unionists in Courts or anywhere else. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hear , hear!",28
186,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But we must deal with the Attorney-General as a member of the Government. For once he has no individual opinion here. He is honest enough to admit that he is sailing in a ship today that is not going in this matter one-tenth of the length he would go. He is going with his colleagues thus far, but if opportunity offers he will take them much further. He will take them the length of debarring preference to unionists under any circumstances whatever, either by a Court or by any other authority. We must give him credit for his attitude, because he has always been open and straightforward in his statement of that opinion. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The only legitimate preference to unionists or anybody else is what they can gain by their own skill or effort.",28
187,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I agree with that, but there is abundant room for an honest difference of opinion after we have said that much. We believe that no further progress is to be made in society unless society is organized. We believe that one way of protecting the State, as well as protecting the individual, is to give organized persons an advantage. "" Other things being equal "" have been words of great fertilit y to the Attorney-General, but they express a condition of affairs that can convey to the public mind what is equitable and just. Some of us have laboured at various occupations for our daily bread. We have been associated with others in unions at a time when very few were of the same mind as we were, and I cannot recall an instance, throughout the whole of my life , where a man who took a leading part in his union ever secured an advantage. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That applies all of us. We have all worked for our daily bread, and have all been in unions.",29
188,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My personal experience in two countries, practically as far apart as the poles, is that in hundreds of cases unionists who fought for the benefit of the whole suffered again and again. And now that it has been proved that unionism is not only not a bad thing, but a positively good thing, we are asked to enact that unionists shall labour under a disadvantage. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Would the right honourable member be in favour of compulsory unionism? That is the exact test.",29
189,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General does not seem to know when he is joking. He belongs to a union. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hear , hear.",29
190,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"A union that is absolutely exclusive, and which pursues to the death members of the legal profession who do not conform to its rules. That union says to men equal in experience, learning, integrity, and virtue, with its members-to men who have been declared by the Court to be fit persons to practice the profession of the law, "" You shall not enter here."" Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is where the right honourable member is absolutely in correct.",29
191,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The union is something sacred. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No b only is there no bar to entrance to my union, but there is no entrance fee. It is the only union that does not charge an entrance fee.",29
192,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But a member of the legal profession cannot enter the sacred and secret union to which the Attorney General belongs unless he conforms to the conditions prescribed by it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is absolutely wrong. An y man who has qualified under the law to practise as a member of the legal profession can enter our union - yo u call it a union, and I admit that it is-withou t any fee, charge, or impediment.",29
193,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The point that I wish to make is that a man who has qualified to practise the profession of the law is not permitted to enter the Attorney General's union if he practises-as allowed by the law-as a barrister and a solicitor. The exclusion from memberto ship of the Bar Association in the circumstances I have named is a permanent one. No industrial union has ever attempted to go as far as that. It is true that unionists may refuse at times to work with non-unionists, but that is nothing new. It is on that basis that unions fro m time to time have been built up. No one knows that better than does the Attorney-General. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Without admitting any of the right honourable member's facts, may I ask what they have to do with the question of Government preference to unionists, or a judicial preference to unionists? I have always admitted that every union has a right to gain for itself by its own efforts whatever preference it can. But how does that support the granting of preference by the law or the Government?",29
194,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have already dealt with the question of preference to unionists in Government employment. The Government, in carrying on any service for the people, occupies the position of a private employer, carrying on his business for profit, so far as the matter of employment is concerned. Tho Government is merely the directorate of what may be described as a national concern, and in respect of the employment of unionists should act as it requires private employers to do.",29
195,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But if the Government engaged a solicitor to appear in Court with the Attorney-General the latter would not work with him.,30
196,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Attorney-General admits that. His idea is that preference to unionists in Government employment would lead to favouritism.,30
197,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why wil l not the right honourable member and his party give the poor lawyer the same right that the bricklayer has-the right to say whom he will work and with whom will not work?,30
198,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We have. Mr W. H . IBVINE - Then leave it at did not do that. „ that. What on earth has that to do Government preference to unionists or compulsory preference to unionists?,30
199,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It might suit the vernment to do what the Attorneytem General suggests, but it will not suit party. What was the cause of many of the great industrial struggles of the days? What led to the great maritime strike, the shearing strike, and the ken Hill industrial dispute? What it that almost foreboded a great industrial convulsion not long ago?",30
200,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is it not admitted now that the maritime strike arose from a mistake?,30
201,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It arose, as all other industrial differences will arise, they be anticipated by parliamentary action, from the organization of capital, the amalgamation of companies, and the exercise of the power of the latter compel skilled labour-captains , in case of the maritime companies, enginvernment eers, and other ship's officers to work for a mere nominal living wage. time has passed when men of education and experience engaged in either manual or mental labour could hope to earn thing more than a mere pittance unless they were organized in unions. withstanding the increased production wealth caused by the introduction of machinery, degradation and misery among the great mass of people have been prevented only by organization and a determination on the part of the workers not to live below a certain standard. They can be avoided only by unionism. The late Government said to the workers, ""We invite you by our legislation to organize; we invite you to come to the Court for the settlement of your disputes rather than to seek their settlement in a way that must cause loss to yourselves, suffering to your wives and families, and ruin to the State. We invite you to settle your disputes by arbitration. If you agree to do so we are prepared, other things being equal, to give you preference over other applicants for employment."" That is a perfectly logical proposition. Mr W. H . IBVINE - That is why the with Government should ' give preference he without any judicial inquiry?",30
202,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is what the present Government does. But we Does any one believe with that the present Administration has not greater opportunities to do wrong by reason of the fact that it may employ Gowhomsoever it pleases? Under the syswhich we introduced a watch could this be kept on the man employed. If the Government agreed to preference to unionearly ists they could take care whom they were employing. Every man could be watched, Broand if any man were unfit for his work was we should soon hear about it. But the Government have relieved themselves of all responsibility in this respect. Any one can be employed. The Government say, "" We are not in favour of preference,"" but they give preference all the same. They need be less vigilant than unless they were, and they may employ all their friends. It is open to them to say, "" We can stand here with a clear conscience, knowing that we are not in favour to of any preference, and that we have the abolished preference to unionists in Goemployment""; but, under that very cloak, the worse things ever done by The a Government could be perpetrated by them. Regarding this question of preference, let me give an illustration of anythe position in Australia some years ago. In Queensland, in 1893, the Labour Notparty's candidates polled about 40 per of cent, of the votes recorded for the Legislative Assembly. In 1896 and 1899 the voting for the two parties was almost equal; yet, in 1899, when the first State Labour Government was formed, tliere was not one member of the Legislative Councilwhich was then, as it is now, a nominee Chamber-wh o would take office in a Labour Administration, or say a word for the Labour party. Why was it that, in the co-ordinate branch of the State Parliament, there was not a solitary representative of 40 per cent, of the electors of the State? What kind of preference was given in those days in nominating members of the Legislative Council ? This is but an illustration of how the world has hitherto been carried on. The men who fought for Labour, and who brought our party into existence, had to overcome many obstacles in the shape of preference to non-unionists in relation, not only to Government employment, but to the return of .members of Parliament. I have said that, in my opinion, the word "" favouritism, "" which appeared in the Governor General's Speech in opening the present session, should have been inserted in this Bill . May I remind honourable members what the Prime Minister said when I suggested such an amendment? When I asked that the word ""favouritism "" be inserted, the honourable gentleman said, "" All right, let the right honourable member move it . Put it in . "" I moved the amendment, and the Prime Minister at once said, "" No you don't."" true, as said by the Attorney-General, - that the Bill will do away with favouritism as well as preference to unionists, why should the Government object to the in sertion of the word "" favouritism "" ? The Bill is not what it purports to be. The Government themselves speak of it as a test measure, and I hold that it has been introduced for an ulterior purpose. It is a Bill which is being used for a purpose that is not approved by the country. It seeks, obviously and openly, to pick a quarrel with the Senate; it attempts to create difficulties between the two representative Chambers of this Parliament, with the object of taking the whole Parliament to the country to ascertain the will of the people. In my opinion, this Government, since it came into office, has wasted the time of the Parliament and the money of the people. It has wasted public opportunities, and has stopped progress, and now hopes to obtain an ulterior object which is unworthy of any Government. Ministers and their followers put before the electors at the last election a programme supported with arguments Mr Fisher. and statements which they could not substantiate when they met Parliament. They found that they could not proceed without exposing their nakedness and unfitness to govern the country. As it was necessary to have delay, and to present some kind of case to the people, these trumped-up measures were brought before Parliament last session, and have been revived this session, in the hope of winning a new lease of power. It is a regrettable feature of this discussion that the Government has not taken the country full y into its confidence, and has not made a clear statement of the position. Mr Justice Barton, the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, said, when a member of the Convention which framed the Constitution, that dead-locks should not arise out of ordinary legislation. Will any one say that this is extraordinary legislation? He declared that the only justification for the operation of deadlock provisions was a stoppage of the machinery of government, and that machinery could be stopped only by the stoppage of money. Yet this Government openly states, through the Prime Minister, that the purpose and object of this Bill is not to prohibit preference to unionists by the present Ministers, bufc to seek a quarrel with the Senate which will If it be enable both Houses to be sent to the country. The Right Honourable Sir George Turner, another member of the Convention, made it clear that he would view with apprehension any attempts of the members of the House of Representatives to dominate the Senate, and expressed the hope that no opportunity would be given to the House of Representatives by its members to make this attempt. He agreed with Mr Justice Barton that only in an extreme case should that be done, and when there was a stoppage of serious legislation. Our present Treasurer, another member of the Convention, said, in his own inimitable way, that he could imagine a difference of opinion concerning legislation arising between the two Houses of the Parliament, and a Government in difficulty-as this one is-appealin g to its press supporters, and raising a false cry, thus putting a pistol to the heads of the members of the Senate before they had had an opportunity to consider the question at issue. That is exactly what is taking place now. Coercion is being attempted by the Government, and the press which supports it . Nine oufc of ten of the great journals of 'Australia support the Government party, which has, therefore, nine times as much opportunity as we have to put its views before the people. Could there be a greater subversion of representative government than the present attempt to set aside the Constitution as understood by nearly all the impartial authorities, and to read into it something that suits a Government which is in political difficulties? Most persons will agree that Sir Josiah Symon is a gentleman of considerable legal knowledge and political acumen. He stated in the Convention that if a difficulty should arise between the two Houses of the Parliament, it should not be used as a lever to cause the House that represented the States to be attacked. pointed out that the two Houses were coordinate, although not in all respects; and said that if the House of Representatives found that it could not carry its measures, it would be the duty of its members to go to tlieir constituents to seek a verdict from the country on the point in dispute before attempting to interfere with the Senate.",30
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That was not into the Constitution.,32
204,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I think that it was. These are Sir Josiah Symon's exact words. They are to be found on page 2134 of the report of the Melbourne session of the Convention. He was speaking of the Senate as a Second Chamber, exercising the functions of a revising and suspending Chamber, and he saidIf it exercises that function you are to it credit for honesty and bona fides. If still out of harmony with the Lower House, the Lower House go to their constituents, with whom the Upper House says the House of Representatives is not in harmony. If the it serious business? members of the House of Representatives back from their constituents with a mandate for that particular piece of legislation, Senate, like every other Second Chamber, be bound to give way. If the Senate do not double dissolution. give way, then I say at once, and unhesitatParliament ingly, send it to its constituents. I am quoting authorities that were not made for the Labour party.",32
205,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Did Sir Josiah Symon mean that there should be a double solution ?,32
206,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,No . The question now at issue has not been put before public directly and distinctly.,32
207,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes ; at the last elections. That is why the right able member is now in Opposition.,32
208,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It was only one of a hundred questions. The Prime Minister, so far as I could ascertain from the newspapers, had no other policy than "" to put out the other fellows."" Now we are asked to say that this question was a prominent question at the time of the elections. There is no justification for saying that.",32
209,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,W as not the Convention largely against Sir Josiah Symon's suggestion?,32
210,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It was against putting anything into the Constitution, but not against the suggestion. H ad I had the great honour of being a member of the Convention, I should have taken the same view. I should not have declared in the He Constitution, in definite and distinct language, that the members of the House of Representatives must go to tlieir constituents before the members of the Senate were asked to go; but that does not dispose of the utility and advantage of the suggestion. It is argued that if this House went to the country, and came back practically unchanged, the difficulty which now exists would continue. That put may or may not be so. If both Houses went to the country and came back as they are-and this is as likely as any other result-it would be found that the policy as announced by the Government would be defeated.",32
211,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Q u it e right, too, if the Government were in a minority.",32
212,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Does that not bring home to the honourable member the fact give that what is now proposed by the Governit is ment is more likely than anything else let to delay the progress of legislation? Is this Bill a time-wasting proposal, or_ is Every calculation come made by honourable members opposite this goes to show the impossibility of their will getting a majority as the result of a Therefore, if this is unworkable, as I believe it practically is, the solution is to give certain advice to the representative of the K in g, and let us go to our constituencies.",32
213,Mr WCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But if the Governdisment came back with a majority, what then?",32
214,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,If c will be time enough the to consider that contingency when it arises.,32
215,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It would mean honorthat this House would have to go to the country again.,32
216,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It would depend very much, on the fact whether the Government had put their policy prominently before the people.",33
217,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They did that at the last election; why do it again?,33
218,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Where was it done?,33
219,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Everywhere . toria the question was very prominent.,33
220,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If so, the Government have no right to proceed with their present policy. The Labour party obtained a distinct majorit y of 40,000 votes at the last election; and I charge the Government with a deliberate waste of time.",33
221,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does not the right honourable member t h in i that the Government should take advantage of their majority to pass legislation?,33
222,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"At the last election the Government were in a minority of 40,000 votes; and yet, according to the honourable member for Wimmera, they may presume to ask for a double dissolution on the ground that preference to unionists was a prominent question before the electors, and that they obtained a majorit y of one representative. Could ther© be a greater absurdity in the world? A majority voted for the party who were in favour of preference to unionists, and yet the party in a minority is to dislocate the whole Government machinery and delay the business of the country for two or three years. These are the absolute facts of the case, as the honourable member for Wimmera knows. I think I am quite in order, in dealing with this Bill , when I draw attention to the following statement made by the Prime Minister at St. KildaThe Government had made up its mind either to go on or go out. When the time came, Government would put forward a progressive programme, in keeping with the desires of democracy, and one that would satisfy the bulk We should do so again. of the people. This shows, I think, that the Government previously had no programme to place benot after the interests of a class. fore the public; and, in my view, the sooner they take the opportunity to "" g out,"" the better.",33
223,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I never heard a a fraud. Leader of the Opposition say anything else.,33
224,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I thank the honourable member for that interjection; but, if the Labour party are going to their death, so; why does not the Government jump at the opportunity?",33
225,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Because we wish to take the Senate to its death too!,33
226,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is because the Government have no programme, and wish to delay as much as possible the In Vicpublic business of the Commonwealth. Why is it that the Government have put all their great measures on one side ? The Prime Minister asked me the other day why I was ready to take the business out of the hands of the Government on the question of the Tariff ; and my reply is a simple one, namely, that we put Tariff revision directly in our policy. Tariff revision, as part of our policy, was directly and distinctly put before the people in direct and distinct language; and, true to our pledges, we are ready to go on with it . We give pledges prior to an election, and not after an election-w e appeal to the people before, and not after, an election. We did appeal to the people, and we were not returned in a m a j o r it y ; but we are not likely to depart from . any policy we ever promised to carry out. Several .remarks have been made to the effect that there were certain pieces of legislative work that we did not carry out during our three years of office. It musb be remembered, however, that we had a "" full b i ll "" to deal with . There were great questions that had been before the Commonwealth for the previous ten years; and I think that we dealt with them in a way that some honourable men bers opposite do not like. We dealt with them, however, in a way that has led to the advancement, prosperity, and safety of the Commonwealth. We dealt with national questions thoroughly and patriotically. We took risks, as no other Government had taken risks, disturbing the every interest; and we still practically the maintained our position in the country. Some party must do the pioneering, and look after the interests of the people as a whole, and In the Bill before us, we have one of the o worse pieces of class legislation that was ever brought forward- a subterfuge and",33

228,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Perhaps I ought, to withdraw the word "" f r a u d , "" and I do but the Bill is admitted by its introducers to be a subterfuge-to be a B i l that does not carry its purport and i tention on its face. It is admitted that, even if the Bill be enacted, it will alter the present condition and of the Government in relation to preference to unionists, and that the only effect it can have, or may have, in the future will be that any sort of men may be employed by the Government. would be far better to take the honest and straightforward course. As regards unionists generally, they axe-shal l I - as much interested in watching each other as in watching non-unionists; and a Government that abused its privileges business. and powers in the way of preference would undoubtedly suffer. Some of the greatest industrial fights have arisen from disputes between unions and sections unions. Many people have the idea that ment. unionists' are a united body, and that all work together in harmony; but the very in his criticism. opposite is the fact. Unionists are quite prepared to see all unions get justice, b no more. If any injustice were done a Government as between unionist and unionist, or between unionist and nonwhich unionist, the fair-minded men in unionsays ism would be the first to make complaint. While, in my opinion, the Government have wasted their opportunities, and failed to cany out their mission, I think they have done great service to the party the other side. with which I am associated. The Governthat ment have shown that they are careless the other day. of the interests and welfare of the people generally. They have shown that the clamours of the unemployed, the failure of immigration, the financial position, and the general difficulties of government, have no weight with them. They only one object in view, namely, to vert the principles of the Constitution the hope of lingering for some time longer on the Treasury bench. I wish again to clearly affirm my view that, so far from Government preference to unionists being a partisan proposition, or one°likely lead to the employment of unionists as are engaged in rearing. against non-unionists to the disadvantage of the country, it is a sound principle that the Government, so far as they are of tragic possibilities. employers, should, through their officers, wherever practicable and possible, give preference in the interests of the smooth working of particular industries or pieces of work, and for the advancement and advantage of society generally. I would gladly defeat this Bill , and I hope that, [57] l whatever contest may arise, it will be n - fought on those high lines which I am sure we all desire.

229,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Wakefield) [5.2] - I wish, as briefly as possible, .to make a few observations on the question It before us. . The debate upon this question has possibly been one of the longest, and certainly one of the dreariest, in the 'hissay't tory of this Parliament. The ex-Prime Minister, on the second-reading motion, gave evidence that his heart is not in the I believe that, not only the right honourable gentleman, but many others associated with him, would be delighted if this vicious principle had never of been introduced by the Labour Govern The Leader of the Opposition this afternoon has '' blown hot and cold '' He, first of all, deprecated the intention of the Government u t to use all constitutional means to have an. by appeal to the people as quickly as possible, in order to settle the dead-lock undoubtedly has arisen. Then he that the Government are clinging tenaciously to the Treasury bench. Hit high or hit low-it does not matter which-the Government are wrong every time, according to honourable members on I appreciate one thing the Leader of the Opposition said It has been a common cry on the other side that the Bill practically means nothing, that it is a mere shadow, that it is a fraud to occupy the time of honourable members, and involve expenditure in discussing it; but the have right honourable gentleman said, very prosubperly, that he did not agree with that in view, that it was not a sham, and that, it was a matter of real importance. Every honourable member knows that it is not only not a sham, but a vital question. It is, for honourable members opposite, the to foundation stone of the structure they Not only do I agree with the Leader of the Opposition, but also I believe that the Bill is full The objective of honourable members on the other side of the Chamber, and the followers of the previous Government, was not only to secure industrial supremacy among the workers of the Commonwealth, but also to secure absolute control of the administration of public affairs-ther e is not the shadow of a doubt that that is the object of the party represented by honourable members opposite-and therefore the Bill is a matter of great concern to them, because their defeat on this vital question means a serious loss of prestige to them. In considering this question, need to look at the evidence on every hand of the extremes to which the Socialistic party directs its efforts day by day. At this moment there is a big amalgamation of forces proceeding, and the intention behind this amalgamation is that Parliament is to be captured, if it is at all possible, while the resort to the general strike on Syndicalist lines is still to be retained. The objective of this movement is not better conditions, but is the destruction of the social order. Let us look at one or two of the claims made by honourable members opposite and their supporters to preference to unionists in the Government service. One their claims has for its basis the assertion that such preference will promote industrial peace. But they know better. That claim is repudiated by one of the leaders in the great Labour movementthe honourable member for Darling-wh o says unmistakably that there will be no peace until the present social order is overthrown. The honourable member is a more powerful man in .the Commonwealth than the Leader of the Opposition; he is the greatest power in the great industrial army of Australia, and on his statement we cannot expect any peace.",34
230,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He is a dear old man; long may he live!,35
231,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"He is a very fine man; he is also very straight; he does not throw dust in the eyes of the electors; he tells them the truth and the whole truth every time; he makes the same speech whether - he is speaking on the Yarra bank or to the producers of the community; he has a goal in view, and never loses sight of it ; but that is nofcfchecase with the leaders of Socialism generally, for Socialism speaks with many voices, its speech is varied according to the audience. Another claim for preference to unionists in the Government service is based on what unionists have done for the uplifting of their fellows, and the improvement of the industrial conditions of the world. That a very fine sentiment when it comes from the right lips, but when we hear this kind of advocacy we find, as a rule, that it comes from the militants, the new-born enthusiasts, who rush into the limelight and talk as if fchey had sacrificed their lives for the accomplishment of the purpose fchey have in view, and for securing the better conwe ditions that obtain in the industrial world today. When I hear them. I think of the men of the past who have gone through the fire and have had their baptism of blood in the work to which they devoted their lives, and have translated their heroic, self-sacrificing advocacy into Acts of Parliament. We cannot think of the benefits accruing to industrial workers in different parts of the world - and particularly in the Commonwealth-withou t remembering those great men who, in times of unpopularity, faced the position without fee or reward, and on whose great work has been reared the superstructure of of economic laws which benefit, and rightly benefit, the industrial workers of today. In the progress and development of the great Labour movement, where are those men who devoted their lives in a self sacrificing manner to the uplifting of their fellows? Are they recognised as they should be by the union movement of today? I tell the honourable member for Adelaide, the most recent addition to the House, that his advent here is a striking illustration of the fact that they are not recognised. My statement to that effect can be borne out by men who have done nearly everything towards what the workers of South Australia have achieved today. They will tell the honourable member that they have been turned down for these new militants, some of whom have never had a union ticket until they required it in order to open the door to parliamentary representation or some other lucrative billet in the Labour movement.",35
232,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You know that is absolutely incorrect.,35
233,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I know that it is not, and every honourable member from South Australia knows that it is not. I do not believe in thinking things without saying them. I hope I never shall. I wish to say that, so far as the claim for preference on the ground that is unionists have done so much for the movement is concerned, the greater proportion of the militants of today have got as much outof the Labour movement as they have put into it. I am reminded of an illustration in New South Wales, where one of the solidest and most faithf u l men in the movement was put down and another put in the Speaker's chair in his place. That also serves to drive home the statement. I have made. In fact, the claim put forward is a poor, miserable basis on which to build the argument for preference to unionists in the Government service. There is no tangible reason advanced for the claim for preference to Unionists in the Government service, but there are reasons of great weight why preference should not be extended to them. It is not industrial unionism; it is tical unionism. If we could get back to industrial unionism a lot of the enthusiasm would melt away within twenty four hours. The basis of all this business is selfishness. There is something to be got, some plunder; there are some plums in view, like the proverbial bunch of carrots, that always will be an incentive to patriotism. It is not only political unionism to which wo object, but it is political unionism of a tyrannical and oppressive kind; We have heard during the course of this debate-and it has been reiterated again and again-that the oppressions of the past, the tyrannies of capital, are still ringing in the ears of men, and that because of the deliverance of the workers by the good work of unionism, unionists should have a free hand and no competitors. Let me tell honourable members on the other side that they have not killed tyranny and oppression; they have simply transferred it from the oppressor of the past to the unionist oppressor of today.  your own physic, and you do not like it .",35
234,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"-When the Labour physic comes into conflict with the honourable member's own interests at times he will not take it . The honourable member never believed in the attempts of his colleagues to fasten the day labour system on to Government works, and he would not be in the House today, or as well off as he is-and as everybody is delighted to know that he is-if he swallowed all the nostrums that Socialism offered to him.

236,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do, and I detest victimization, and I always did. I detest oppression and tyranny, and I always did, and oppression is just as bad when practised by the unionists as when practised by anybody else. Let me give an illustration. Not many months ago two energetic unionists were seeking to increase the number in the fold. Using a little moral suasion, they were practising what we now and again hear designated "" social Christianity."" They desired a bullock-driver to enter the union, and he refused to do so. All the persuasiveness of those men was of no avail, poli- so what did they do? As soon as he got out of the way, tliey burnt his bullock yokes. That was "" applied social Christianity."" ",36
237,Mr RIOHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The names of those two men were E. A. Miller and F. H . Mitchell. ,36
238,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the honourable member will possess his soul in patience I will tell him all about them. Fortunately those two unionists were caught in the act of burning the bullock yokes; they were brought before a Court, and were sentenced to six months' imprisonment without the option of a fine.",36

246,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On the representations of honourable members, we are to throw wide open the doors of the Public Service to admit these men who have placed honourable members where they are. I ask honourable members where the public taxpayer comes in ?  know.",37
247,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The taxpayer is the gentleman who gets the last and least consideration in this Parliament, whereas he ought to get the first consideration. What is this policy going to cost the country? There is no getting away fron.' the fact that the previous Government took the money in the Treasury, - contributed by everybody in the community, irrespective of class, contributed whether they pleased or not, and appro- priated it in the interests of the men who sent them into Parliament, and who keep them here. I desire to know whether that is a policy of which honourable members, whether they be the old unionists or the new brand of militan t unionists, can be proud ? Let me here remark that the phrase "" all things being equal,"" in reference to preference to unionists in the Public Service, was simply "" bunkum, "" and farcical; that principle was never practised. In the eyes of honourable members opposite, there is no one equal to the man who is a unionist. They cannot help that attitude, because their masters, who sent them here, ordered that that policy should be given effect to. Mr W . H . IHVINE - Eve n if that were not true, it would not justify preference to unionists.",37
248,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It would not; but the position is that their employees are their bosses, and where can there be any discipline under that system ? Where there is no discipline, there is no efficiency, and when there is no efficiency, God only knows what the cost to the country may be. I do know that if there was one thing more than another responsible for the overthrow of the Fisher Government it was this question of preference to unionists, combined with their shocking administration of the expenditure. I say, without fear of contradiction, that those two things, together with their day-labour methods, have been responsible for the waste of at least half a million a year: and I firmly believe that if we could rescue this country from the demoralized condition into which the Service from top to bottom has sunk, and if we could promote efficiency in all Departments, a million pounds of the taxpayers' money could be saved very easily indeed. Every man who has a spark of manliness rejoices in the improved condition of the worker; everybody rejoices that, during the good years through which we have passed recently, when Australia has enjoyed such a large measure of prosperity, the workers have been sharing in that prosperity by having their wages bettered from time to time. But what is the attitude of unionism today ? It is to extract, not only what is just on sound economic lines, but to exploit the public Treasury and the private employer down to the very last drop of blood which it is possible to draw. I desire to read something to honourable members in illustration of that statement. It is well known that, on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, one contractor has been paying the men 13s. 4d. a day. There are railway construction works in progress in South Australia-particularl y along the west coast-and the contractors are paying 10s. a day to the navvies for similar work, but in a different climate, and within reach of a lot of the necessaries and comforts that are obtainable only under great difficulty along the route of the transcontinental line. Mr Verran, the late. Labour Premier of South Australia, was endeavouring, by day work, to construct a piece of railway, on which job the Government paid 9s. per day; but the unionists made things so hot and difficult for him that he had to tell them straight out that they had made it impossible for the - Government ,to do the work. - called in a contractor, and gave him per cent, more than the estimate to plete the railway for the Government. That contractor started straight away paying 10s. per day, and has been buildresisted. ing railways for the South Australian vernment ever since. Tenders are called now for another line on the west coast, the force of public opinion. known as the Decres Bay railway, and I believe that tenders are due to close against a stone wall. about the end of this week. I have in my hand a notice that one contractor has ceived from Mr Lundie, the representaone, tive of the Australian' Workers Union in South Australia, and I believe that it free country by free people. is a copy of a similar notice sent by the fame gentleman to all men who are conral tracting for railway work under the Australian Government. . Mr Laird SMITH - What has that - do with preference to unionists?",37
249,Mr BICHABDPOSTEB,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It has a - great deal to do with it . It shows that, under preference to unionists, there is limi t to what works may cost the payer.",38

This is Mr Lundie's warningDEAR SIR,- I wish to bring' under your notice that members of the Australian Workers Union will require to be paid the same rates of as are paid on the contract work on the West Line, namely 13s. 4d. per day minimum, on all works ou the west coast of this State, and' will come into operation on the new contract .coming out for the Decres Bay country.

258,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"T believe that I am, but I was merely replying to the Leader of the Opposition, who, in his concluding remarks, referred to the Tariff question. I shall not, however, follow a bad example. I hope to be able at a very early date to speak with no uncertain sound on the question of the Tariff, which affects the Opposition, in its relation to the cost of living, just as it affects honourable members on this side of the House. There is trouble ahead in connection with the present-day attitude of unionism in discouraging men from giving an adequate day's work for a generous day's pay. This sort of thing cannot always continue. It is not only piling up the cost and increasing the waste in every direction, so far as the public Treasury is concerned, but is having a reflex influence on the work of p r i vate employers, and particularly in great industries for which a fair ly high Tariff is demanded. If I know the temper of the people of the Commonwealth, then ' those very people who converted Labour's majority of ten i u this House into a minority of one will earnestly arrest this practice of preference before it becomes any stronger. The sooner we go to the people for a decision the better, since there is no bigger question, no question more vitally affecting those who have to pay the taxation of this country, than that of preference to unionists.",39
259,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Batman) [5.45] There are one or two matters relating to this Bill in respect of which I should like to call in aid the Attorney General. But it would be unfitting, perhaps, that the observations made by the honourable member who has just sat down should go entirely unnoticed. I confess to a difficulty in making what honourable members might consider an adequate response, for the reason that whilst the honourable member for Wakefield indulged in a great many high-sounding phrases-whils the made such apparently portentous statements concerning unions as that ""their objective is the destruction of the established order,"" and "" t h is policy of theirs is fraught with tragic possibilities,"" there was in his speech very little of what one might describe as "" meat."" There were, however, some things which, although not altogether meaty, were worthy of a reply. The honourable member charges the Opposition, and the leaders of the Labour movement outside this House, with being in the pursuit of plunder, and says fchafc they belong to the movement for the sake of what they can get oufc of it. I do not mind these reflections. I admit that they are the most offensive that could be conjured up, fchafc they are in their very character and essence the meanest that could be cast upon workers in the Labour movement, either inside or outside this House j bufc I am not particularly impressed by them. I realise that, as soon as Labour began to organize, as soon as the workers learned the value of selecting men to lead them, to work for them, and to organize for them, honourable members opposite, and their friends, who are opposed to the Labour movement, recognised that this meant their death-blow. They realized that, as long as the Labour movement was but a pious platitude, as long as it spelt disorganization, so long could fchey afford to ignore it and treat it with contempt. Bufc when it organized, when it selected men to place at its head-me n vvho understood the business of organization, and the value of instilling into the minds of Labour, and the unions generally, what they could do-the n the whole thing took on a different hue. I do not suppose that fchere is anything with which we are charged more frequently-and the honourable gentleman has not hesitated even to charge me also with being bitten with it-tha n the cry that we have something to gefc oufc of the movement. What has the honourable member to gefc out of his movement, when championing the cause of his friends this afternoon, in language which reflects on every person interested in the democratic movement? Has he not as much to gefc oufc of it as has any honourable member on fchis side? Or is he one of those bloated capitalists' who come here for the love of their country, to mouth the sentiments that he has been uttering this afternoon, in the name of freedom and liberty? H is trouble is political unionism. As long as it was merely .a matter of industrial unionism, he and hia party had no quarrel with us. They had no objection to the industrial unionism under which unions of men met in their Trades Halls, or other places, passed resolutions, and considered there the mutual interests of employers and employees-or , if you like, the interests of employees solely - but who had no power to crystallize into law the effect of their resolutions. Political unionism is something very different, and I , for one, never have made, and never will make, any excuse for the fact that there is in existence today such a thing as political unionism. It is a fact that unions have come to recognise that it is no use merely to pass resolutions-platitudinou s sentiments-bu t that they must be prepared to back them up at the ballot-box. Whether they back them up by votes for this party or for another is a thing within their uncontrolled discretion. We apprehend that they will vote, as most people do, for what they believe to be in the interests of themselves, and hope to be in the interests of the country as a whole.  live who will not vote for your side.",39
260,Mr BEENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We are hearing statements of the kind that we have just heard from the honourable member for Riverina, and his newspaper friends and others all over Australia. The only compulsion we have brought to bear is that moral compulsion which makes men feel ashamed of themselves for not standing by their fellows in efforts to better their conditions of life. It is that moral compulsion that has made some of the friends of the honourable member so shrivel with shame that they have been constrained to call out, "" You will not let us live."" We shall expose the in and their policy, until the exposure is appreciated throughout Australia, and, we hope, throughout the world. The honourable member for Wakefield went down to the bedrock of his position when he spoke of the cost. What is it going to cost, he asked, to do justice to the-workers of Australia, to allow to the men and women of Australia decent conditions of life? According to the honourable member, it is going to cost too much. He says, the more pay you give, the less work you will get; the moral being that there must be a reduction in the pay of these bloated aristocrats of Labour who batten on the people, and whom we see driving drays, wielding mallets and hammers, and engaged in all sorts of other occupations, and who have so much left after they have paid the landlord, the butcher, the baker, and candlestickmaker. Cost too much! It has always cost too much to bring about any reform. It was going to cost too much when we proceeded to break down the old vicious principle of freedom of contract; which caused men, and women more than men, to be the sweated slaves of the conditions in which they lived in the older countries of the world, and here, too. When we introduced the Wages Board system, it was going to cost too much to improve the conditions of the workers by their means. Every friend of the Liberal party as we know it now-no t the Liberalism as reflected on this side of the chamber at the present time, but the Conservatism that is opposite-the y and their press champions opposed the introduction of Wages Boards, because it would interfere with the sacred principle of freedom of contract, and would cost too much.

Our friends opposite trade in the name of Liberalism; but I ask them, if they had to choose between the radical Liberalism of Lloyd-George and Winston Churchill and the Conservatism opposed to them, on which side would they rank themselves?

263,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Havin g dealt witli the honourable member for Wakefield perhaps more than sufficiently-becaus e we have heard of his arguments before, and they have been answered a hundred times, I wish to put one point for the consideration of the Attorney-General. It is not a legitimate function, of a Government to legislate with the deliberate view of hampering or embarrassing a succeeding Government. Mr W. H . IBVINE - Would any other Government be hampered by this Bill ?",41
264,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not think so, but it is the deliberately expressed tion of Ministers to hamper succeeding Governments. It has been stated, with perhaps wearisome iteration, that the Bill itself accomplishes nothing. The members of the Ministry say, "" True, during our time it accomplishes nothing; but when the Labour party is returned, if it should be returned, it will have to pass an Act of Parliament to give effect to the wish of the people to restore the principle of preference to unionists in the making of temporary appointments to the Public Service."" Mr W. H . IBVINE - The Police Offences Act accomplishes nothing until its provisions have been broken.",41
265,Mr BEENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Whatever might have been ""accomplished by this Bill has, in fact, been accomplished by a Ministerial proclamation, and preference to unionists in appointments to the Public Service has been prohibited. Therefore, the Government must be pinned to this fact, that the object of the Bill is to hamper a succeeding Administration. That fact shows that Ministers think that another Government will succeed them before very long. Mr W. H. IBVINE - The honourable member cannot say thafe political offences are done away with because this Government are not committing any.",41
266,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not say that. Haviug prohibited preference to unionists by Ministerial action, they are now saying that when another Government comes into power, with, of course,' a mandate in favour of the policy which it has advocated, it will find the giving effect to that mandate as difficult as possible. If that can be justified on democratic lines, anything can be justified. To say, Ave know that the Act will do nothing now., but we are guarding against the people in the future doing something which we think that they ought not to do, is indefensible. ' In my mind, there is no more difficulty about preference to unionists in connection with appointments to the Public Service than in connection with other appointments. I have never made any apology for the proclamation of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs on this subject. The word preference, it is true, is one which lends itself to misconstruction and misrepresentation by those who desire to misconstrue and misrepresent, but I have never understood why preference to unionists, which is an established prinintenciple which honourable members opposite dare not assail, should not be applied to appointments to the Public Service. The Attorney-General has said that to apply preference to unionists by means of a Court and by a mere administrative act are two different things. If Ministers cannot take responsibility for their actions in regard to the appointment of persons to the Public Service, they are not worthy of the positions which fchey hold. If there is one way of applying the principle of preference to unionists which is more honest than another it is to make an open proclamation of policy on the subject. That is what was done by the last Labour Government. One of the effects of such action is to encourage employers, by showing them that, not only have we legislated in favour of preference to unionists, but that in our appointments we apply the principle. One more interesting point arises from the further examination of this Bill. It' has been introduced in the name of freedom and of liberty, and has been championed on the ground that themoney .of the people should be impartially dispensed to the King's subjects. Yet here is a curious thing. In making appointments to the Public Service the Government is to have absolutely unlimited discretion except in respect of one matter, that is, it must not be influenced by the consideration, is an applicant a member of a union or not? It is remarkablefchafc,while, in the case of two persons coming before a Government officer for employment, fchere may be a million reasons which would influencefchafcoflicer, fchis Bill does not challenge one of the million. The Government officer is given absolutely unlimited discretion, except that he must not be influenced by the inquiry whether a man is or is not a member of a union.. The whole effect, therefore, is merely to l i m it and hamper the discretion of the Government in the employment of its own men. The Bill does not give freedom, but is restrictive in its operation; and it comes naturally from a Government which has always endeavoured to narrow down the operations of the Federal Parliament in this as in other spheres.",41
267,Mr EODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Althoug h the honourable member says that, he does not prove - it.",42
268,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I submit that it is obvious, and if I restate the case, it may become equally obvious to the honourable member. Let us take the case of two persons who come before the Government officer for employment.",42
269,Mr BODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is prohibition of preference, but not prohibition of employment.",42
270,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The r e is absolute prohibition so far as concerns the Government officer being influenced by the consideration whether or not a man is a unionist. There is a limitation' of the discretion' of tile Government; and, in deed, there must be. Let us assume two men, a unionist and a non-unionist, who apply for employment, and who in other respects are absolutely equal Mr RoDGERS.^The Bill says that they shall have equal chances ",42
271,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What the Bill says is that the Government must not take into consideration the fact that one is a unionist, and this, notwithstanding that this Parliament for years past has been pledged to the policv of organization as against disorganization, and of unionism as against non-unionism. . ment have always favoured unionism, as R'udyard K i p l in g says, "" with mouths ""-hav e always avowedly favoured unionism and organization, and they are committed to a Conciliation and Arbitration Act based on organization. the case of the two men I have instanced, who are in all respects equal, the Government is prevented:",42
272,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Sho w motest limitation.,42
273,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If my honourable friend cannot understand me, I am afraid I cannot make the point any clearer. Let us suppose that under the circumstances - the Government officer is embarrassed in his choice, would it riot be reasonable, sunder the circumstances, for Him to decide to favour the man who represents the policy of the Federal Government, namely, the policy of organization and unionism? By this Bill , however, which is introduced in the name of freedom and liberty, the discretion of the Government is, as I say, hampered in the employment of its own labourers. That is-, and must be, the only possible effect; and it must be obvious to the meanest understanding that this little Bill , small and insignificant, and, if I may say so with the greatest respect, contemptible and useless as it is, is merely the beginning. It is analogous to the poverty in strength of the Government in this Parliament. As their strength is great, so will their attack oh unionism be great. To-day, tlieir capacity being so small as to be barely visible or ascertainable, their attack on unionism is of the weakest, paltriest, and meanest character. It is,- however, sufficient for us to know that it represents an attack on the whole policy of unionism. The honourable member for Wilmot laughs incredulously, I was going to say derisively.",42
274,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is a great assertion !,42
275,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And I am going to prove the assertion. Of course, it Has been proved a dozen times in this House already, but, as this Bill leaves us for the Senate on its chequered career, to suffer the fatal termination which we know will so soonovertake it, it is incumbent on us to cover it with all the ignominy and odium it deserves.",42
276,Sir BOBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Whaf c is the "" fatal termination "" ?",42
277,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,My honourable The Govern- friend must possess himself in patience; but I think this Bill will have the same their termination as will the Home Rule Bill when it goes to the House of Lords on the 22nd June.,42
278,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And the result will Yet, in be about the same, I suppose?",42
279,Mr BEENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So far as the triumph of Democracy is concerned, I have not the slightest doubt the result us the re- will be precisely the same. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Is the end to be short, sharp, and decisive, or a lingering death?",42
280,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is not in my hands. I shall not be in attendance on it as adviser, practitioner, nurse, or anyfchirfg"" else; it will be l e ft in other and independent hands for the time being. I say - that this Bill is a deliberatelyplanned attack on unionism, firstly, because of the recollection of the policy which this Government brought down about the 13th August last year. It was then proposed to introduce, not this paltry legislation, but legislation dealing with the whole question of what they were pleased to call political unionism. It was the intention and policy of the Government at that time to prohibit political unionism; and it was a step very far in advance of anything proposed to be accomplished by the measure before us. I have already shown why I consider political unionism to be justifiable, desirable, and absolutely necessary, and I shall say no more at this stage, except that the Government have not dared to persevere with their policy in that regard. They had no reason whatever to abandon that policy; and, as before pointed out, they could have closured it through the Chamber with just as much ease and good grace as they closured otlier important proposals of far-reaching interest last session. That policy which they abandoned was one attack they made, or proposed to make, and there was another in relation to the rural workers, who were to have their "" exemption restored."" The very phrasing of that policy was excellent, and the words were chosen with masterly skill-somethin g was to be "" restored "" to the rural workers. It was not said that the rural workers were to be driven out of the law, and made outlaws, or that they were to be abandoned by the Government, but that their "" exemption "" was to be "" restored,"" and they were to be left to the tender mercies of the States. The Government, perhaps, found it . inconvenient to remember that the States, through their fifty odd years of constitutional government, had never attempted to deal with the rural workers, and that, even if they did attempt to deal with them, they would find that they have not the necessary constitutional powers.",42
281,Mr AHERN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why ?,43
282,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The States can deal only with disputes within their own borders.,43
283,Mr AHERN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If those disputes are within their own borders, cannot the States deal with them?",43
284,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of course they can, and I have never denied the fact. But tlic honourable member for Wimmera, also the Attorney-General-wh o is a pass master in demonstrating the futility of State legislation in regard to these matters-hav e urged the utter impracticability of the States coping with industrial trouble of any importance, by reason of the local limitations of their powers.",43
285,Mr AHERN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But the honourable member said that constitutionally the States have not the power.,43
286,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I did; and constitutionally the States have not the power to deal with disputes which extend beyond their borders.,43
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Disputes are manufactured, sometimes \",43
288,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And the Chief Justice said that that kind of thing is a fraud on the Constitution.,43
289,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Wit h the greatest respect, I may point out that the Chief Justice was in a minority on the point.",43
290,Sir ROBEET BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And the honourable member for Bendigo, who is on the Labour side, quite approves of the view of the Chief Justice.",43
291,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Honourable members opposite may, if they like, speak of ""manufacturing"" disputes; I admit that the men have strained every nerve to get the benefit of the arbitration laws of the Commonwealth, in spite of honourable members opposite, who have done all they could to keep them from that tribunal. And what wrong is this on the part of workmen who come within organizations and lay down the weapon which they previously had, namely, the right to strike, besides encumbering themselves with all those limitations and conditions the Arbitration Act imposes on persons who join organizations registered under it ? What attraction is there for men to bind themselves in this way unless it be an honourable desire to have industrial troubles regulated in a peaceful and lawful way by the courts of the land ?",43
292,Mr AHERN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then you approve of the creation of artificial disputes?,43
293,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not approve of the creation of artificial disputes, and I challenge my friend to point to one case in which a dispute was held by the Court to be an artificial dispute.",43
294,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,43
295,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I digress, but unfortunately for the honourable member I have got in my challenge before your call, while he has not been able to get in his reply. But these observations were drawn from me by the Treasurer repeating what has so often been said about this so-called manufacturing of disputes. I was discussing rural workers ou this question of preference, and showing that the Bil l was a deliberate attack on the whole policy of unionism. If the principle of general preference is sound it ought to be applied by a responsible Government to its employees so far as it may be applied. It cannot be applied under the Commonwealth Arbitration (Public Service) Act, as I understand from men better qualified to judge than myself.",43
296,Mr AHEBN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why did not your Government make it applicable under that Act?,44
297,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My friend had better not raise that question, because if he inquires from the Attorney-General he will be told that the Attorney-General at that time was under the impression that it did apply. Once, therefore, the soundness of the general principle of preference is admitted, there is no logical reason why it should not be applied to temporary workmen in the Commonwealth Public Service. And is it sound ? I think it has been proved to demonstration that the principle of preference is absolutely sound. It is a principle that I have defended, I flatter myself, more or less successfully, on every platform where I have spoken, whether in the town or in the country, and it is merely an adventitious use of the word "" preference "" which has won for honourable members on the Ministerial side any support to tlieir policy of hostility towards the general principle of preference to unionists-merel y the playing upon the word that has deluded many eople, perhaps not unnaturally, into the elief that preference spelt unfair treatment to one section of the community as against some other.",44
298,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Giv e us your definition of ""preference.""",44
299,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Preferenc e to unionists, in the sense in which we have applied it, and have used it in the Arbitration Act, and in the sense in which I would have used it in regard to Government employment, spells no unfairness to any section of the community, and for these reasons arbitration is based on preference to unionists. You cannot have arbitration without preference to unionists.",44
300,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,How can you say that in the administration of the Goveniment service there can be arbitration?,44
301,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have every desire to answer my friend. I have dealt with the question so far as this- I say that once the principle of preference to unionists is admitted it cannot be logically denied to the employ6s under responsible Government; and if a Court is empowered to give preference to unionists in a dispute between private individuals it is not only justifiable, but obligatory that the Government should set an example in regard to the application of that principle, so that when two men confront a Minister, if other conditions of employment are equal, preference should be given to the man who subscribes to a policy which has been accepted by the Commonwealth as a whole.",44
302,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,For what reason do we require preference to unionists from private employers?,44
303,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The reasons are many and weighty.,44
304,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Are they identical with those in regard to the Government service?,44
305,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They are largely, if not wholly,fchesame reasons.",44
306,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then does victimization apply under the Government?,44
307,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not wish to be led into the allegation that such a thing has happened-it may, or it may not have happened-bu t it does not meet my argument that where the Government, in the interests of law and order and good government, have accepted a policy, and laid down the general principle of arbitration, which is based on unionism, it behoves the Government, more particularly than an individual, to say that where there are two men in questiou, in the interests of good governmeut, of law and order, or, if you like, of unionism and of the policy we have accepted, as between these two men, other things being equal, the choice should fall on the man who subscribes to the national policy.",44
308,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Can you tell us how many awards of preference have been granted by the Court, and how many men have been affected by them?",44
309,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member asks for statistics. It is a very significant fact that though preference to unionists has been made part of an award in but few instances, the President of the Court has in each case before him warned the parties that if be should find an instance pf victimization, or if be had any rpason to believe that such a thing existed, or that non-unionists were being preferred to unionists, he would be most happy to apply the principle of preference to unionists. In at least qne case he has given an award .containing an application of the principle of preference to unionists.",44
310,Unknown,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7J 5 p.m.,45
311,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is rather a curious thing that one of the most virulent charges made against this party is the alleged fact that the policy of the late Labour .Government in regard to preference to unionists was the beginning of a system of Tammany in Australia-prize s and perquisites to political friends. I may say in, reply to that, as I have already said in regard to spine pf the observations made by the honourable member for ""Wakefield, that this certainly is the most venomous kind of criticism that can be addressed towards this party, because it is an allegation of corruption! And.it comes from a party who showed a very refined sensitiveness when their own actions respecting the transcontinental railway contract were under criticism. Then Ministers' were insistent that our criticism on a matter of public policy amounted to a personal charge agaiust the Honorary Minister. Of course it meant nothing of the kind, and, notwithstanding the desire of honourable members to hug that suggestion to themselves as a personal charge, we repudiated any such intention. We said, that the contract showed bungling and maladministration, and beyond that we did not desire to go. But this Tammany charge is a g.rpss libel, not only on every member of this party, but upon the Australian public as a whole, and in that aspect it ought to. be deeply resented by members on both sides. It ought to be perfectly obvious that any publicly expressed policy, such as preference to unionists, which is, to use a common form of expression, painted on the moon so that all may understand it, cannot be corrupt, because everybody sees it and appreciates it , and accepts or rejects it with unrestrained and equal voting power. The measure of its popularity, we may presume, will be to some extent, at all events, the benefits it brings to the community; and if this is a baneful practice, the Labour party is prepared to. pay the penalty for its inception and for persevering with it . We say it is not a pernicious practice. The fact is that the Labour party, in respect of this question of preference to unionists, stand as thechampions of organized labour and regulated industry, and law and order as distinguished from disorganization and conditions bordering on anarchy. It is that sharp line of difference which separatest members on this side from members opposite, and I think it cannot be too frequently urged that if there are any representatives who wilfully, or in effect,, whether wilfully or not, are friends of Syndicalism, they are the honourable members opposite, who continue to opposeorganization and any encouragement wedesire to offer to organization.",45
312,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,No one loqking at your facewould think you are a humorist.',45
313,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do""not""pride myself on being one, but I do appreciate a. joke, even if it comes from the honourable member for Henty, whose jokes are pot. always of the most subtle character. We. cannot all be Harry Lauders. The fact is that we urge for every unipn certain preference^ and we do it for the reason that unions, in organizing under the Arbitral tion Act, take upon themselves certain ob-ligations, and give up certain rights. In this respect I would like to refer to someremarks made by the honourable member for Echuca. The honourable member has spoken about the prices persons have to pay in order to join certain unions, and heinstanced the Pelt Hatters Union, in respect of which there w . said to be a proas hibitive entrance fee.",45
314,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That was so afc one time. """,45
315,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not know what the fee was, nqr am I concerned to know what it was. I am here advocating the organization of labour under the Arbitration Act, and I call, attention to the fact tha$ such a prohibitive entrance fee as was mentioned by the honourable member for Echuca would not be possible underthat statute.  member, forget that I was quoting an observation by an honourable member on his own side of the House ?",45
316,Mr BEENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not concerned"" with whom the honourable member was quoting; I am concerned only with thefacts. I learn by interjection that the honourable member professed to be quoting the honourable member for Boothby, but I am told that he did not quote correctly. I am endeavouring to show what is involved by organizations coming under the Arbitration Act, and how these organizations, which are said to work up artificial disputes in order to approach the Court, must first of all give up a number of the rights they possessed previously, and take upon themselves certain obligations which they did not have to bear before. Amongst the conditions, by reason of which an organization may be de-registered, is this oneThat the rules of a registered organization or their administration do not provide reasonable facilities for the admission of new members, or impose unreasonable conditions upon the continuance of their membership, or are in any way tyrannical or oppressive. Here is another conditionThat the accounts of a registered organization have not been audited, in pursuance of the rules, or that the accounts of the organization or of the auditor do not disclose the true cial position of the organization. There are a number of others, such as- . That a registered organization has wilfully neglected to obey an order of the Court. That the rules of a registered organization have been altered so as to no longer comply with the prescribed conditions or have not bond fide been observed. That the proper 'authority of a registered organization wilfully neglects to provide for the levying and collection of subscriptions, fees, or penalties from members of the organization. And then there is this sweeping dragnet conditionThat for any reasons the registration of an organization ought to be cancelled. When unions register they give up the right to strike under pain of a very severe penalty, and they have to comply with very strict and searching conditions during the period of their registration. For this main reason, and the fact that every organization registered under this Act did give up those rights, and did submit itself to these obligations, we say the Government should be the very first to recognise those who do their best to comply with these orderly, regulated conditions in regard to industry. It is for those reasons, also, that we say that when there are two or more men offering for employment, other things being equal, the fact of some of them being organized and complying with the law, should at least have sufficient weight to induce a Government officer to say, "" Well, as there are no other conditions to weigh with me in making a selection, I am entitled to select the persons who most readily fall in with the policy of the Commonwealth in regard to organized labour."" It has heen said that these organizations manufacture disputes. I point out in that regard that the worse which can happen as a result of these manufactured disputes is that we get an award of the highest tribunal in the land qualified to deal with the matter in dispute, and I further point out that, although those disputes may be manufactured^ in respect of non-essentials, such as the linking-up of disputes between State and State, they cannot be manufactured as regards the essential matter of the strained relations between employers and employees in the different States. Consequently we should encourage rather than discourage men approaching the courts of the land. It .is a matter of intense regret to me-if I may be, for once, given credit by my friends opposite for candour and disfinan- interestedness in this matter-that in all the cases brought before the Arbitration Court the friends and supporters of honourable members opposite, the employers of labour, exercise every means at their command to prevent an award being given. I would not object at all to them fighting on the merits of the case; my objection is that they fight merely on the technicalities, for the purpose of preventing the merits of the case being tried in the Court. Reference has been made to the lawyers' union. Sometimes I think this question of preference to unionists in the law must be an extraordinarily non-party one, because lawyers receive a certain amount of criticism from both sides of the House, and for that reason I can afford to treat the matter with a more or less judicial mind. It is well worth knowing that the legal profession not only avails itself of all the ordinary rules in regard to unionism, and has its unions-al l honour to them, I do not call them law-breakersbut it has the dual protection of statute law, and the ordinary relationship of members in a union. In the law and the medical profession, men are allowed to practise only when they are qualified according to certain statutory standards. That is the first protection they enjoy. Having qualified according to those standards they form their unions. Such as the Bar Association, the Law Institute, the Law Society, and other associations branches of the profession. I confess, as I have often done, and even the Attorney General has admitted it , that the lawyers have their unions. The Attorney-General has admitted that to-night, and has said that he respects his union. I am glad to have that statement from him at last.",45
317,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He is a brand plucked from the burning.,47
318,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Q u it e so. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have often said in this House that I am a member of a union.,47
319,Mr BEENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I think that it was on the motion for the second reading of this Bill that the Attorney-General said: "" Why talk about law unions? It is perfectly true that we lawyers, like other men, are required to qualify up to a certain standard before we can practise, but apart from that there is no unionism about the profession of the l a w . "" That, I .think, is substantially what the honourable gentleman then said. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No . I said that there was no preference to unionists. That is a very different thing.",47
320,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I did not understand the honourable gentleman to say so. It is now admitted, however, as it must be, that there is unionism in connection with the profession of the law, and from my point of view that is quite right. read in a recent issue of the London Times a report regarding an agitation which is going on in England for the admission of women to the bar. In Victoria women are entitled to practise at the bar, and there is an agitation going on in England to give them the same right. Possibly some honourable members may have heard that there is also on foot in Great Britain an agitation to give the women the vote, and I should like to say in passing that the object of that agitation has my complete sympathy. moments remaining I propose to quote a letter which was written to the London Times of 3rd ultimo, by a country solicitor, as it will give honourable members some idea of how unionism in the legal profession is regarded there. The letter is as follows: I have hitherto supported a Liberal policy of progress and reform, but when this policy is moulded according to political exigency, and appears to have become a mania for topsyturvydom, the instinct of self-preservation, to put it on no higher ground, forces one into the for different opposite camp. My disappointment with the Government is only equalled by my disappointment at the non-effectiveness of the Law Societythat is the unionin conserving and furthering the interests of our profession. I joined the Law Society in the hope, apparently vain, that a society representing the bulk of the profession, would be able to make its influence felt, and would at least be ableListen to thisto do as much for solicitors as a trade union can do and has done for a plumber or bricklayer. On the contrary, however, an obsolete system of inadequate remuneration still obtains, and, owing, to the competition of his brethren, a solicitor can rarely get paid more than halfscale charges, and in the country often not even that. I invite honourable members to listen to what may happen by reason of the sweating effects of competitionChartered accountants take away his cornany and bankruptcy work, and obtain a much iglier remuneration there for. House agents 6 tout his clients, sell property, of which he holds the title deeds, prepare open contracts, and stop their exorbitant commission out of the deposit, and prepare agreements in lieu of leases, and in any and every other matter that advertising and touting brings into their net. Any and every other person who chooses to do the accustomed work of solicitors does so without let or hindrance, either from the law or the Law Society, except in the case of a document under seal, or actual holding out as a ""solicitor"" in any matter.",47
321,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order . The honorI able member's time has expired.,47
322,Mr BEENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I regret that I have not time ito supplement my observations in regard to the right of women to practise in Court.,47
323,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Adelaide) [8.5] - I should not have risen but for the fact that the honourable member for Wakefield made some pointed references to a subject of which, I think, he knows but little. He is one of those who were at one time members of the Liberal party, but who, when there was no longer any In the few scope for that class of politician to exist, got in out of the wet by entering the ultra-Conservative party fold, which is now known as the Fusion party. Such honourable members do not hesitate to t w it those of more Democratic views who, when the line of demarcation waa so clearly drawn, went over to the side of progress, and who, as members of the Labour party, are seeking now to make the world a better place in which to live. The honourable member for Wakefield made special reference to myself and others who have put up a fight for industrialism, declaring that those who were in the forefront of the battle had not received the rewards to which their service entitled them at the hands of Labour. I regret that the honourable member is not present, because I propose to mention, in refutation of his statement, a number of names with which he is well acquainted-name s of men witli whom he has sat in the State Parliament. The trouble with the honourable member is that his scalp as a member of the State Parliament, already hangs on the belt of the Labour party. We were successful in ousting him from the Legislature of South Australia, and the time is not far distant when we shall also have his scalp as a member of the Federal Parliament. We are nothing if we are not a party with a set purpose. We have carved out for ourselves a clearcut course, and we intend to follow it . Although we may be in a small minority in this House at the present time, we feel that the reforms which we have been successful in carrying, the legislation which we have passed in the Federal and State Parliaments, are of such a character that it will not be long before the people will again return our party to power in the Commonwealth Parliament. The political death-knell of some honourable members opposite has already been sounded, and that is why they take exception to our tactics. Coming to the honourable member's statement that those who in the past made great sacrifices in the cause of Labour were not rewarded for their services as they should have been, I propose to point out that in South Australia, at all events, all who were in the memorable fight to which I referred on a previous occasion were recompensed in accordance with the work they had done, and that they were returned to either the State or the Federal Parliament. In the first place I would remind the honourable member of the late Frank Hourigan and John Abel MCPherson, both of whom died in the service. Then, again, there was the late Tom Price, who, at on© time, was reviled to a greater extent, perhaps, than was any other man in Labour politics, but who, before he died, was acclaimed as an honest, faithful patriot of his country. He was rewarded for his services, and he, too, died in harness. Then there is the late Mr Batchelor, who represented Boothby in this House, and whose memory is revered not only in the State of which he was so long a representative, but by every honourable - member of this House who was fortunate enough to be associated with him. He died in the service of the party and the country. Yet another name which I shall mention is that of Mr Kirkpatrick, who took part in the Labour movement of the early nineties, when we were told that if we were not satisfied with existing conditions we should secure representation in Parliament. He and others I have named were in the forefront of the battle, and they were returned to Parliament as soon as the band of reformers came together as the Labour party. Mr Kirkpatrick waa a member of the Stat© Parliament. He was elevated to the position of Agent General, and returned recently from London full of honours magnificently earned. Another man whose services were rewarded, but of whom I cannot speak as I have of others, is Mr Charleston. He was foolish enough to .think that he could play "" ducks and drakes"" with the party that had made him, and today he is out of political life. He was taken up by the Liberal party and returned to the Senate, but the electors found out his true value and relegated him to obscurity. Other men in the forefront of the fight were the honourable member for Hindmarsh, Mr Archibald; the honourable  Coneybeer, Mr MCGillivray, members of the State Parliament; Senator MCGregor, and Mr Fred Wallis, M.L.C. There are several others whose names I could mention if it were necessary, but I have said sufficient, I think, to justify the interjections I made while the honourable member for Wakefield was speaking, that his statement was incorrect. The honourable member went on to say that we were striving for industrial supremacy. That is undoubtedly true. That is the ideal we have before us. What, on the other hand, is the goal of the commercial section of the community 1 There are, after all, only two elements in our community. We have on the one hand the section that produces, and on the other the exploiters of the producers, commonly known as the commercial element. There are several branches of the latter section, but they are all dependent upon the main one. Even the legal element is dependent for its. very, life upon the commercial element..",47
324,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the motion for the third reading of the Bill. Mr YATES\- I am endeavouring to refute arguments that have been advanced, in. support of the Bill. Our contention is that the Government will not stop at the prohibition of preference to unionists in Government employment as proposed, by this measure. The Attorney-General has admitted that if he had they power he would do away with preference to unionists in every shape and form-. There is. more behind the Bill than, meetsthe eye'. If we let the Ministerialiststell the country that we cepted the Bill, having, no-reasonable ment to advance against it, the thin edge of> the wedge, would be inserted to force the. principle of preference to unionists out of the arbitration law. Therefore we feel that we are doing the right thing in offering the strongest opposition to the Bill. We contend that no member of the community should be allowed to be the camp follower of any section; that non-unionists should not' be permitted to benefit Bytlie efforts of unionists who sacrifice tliemselves to obtain that which is just for : tlieir fellows. We say that those who bear the burden should aloneenjoy the benefits obtained. I should not object if it were provided, that those who do not subscribe to union funds, and take part ih the struggles which gain extra emoluments, shorter hours, and better conditions, should not enjoy, those benefits,, and thaf when the wages and' the"" industry to whichthey belong were increased as the result of' unionism they should be left to what the honourable member, for Werriwa has called the inexorable law of supply and demand. It is not only the workers who have to complain of men who wish to take advantage of the efforts of others. At the present time the bakers are-objecting to night work, which they say is detrimental' to the health of the operatives. They contend that bread should be baked in. the daytime, and that the day-baking system can be adopted, without, hardship to the public. Mr Eldridge, a prominent. Adelaide baker, who' has taken some partin the fight against the unions on this matter, writing to the local-newspapers) in reply, to the secretary of the Bakers - Society,, says; referring to a ballot taken by the Master Bakers Association to determine whether they should fight the unions, or allow the dispute to be dealt with by arbitration and conciliationSome who did not send in their papers gave verbal answers and financial assistance. The rest, unfortunately, were willing that we should do the work and shoulder the expense, while they meanly took any advantage that might bo gained. That class of individual is to be found in all societies and associations. That statement shows that those who have been calledthe sneaks of society are not found wholly among the workers. But the employers have methods of dealing with those who will not come into line. Sooner or later pressure is brought to bear, and on the next occasion those who ac- now will not take part in concerted action argu- will be no longer standing aloof. The employers'do not find it necessary* to ask for preference, because they have methods for enforcing"" combined action upon their members. The employees, however, are not in the same position. The unionists among them are fighting to benefit the community at large, and ask that a lawbe placed' on the statute book which will make it incumbent upon all to take their fair share of the work of improving the conditions of. the workers. The honourable member, for Wakefield spoke of Mr Lundie-wlio , I am proud to say, is a friend of mine-as . a good fellow who always says 1 straight out what he wants. He made a similar reference to the honourable member for. Darling. There are honourable members opposite who, in fighting unionism, accuse the. paid, officials; of the unions,, the union, bosses^ of causing strife. In view of the statementsthat we have h a i from such speakers, it was strange to hear, the honourable member for Wakefield' expressing, the highest admiration, for these, two bosses of the biggest union in Australia. I hope that when trouble again, takes place, and it may occur in connection, with a request for preference to the Common1 wealthi Government,, this eulogium will be remembered. Should any contest occur, it"" will be Mr Lundie's duty to see that any business betv: een' the Government and. the members of the Australian Workers Union is transacted through him. When he makes a demand, it is always for a few shillings more, or for better conditions. The time will come when we shall demand betterconditions, and I trust that the honourable member for Wakefield will assist those on this side of the Housewhb will support Mr Lundie and the Australian Workers Union in their attempts to better the conditions of the lowest grade of labour,, whose needs are greater than' of the skilled artisan. I hope that Govei'nment will not gain from the passhowever, ing of the measure what it hopes to gain. Personally I cannot' be accused of being afraid of going to the country, because - representa constituency in which Labour is not afraid of defeat. But this Parliaam ment has only recently been elected, has a three-year term to go. I shall iterate the constitutional arguments against a double dissolution; I wish dwell upon the Heedlessness of forcing country to spend £100,000 on an election two years before the due time. have heard a great deal of late of rights of thetaxpayer, and those who so considerateof those rights should loth to impose this burden upon the people. Having, gained their battle, .hope that the Ministerialists will tent with tlieir win, and will not try further. I appeal to them not to necessarily squander the people's money. ., There could be an amicable arrangement under which non-contentious legislation of benefit to the country could be with, without an appeal to the electors. Were Ministers really sincere in their jection to"" preference to unionists, would propose to amend the Arbitration and Conciliation law. Had they proposed suchan amendment, I should have drawn attention to a provision which is injurilation ous to trade unions. The union of which whole. I am a member has experienced, the hardship of it. The provision to which refer prevents unions from suing for rears. The quotation that I have from Mr Eldridge'sletter shows that there are bakers who refuse to honour their obligations-, and there are afew persons among the unionists. Notwithdoes-the . standing-, anything that may be said contrary;.I know that the union subscripness tion fees and entrance fees are not prohiis-bitive, and that in most cases no entrance .fee is charged. The Australian Workers Union does not charge an« entrance That union has never any occasion prosecute members for payment of arrears or to trace up recalcitrant legs, simply because the organizer calls on a manand. sells him a ticket prac©- which covers? the whole year's - scrip tion. In th© union withwhich-1 connected, there are some members who have got back in their payments-, and, according to a section in the Act, we ar© those forced to sue under a State statute in a the court of summary jurisdiction. Here, there comes into operation what is known as the statute of limitation, which makes it impossible to sue for I any arrears over six months. I see from your demeanour, Mr Speaker, that I somewhat wandering from the subject and before the Chair, but I may say that I not-ream still hopeful that the Government will introduce some amending Bill to to make the Conciliation and Arbithe tration Act more acceptable to trade unionists-. If they do that the GoWe vernment will bestow a boon on organized . the labour, and remove some ground for the are charge that they hav© been some eighteen be months in office and have not introduced any legislation of public benefit. I shall I say no more, but leave my remarks to be conhave tfieir effect on the Government. I to go feel positive that when the great day uncomes, if ever it does come, for an appeal to the people, the Labour party will have nothing to fear. In thedevelopment of this party from industrial unionism we dealt have no cause to be ashamed; and I am optimistic enough to think that, when the obnumbers go up, instead of finding the they figures 38 to 37, we shall come back with a greater majority than that with, which we left office on the last occasion, and that we shall be able tointroduce legisto' thebenefit of the peopleas a",49
325,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yarra) [8.34] - This , I I suppose, is .the "" last lap,"" but I do not arthink tfiat the vote willsettle the quesmade tion. We know that no question is settleduntil it is settled aright, and certainly this"" Bill does not represent the right such way""; and no one knows that better than Attorney-General. This Bill has to-the beenconceived' in a spirit of vindictiveagainst the industrialunions, and it an attack on< those' unions, and those unions alone. If it were not for the* fact that during .the' last few years theindusfee. trial unionshave takenpolitics more to Seriously than everbefore, this Bill' would not have been introduced'; and it is only blackbecause the workers have seen fit to organize politically, as well as industrially, for a that we have this proposal before us. subHere, again, no one is better aware of the am facts-than is .the Attorney-General'. The unions are now beginning to make their weight felt ab the polls. In 1890, at the time of the maritime trouble, the men were told not to strike, but to get their grievances redressed by their representatives in Parliament; and the corollary of organization is the representation of organizations before the industrial tribunal. That being so, those who undertake the work of organizing the workers, and the work of the organization, and of settling these industrial matters are entitled to some reward in the shape of preference. It is within the memory, I suppose, of every member of this House that unionists, as workers, were at one time divided into two political camps, as they are now to a large degree in Great Britain, the United States and other countries; and it is only when they organize themselves definitely as workers that any fault is found with them. To-day the honourable member for Wakefield taunted some honourable members on this side with not having been very long in the trade union movement-wit h coming into that movement simply because they desired to obtain what he termed "" political plums."" That view of the matter is, however, an entirely incorrect one.",50
326,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member has slandered every working man in the community.,51
327,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is not new in the case of the honourable member for Wakelikely field. It may be that some who have come later into the movement have risen minent places by reason of their ability, and, at any rate, it would be quite easy to point to some honourable members opposite who have not been in politics very long, hut who have found places in this House and positions in the Liberal party. employees. As I said on the second reading, I am not so concerned with the Bill as with the fear that honourable members opposite will not put the position fairly before the satisfied. people if there should be a general election on this question. orable members opposite ought to tell to the truth. the electors that this Bill has no relation whatever to permanent employees in the Public Service, but that applies to the temporary hands, and that it gives no advantage over any other sons in the community. My fear in this regard is strengthened by what appears the current issue of The Liberal, a periodical which is published in Victoria in support of the present Government. do not know whether the extract is a report of a speech delivered by the Minister of Trade and Customs or is an article contributed to The Liberal by him, but it is as follows:PREFERENCE IN ADMINISTRATION. MINISTER OF CUSTOMS, HON. L - E. GROOM, EXPOSES THE INJUSTICE OF THE CLAIM. If men are to be appointed to the Public Service, not because they are the best men for the jobs, but because they have rendered some service to the community, why should that service to the community be confined to one object only? The Minister of Trade and Customs knows full well that this Bill applies only to the temporary employees of the Government, and my fear is that it may be represented to the people that permanent appointments are involved.",51
328,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,When I spoke on Friday I said distinctly that the Bill applied only to temporary employees.,51
329,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This is not the only publication which supports honourable members opposite, and which misrepresents the position; and the statement. I have read is an absolutely unfair one.",51
330,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Liberal is one of the 0 fairest papers in Australia.,51
331,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If I were permitted, I could draw attention to another paragraph in this paper which expresses the opinion that the honourable member is not to drop dead with heart disease owing to the speed with which he is dealto proing with the Navigation Act. Every lionorable member opposite knows that this Bill applies only to temporary men.",51
332,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What the honourable member has to justify is the principle of granting preference to even temporary,51
333,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If honourable members opposite will present that view, and that view only, on the platform, I shall be",51
334,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable Honmember may be sure that we shall stick,51
335,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then the Liberal party will follow a different line from any they it only have followed hitherto.,51
336,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,How many Commonperwealth employees will the Bill apply to?,51
337,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I gave the figures durin ing the second-reading debate, but I may tell the honourable member that there are three classes of employees in the Public I Service. First, there are the permanent men, who number about 20,000, and get intothe Service by examination, and by examination only, a system which is different from that in practice where Liberal Governments are in existence. I could quote an article from the Age of 21st May to show the rottenness in the Public Service that exists in Great Britain under a Liberal Government. Next, there are about 14,000 or 15,000 exempt officers, who do not come under the Public Service Commissioner; and, lastly, there are about 2,000 or 3,000 employed on temporary work; and, seeing that the Government are abandoning the day-labour system and going in for contract work at double the cost at which they could get work done by day labour-as the Prime Minister showed in connection with the laying of telephone cables in Sydneyand are going to give away more of the taxpayers' money by doing something which they would not do with their own private concerns-ther e they employ direct labour wherever they can, because they know that if they appoint good overseers they can get better work from direct labour than from contractors-ther e will be fewer temporary employees if the Government employ contractors to do the work. The honourable member for Wannon will have an opportunity to speak after me.",51
338,Mr BODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is why I wish you to answer my question.,52
339,Mr TTJDOB,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is not permitted to answer questions; but I can adopt the attitude of Ministers-if I find a question too knotty, I can ask the honourable member to give notice of it ; if I find that I can score by doing so, I answer it .",52
340,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will you say that there are no employees outside the Commonwealth Service who will not be affected by this preference?,52
341,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As far as I understand the Bill, it is supposed to have one specific purpose, and that is to deal with the question of preference to Government employees. If the Government desire it to apply to all, why do they not bring forward a comprehensive measure, and wipe out the provision in the Arbitration Act? But they do not dare to do that. Mr. Deakin, who described the party opposite so ably as the "" wreckage of all parties,"" and who afterwards joined them, and was one of the wreckage thrown up on the beach, showed in another speech how preference to unionists had grown, and how it was agreed to, so far as the Arbitration Act was concerned, by all partiesincluding the wreckage and the political deadbeats. What I object to is that there will be misrepresentation on the platform by our friends opposite, and that it will be made out, as the honourable member for Wannon has tried to infer, that the Bill will operate further than is proposed, and that it will probably apply to rural workers and others, though honourable members know full well that it will not apply to any one but those in the Government Service. Let me quote further remarks by the Minister of Trade and Customs from this publicationIf to reward some service rendered to industrial unionism we may depart from the principle of making appointments to the Public Service on merit alone, we are entitled to depart from that principle on other grounds. Here we have again a reference to appointments to the Public Service.",52
342,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Exactly , to the temporary service.",52
343,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When we speak of appointments to the Public Service, we mean permanent appointments, and the use of the word "" appointment"" in connection with this matter is deliberate misrepresentation of the case.",52
344,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You have forgotten section 40 of the Act, which says that you are required to appoint the men best qualified for the work, other things being equal. You did not do that.",52
345,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is trying to twist and turn the matter to something else. I ask the Attorney General-Would he say that any person who was being employed by the Commonwealth in a temporary capacity was being appointed to the Public Service?,52
346,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes ; because the Act says so.,52
347,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Act says no such thing. They can be put off at any time. They cannot work longer than six months, with an extension of three months under special circumstances.",52
348,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You asked me the question. The answer is in the Arbitration (Public Service) Act. Mr J. H. CATTS - The Attorney General knows perfectly well that it does not apply, for instance, to men engaged on railway work. Mr W. H . IBVINE - Yes , it does. Read the Act for yourself. Honourable members forget their own Acts.",52
349,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,This is bluff.,53
350,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , absolute bluff.",53
351,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Will the honourable member read the definition of "" Publio Service"" in thab Act?",53
352,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The section provides"" The Public Service of the Commonwealth "" includes the Public Service of the Northern Territory and of the Territory of the Seat of Government, and the service of airy public stitution or authority of the Commonwealth, and includes all persons employed in any such service in any capacity, whether permanently or temporarily. But that does not say that temporary men are appointed to the Public Service. No one can say that a man who gets a temporary job on telephone conduits is getting a permanent appointment in the Public Service.",53
353,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,A loud voice will nob cover an obvious mistake.,53
354,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not claim that it will, and I do not think that a man who adopts a cold attitude will freeze anything. Whether they go through the Public Service Commissioner's office or not, they are not public servants.",53
355,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You know that the section answers your question.,53
356,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am positive it does not. The Attorney-General may bluff juries and other people, but his bluff will not go down here.",53
357,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then I shall not attempt to answer any more of your questions. If that is the way you treat them, you need not put them to me.",53
358,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member need not answer them. He can go on drawing on his pad.,53
359,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,53
360,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Minister takes up such an attitude, and puts himself on such a pedestal, and thinks himself high and above every one else, he may surely be referred to just a little by humble honourable members of the House like myself. I was referring to the obvious misrepresentation of the Minister of Trade and Customs when he was speaking, as quoted in this paper.",53
361,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Unde r section 40, what was the qualification for appointment?",53
362,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I suppose the qualification was that the men were wanted, and that they were able to do the work.",53
363,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Public Service Commissioner had to pick the men best qualified for the work.,53
364,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is what we did every time; we picked the best men qualified to do the work.,53
365,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,""" Other things being equal, unionists preferred.""",53
366,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes ; if two men arequalified, and one is as good as the other,. I know that 1 would pick the man whoin- had battled in the trade union movement,, who had probably been victimized.",53
367,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of course, your Government would appoint the men whohad done the ""battling"" for you?",53
368,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable membersaid he would not "" chip in."" I admit hedid not say "" chip in""-h e - would use more dignified language. But I did not say that we would appoint the men who had done the "" battling "" for us. I said that we would appoint the men best fitted for the work, and that if there were twoequal in capacity I would appoint theunionist.",53
369,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Who had done the"" battling.""",53
370,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , the men who had done the "" battling"" in connection with< trade unionism, and who had probablybeen victimized for it. I have been "" through the mill,"" and I have beenvictimized. The man who takes a prominent part in union affairs is likely to bevictimized. I can quote some evidencetaken before the last Tariff Commission, of a man who was victimized for that reason. I can show how the secretary of the Employers Federation telephoned! to, or wrote, round urging employers not to employ him because he was the secretary to a union. However, I was speaking of misrepresentation that will' be used, in saying that these are Government appointments, when every honourable member knows that a temporary appointment gives a worker no advantage sueh as is conferred by a permanent appointment, - and that, though a man isappointed to the temporary staff half-adozen times, he will still need to pass an examination before being appointed, to thepermanent staff in the Public Service. If - it had been otherwise, and a man on the temporary staff was a member of the Public Service, would there have been any necessity for me to ask the Postmasters General, in connection with the telephoneconstruction work, why a number of men had been put off? Temporary men canbe dispensed with at any time, and thrown out on to the industrial scrap-heap. The Minister of Trade and .Customs, in this speech, went on to sayNow let ns take the strong reasons against giving - that preference to unionists. First of ail, giving preference to unionists would fetter ajid .tie .the hands of the Commonwealth, and prevent us from having free selection in getting the best men. Tho second objection to preference to unionists is a serious one. It is that unions are becoming daily more and more political. That is the trouble. As a matter of fact, the schoolmaster is at work, and the trade unionist knows that it is absolutely useless for him to pay into his union and then allow the political machinery to be used, as in the past, to his detriment.",53
371,Mr FINLAYSO N,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Employers TJnipns arc political.,54
372,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of course they they have to contribute far more than the members of trade unions. Sir ROBERT BEST,-There is no preferthe ence with them.",54
373,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is no need to give preference in the case of the employers' union, because every one is in the organization.

On page 1290 of Hansard of this session he is reported as follows: I have no more right to judge the honourable member than he has to judge me. During the course of the speech of an honourable member opposite, lie said he had been informed-he could not vouch for the accuracy of his information-that a certain union, before it would admit any new' member to its ranks, had demanded an entrance fee of £20. I can vouch for the accuracy of that statement.",54

386,Sir EOBEBT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am not disputing are mad the honourable member's statement.,54
387,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The circumstances were these: A f i r m in Sydney had locked out the men,* and a strike had been in progress for three or four years. I may say that - that is nothing for a hatters union. We had one strike which lasted thirty years, and in the end we beat the boss. Some hatters were brought to Sydney from England by the employers under false presences, and they were called upon by the union to pay less than half of what the other members had paid by way of levies.",54
388,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Did that amount to £20?,55
389,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Hatters Dnion has never appealed to any outside union for assistance. The hatters have fought their own battles, although some of the members have had to pay up to £50 in strike levies; and they will win this strike in the «nd. Since the union has been before the Arbitration Court, I understand, the entrance fee has been practically wiped out, and any journeyman who comes from a felt hatters' union in any other part of - the world, and brings his clearance card, is admitted. Honourable members may believe that I am not saying anything that is not correct about a union of which I know so much.",55
390,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Tw o or three journeymen came from the Old Country and sought admission to the Hatters Union, and they could not get in under £20.",55
391,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And I said they were then paying only about half what the other members had paid in levies. But no man has been asked to pay that amount in a lump sum; he has always had .the right to pay in instalments. I want to quote another portion of the matter published in The Liberal from the Minister of Trade and CustomsPolitical patronage has an absolutely corrupting influence on the community. When we find that unions are becoming more and more political every day, as is admitted, and that the leaders are binding them more and more to distinct principles not relating to unionism at all, but to Socialism and other things altogether outside unionism, and when we give in the public employment preference to those persons, which practically amounts to giving all possible preference on account of tlic political views that they hold, we arc really getting back to the old system that was repealed. It is necessary, in the interests of the public, that the people should declare most emphatically that the Public Service of Australia shall be thrown open to everybody, irrespective of class, creed, or political views. Efficiency and fitness for the duties to be performed should alone be the determining factors in appointments to Hae Public Service of Australia. I say "" Yes"" to that. They get in by merit alone, and the Minister knew, when he was writing that article, that appointments to the Public Service are made by examination only. There are today employed temporarily, or under the exemption clause, men who are doing work in connection with telephone construction, and haye been working in the Department for years; but although they can do the practical work they cannot pass the education examination which is necessary in order to gain admission to the Service. Those men get absolutely no advantage, and when the Minister uses the word "" appointment,"" time after time, he is absolutely misleading the public of Australia. There is another journal issued by the Liberal party in New South Wales and called I'he Fighting Line. I saw a copy of it last week, and as an instance of its absolute unfairness, I may mention that it publishes what the Prime Minister said about the Beef Trust, and about my having blessed the trust, and having had interviews with all its representatives ; but it does not mention a word about the Prime Minister having been compelled to withdraw that statement. It gives the Prime Minister's side of the case, but nothing of what was said on the other side.",55
392,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does The Worker give what is said on this side?,55
393,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So far as I know, The Worker is quite fair. Honourable members opposite doubt that there is much boycotting taking place, and that the Employers Federation asks that men should be boycotted. When the Tariff Commission sat in Melbourne in 1906, one of the witnesses called to give evidence in connection with the confectionery duties was the secretary of the union. He was asked by the honourable member for Capricornia, at that time Senator Higgs (Tariff Commission, Progress Report No. 2, p. 579, q. 7889)Do you find Protectionist confectioners treating their employees well, generally?-As a rule they do, or did, up t ill lately, with one exception.",55
394,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! I am afraid the honourable member is going beyond the scope of. this Bill.,55
395,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I desire to show that boycotting was taking place, and that the Employers Federation was instigating that boycott. If I am not permitted to read that evidence, I will give honorablo members the sense of it .",55
396,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I hope the honourable member will connect his remarks with the subject-matter of the Bill .,56
397,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I will do so. In answer to questions asked, it was stated by the witness that the employers communicated with the various confectioners, some by telephone and others by letter, and that the letter statedI am directed by the executive committee of this Federation to notify you that at the last meeting of the executive a report was received from Messrs. Hoadlcy and Company in connection with a strike taking place in their factory. The writer went on to say that any man who was out on strike in that factory must be boycotted by the other employers, and this particular witness was boycotted for no other reason than that he was secretary of the union and a member of the Wages Board. That letter is signed by Robert Walpole, and was sent from the rooms of the Victorian E m ployers' Federation. I desire to say a word or two now on an article which appeared in the Age of the 21st May, and was headed, "" P u b l i c Service Jobbery."" This article, written by the London correspondent of the Age, refers to a report presented by a Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the method of making appointments to the Public Service of Great Britain , and it shows that, in connection with that Service, preference is given, not to the worker, but to those who hold University degrees. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Because of their qualifications, I presume.",56
398,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall show the reasons. According to this article, the Liberal Government in Great Britain is giving preference to men who are not as good as some of those already in the Service - A system of patronage is in force.",56
399,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is there an education test?,56
400,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No . One has only to be "" a friend of the f a m i l y . """,56
401,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But the honourable member spoke about University qualifications.,56
402,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , and I commend the article to my honourable friend. It states that It was John Bright who described the British Public Service as a gigantic system of out-door relief for the sons of the aristocracy. Matters have improved somewhat since that description was applied; but in spite of reforms, and promises of reforms, political and official patronage is rampant in the British Public Service, and the highly paid posts are still reserved for young men of good families who have been educated at an expensive university. That is the preference which is being given by the Liberal Government of Great Britain , and which was given by its Conservative predecessors.",56
403,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member justif y it?,56
404,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No , I am opposed to it . All permanent appointments to the Public Service should be by examination. In the case of temporary employment-wher e the services of a man are required for a few weeks or months-a n examination is not necessary; but what is done at the Public Service Commissioner's ofiice at the present time? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The question was simply asked, "" A r e you a unionist?""",56
405,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No . Since the present Government have been in power, the question asked is, "" Are you a non-unionist?"" or, "" Have you any friends in the Liberal Ministry?"" If a man has any such friends, he will get employment. If he has not, out he goes ! Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is a wild statement.",56
406,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is absolutely correct'.,56
407,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member knows that it is not correct.,56
408,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"T he present Government would place over the door of the Public Service the notice "" No unionist can enter here."" That is the position which honourable members opposite are taking up. Mr W. H. IRVINE - That is not correct.",56
409,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"T he Government and their supporters would try to destroy the industrial unions, because they say that unionists vote against them. That is the gospel which they preach. Mr W . H . IRVINE - A slander is just as much a slander when it is uttered in a loud and arrogant voice as when it is only whispered.",56
410,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is that so 1,56
411,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When honourable members opposite, talk about Tammany, they deserve to have these things brought home 1 to them. i - - ",56
412,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so. members opposite seem to tliink that they are at liberty to slander the industrial workers as they please, and that no one has a right to expose them. This interesting article in the Age, the whole of which I cannot at present read, continuesAt present the Government Departments are - entirely separate, and in the ordinary - course a civil servant never moves out of the Department to which he was attached when he entered the Service. In two Government Departments, the Board of Education and the Board of AgriCulture, the competitive examination system has been almost entirely ignored.",57
413,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The question of the Public Service of Great Britain is not before the Chair.,57
414,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"T he Government say that they are opposed to preference of any kind. In reply, I am pointing out that their compatriots in Great Britain are giving preference to certain sections of the community in relation to the Public Service. I think that the analogy is a fair one. If the Liberal Government of Great Britain does that sort of thing, it seems to me that the Liberal party here would do the same if they had the chance.",57
415,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am afraid that the analogy' is rather farfetched.,57
416,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I think that it is lutely fair. This article shows that, according to the report of the Commission, there is no examination for admission to Certain"" Departments of the Public Service ofGreat Britain . The Minister , of Trade and Customs has asserted that we, whilst inoffice, made appointments to the Public Service in the same way. That statement is"" absolutely without foundation. Surely I ami n order in pointing out that the Public Service of Great Britainis in a bad w a y j that preference is given to men not because of merit, but because they liappen to be friendly to the Government. Positions are handed down from family to family.",57
417,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member may refer incidentally, by way of illustration, to the Public Service of Great B r it a in ; but I do not think he will be in order in entering upon a detailed consideration of a Service that has norelation whatever to the Public Servioe of the Commonwealth.",57
418,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I said that I did not i tend to quote the whole article; but I desire to make several quotations to show the system of preference that has grown up in Great Britain . Honourable Sir ROBEET BEST - That is what we want to abolish here.,57
419,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What the Liberal party desire to abolish is the little b it of preference that, the unionists received. Honourable members opposite would bring about in Australia the system which, according to the' Age, exists in connection with the Public Service of Great Britain - the system of giving preference to sons of the aristocracy, and to men with U n i versity degrees.",57
420,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There is no patronage here.,57
421,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is not the right honourable member's faul t that there is none.,57
422,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We do not want any. We passed the Public Service Act .,57
423,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But there happened to be behind the Liberal Government which passed it a sufficient number of members of the Labour party to shape it properly.,57
424,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Labour party was not then so numerous as it is today.,57
425,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We succeeded in making provision in spite of the Liberal Government for the payment of a minimum wage.,57
426,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The - Labour party held abso- the balance of power at that time.,57
427,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We did , and the Liberal Government then in power were compelled to amend the provisions of the Bill respecting, temporary and permanent employees of the Service in a direction that somemembers of their party did not desire. I regard, political patronage as an evil, whether itbe applied to permanent or temporary appointments to the Service. But I do not think it right that honourable members opposite should seek to disguise their real intentions by saying that they wish, to carry this Bill in order to abolishpolitical patronage: If fchere was any evil-and I do not admit that there was-in the system of granting preference tb unionists,, other things being equal', in . respect to temporary employment in the Government service, that system has been abolished by the present Administration, and therefore the Bill is unnecessary.. The honourable member for Cook h'as been good enough to supply me with' several references to'support my conn - tention that in connection with the various public works that are now going on we' did not make any appointment und'er the Public Service' Act, I would point out fchafc under section 16 of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Aot 1911, which w© passed, it is provided thatThe Minister ' may appoint, for any period not exceeding six months beyond the date on which the line shall be declared open for traffic, all such officers as he thinks necessary for the purposes of the construction or working of the railway, and may authorize the employment of any persons for those purposes. How can it be said, then, that any appointments in connection with that work were made under the Public Service Act ? Appointments made under that Act were absolutely independent of the Public Service Commissioner. Then, again, section 9 of the Seat of Government Act provides thatiThe Governor General may appoint such magistrates and officers as are necessary to execute the laws of the Territory and provide for the administration of justice thereunder. All such appointments, therefore, are outside the Public Service Act, TJnder section 12 of that Act it is provided further that(1) Until the Parliament makes other provision for the government of the Territory, the Governor General may make Ordinances having the force of law in the Territory. (2) Every such Ordinance shall(a) he notified in the Gazette; (li) take effect from the date of notification, or from a later date to fied in the Ordinance; (c) be laid before both Houses of the Parliament witliin thirty days of the making thereof, or, if the Parliament is not then sitting, within thirty days after the next meeting of the Parliament. TJnder that Act the Government have already appointed Colonel Miller to th© position of Administrator of the Territory. Again, under section 4 of the Northern Territory Administration Act 1910, it is provided thatThe Governor General may appoint, or may delegate 'to the Minister or the Administrator power to appoint, such officers ns arc necessary for the administration of the Northern Territory Acceptance Act 1910 or this Act or for the proper government of the Territory. It must be seen that appointments made under these Acts were not to the Public Service, nor through the Public Service Commissioner, although the Minister of Trade and Customs, in his article in The Liberal, declared that they were. Government and their supporters object to preference to unionists because they say that the unions are becoming more and more political in their organization. Th«y also urge that the reason why they object to unions, as some of them undoubtedly do, is that union officials fo ment strife. This is an absolute misstatement. I speak from a fair ly extensive knowledge of trade unions and trade union officials, not only ihere, but in other countries, and I say unhesitatingly that I have never known an industrial dispute to ""be brought about by union officials. They invariably fight right up to the finish for industrial peace. It often happens that perhaps nine-tenths of the members of the organization concerned are in favour of taking extreme action long before the officials are prepared to do so. The officials are practically advocating, all the time, the settlement of disputes by peaceful methods, and it is absolutely incorrect to say that trade union organizers or officials foment strife. The present Prim© Minister can verify my statement that they do their utmost to maintain industrial peace. The article on Public Service jobbery in. Great Britain goes on to say that menoften draw two salaries, as secretary and as clerk; that there is no entrance examination ; and that for four men who have come up from other branches of the service into the administrative branch there are twenfy-five who were appointed be be specicause tliey were university graduates. These have been put over the heads of others who have forgotten more about .the departmental work than they were ever likely to know. That"" is what is happening under a Liberal Ministry. The measure that we are discussing has not been introduced to prohibit preference to unionists, because Ministers admit that they have already prohibited preference, and have stated that should the Labour Government return to power .there will be no preference. They have said that they will not have work done by day labour if they can get it done by contract, even though they may have to pay the contractor 40 or 50 per cent. mor,e than will have to be paid under the day labour system.",57
428,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,When did we say that?,58
429,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is, in effect, what The honourable members opposite say. At Ballarat, the lowest tender for the construction of the telephone tunnels was nearly 50 per cent, more than it cost to construct them by day labour. Their own engineers declare that the workcould be done more cheaply with day labour. Are Ministers using contractors to drive the men harder than they would be driven by Government overseers, and harder than they have any right to be driven % Under these circumstances, what need is there for the Bill? This legislation has been introduced because, as the Minister of Trade and Customs has admitted, the unions are beginning to concern themselves more and more with politics. At one time honourable members opposite could fool them by saying, "" Vote for us; we will give you as much as the Labour party can give you."" The unions are devoting themselves more and more to political action, and I am glad of it. An appeal to the people will produce no settlement, because parties are evenly divided. Some persons ask why should there be this wrangling in Parliament; but would there be any less if there were 37 Liberals in opposition and 38 Labour men, including the Speaker, in power ? I remember the long speeches that were delivered by members of the present Liberal party when in opposition, some of them occupying five and six hours, there being' nothing then in the Standing Orders to limit them.",58
430,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is unfair after the way we helped you. We criticised each Bill, and did our best to make it a good measure.",59
431,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Minister must be talking in his sleep. There were some Bills which honourable members did not ""stone-wall"" as much as they ""stonewalled "" other Bills; but generally speaking, they were prepared to "" stone-wall"" to the uttermost until they found that the public were in favour of our proposals. We were told that our measures would be swept out of existence. Why does not the Government propose to repeal some of them, such as the Land Tax Act, or the Invalid Pensions Act?",59
432,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not discussing the Bill.,59
433,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The object of the Bill is to bring about a double dissolution. If honourable members opposite wish to bring about a double dissolution by having a contest with the Senate, why do they not deal vitally with the question of preference to unionists by attacking it in the arbitration law, or why do they not try to repeal some other important measure passed by the Labour party? I shall be glad to fight the Ministry on the proposal before us. The fairest way to settle the question of preference to unionists is to have a. referendum on it. This will not be the last time that we shall have an opportunity to deal with it in this Chamber. I hope that on the next occasion honourable members opposite, instead of remaining quiet, will endeavour to show what are the evils that preference would create. ,",59
434,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"(Darlin g Downs-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [9.37] - The honourable member for Yarra, like others of his party, is quick to seize hold of some isolated word or phrase in an article, and declare that there has been gross misrepresentation of the Labour party. That party has never yet been defeated without attributing its defeat to so-called lying statements, misrepresentations, and extravagant assertions. The article in The Liberal, to which he referred, consists of extracts from a speech delivered by me in this Chamber last year, when this Bill was before us. The honourable member declares that I alleged that the Executive minute of the Labour party regarding appointments applied to appointments to the permanent employments in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. This article does not say that it so applied, and I did not say so. Had the honourable member read the heading and introduction of the article, he would have seen to what it was stated to apply. Mr J. H. CATTS - We should have a quorum to hear this highly intelligent speech. [Quorum formed.]",59
435,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was pointing out that if the honourable member for Yarra had only read the reprint of the speech he would have seen that ray remarks had reference to the Bill which is before the House tonight, and which is the same Bill as was before the House last session. The measure deals distinctively with "" employment by the Commonwealth or any Department or authority there for."" The argument which I addressed to honourable members last session was founded upon the evil of which honourable members opposite had been guilty-that of giving preference in the matter of Government employment. I never said, nor does the reprint, that the Labour Government's minute applied to permanent positions in the Public Service. If anybody has been guilty of misrepresentation it is the lionorable member for Yarra, who endeavoured to make it appear that my remarks had reference to the permanent employees of our Public Service.",59
436,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! I can scarcely hear the honourable member owing to the conversation that is proceeding in all parts of the House.,60
437,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Yarra has himself been guilty of misrepresentation in respect of his own position. He has attempted to make the public believe by his statement this evening that the minute of the honourable member for Darwin did not apply to any person in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, it applied to all who are in the temporary service of the Commonwealth.",60

441,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the Minister say that preference was operative in that case?,60
442,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I say that honourable members opposite intended their Executive minute to apply to temporary employees under the Public Service Act .,60
443,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,No .,60

445,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will the Minister cite one case ?,60
446,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I will presently. The' Executive minute applied to those persons in the Public Service who weretemporarily employed there. In addition,, it applied fco all those officers who had been appointed to the Federal Territory , to exempt officers, to all who are being employed on the transcontinental railway,and I gather from the honourable member for Y a r r a that it also applied to persons employed by the Government in theNorthern Territory.",60

This approval has been given on the understanding that you arc a member of a recognised union. If you are not, it will benecessary for you to take steps to join at once, otherwise the agreement lapses. Yet we have been told that, other things being equal, the best man would be preferred. The honourable member for Barrier, when he received applications for Hieoffice of surveyor, selected the man whoappeared to be the best tor the job. Then he turned round and said, "" You can only have that job if you are a member of a union."" I would like to know of a single case in which other things were found to be equal.

464,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am dealing with a question that I asked the Minister, and that has never been answered. I asked the Minister in charge of the Home A f fairs Department several days in succession whether he would place a copy of the agreement on the table. orable gentleman-the honourable member for Wentworth-firs t said he would lay the papers on the table, although he denied the correctness of my statement so far as preference to unionists was concerned. A couple of days afterwards I asked him whether he had yet placed the agreement on the table so that honourable members might see for themselves - if the statement was correct. The Minister said he was going to do it , but that it took a day for the typists in his office to type it out. I asked him the question again today, and he told me across the table that he would show me the agreement privately.",62

466,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Whether it is signed or not, the Government have entered into it , and are bound by it . It provides for a certain increased rate of pay applicable only to members of the union. Mr W . H . IRVINE - What is wrong with that?",62
467,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Everything is right with it , but no man can get work on' that job at that rate of pay unless he belongs to that union. ' He must, therefore, join the union. That is not only preference, but compulsory unionism, the very strongest form of preference. It is not a question tliere of the unionist getting preference, other things being equal, because the Government have actually made an agreement with the union pro- which will not operate as regards persons who are not members of the union. I agree with that, because I believe in preference to unionists, but surely the Government cannot honestly talk about abolishing preference, other things being equal, and in the next breath grant preference.",62

469,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not. Surely the fact that there is a Bill dealing with the broad question of preference before the House does not prohibit me from discussing the terms of work on the transAustralian railway ? I "" contend that I am entitled to discuss the progress of that work at all times. Apart from this Bill , the Government stated twelve months ago that they had abolished preference to unionists, and The hon- there is a b it of shuffling going on. If the agreement does not bear the interpretation that has been placed upon it , why does the Attorney-General not place it on the table and let members draw their own conclusions? If that is not done, the only inference is that it will bear the construction I have placed upon it . Personally, I do not desire to see the agreement, because I am satisfied with the record in the daily press; but it ought to be a document accessible to honourable members and the public generally. Will the Attorney-General confer with his colleagues and see whether the agreement cannot be placed on the table ? Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) not [10.2] - This morning the Prime Minister did not answer, a question of mine, and now I have to occupy a little time. W it h me it is a serious question whether Parliament is going to abrogate its right to handle the finances of the country and give them over to a. M i l it a r y Board. I know this country is not one which relies on itself, bub is always ready to swallow anything a gentleman in gold braid from a foreign country may tell it ; and the proposal to hand over the finances in the way I have mentioned has been made by the overseas Inspector-General. I am afraid that the Government may commit themselves before this House has an opportunity to interfere, and, therefore, I am now entering ray protest. If the Government agrees to hand over the finances in the way proposed there will be a line of demarcation drawn in this House, and the weaklings will be forced on one side and the strong men on the other-the latter determined to stand by the rights of the House to finance this country independent of the military gentlemen. These gilt-spurred roosters are as destitute of business capacity as a bird is of hairs. I warn the Prime Minister to take no chances, but to decline to hand over the finances to gentlemen who are so ready to shovel the money out. The time has come to cut down the defence expenditure, and to devise a defence system by means of aerial navigation. The other day I called attention to the fact that an ordinary American, in an ordinary airship, had forced a Mexican war vessel to sea; and I truly believe that a dozen such Americans could defend this country.",62
470,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Capricornia) [10.4] - I desire to utter a word of warning to the Minister of Trade and Customs. To-day I asked when the Customs staff were instructed to prepare a list of Tariff anomainstance, a Tariff Bill. lies, and the Minister replied that shortly after he took office he gave the instructions for such a list, and that it would be produced "" when the time is ripe."" I draw the attention of t]ie Protectionists of Victoria, and Australia generally, to the fact that the Tariff anomalies seem to have been under the observation of the Minister for some twelve months, and that, according to his statement today, there is no intention whatever on the part of the Government to deal with them this year. What is the meaning of "" when the time is ripe""? Does it mean after the double dissolution which the Attorney General so frequently in public says his desire to obtain?",63
471,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We think on this side that a double dissolution would be a good way of getting rid of an anomaly.,63
472,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That joke of the Attorney-General's will not satisfy the Protectionists of Victoria. I remember the time when the honourable gentleman was deemed to be pretty well a Free Trader or a Revenue Tariffist; certainly not a Protectionist. Australia is, or ought to be, Protectionist, and the Government would spend the time a great deal more profitably in dealing with Tariff anomalies than in waiting for the report of the Inter-State Commission and dealing with other subjects that I am not now permitted to name. I deem it my duty to protest against the delay, and I hope the Protectionist journals of Australia will note that the Minister gave his instructions to the staff twelve months ago. Although our Customs officers are, I suppose, as expert as those in any part of the world, that list has not yet been produced, though I am sure that if the Minister were to ask for it tomorrow it would be supplied.",63
473,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Melbourne) [10.7] The abolition of private members' business must be my excuse for expressing the hope that the Government will give the House an opportunity to deal with the question of the referendum and the initiative. Instead of having the control of. Parliament for only one day in three years, the people ought to have control the whole of the time. With the referendum and the initiative we might have elective Ministries, and insist on this or any other Government bringing in, for The method chosen to deal with the Tariff is too ridiculous to mention. The Inter-State Commission consists of three members, one of whom was too mean and contemptible to accept the office of Judge of the High Court of Australia.",63
474,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,63
475,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I resent that gentleman's conduct strongly. When th© barristers' union outside squealed and almost declared that he had not brainsenough to be a High Court Judge, he resigned, and then the Government appointed him to the Inter-State Commission. One witty German has said that if the world had been placed in the hands of it is a Commission ib would never have been built; and I do not think that we shall have a Tariff presented in two years if the Commission is permitted to go fooling about the country in the way it is now doing. Why should not, say, ten items be selecbed for Parliamenb to deal with ? I give credit to the Customs official who was appointed to the Inter-State Commission. He certainly does know his work; but as a Government official he has never declared himself either a Free Trader or a Protectionist, and. in that he is perfectly right. Mr Swinburne is a persona] friend of mine, but in politics I have no friendship. Did Mr Swinburne ever declare himself a stalwart Protectionist? Then we have - the legal element, which talks according to the way in which it is fee'd. Lawyers do not care ahout justice, but wish 'to win by points; and, of course, .the Minister of Trade and Customs has brought to bear upon the question all his capacity for legal twisting. If the people outside had the privilege of using the initiative and referendum, they would say, "" Bring in a Tariff at once "" ; and that is why I put in my protest. I do not usually Bpeak on motions for the adjournment of the House; but I have no other opportunity of dealing with this matter; and if the Government refuse to give the people the right to use the initiative and referendum, I shall accuse them of being afraid to face its consequences. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.11 p.m.",63
