1,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"In its report of our proceedings of yesterday, the Age publishes the statement that when the honourable member for Hunter was referring ito the oharges recently made by Senator Watson, I interjected that the honourable member for Perth had gone outside to make similar charges, and that when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports took exception to that remark, I said that he went to the Supreme Court to make his charges. What I said was that the honourable member for Perth went outside and made his charges from a public platform . He did that, and in fairness to him I have endeavoured to make the matter clear.  in the press to have said-that no colonial bags have been accepted' by the Wheat Board. The correspondence led me i o that conclusion,, but I find that the facts are that the Board rejected one particular sample of Australian-made bags. I have no desire to injure the local manufacturers of bags; and I wish, therefore, to make the statement that there are locally-made bags which are accepted by 'the Wheat Board. MALTESE IMMIGRANTS . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Is Minister for the Navy in a position to give the House any information ing the detention of Maltese in Sydney, in the face of the facts that some one haa undertaken to find employment for them, and that every one of them is already a unionist and prepared to join the unions of this country 1",4
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have not heard anything during the last few hours, but I have every hope that the matter will be satisfactorily settled. [402]",4
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In reply to a question on this subject yesterday, I stated that I had asked for certain assurances from the reverend gentleman who is acting for the Maltese. I have since received those assurances in writing, and propose to act on them. The men will only be released as employment is found for them, and on the definite understanding that they join the unions as soon as they have sufficient money to pay their subscriptions. Each, application for release of the men will be accompanied by a guarantee from Father Bonett that these conditions are complied BAGS. with .

5,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,No . CENSOBSHIP.,4
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for the Navy whether the same conditions of censorship in relation to political matters will prevail during the forthcoming electiorl campaign as prevailed during the referendum campaign. I understand that the censorship regulations have been amended, and that the newspapers are not now allowed to publish statements which they could have published during the referendum campaign?",4
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So far as I know, there have been no changes of any' kind. My own feeling is that the censorship should not affect political discussion the so far. as it consists of ordinary comment on matters of administration and other regard- matters unrelated to the war.",4
8,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether the regulations affecting the censorship of newspapers have been altered since the referendum campaign. Will the right honourable gentleman see that the same conditions operate during the forthcoming electoral campaign as operated during the referendum campaign, and that the newspapers shall not be prohibited from publishing comment on matters of policy generally? I understand that an agreement was made between the Prime Minister and representatives of Now South Wales newspapers, and that since the referendum campaign the regulations have been amended.",4
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have no knowledge whatever that the conditions of the censorship have been amended as the honourable gentleman suggests. I will state what I do know. The only censorship upon political criticism was imposed as the result of a discussion which took place in another place at which the honourable member for Y a r ra w a j present, and at which I stated that, for the time being, I did not propose to allow criticism in regard to a certain matter. Eor the moment I cannot remember what it was.",5
10,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It was the general situation.,5
11,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It had something to do with my going round to the various organizations. The press made a considerable hubbub about this, and no doubt the censors interpreted the instruction very, widely, and excised things which it was not intended should be covered by that instruction. A f t e r that I saw the press representatives both here and in Sydney. I said that they were as free to speak about political matters as they ever had been. So far as I know nothing has since been done which in any way limits their powers of political criticism. I speak only fro m my own knowledge, of course, and, so far as I know, no change has been made since I spoke to the representatives of the press.",5
12,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If I show the right honourable gentleman how the arrangement has been altered., will he see that the first instruction is adhered to?",5
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I will . I should like to know how the instructions came to be altered. I have been reading the newspapers during the last few. days, and if they have been altered, by heavens, they have not been altered in the way I would have liked to alter them.. NA Mr RICHARD FOSTfcft - Has Postmaster-General any information give to the House .witli respeot to the alleged theft of mails from the",5
14,Mr WEBSTER,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"It has come to my knowledge that there has been an attempt to rob the mail that was being carried by the Indarra. I shall read the following telegram I have received, so that honourable members may be informed of the facts: On receipt at this office this morning of mails from Eastern States, per Indarra, it was found that seals had been tampered with and registered letter bags from Melbourne and Sydney . ripped open, and in many instances . rifled. Ordinary correspondnee .apparently untouched. Man suspected being implioated robbery now in enstody. Arrested at Albany. Found secreted in hamper landed on - jetty from Indarra, having with him bag containing jewellery. I might say that the man was . hidden in a commercial traveller's hamper when he waa caught.",5
15,Mr RILEY,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,Does he belong to the Commercial Travellers' Club?,5
16,Mr WEBSTER,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I would not utter such a libel upon any reputable institution. The interjection will show the irresponsibility of some people. The telegram continuesPolice also arrested supposed confederate at Mount Barker. Ascertained today door ship's mail-room, which had been locked, but not secured with iron bar in usual way, had been prized open. Police making full investigation, and inventory now being prepared of missing contents, registered articles at this office. Full report will follow early as possible. Am notifying agents A.US.N. Co. of their liability - LLOYD . I might be allowed to add a word or two. Serious allegations have been made in the press with regard to missing mails in Sydney. The allegations have been not only that the mails have been interfered with for three or fou r months, but that this has been the outcome of in efficient supervision. I wish to say, first of all, that the general allegation with regard to Sydney' mails being interfered with is not correct. There has been a registered mail bag removed and another put into its place, quite recently, in transit from the General Post-office to the Central Office. These things are occurring, not fro m any lack of supervision, but from the difficulty we have in these times of war in finding men of equal probity to take the place of those who have gone to fight our battles. Do what "" INDARRA."" we will , and exercise all the precautions the we may to Mr MAHONY - That is a very insulting remark concerning the people here. Indarra! Mr Webster - It iB a fact all the same. Although the great bulk of the men are giving good and honest service, honourable members will recognise that it requires only a few of a particular kind to get into the service of the Post Office to cause a lot of trouble to the people of this country. I did not, by the remark I made, to which the honourable member for Dalley has taken exception, cast any aspersion upon the general body of men engaged in the Post Office, though the honourable member would try to suggest that they are all implicated in that remark.",5
17,Mr MAHONY,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,The honourable gentleman made a very wide statement.,6
18,Mr WEBSTER,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I made the remark to suggest the great difficulty we have today in rendering to the public the service we have been able to give in the Post Office. I am glad to make this statement for the information of the House and the country. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE 'S Sir, INVESTIGATIONS.",6
19,Mr RILEY,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"In response to the rebeginning quest made yesterday by the honourable member for Wentworth for information recruiting. as to the total estimated cost of the i quiry regarding various works, I lay estimate on the table on behalf of the Standing Committee on Public Works. CENSORSHIP.",6
20,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"Following up my question with respect to the censorship, I handed the matter, on which I based the question, to the Prime Minister, and he has suggested that I refer to it publicly by a further question so that he may have an (Opportunity to deal with it through the columns of Hansard. The following paragraph appeared in the Bulletin of the 22nd February last:Another instance of the awful Defence Department's efforts to help voluntary recruiting :My youngest brother enlisted in the 4th Battalion, and was killed at Gallipoli between 6th and Oth August, 1915. Before leaving he, no doubt thinking I could best attend to his business, nominnted me as next of kin, although he bad ft wife and two children. On receipt of the advice of his death I made application for a pension for his widow, and after some delay, which was quite warranted under the circumstances, I got it fixed up. I also made application on behalf of the widow for the balance of his military pay, and wrote perhaps twenty times about it. A little over a year after his death-in September, 1916- 1 got the form which I enclose. I wrote at once pointing out that, for some unknown reason, [402]- 2 the form asked me to declare that I was the father of the deceased, ana I pointed out that I had a year previously established the identity of a widow and children. I again, however, gave them all addresses, cartificates, & c , that bad been required previously. This simple matter appears to have produced chaos in the Department, as up to date (12th February) nothing further has been beard of the matter, except that a month ago it local sub-inspector of police called and produced forty folios of correspondence between the Military Department and almost every police officer in Tasmania. He asked me to add a few marginal notes to the huge collection he had, which I did. It is now eighteen months since my brother was killed. His widow is still waiting for the unpaid wages that were to his credit when he died. The amount is admitted to be £60 Is. 4d. Following the publication of that paragraph the following correspondence took place:Censorship Office, Sydney, 2nd March, 1917. The Editor of the Bulletin. Your attention is directed to' a paragraph published in the Bulletin, 22nd February, and "" Another instance of the awful Defence Department's efforts to help voluntary . . . "" I am to inform you thai such articles are prejudicial to recruiting. n - They should be submitted for investigation the before they are published - I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, C. G. NICHOLSON, Censor. To the Censor, Sydney. Dear Sir, An agreement was entered into between the Bulletin, and other Sydney newspapers, on the one side and the Prime Minister on the other, that paragraphs of the kind you allude to in yours of 2nd March were not to be subject to censorship. I should be glad to bp informed whether the Prime Minister proposes to break this agreement. As your letter is not marked confidential I propose to publish this correspondence. Yours faithfully, S. H. PRIOR, Editor. Censorship Office, Sydney, 3rd March. Editor, the Bulletin. Sir,- I have received your letter of today, and beg to inform you (1) that the agreement to which you refer was in force only during the period of the referendum, and (2) that it did not at any time affect the operation of the War Precautions Regulations. The publication of the matter to which my C.S. 19,231 drew your attention is prohibited by War Precaution Regulation 28. The publication of my C.S. 19,231, and of any statement to the effect that publication of any matter has been forbidden is prohibited, and would constitute an offence under War Precaution Regulation 28c. I am, &c., C. G. NICHOLSON, Censor. A reply was sent by the editor of the Bulletin, but I do not propose to read it .",6
21,Mr WEBSTER,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,Why not?,7
22,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I do not mind doing so, but it will serve no purpose to do so. Apparently some alteration has been made, or the censor in Sydnf y isof that opinion. I ask the Prime Minister if an alteration has been made, and, if so, whether he will have the old conditions restored ?",7
23,Mr HUGHES,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I understand what the' honourable member's were aimed at. I take it that at the most the censorship referred to is directed to matters relating to military tration. It is not suggested that there is anylimitation of political criticism as such. That is what I said just now. But I have glanced at the papers which the honourable member has handed to me, and I think that he should have read the final letter from the editor of the Bulletin to the censor. What is said in that letter is' scandalous. It shows the type of man that he is. I knew nothing of this matter-I would not have asked the honourable member to read the correspondence if I had known 'anything at all about it. This is what this man has said- > Dear Sir,- I have your memo, of this date. The agreement was not made for the period of the referendum campaign, and if the Prime Minister says it was he is merely a liar. I shall be glad to be informed if it is an offence to have this correspondence read in the Senate. That is an unprovoked and scandalous thing for this man to say about me, and my conduct in the Chamber today is an ample refutation of his .statement. I know no more of this matter than the man in the moon.",7
24,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,I have not said that you did.,7
25,Mr HUGHES,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"It is a shame. have been hounded down from one end of the country to the other. This paper is notoriously bending its every effort to denounce me at every conceivable opportunity, and for this man, under cover of this correspondence, to make the statement he has made concerning me is absolutely intolerable. Every honourable member opposite knows that the censorship regulations were imposed during the heat of the referendum campaign for one purpose. I was going round to the various organizations, and while there was a hope of-reconciliation and of our working together again it was the practically unanimous wish of the united Labour party in this Parliament that there should be no publicity given to the negotiations that were in progress. The Bulletin at the time published a leader full of the most venomous and vile abuse of me. The article was brought to me. It had to go out under the censorship regulations, and the censor had struck it out, but though it absolutely reeked of venom, I said, now "" Let it go,"" and it was published. Of remarks course, I had the power under the regulations to stop it ; in fact, I could bave said nothing at all, and simply let the adminis- censor strike it out. But the letter that I have just read is too much altogether.",7
26,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I asked the question in good faith, and I did not read the letter to which exception has been taken. I passed the correspondence over to the Prime Minister, but I admit that he had not the time to read it at that particular moment.",7
27,Mr HUGHES,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,I did not read it .,7
28,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"The Prime Minister passed the papers back and said that I had better read the correspondence. I did not read it for the purpose of injur-, ing the right honourable gentleman. No one can say that I have ever attacked him except in a fair way. 1I have disagreed from him, but I do not carry that disagreement any further. In regard to the censorship I do think that we are not entitled to censor such matters.",7
29,Mr HUGHES,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,Does the Leader of the Opposition say now that the tone of the letter is excusable in any sense?,7
30,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"No; but I consider that the whole of the correspondence, with, perhaps, the exception of the letter referred to, should appear in Hansard.",7
31,Mr HUGHES,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I maintain that the whole of the correspondence should be I printed, so that the people may know what kind of person this man is.",7
32,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I am not particular. I simply object to this kind of newspaper censorship. I have never previously taken exception to the exercise of the censorship, although I have felt very keenly upon it . I hope that this is not to be the type of censorship to prevail during the election campaign.",7
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,Order !,7
34,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I do not propose to debate the matter further. If we wish to do so we can do it on an adjournment motion or on Supply. Although we disagree, we wish to conduct the fight fairly, but there must be no favouring of one side while restrictions are imposed on the other.",7
35,Mr HUGHES,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,Did I not keep my word that people could say what they liked on the referendum campaign? I do not seek favours from any one.,8
36,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,Neithe r do I . simply ask that the same conditions may prevail during the elections. I ask for our party just the same treatment as is to be extended to any other party. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. PRISONERS OF WAR .,8
37,Mr CHARLTON,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I wish to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I direct his attention to the following paragraph, which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on the 19th February:  his relatives who was a prisoner of war in Germany. A letter was received from the military authorities to the effect that the lad had been killed, but two days afterwards a letter came from the lad himself, stating that he was in Germany. The military authorities were advised to that effect, and they asked that the letter be forwarded to them. That'was done seven months ago, and a reply was received two days ago that the boy's pay would go on. He thought there was a lot the military authorities could do to improve matters. In view of the statements contained in that paragraph, I ask whether steps will be taken to see that matters like this are expedited. I quite realise that mistakes may be made, but there appears to be no excuse why hardship should be imposed on the recipients of soldiers' pay when seven months are occupied in ascertaining the facts and making them known to the people concerned.",8
38,Mr GROOM,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I can promise the honourable member that everything will be done at this end to expedite the making of these inquiries. Of course, the honourable member can see that the delay may have occurred at the other end, b ut even in that respect he is justified in asking that representations may be made to see whether these matters cannot be expedited across the seas. SCARCIT Y OF SHIPPING .  the whole of the shipping is held up on the east coast of America owing to the datids. submarine scare, would the Prime M in ister see if arrangements can be made with American ship-owners to send their boats to Australia to load our wlieat and wool that has accumulated here in big quantities? These vessels could go across the Pacific and through the Panama Canal, and land our produce at one of the ports on the seaboard, so that there I would be only a short distance to transport it to the Old Country. An y arrangement in that direction would relieve the pressure here, and at the same time provide freights for American shipping.",8
39,Mr HUGHES,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"I am afraid the honourable member's proposal is not practicable. W h at we have to do is to take wool and wheat not to America, but to England. ",8
40,Mr HUGHES,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"It is the other half that is the trouble. It is like making a charge-the first half mile is nothing; the last 100 yards is bell. The fact is that there is a blockade, and we have to run it . The nearer we get to Great B r i tain the harder it is to get through. I am afraid there is no way round this business. I wish there was. MEAT FOR TRANSPORTS.",8
41,Mr FINLAYSON,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"In the Age report of the proceedings of the House yesterday it is stated that when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports complained that the meat supplied to the transports was rotten, the - honourable member for Denison interjected that it was meat supplied by the Labour Government in Queensland. I know that is a misreport, and therefore call attention to it . I wish to ask the Minister for the Navy if the report is correct, and whether any meat supplied to the transports by the Queensland Government has been inferior or condemned for any reason whatever?",8
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"It is quite untrue to say that rotten meat has been supplied to tEe boats. It is a great pity that in discussing these matters that affect the business honesty and integr it y of our community, we could not be a little more careful in the way we put these things. As I said yesterday, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Melbourne, the facts were that a certain amount of meat had been supplied - ove r nine"" months ago-chiefl y ox livers and the like, affected with fluke and hy",8
43,Mr LIVINGSTON,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,I never heard of ox livers affected with fluke.,9

46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"Then probably it was sheep's livers. There were three shipments of meat-no t a great quantity. I think in one case 1,100 lbs. was supplied, and about 5 per cent, of it . was found to be infected.",9

53,Mr TUDOR,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,They deny it .,9
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"They may deny it, but the fact is that this meat came from the abattoirs somewhere, and passed some responsible inspection. my honourable friends have any case which they can prove as to the mala fides tliese men, why do they not bring i along? Why do they keep saying these to the men. things ? I am as anxious as they are hunt out wrongdoing, but it is wrong condemn the contractors for things for which they are not responsible.",9

69,Mr LAIRD SMITH,THEFT OF MAILSFROM,"B y way of personal explanation I would state that I was in attendance at the House last night when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was making a charge about the inferior meat supplied to the troops going fro m Australia. Prom his remarks one would infer that the whole of the had meat supplied to our men was rotten. If During the time. I was Assistant Minister for Defence I had the opportunity of seeof ing the meat at one camp, and no one t could wish to see better meat served out I was also aware of the to fact that most of the meat supplied to to our men was obtained from Queenslandi t is frozen meat, and so far as I could learn it was of excellent quality. Wishing to emphasise that the meat was good, I interjected to the honourable member last night: "" Is it not supplied by the o Labour Government in Queensland?"" From the information given this morning, we know that the meat supplied is of excellent quality; and it is wrong for any honourable member to say that it is rotten. ELECTIONS : FREEDOM OF",9

Whether the Minister will furnish to the House before the dissolution a list of persons of Australian birth who are now interned in German concentration camps ? 2. Will he state whether any petitions have been received from those persons ? 3. Whether he proposes to hold any further inquiry into the circumstances in which they have been detained?",11
80,Mr GROOM,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is not desirable in the public interest that the information should be given. 2. Petitions have been received from a number of these persons. 3. All such persons have been detained after full consideration of each case by the Minister and the Cabinet. In some cases magisterial inquiries have been held. Decision as to further inquiries will be determined by the merits and circumstances of each case. ELECTORAL (WAR - TIM E) BILL.,11

I desire to inform honourable members that this measure is now being printed, and that an advance copy will be available, I hope, in about an hour. What I propose to do, with the consent of the Leader of the Opposition, is to supply him with a copy. That is all I can do at present. The honourable member will then be able to discuss the Bill with his friends, and the measure will come on for consideration at the earliest, possible moment next week. I may add that we have not yet had an opportunity of caref u l ly scrutinizing the Bill , so that it must not be regarded as definitely and finally the best that can be evolved, but it is the best that can be formulated in the circumstances.",11

85,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Dampier) [11.231 The honourable member for Kalgoorlie last night twitted the Treasurer in regard to a motion which appears upon the business-paper dealing with preference to unionists in our Public Service. I was rather surprised that he should draw such pointed attention to the attitude of the right honourable. gentleman, in view of the fact that when he himself joined one of the most extreme Protectionist Ministries in the Commonwealth, his previous Pree Trade protestations made very little difference to the support which he accorded that Administration. I may tell the honourable member, however, that if the Treasurer does not proceed with the motion in question there are other honourable members on this side of the chamber who will not hesitate to press it. There is no greater disgrace to Australia than the prefereuce which is accorded to unionists, so far as temporary employment in our Public Service is concerned. It is degrading and immoral. I believe that the admission made by the Postmaster-General today is directly due to the fact that the heads of Departments have not the control over their subordinates which they should be able to exercise. Doubtless they get a number of good'men, but they also get a proportion of ""scallywags,"" who ought never to be there. We have only to imagine ' the position prevailing in the Defence Department today to realise what a disgrace preference to unionists means. When that Department requires clerical assistance it cannot obtain it from the Returned Soldiers Association-it has to go to the Clerks Union, to Mr Eatz, the secretary of that organization, which, honourable members will recollect, sent to Mr Fisher, when he was Prime Minister, the most disloyal resolution that has ever been carried in Australia. That resolution affirmed that those who had gone to the front had only done so because of empty bellies. This Mr Katz, I understand, is now opposing the honourable member for Maribyrnong in the pre-selection ballot. If the Governmenb are worth their salt, they will immediately withdraw the objectionable regulation granting preference to unionists in the Public Service. I do not think that that regulation would ever have been promulgated but for the honourable member for Darwin. I do not believe that Mr Fisher or the other members of his Cabinet desired it .",11

I hope that whilst the war is in progress he will not allow young men to be brought into his Department, but that he wil l get women and girls to do the work.",12

89,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports had a good deal to say last night in regard to the treatment of our returned soldiers. He professes to believe in this war, and says thab he has done his best to induce many persons to enlist. But after his deliverance of last evening, and his speech at Ballarat, can we believe that he is in . earnest on this question ? Evidently he does not mind asking one section of the people to volunteer for service abroad",12

But since the disruption of the Labour party there is no charge too bitter to be levelled by honourable members opposite against their former colleagues. Is it fair that a new Administration should be charged with all these shortcomings 1 In regard to the accusation that rotten meat was supplied to our troops on board a transport, I would point out that it was supplied by a Labour Government in Queensland. But I do not believe that rotten meat was wilfully supplied. I cannot credit that the Queensland Government would wittingly provide bad meat for our troops. It is quite possible, we know, for meat to We must not forget the difficulties under which work is being cairied on at the present time, and especially the difficulties in regard to transOnly last Sunday in my own home in Melbourne we had to throw out a, joint because it was tainted.",12

The Treasurer's financial statement must convince any one that we and cannot go on as we have been doing.",13
112,Mr MATHEWS,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,We want a few more amongst thousand out of work !,13
113,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I have here figures showing that in 1914-15 the States boremrowed £22,000,000. All that money prois being expended here. The growth of national debt has been abnormal during the last five years. The public and debt of the States is £350,000,000, to are which we have to add £159,000,000, representing the indebtedness of the Com40 monwealth. Despite this vast expendidisture of public money during the last few years, and notwithstanding that 300,000 of our men are away at the front, we find that there is unemployment in Australia; we have honourable members coming here and talking about starvation, and about men having to leave work. Is it not discreditable that this should be the position after the expenditure of all this borrowed money? The fact is that this Parliament has been the enemy of the primary producer. It has done everything possible to cripple the man who is prepared to put his money into industry. In the very near futur e we must give greater encouragement to the building up of our primary industries: otherwise no one can say what will happen. direct taxation is £7,600,000 a year. The taxation from Customs £16,600,000, or a total of £24,000,000 in the Commonwealth' alone; not taking into account the State taxation, and representing nearly £ 5 10s. per head for every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. It is enormous, and if on top of this we have to make provision for repatriation, and for the increased in - being made. terest and sinking f u n d on further loans that will have, to be raised for the will probably run us into another cou,ple of millions of pounds a year. We must therefore t ry to put a stop to the extravagance that is going on. Let us look at what is being done at the Flinders Naval Base. Admiral Henderson reported that this was suitable as a small sub-base for repairing submarines, but now it is being formed into a training establishment. I do not know what the expenditure has been up to the present, but I do know that the Defence authorities want over £500,000 for buildings alone, and at the present time they are proposing to erect a workshop, which alone will cost over £40,000. The machinery is estimated to cost over £30,000, and, in addition, £22,000 is required for three Babcock and Wilcox boilers. And I suppose that the boilers will cost this sum because they are going to be made at the Cockatoo Island Dock.",13
114,Dr MALONEY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,I do think that we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],14
115,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The expenditure on these Public Works should be considerably curtailed at a time like this. This morning I received the Minister's answer as to what is going on at the Flinders Naval Base. Just imagine paying 7s. 8d. per cubic yard for handling the d i r t of an embankment! I believe lhat when one man on the job was asked one day how much it was costing per cubic yard he said he could not tell, but he had a very good idea how much a "" bally "" shovelful it was costing.",14
116,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"That was cutting through the rock, was it not?",14
117,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"No ; it was all loose dirt. I have particulars of another excavation about 700 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 20 feet deep, the cost of which was 9s. 3£d. per cubic yard to take out and distribute to spoil. I am given to Our understand also that there was no necessity to take out one yard of that dirt. is As an instance of what is being done there, I might mention that when we visited the Base they told us they were making the excavation because they could not drive the piles through the sand. I objected, with the result that for the balance of the wharf the piles were driven without one yard of further excavation",14
118,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"How many war, it thousand yards were taken out?",14
119,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Twelv e thousand seven hundred cubic yards at a cost of £5,900, and they told me it would cost £2,750 to put in reinforced sheath piling to fill in the places from which they had taken the earth away.",14
120,Dr MALONEY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Mone y is being wasted there in thousands.,14
121,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Yes ; because the men in charge have had no experience of what is necessary. Work has been going ou also at Cockburn Sound for the past two years, but the plans have not even yet been prepared. Take also the transcontinental railway. That has cost over £6,000,000 up to date, and they were going to spend £250,000 in building workshops at Port Augusta. As a matter of fact, the train service on that line sliould be conducted by the State Railway Departments. We do not want an unnecessary Commonwealth Department to be created, because this means building up huge expenditure against the people of Australia. Let us look also to the proposal with regard to the arsenal at Canberra. We are told that Mr Ratcliffej the manager of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, has been sent to London to get experience, and the Defence Department authorities are going on with this proposal, though I pointed out in this Chamber some time ago it will cost £1,750,000 to house the men properly. I have no doubt that the site suggested would be an excellent one for a monastery, but for an arsenal, all I can say is, God help the men who have no better brains than to suggest such a thing as that ! Mr Glynn told me the other day that it would cost nearly £4,000,000 to house the men and provide all the necessary facilities for a township.",14
122,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"We had a water scheme propounded to cost about £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, but that is not to say that it is going to be adopted.",15
123,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"But work in connection with the arsenal is going on. Nobody knows better than the honourable member that £40,000 was set aside by the Treasury without parliamentary sanction. They are going on with it , and I sav we should fight the Estimates in this House, and have something to say as to whether the arsenal should be established there or not. It is absurd to go on with the proposition, because in Australia we have no one capable of giving a satisfactory opinion upon this subject. This House should determine whether the arsenal should be built at Canberra or not. We have, of course, been promised that the House would have' the right to determine the question, but it has been shelved every time, and, in view of the fact that ib will cost at least £2,000,000, and probably £4,000,000, is it not a proper matter for the consideration of this House? Look at what has happened at Lithgow. We were told that we were going to produce rifles at a cost of £ 3 9s. I d but actually they cost over £ 1 5 each; and let us not hide the fact that none of our rifles are being issued bo our troops. From the beginning of the war we have hardly sent a rifle away, and the whole factory might as well be closed down for all the use it is, except to supply rifles with to train our troops.",15
124,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Do you say the rifles are costing £ 1 5 each now?,15
125,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The first estimate was about £ 1 3 ; but after the honourable member for Melbourne and I made certain representations, Senator Pearce sent up an inspector, who condemned an enormous number of rifles. The man responsible for this work should have great experience, yet the man who has blundered is being sent to England to get knowledge and advice in connection with the building of the arsenal at Canberra. I ask the Committee to remember that we are at war, and that the arsenal cannot be completed inside of four years. The whole science of manufacturing munitions of war is in the melting pot. The types of guns and rifles are being continually changed. New conditions are arising and fresh experiments being made to cope with them. The genius of the whole world is concentrated today on the task of producing munitions of war as speedily as possible. If we wait u n t i l the war is over, we shall be able to get the best expert advice and the finest machinery in the world at probably a third of the price which would have to be paid for it today. There ought to be a sound inquiry into this project. Experts have told us that a work of this character should be somewhere near a large centre of population, because a large supply of youthful and inexperienced labour is required.",15
126,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Mr Walker, of Queensland, said that the site at Canberra is one of the best in Australia.",15
127,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"That is not the opinion of Admira l Clarkson, who has expert knowledge. Mr Walker is an ordinary engineer, and probably he does not care what the cost is. The proposal is to erect an arsenal' seven miles south of the Capital City where not a soul is living at present. We should have to construct a railway to the site, build a weir in order to conserve water for factory purposes, and install water supply and sewerage systems. The consequence would be that . , we should have a second Broken Hill at the doors of Parliament House. Parliament should discuss this matter, and come to a determination before we are too full y committed to the scheme.",15

Now that he has wrecked the Fusion party after Ha d Liberal members been worth their salt, they would have challenged the right of the Hughesites to hold the Treasury beuch, but they said, "" We shall not do that, because we wish ito put all our efforts into winning the war."" Consequently there was a fusion, and they had the effrontery to call themselves the ' ' W in the-war "" party and to try to have the name of the Ministry inserted in Hansard as the "" Win-the-war"" Ministry. The Prime Minister has sunk everything to gain his ambition of representing this country at the Imperial Conference. He had a Ministry composed of men whom every one trusted and respected, but he did not hesitate to get rid of them when it became necessary, to get to the Old Country, to take into his Cabinet men whom he had been denouncing for half a ceDtury. His vanity was on the point of being satisfied, a majority having been secured in this House to - support his policy. Attention was then turned to the Senate. Two Labour senators are absent sick, and a third is away on a sea voyage. No rtairs could be obtained for them. Then attempts were made to get others to resign, or to change their party. Statements were made openly in the Senate regarding the overtures of Ministers to a senator. Was it the object of the Government to prolong the life of the Parliament in order that the war might be better pro- 1 secuted and the Empire strengthened ? No. The desire was that the Prime M in ister and the honourable members for Swan and Flinders should be allowed to go to the Old Country to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference. A senator suddenly disappeared from the political arena without consulting his party, and just as suddenly another man was appointed. The Premier of Tasmania has made statements which bear out those made in this Parliament. Everything suggests that there was something wrong. I am not going to impute corruption, but the people outside may think that there was corruption. Last Friday, when the Labour partu asked for a Royal Commission to inquire into the charges that have been made against the Government, the whole Liberal party, with the exception of Mr . MCWilliams, voted against the proposal.",16
147,Mr FOWLER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,We voted against a blow aimed at the Government.,17
148,Mr RILEY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Y o u voted against the proposal for an inquiry. That action must be the keynote of the elections. Liberal party and the Hughes party had deliberately refused an inquiry into one of the gravest charges that could be made against the Government. They now shelter themselves behind the action of the Prime Minister in issuing a w r it for a Supreme Court action against Senator Watson. If Senator Watson takes my advice, he will ignore that writ, and not forgo his parliamentary privilege. He is prepared to make his statements on oath before a Royal Commission. We desire that those statements shall be so investigated. As an answer to our demand for an investigation the Prime Minister has brought about a dissolution. We are prepared to appeal to the grand jury of the country. I do not think that the Prime Minister consulted the Liberal party in this matter. W h at he has done has been done off his own bat, as he has done other things in the same way. We have a right to insist that the honour of members of Parliament should be made clear. The issue of a w r it against Senator Watson will prevent the free discussion of this case from the public platforms, because it will be sub judice. This is a trick on the part of the Prime Minister. The statements of Senator Watson are dovetailed in with the disappearance of Senator Ready.",17
149,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,What does the honourable member mean?,17
150,Mr RILEY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The two things are closely associated, and have caused a great deal of suspicion in the minds of the people. Senator Watson would not have made his disclosures had it not been for the resignation of Senator Ready. He saw that a young man had fallen a victim to bribes offered to him. That, in plain English, is his statement, and, therefore, he asked for an inquiry.",17
151,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Do you say that bribes were offered?,17
152,Mr RILEY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I make no charges. There is strong ground for suspicion, and I ask for an inquiry.",17
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,It is your own men who are concerned.,17
154,Mr RILEY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I am pleased that two Liberal senators had the decency not to be a party to the Government proposal for the prolongation of the life of Parliament. I knew before leaving for Sydney last Friday that Senators Keating and Bakhap were not likely to support the The Government. Ministers, as they were certain of defeat, took the bull by the horns and arranged a dissolution. hoard the speech made by Senator ""Watson in the Senate, and also the replies made by the President, Senator Pearce, and the Prime Minister, all of whom evaded the charges that were brought. The Labor party has nothing to fear from an election. We believe that the people of this country will return a majority pledged to honest Government and vigorous administration. The honourable member for Dampier has said that this is a time for retrenchment; that we should tighten up because of the war. We must  made it clear, the public works of the country must be carried on. I understand, however, that there is to be cheeseparing. Public works are to be stopped, and the old methods of the Liberal regime are to be followed. There is unemployment in Melbourne and in Sydney. That should be impossible under good government. In one week the Prime Minister, together with the Premiers of the States, completed a deal for the purchase of our wheat and wool, amounting to £90,000,000. In addition, the country makes profits on its exports of sheepskins, hides, tallow, coal, and minerals of various kinds which every ship takes away. It is a disgrace for a Government to say that the public expenditure of a country with this great natural wealth which only needs development should be tightened up. There would be no unemployment with proper sion of industry. The policy of Ministers when war and trouble comes is to stop public works expenditure. Honourable members opposite say that we are a disloyal party, and that we are not assisting to win the war. I challenge the truth of that statement.

I am prepared to go out reI cruiting, and do everything possible. I do not wish to see the Empire beaten, because I have no desire that this .country should be shackled by militarism. Australia is doing her part in this war. We have sent 300,000 men overseas, and that is more than the whole British Nation sent to the South African War. We have a bigger army from Australia in the field today than Great Britain ever had in any previous war. In addition, we are supplying the Allies with food, munitions, steel, and steel rails, and I have no doubt that when the history of this great war comes to be written Australia will hold a prominent place, and will be considered a credit to the Empire. If there is anything more that we can do, I am willing that we should do it .",18

I am honestly convinced against compulsory service abroad. It is repugnant to my nature, and I believe at the same time that the voluntary system will be found to meet all our requirements. Those concerned in the Labour movement are most anxious to win the war, because trade unionists, and the sons of trade unionists, are today at the front in the trenches. The honourable member for Dampier has sneered at the trade union movement in expan- this connection, but the majority of the men in the trenches today are trade unionists.

In this connection I should like to say that I desire that Australia shall be represented at the Imperial War Conference when the terms of peace are being drawn up. We have at present a High Commissioner in London who possesses the confidence of the people of this country. There is also in London at the present time the ex-High Commissioner, Sir George Reid. If the Commonwealth cannot be represented by a delegation from this Parliament direct, it could be well represented by these gentlemen, and at a considerable saving of money.

The trouble is that no definite charges have been made. Merely insinuations and innuendoes have been made, upon which it is quite impossible for this House, or any other deliberative assembly, to take action. We must have something definite before we can act.",19

173,Mr FOWLER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The w r it has been issued in regard to allegations against the Prime Minister by Senator Watson. Let me say that so far as this matter is concerned it seems to me to be merely one man's statement against the other's. But it is quite obvious that if a bait was offered to Senator Watson he not only nibbled at it , but he came back to it again and again. However, I am not concerned so much about the Seuator Watson part of the business as I am about the Senator Ready part of it . I say, unhesitatingly, that if there is anything that needs in quiry, it is that particular matter. so far we have had no definite charges in this connection; nothing but a considerable amount of talk that tends to create suspicion. Personally, I believe that that is wholly and entirely the object of all the talk by honourable members opposite. Their desire is, not that there should be an inquiry at all, but to stir up some of the mud so that there may be an opportunity later on of declaring that something is beneath it .",20
174,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"If there is nothing under the mud, what an opportunity honourable members on the Government side now have offered to them.",20
175,Mr FOWLER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"If there is something under the mud, let honourable members make their charges definitely, and I will assist them to secure the inquiry they profess to be so anxious about. In connection with this matter it has been mentioned that I was concerned with a certain inquiry, but there appears to be some misapprehension as to the facts in that case. I made definite charges in this House against a certain person who obtained a position under the Government. I made those charges categorically. A Comniission was appointed, and the result was somewhat colourless, and unsatisfactory.",20
176,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,At any rate the Government did grant a Commission.,20

179,Mr FOWLER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"That Commission was appointed because I made definite charges in this House, and, therefore, I say that honourable members opposite must make similarly definite charges in this case before they can in reason expect to secure a similar inquiry. As soon as definite charges are made, I will vote for an in quiry into them.",20
180,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I think that the honourable member, and a number of other honourable members on his side, would like to have voted last Friday for an inquiry, but were prevented by party reasons.",20
181,Mr FOWLER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"It is of no use for the honourable gentleman to make these insinuations. I have given honourable members opposite a definite challenge. If they make a definite charge my course will be plain, and I shall assist them to secure an inquiry. They have no right But to demand that a Royal Commission shall be appointed to go fishing in this muddy warer in the hope that something may be brought to the surface. Coming back to the Chinn Commission, I wish to inform honourable members that I went on the public platform in Western Australia and repeated the charges, and challenged action in the Law Courts, and nothing came of it . I make this statement now because there is some misunderstanding as to what exactly transpired. I hope that I have made the position quite clear. I wish now to call attention to a matter that has been under my notice for some little time. I referred to it in the House a little while ago by way of a question. It appears to me that certain old-age pensioners are being penalized in a way which I am sure this House never intended. I refer to those who have lost their breadwinners at the front . The case that I brought under the notice of the Treasurer was one which I believe has been repeated in very many instances. A widowed mother with an only son was enjoying an old age pension of 12s. 6d. a week. The son went to the front and was killed. As the result, she is in receipt of a war pension of £ 1 a week, but her old-age pension was immediately reduced so that the total amount she derived from the old age pension and the war pension together should not exceed the maximum of £ 1 2s. 6d. Unfortunately, the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act renders that course of action imperative, but, while it is the legal position, it is not the moral position, and I contend that this state of affairs should be altered at the earliest possible opportunity.",20
182,Mr MASSYGREENE,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I endeavoured to get the Government to deal with the matter when the War Pensions Bill was uuder discussion, but they would not do so.  ment do not go into the matter and take the necessary action, then if I came back to the House I shall have no hesitation in tryin g to bring about an alteration. The old-age pension is given to a widowed mother irrespective of whether provision is being made for her by her children. The House recognised that it was not a fair and proper thing if a widowed mother happened to be receiving assistance from her children that she should be penalized in that regard. Section 4 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions A ct says distinctly"" Income "" means any moneys, valuable consideration, or profits earned, derived, or received by any person for his own use or benefit by any means from any source whatever, whether in or out of the Commonwealth, and shall be deemed to include personal earnings, but not any payment(fi) by way of gift or allowance from his son, daughter, step-son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, or legally adopted son or daughter. Thus the Act provides, in regard to any person receiving assistance from children, or even step-children or grandchildren, that he or she is still entitled to the old age pension, no matter whether the pensioner may be living in the lap of luxury at the instance of her children. Tn the case that I have mentioned, the death of the son gives the widowed mother a war pension of £ 1 a week, but while the son was alive he probably contributed much more to her support.",21
183,Sir JOHN PORREST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The pension paid depends upon the rank of the son.  private.,21
184,Sir JOHN PORREST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"If the widowed his mother is in receipt of £10,000 a year she is still entitled to the war pension.",21
185,Mr FOWLER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"That is so, but it serves to emphasize the position, that special provision was made in and Old-age Pensions Act so that the widowed mother should not be penalized, but the effect of the administration of Act has been to do the very thing that were anxious to avoid. The hardship is all the greater when one reflects that the son before going to the war might have allowed his mother much more than the equivalent of £ 1 a week, the pension to which the widowed mother of a private who is killed becomes entitled. The In valid and Old-age Pensions Act automatically cuts down the old-age pension, so that the maximum drawn by the widowed mother does not exceed £ 1 2s. 6d., and the 12s. 6d. pension she was receiving under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act is reduced to 2s. 6d. per week. The facts need only to be mentioned to the Committee for the injustice and inequity of it to be seen. I ask the Treasurer to go into the matter carefully and see whether the intention of the Act in practice in this regard is not being flouted. I do hot say that the administrators could do anything else than bring down the old-age pension to make the total receipts of the pensioner £ 1 2s. 6d. a week, but I do say that there should be forthwith a simple modification of the Act that will insure, in the case of widowed mothers, that the same conditions that apply while the son is alive shall apply in the case of his death at the front. It is monstrous stepto think that the son, who has made the supreme sacrifice of his life for his country, who has gone away thinking that in any case his mother would be ,provided for, has forfeited by his death the right of his mother to a few extra shillings per week.",21
186,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The widowed mother is entitled to the pension even if the son did not contribute a farthing towards her keep.,21
187,Mr FOWLER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I know that such is the case, but the Act points out that whatever contributions are made by sons or daughters, stepchildren, or grandchildren shall not be deducted from the widowed mother's pension, and surely if a contribution in the shape of a pension is made to her by a son as the result of supreme sacrifice of his life for his country there is less reason than before for the deduction in the case of the oldonly age pension of the widowed mother.",21
188,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The honourable member's the Invalid point is unanswerable.,21
189,Mr FOWLER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I trust that the necessary modification of the Invalid and Oldthe age Pensions Act will be taken in hand we by the Treasurer. I know that the righ t '.honourable gentleman is fairly keen in the matter of preventing raids on the Treasury, but the granting of this request would not be i u the nature of a raid. It would merely secure to the old.age .pensioner what the A ct intended without increasing the charges on the country. I hope that the Treasurer in his large heartedness will see that the hardship imposed on the widowed mothers of those who have made the supreme .sacrifice at the front will be put right at the earliest possible opportunity. Several honourable members rising,",21

It is the usual practice to call ou an honourable member from the opposite side to the honourable member who has just completed his remarks, but I have determined that I shall give preference to an honourable member who has not already spoken on the question before the Chair, over honourable members who have already addressed the Committee.",22

192,Mr LYNCH,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Werriwa) [12.40] - I am pleased that the Treasurer is present, because I wish to accentuate a few matters concerning the wheat-growing industry that were brought under his attention yesterday evening by a deputation. As a wheat-grower and a representative of a large farming constituency I am intensely grateful when I find that the right honourable gentleman and his Government are seriously considering the position of wheat-growers, and intend, as soon as possible- I hope it will be almost diately-to pay another instalment 1915-16 wheat. The wheat-growers in vernment. I some of the districts of New South Wales are carrying on under great disabilities. They have suffered from hailstorms and unprecedented wet weather, and from rust attacking the late crops. As a result wheat-growing industry in those districts is in a very serious position, and temptais tion is pressing many land-holders to disright miss their share farmers, and go out the industry on account of the high price stand. of stock and wool, and the tremendous of wheat production, and because through such huge sums of money being locked the duty will devolve on them to finance their share farmers through another It will be necessary for this to be done the wheat-growing industry is to contions tinue, but many of these land-holders are ought at once to be set aside. not in the position to do it . If we are to cast adrift a large number of able and capable men, and cause them to sell at a mere bagatelle the plants they employ in tlieir share farming, and which really represent the savings of years, I am afraid that it will result in augmenting the unemployed trouble, which already promises to be sufficiently pronounced before the winter is over. I u addition to the question of unemployment there is a higher consideration of deep interest to all, the question of how a cessation of operations wheat-growing districts will affect the food supplies of the Empire and of our own people of this Commonwealth. For these reasons I ask the Treasurer to make every possible effort to have the promised payments made as soon as possible. I am sure that his sympathetic reply to the deputation means that something will be done, but action should be taken immediately, because the months during which the new land must be precan be pared and sown are just upon us, and people are trembling on the brink as to whether it is safe to go ahead or not. I intend to go ahead, and increase my area under crop, notwithstanding that last year's operations resulted in a huge loss to me. Generally speaking, the bountiful harvest that was reaped that year should certainly enable the farmers to face their difficulties if they obtain the support and encouragement which they are seeking. Another matter of great importance to the country interests, and one that has not, so far as I am aware, been dealt with in immethe House before, is the acquisition of on the the wool clip by the British Goam sure that wool growers, large or small, throughout Australia, are desirous of doing their duty. I am sure they will be satisfied on the whole with the price obtained, but there the is one feature in connection with the administration of this great matter, which of vital Imperial moment, that cuts across the Tjrinciple of decentralizaof tion, for which most country members Wool growers, large and small, cost feel that if it can be shown that any in ju ry will be done to the vital principle up of giving Great Britain control of the wool clip of the Dominions, and preventyear. ing any leakage towards the enemy, by if any suggestions that we make for alteraor amendments, 'those suggestions But up to date the Central Wool Committee have not been able to show that any of our suggestions would injure any vital principle that it is necessary to observe. For the first time in the history of the wool industry in this country scientific methods of valuation and classification have been adopted in the disposal of the clip, and influential men in the trade agree that the system of appraisement-purchase has come to stay. The objections raised by the country interests involved are to the position developed through the administration being wholly centralized. Country wool businesses, especially in New South Wales, have been built up during the last 50 or 60 years, many of them employing large numbers of permanent hands, but if the whole administration is to be centralized and the present system of disposing of the wool is not altered, the bulk of those country businesses will go to the wall, and utter and complete ruin will await the men who have developed them at a vast expenditure of capital and industry. Many country wool firms were buying wool on commission both for B r i tish and foreign manufacturers. all admit that that business must go, but the very first action of the Central Wool Committee was to put an embargo on country trading in regard to both skins and wool. The country dealers or hawkers who visited every farm and station, and gathered up the skins that perhaps were only two or three days old, used to take them into their central depots, where they were poisoned, properly treated, and conserved. All that trade was stopped. Much of the stuff was allowed to rot, and the skin money derived by the very poorest of the people was in a great measure lost. Sir JOH N FOBBEST - Could they preserve the skins themselves?",22
193,Mr LYNCH,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"They were in the habit of having it done in the way I described. The logical deduction from the regulation was that these small people were asked to send every few skins to Sydney in a separate lot. We asked that the country dealers sliould be allowed to buy, properly treat, and classify the skins and send them down in bulk to be appraised for the purpose of the Imperial arrangement. That was conceded when the Central Wool Committee saw what a tremendous dislocation had taken place. Previously also country wool merchants bought up large and small quantities of wool, brought them into their central depots and warehouses, classified them, and by their expert knowledge and the appliances they possess, doubtless gave them an added value of from l d . to 3d. per lb. But all that was knocked on the head by the edict of the Central Wool Committee, and each individual wool grower was supposed, if he had only one bag of wool, to send it to the central appraisement depot, which was generally in the capital.",23
194,Mr GREENE,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Do you not think he got better value that way?,23
195,Mr LYNCH,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I shall deal with that point in a moment. Such was the outcry that after a while the regulation was relaxed, and country wool merchants are now allowed to buy up to £ 1 0 worth- a concession that is absolutely worthless. It'cannot possibly be argued that the idea of preserving the whole of the wool clip of Australia for the British Government would be in any way interfered with, or the work of the appraisers rendered more arduous or difficult, by allowing the They country merchants to buy the wool, classify it , and send it down to be appraised and taken possession of by the British Government. On the contrary, such a policy would preserve our inland industries, and keep in employment hundreds of men in the country who had what they hoped was a life-long occupation. A country Wool merchants association has now been formed in New South Wales, and is seeking representation on the Cent r al Wool Committee.' I wish to point out that never in the history of the wool industry have the large firms which are represented on the committee made profits commensurate not with what they are now making. The contention of the association has not yet been fairly answered. If sacrifice amounting even to the destruction of one's business is necessary for the carrying on of the war, why should that sacrifice fall needlessly upon country traders, while the extra profit goes into the pockets of the kings of the wool trade, who are not asked to make commensurate sacrifices themselves ? The honourable member for Richmond asked me just now if the small growers would not get a better market by sending their wool to Sydney direct as they are compelled to do now. My reply is: Why not leave them both markets, the local market or the central appraisement depot, so that they might still be free agents ?",23
196,Mr MASSYGREENE,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,It seems to me the new arrangement does away with the middleman's profit.,24
197,Mr LYNCH,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"No one can accuse me of being a middleman's advocate. I am up against him at all times, but in this case the middleman was performing a really useful and essential service. H u n dreds of small wool-growers, even in my constituency, carry on small mixed farming and grazing, and were in the habit of selling anything from £ 2 0 to £ 1 0 0 worth of wool to local merchants in October, just when they wanted a little ready cash to begin harvesting. There was a time in my history as a small settler when the local wool merchant and skin buyer helped me along in the same way. were still in the position I was then, I would be told now that I must send my few bags of wool down to await the appraisement boards. This policy causes congestion, because it would be infinitely better for a dozen small clips to be properly classified in country warehouses and then submitted in one or two lots to the appraisers down below. There is a time as I say, when the support of the local wool merchant and skin buyer was essential to the small settler. It is essential now to thousands of struggling people who are trying to knock a piece of rough bush into shape, and derive sustenance from it . We are told that they can make application to the wool brokers and get advances, but no logical or just reason has been put forward to show why our country wool in dustries should be disrupted in order to swell out of all proportion the huge monopolies already possessed by the great wool agents in the capital cities.",24
198,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,There should be a representative of the small growers on the Board.,24
199,Mr LYNCH,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Exactly , and there should also be a representative on i the country wool merchants. No man who has built up a business of that kind i country should be needlessly broken up dum. and cast aside as if he were an enemy the Empire. I hope the Government, notever withstanding its many and varied difficulwas ties, will bring about an alteration of policy that will commend itself more to the people of the country than the present system of administration. I say nothing against the capacity or worth of the gentlemen on the Committee. I believe them to be actuated by the highest motives. We are told that most of them are giving their services free, but they have utterly forgotten the welfare of the deserving people who have built up these country industries. There is an unreasoning fear on the other side of the House, which no doubt will be fanned into full blast in the coming contest, that the"" Government is a con- scription Government, and will take the first opportunity of fastening conscription on the people of Australia. I was driven out of the ranks of the Official Labour party because of my conception of a broad principle. I stated on 14th November, If I 1916, that I could not follow Mr Hughes u n t i l the home service proclamation was withdrawn and a guarantee given that the will of the people, as expressed at the ballot-box, would, be respected, but I find that the Coalition has given that pronouncement emphatically to the country, and I am compelled to follow them. It is alleged that certain members on this side intend to flout the decision of the people, but I would not be here if I thought there was the slightest truth in such statements. Possibly two or three have stated their intention to hold another referendum, but their attitude reminds me of a very sad story I read many years ago - A father, mother, and seven young children were overtaken by a tremendous flood in the back blocks, and the only survivor waa a little girl of about two years of age. She refused to be comforted until some kind lady asked, "" What does the dear child really want? "" And the dear child replied, "" I want to see another flood.""",24

201,Mr LYNCH,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Before the adjournment for lunch I was referring to the sugt of gestion made on the other side that the Government will seek to bring about conn the scription by means of another referenBut the nearest approach that to Australia ever got to conscription, or is likely to get, was when the division taken in the Labour Caucus, and only by two votes was the Prime Minister given permission to refer the question to the people. W it h all the power he undoubtedly possessed at thab moment, and despite the sentiments expressed by scores of thousands of people throughout Australia, that conscription would suit this country, the Prime Minister refused to adopt any other but the democratic method of referring the question to the people. Had the Prime Minister been compelled to surrender, in the absence of a war policy, I think I am right in assuming that, under the circumstances, the Government which superseded him would have used only the method of direct action and proclamation. But in view of the chastening influence of the referendum vote, can any reasonable being suggest that there is any possibility of that happening now? I have been an anti-conscriptionist from the beginning, but if the people, by a fair majority, declared for conscription, I would even, if I refused to sit in this House to administer the policy, declare that they had a perfect right to do so. This canard is being raised for election purposes, but the common sense of the people of Australia will assert itself, for they will see that it is raised only to cloak the fact that the Oflicial Labour party, having subscribed to the doctrine of outside domination, are anxious to extend that domination throughout the country, and thus obtain the votes of a panic-stricken people who are being frightened by the bogy of conscription in the near future, or at any time, without their consent. were expelled from the Labour movement were expelled on the authority of a resolution passed by the Political Labour League Conference in 1916 to the following effect: That this conference solemnly pledges itself to oppose by all lawful means conscription of human life for military service abroad, and directs all leagues and affiliated unions to take immediate steps to oppose all Labour members who voted for or otherwise supported conscription. The Central Executive is hereby authorized to oppose, under any circumstances, endorsement of conscription candidates; and that it bo an instruction to leagues, and the Federal Executive, to oppose, at all costs, the policy of conscription. That resolution was moved by ex-Senator Rae, and it is the sole authority on which the Labour movement in New Wales has been disrupted. We find just about the same date a similar resoluhad tion was passed by the Central Mr Lynch. of the Queensland Labour party. According to the Labour Gall of September 21, 1916, and also the Brisbane StandardAt the last meeting of the Central Executive of the Queensland Labour party the whole question of conscription was thoroughly discussed, and complete unanimity was expressed in the determination to light the conscription proposals to the utmost. The following resolution, which has been wired to every representative both in the Senate - and the House of Representatives, was adopted :That this executive hereby declares that endorsement will not be given to the candidature of any sitting member, either of the House of Representatives or of the Senate, who does not oppose by his vote in the Federal House, the passage of the Conscription Referendum Bill when before the Commonwealth Parliament. It is well known that quite a number of honourable members opposite voted for the Referendum Bill . It is quite certain, too, that a number of them voted upstairs to refer the question to the people, knowing that this threat was held over them-and all honour to them for that. I suppose, however, that their complete surrender afterwards is the price of their forgiveness. Though I have been an anticonscriptionist from the beginning, I refused to recognise the authority of the State conferences over Federal or Sta.te representatives.",24

If the Labour movement is so destitute of intelligence as not to be able to discriminate between the owners of a concern and its servants, then, whatever the source, whether Federal or State, it is the duty of every freedom-loving man to fight against the attempted dictation.",25
204,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I am sorry you ever got into the Labour movement, and I am very glad I voted against you at the time of the by-election.",25
205,Mr LYNCH,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The nomination for Werriwa was offered to me. It had no attraction for the rest of you-non e whatever. Although notice was given to the Political Labour Leagues, right from the beginning of the referendum campaign, South that Lvncb was no longer to appear on that any Official Labour platform, because he flouted the executive, I was told, long Executive after the referendum vote, that if I did not make an open breach my faults would be condoned. I have been an anti-conscriptionist from the beginning, and my constituents turned down the conscription vote by 11,000 votes.",25

207,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Thre e speakers in succession from one side.,26
208,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I and understand that, according to the prevailing rule, an honourable member shall be called, even though two or three honourable members from his own side have preceded him, if he himself has not already spoken in Committee. An honourable member who has spoken once in Committee is, I understand, not entitled to the call if an honourable member wbo has not spoken rises to address the Chair.",26
209,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"If the honourable member for Wakefield has not already spoken, it is all right.",26
210,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I understand that the debate is to close today, and, therefore, I shall be brief; and in the time at my disposal I shall refer to the statement by the Treasurer, and offer some observations on the public revenue and expenditure. I regret exceedingly that in this debate so little time has been devoted to this vitally important question. I do not, however, desire to reflect in any sense on honourable members who have been dealing with personal matters, because I know that present circumstances are somewhat unique. For some years past I have been urging that more time should be devoted to the criticism of public expenditure, more time than we have seen devoted to the matter during the existence of the National Parliament. For years I have advocated the constitution of a Public Works Committee, a Public Accounts Committee, and a Supply and Tender Board. We now have a Public Works Committee and a Public Accounts Committee, and the present Prime Minister has promised to constitute, at the earliest opportunity, a Board to supervise all purchases in connection with the Government. Although the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee have been in existence for some time, and have devoted much consideration to the matters referred to them, I cannot help expressing the belief that we are not reaping the benefit that we ought to from the work they do. These Committees submit their reports, and these are laid on the table and printed, but, generally speaking, that is the end of them. In these reports it is admitted, and is well known in the House and throughout Australia, that we are not getting as much for our 20s. as we ought to. Overwhelming evidence has been furnished of mismanagement in various directions-in connection with over-costly undertakings, not only in regard to the men who do the manual work, but, in many in stances, the management and supervision. But the point is that we have not yet dealt definitely with any report, either of the Public Works Committee or the Public Accounts Committee. The honourable member for Dampier, during the course of his remarks, cited the departmental report on the cost of certain work at the Flinders Naval Base, and, unless the conditions surrounding that work were exceptionally difficult-unles s the material excavated was chiefly rock- I say that the prices paid for it were extraordinary.",26
211,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,There was no rock.,26
212,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I am glad of that interjection. The honourable member for Dampier has himself inspected this particular work at the Flinders Naval Base. It consisted of ordinary earth excavation, so that the prices paid for it were simply outrageous.",26
213,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Was there any water in it? 3,26
214,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"There was not, in a great deal of it - While the honourable member for Dampier was dealing with this question, the honourable member for South Sydney, who is the chairman of the Public Works Committee, derisively suggested that he was reflecting on the poor working man. But it is of no use appointing a Public Works Committee if we are not to have the right class of men upon it . It is idle for the members of such a Committee to industriously apply themselves to the discovery of evils if they do not emphatically give Parliament the benefit of the results of their investigations.",26
215,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Of course this work was carried out before the Public Works Committee was appointed.,26
216,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I am simply taking this work as typical of a good many other works which have been investigated by that Committee.. and also by the Public Accounts Committee. I do hope that, when the honourable member for South Sydney gets before his constituents, he will inform the people of Australia, through them, of the knowledge which has come to the Public Works Committee from the investigations which have been made. Mr Mahon v - He will do that, for sure.",26
217,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"He - will not, unless he adopts a different attitude from that which he assumed while the honourable member for Dampier was speaking. I say that it is unworthy of him to suggest that the honourable member for Dampier was reflecting on the working man.",27
218,Mr MAHONY,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The honourable member for South Sydney will come back again all right.,27
219,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I am not dealing with this matter from a personal, but from a national, stand-point. I am glad that the Treasurer is present, because I wish to know whether he is going to put the East-West line into a better condition, so far as its' effective management and supervision are concerned.",27
220,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"It is not in Department.,",27
221,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"But the right honourable gentleman has to find enormous deficit. the money for the undertaking, and when he is appealed to in that end connection, he is in a position to receipts whisper a word or two into the ear the Minister for Works and Railways. shall be very disappointed if the preearn sent Minister for Works and Railways does not effect a very great reduction in the expenditure upon that line. I am informed that an inquiry into this matter has at last been arranged, and that but for the coming dissolution a commy mittee would, at an early date, have been engaged on it .",27
222,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The honourable has been promised that inquiry 1,27
223,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Absothe lutely. And this House was mised it by the Prime during the past few days. to questions which I put to the M in ister during this week I learned that there has already been expended on this railway, inclusive of plant and rollingTreasurer stock, £6,006,524. As there is nearly another 100 miles to construct to link up the two sections of the railway, the additional cost of that may safely be put down at £500.000.. Then there is the ballasting, which, according to the Engineer-in-Chief, Mr Bell, will absorb another £2,000,000. It will be seen, therefore, that when the work is completed, it will have cost between £8,000,000 and £9,000,000 in lieu of £4,000,000 as originally estimated.",27
224,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"It is the most expensive mileage which has ever been carried out in Australia. Mr ' RICHARD FOSTER - It is, for the character of the country which the line traverses. I wish now to say a word or two in regard to the Traffic Department in connection with this railway. That Department was created some three years ago. I protested against it as strongly as possible, and urged that the creation of such a Department purely for constructional purposes was absolutely without precedent. But the Government was informed by their officials that there was a l o t of money to be made by a Traffic Department, and consequently it was created. I have received all the previous returns of the revenue and expenditure of that Demy partment, and I say, without any qualification, that those returns, instead of revealing a handsome profit, disclose an The latest return, which covers a period of six months to the of January last, sets out the traffic from the public at £5,335 12s. 3d., of and from the Department at £64,510 I 0s. 4d., or a total of £69,845 12s. 7d. To £69,000 odd it has cost this Traffic Department £137,484 10s. l d .",27
225,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,That is a losing game.,27
226,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Yes ; and trouble is that the same losing game is in evidence in every part of the Commonwealth where public works are undermember taken. If the East-West line costs £2,000,000 to ballast, in accordance with departmental estimate, it will mean proan annual deficit of £500,000. Minister Sir JOHN FOBREST - The honourable In answer member need not prophesy.",27
227,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,I challenge the Treasurer to investigate the figures.,27
228,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,I do not think that the will agree with that statement.,27
229,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"He will have to do so. I want, very hurriedly, to make a suggestion or two to the right honourable gentleman. The construction of that railway was approved by this House, on the understanding that it would cost £4,000,000, and honourable members know that it was a mighty difficult job to get parliamentary authority for the work. Had it not been for the Treasurer, the measure authorizing the undertaking at a cost of £4,000,000 would not have been passed by this Parliament.",28
230,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Then he is responsible for the whole of it .,28
231,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"He is restrongly sponsible for a lot of good things that ""Western Australia enjoys, and they will stand to him , and rightly so, t ill crack of doom. This, however, is a matloan ter of business. Mr Bell wants £2,000,000 for ballasting the line. In his last annual report, published recently, he states that the road is excellent considering that it is unballasted, and that he could run trains wise cost. safely and easily on it up 'to a maximum of 40 miles an hour; or, including stopHad pages, a service averaging 33 miles an hour. In this time of war and stress, way, when we are reminded very emphatically by the Treasurer, as well as by his decessors, that we shall have to be careful in our expenditure and undertake no new works except those which must of necessity be put in hand, the Parliament has no right, at least until the war is over, to authorize an expenditure of £2,000,000 on ballasting this line. An average 33 miles an hour, inclusive of stoppages, ought to be good enough for - a railway which, according to the Department's admission, is going to give them a revenue of only £5,600 a year in resoect of cattle arid goods traffic. Mr Bell has not tured to estimate what the coaching or passenger traffic will be. If the bourne to Adelaide express service, with an average of 27£ miles an hour, satisfies the people of this country, as well as overditions. sea visitors, who declare it to be one the finest in the world, then surely average speed of 33 miles an hour, includunless ing stoppages, should be good enough this railway to the West, the revenue which is exceedingly problematical. The one thing that is not problematical, so far as this line is concerned, is that the will have to pay, by way of taxation, £500,000 per annum to meet the deficit on it .",28
232,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,That is because the country on the South Australian side is poor.,28
233,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"It is poor, but on the Western Australian side also the country is not good. The line terminates in salt-bush country, at K a l goorlie, where the average rainfall is 5 inches per annum.",28
234,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"But nearly £2,500,000 worth of gold comes out of Kalgoorlie.",28
235,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"It is not coming this way. If there was another Kalgoorlie alongside the railway, I should advocate making the service equal to the very best on this Continent. I am certain that the Parliament will not apthe prove an expenditure of £2,000,000 of money on the ballasting of this line. Another point is that if the work of ballasting the line were submitted for public tender, it would be done for 25 per cent, less, at the very least, than it would otherI know of men who would jump at the chance of doing the work. the tender system been applied to the whole work of constructing this railthe country would bave saved £1,000,000, if not £2,000,000. There is preyet another point which I would bring under the notice of the Treasurer, since it affects Western Australia. If this railway is inevitably to be run at a loss, we should insist upon the Governmenb minimizing that loss by running it at the least possible expense consistent with efficiency. of In order 'to do that, the Federal Government should request the Government of Western Australia to administer the serown vice on their side, and the South Australian Government to run it on the South Australian side, just as they now control venthe Oodnadatta railway for the Commonwealth. The striking figures that I have Melput before the Committee this afternoon are an evidence of what will be the cost of running this railway under existing conProm a national point of view, it of is not a good policy for the Commonwealth an to build up a big Railway Department there is justification for it . The on Western Australian and South Australian from Governments have their own railway administrative staffs, consisting of experienced men, and the cost of their own railpeople way systems would not be materially increased by their taking control of the sections of this line within their respective States. I have discussed this phase of the question with the Premier of Western Australia and some of his colleagues. I have also discussed it with the right honourable member for Swan and other representatives of Western Australia, together with South Australian railway officials, and they are confident that the line could be effectively controlled, in the way I have just suggested, for infinitely less than it would cost the Commonwealth Department to run it .",28
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,I agree with the honourable member in that respect.,29
237,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I am glad to have that assurance. I put a question to the Prime Minister a few days ago as to the adoption of this course. The reply I received was that it would be taken into consideration, but that the difficulty in the way was the commitments that have been made in respect of both coaching, locomotive, and other rolling-stock. Those commitments do not put any obstacle in the way.",29
238,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The wealth line has a gauge of its own, and its rolling-stock must be keot separate.",29
239,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Exactly . Separate rolling-stock would have to be provided, whether the Commonwealth or the respective States administered the service.",29
240,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,I presume honourable member intends that the Commonwealth shall find its own rolling stock ?,29
241,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Certainly ; but the respective States should control the railway for the Commonwealth just as South Australia has run the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway on behalf of the National Government.,29
242,Mr SINCLAIR,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The Oodnadatta line is a fairly costly one for the Commonwealth.,29
243,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I read in the press a few days ago a statement to the effect that the Commonwealth Railway Department was considering the advisableness of taking over the control of the Oodnadatta line since it believed that it could run it for less than the South Australian Department could do. challenge the Government on that point. Unless there is a pronounced change in the administrative costs connected with the East-West railway, then the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, if taken over by the Commonwealth Department, would cost 50 per cent, more than it does at present.  the interest on the money borrowed to build the Oodnadatta line and give the South Australian Government the free use of it , they ought to be able to run it for less.",29
244,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"That does not make the least difference. South Australia has no interest in any part of the railway since it has been taken over by the Commonwealth. The State Railway Department, however, can run it better than we can hope to do, because it has its own administrative staff. They have had control of it for thirty-five years, and there has never been a strike or any industrial upheaval in connection with it .",29
245,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Wimmera) [2.57] - I propose to make a few observations regarding the war policy of the present Government. We are on the eve of a general election, and I think it is our duty to acknowledge the success that has so fa r attended the Wheat Pool and the Wool Common- Pool-the two great pools of primary production initiated by the Leader of the present Administration. The development of a proper scheme was necessary to make them effective, and certain defects have necessarily occurred in connection with them. But, generally speaking, they were the only possible means the of enabling the primary products of Australia to be husbanded, to encourage our producers to produce still more, and to permit of their products reaching the markets of the Mother Country, where they are so essential. I have neither the time nor the opportunity , at* this stage, to deal with the finances of the Commonwealth, but I would congratulate the Treasurer upon the clear statement as to our financial position which he submitted when in troducing this Bill . Owing to the approaching dissolution it will be impossible for the Parliament to give to the all important question of finance that attention that we are in duty bound to extend to it , having regard to the enormously increased expenditure of the ComI monwealth. We have had some illumi nating figures supplied, however, by the Treasurer, and we are also indebted to the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Grey, for much valuable information. Three principles, which are safe and sound, and which should have been adopted at the outset of the war, are laid down in the present Treasurer's Financial Statement. I trust that they will be observed while the war continues, and for some time afterwards. In the first place, the honourable gentleman enunciated the principle that we should borrow money for war purposes, and that the new taxation imposed upon the people should be only such as is necessary to cover interest and sinking fun d on war loans- I am speaking now of war expenditure-and also the cost of war pensions and repatriation. Up to the end of the present financial year our war loans, including the sum recently subscribed, will amount to something like £125,000,000. Treasurer states that, in order to meet the interest and sinking fund for the year, we shall have to raise something like £4,800,000; but if we add to it 1 per cent, for sinking fund , the amount will be £6,000,000 on the total of £125,000,000. We have also to face about £1,000,000 of expenditure for war pensions; so that we shall have to increase new taxation in some form or another, on account of the war only, to something like £7,000,000. the course of his speech last, night, the previous Treasurer said that if the war continued until the end of 19.1S our in debtedness on this account would be in creased by another £100,000,000, or £120,000,000 by the time we brought our troops back to Australia; so that we have a prospective war debt up to the end of 1918 of, at least, £225,000,000. Our war pensions, moreover, will probably increase two or three times over, and then on top of that will be expenditure on account of repatriation to the extent of a couple of million pounds a year. By the end of 1918 then, our total war debt will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £250,000,000. Tbis will mean that, in stead of raising about £6,000,000 a year in war taxation, we shall have to find twice that amount, and probably more. Br . MALONEY - Three times that amount. Mr SAMPSON"" - Well , the amount I have stated is about the minimum which the people will be called upon to find. This surely emphasizes the necessity, as the Treasurer remarked, for greater economy and for a very searching scrument tiny of all public expenditure. I am glad to know that the Treasurer is going to pay for public works out of loan money. I will pass on now to refer briefly to the new Government. We all know the necessity that existed for a coalition, in order that we might increase in vigour and righteffectiveness the Avar policy of the Commonwealth, and also to insure adequate representation of Australia at the War Conference in London. No more important Conference has even been called in the history of the British Empire, and no questions of such vital importance to Australia have been considered as those which will be brought before this Conference and dealt with during the present year. These were ample reasons for a coalition of those political forces whose The views on war questions were identical. I hope that the policy laid down by the Prime Minister on 21st February, as in dicating the essentials of the coalition agreement, will be amplified and developed in many directions. I do not take the view, held by some members, that the two parties of the coalition should go to the country as two separate entities on domestic policy. It ' is a little unfortunate In that we have not a homogeneous policy, not only in respect to the war, but in respect also to our domestic affairs, for I believe that the development of the primary industries of Australia, as well as the multiplication of new secondary industries, are quite as essential as a war policy. They are, indeed, properly a part of it , and I hope, therefore, that it will be possible for the Government to give some attention to this important matter. We appointed a Committee for Scientific Besearch, with the idea of increasing our primary and secondary productions. That was a step in the right direction. We shall have to deal with this problem in a practical manner sooner or later, because, with our increasing burden of taxation, it will be imperative to increase our industrial efficiency in every possible way. Especially in this connection will it be necessary to increase both primary and secondary production. It will also provide employment for our returned soldiers. We owe a solemn duty to those who have gone to the front , and are taking their part in the titanic struggle now in progress for the defence of the Empire. I hope, also, it will be possible for the Commonwealth Governto get into close association with the State Parliaments to see if it is possible to elaborate a more efficient system of technical education, including compulsory apprenticeship and training, having for its object the greater efficiency of our artisans in all industries. Let me now refer to the question of a more effective war policy. am satisfied the Prime Minister's statement concerning the verdict of the people at the referendum is one that can be trusted. Mr Hughes told us that the Government will respect the verdict of the people. Every member of this House, and every elector, must recognise that that verdict cannot be contravened; but if they are not satisfied with the dict, the plain duty is to submit the question again, either in the Government policy, or in the form of another referendum. I regret that the question is not going to be submitted again, in some form or other, to the people, because I believe that on the last occasion it was put before them in such a manner that it was least likely to be accepted. I believe there was a disposition on the part of the people then to believe that the draft of 16,500 men per month asked for was too great, and that it would deplete the manhood of Australia. Now my conception of the policy of conscription is, not that it should be administered in such a way as to take the last man out of Australia, but that the Government should discriminate and have authority to say which man should be taken for service abroad, and which man should be left in Australia to carry on essential interests here, because a man might be more profitably employed, and be more valuable, within the Commonwealth than if he were sent abroad.  state of affairs then. The man with money would stay behind, and the poor beggar who had none would have to go.",29
246,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The honourable member must have a very poor conception of the democratic spirit of this Parliament if he holds that view. I am surprised that a supporter of the Labour party since 1910 should now declare Parliament to be no longer a democratic institution. My idea is that if the Government consider it necessary, they should submit this question to the people either in their Government policy, or as another referendum, and that it should be placed before the electors in exactly the way it is intended to be applied. At the present time we are recruiting something like 4,000 men per month throughout Australia; but if any honourable member investigates the figures, Le will find a great proportion of these recruits are I young men from eighteen to twenty years of age. Is it creditable that the youugei men of this community should be so largely drawn upon to supply the recruits wanted to furnish reinforcements to our soldiers? Unfortunately, the manhood of Australia- I refer to the men between twenty and forty-five years of age-ar e not enrolling in anything like the same ver- numbers as the younger men, and it certainly would not be creditable to this Parliament if this were allowed to continue. The question should be submitted to the people again, and the Government should have authority to determine which men should Temain in Australia and which should go to the front. I know there are certain industries from which the men cannot be taken, but there are certain other industries in which the places of men could readily be taken by women, and their duties be discharged just as efficiently. For instance, we have not a single woman in Australia acting as a tram conductor, and we know that there are thousands of them so employed in Great Britain.  for the women of Australia, thank God.",31
247,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I am satisfied that if volunteers were asked for from women there would be a very satisfactory response, and if the honourable member had seen how ""women are carrying on work in the munition factories in Great Britain he would realise that they are inspired by just the same spirit as the men who have gone out to fight in defence of their country. There are clerical and other positions that could be filled by women, the men being released for service. The Government should give consideration to this question of submitting the subject of compulsory service abroad again to the people before the elections are held. I do not intend to pledge myself against such a course. I desire now to make a few remarks in reference to Senator Watson's charges and the resignation of Senator Ready. Honourable members on the Opposition side have made all sorts of innuendoes regarding the peculiarity of Senator Ready's resignation. That gentleman is a member of their own party.",31
248,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,He is not.,32
249,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"He was, up t ill the time he resigned from Parliament, apparently a trusted member of that party. Whatever outside people may say and believe in their individual capacity, it appears extraordinary that no member on the Opposition side has brought forward any evidence th»t would indicate a serious charge on the Ready resignation ",32
250,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Agre e to a Royal Commission.,32
251,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Honourable members opposite desire a fishing inquiry. I tell the Committee frankly that I am disappointed that the Watson charges have not been taken in hand by the Government. I would have been pleased if some tribunal had been appointed to clear up the mystery. The attitude of the Leader of the Opposition in bringing forward a motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission was equivalent to an endeavour to take the business out of the hands of the Government. It was a motion of the kind that is brought forward for the purpose of embarrassing a Government. If the honourable member for Yarra will look up parallel cases he will find that, when charges have been made, the Government have been asked to indicate what they intended to do. His standand-deliver motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission was tantamount to an endeavour on the part of the Opposition to take the control of business out of the hands of the Government.",32
252,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The same action was taken in New South Wales by Mr Wade in respect to charges against Mr A r t h u r Griffith.,32
253,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I believe that the constitutional and technical difficulties supposed to stand in the way of the Prime Minister allowing the Royal Commission to be appointed have been exaggerated. I do not believe that an independent in quiry into the charges made by Senator Watson would have entailed the resignation of the Prime Minister, and I regret that he did not take the bold course of nominating on his own initiative, on behalf of - the Government and the House, a proper tribunal. It is not for us to pronounce judgment as to whether the charges are true or not. If I have to express my own opinion it wall be in favour of the Prime Minister's denial. But the great outside public expects Parliament to vindicate its own honour in its own way, and not to depend on an outside tribunal at all. Utterances in Parliament are privileged, and honourable members do not come within the jurisdiction of civil tribunals in respect of doings within the Legislature. Consequently, the onus and responsibility are thrown on Parliament to vindicate itself in its own way. In those circumstances I regret that the Prime Minister did not take the bold course I have indicated. He has taken action to bring these charges before a Court of Justice, but - the other line of action would have been more in conformity with the traditions of this House of Parliament, would have been better from the point of view of the public, and would have done more to safeguard the honour of Parliament. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It would have involved the resignation of the Government.",32
254,Mr SAMPSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I know that statement has been made. I have consulted some, but not of course all, the authorities. I do not think that the Marconi case, in England, involved the resignation of Ministers. On other occasions in our Australian Parliaments charges against Ministers haye been investigated without necessarily involving resignation. But in any case, during the stress of war, and on the eve of an election, why should not this Parliament create its own precedent? No constitutional difficulties or technicalities should stand in the way of an inquiry of this kind if it be desirable that it be held. I do not believe that one elector in Australia would have expected the Prime Minister to resign, if he had decided, in order to remove all possibility of suspicion, to appoint a tribunal to inquire ' into charges which he has denied. The matter might have been determined in two or three days during which his administrative work could have been carried out by his deputy. However, in the absence of any other form of investigation, I hail with some satisfaction the announcement by the Prime Minister that he intends to take action in a Court of law, and if Senator Watson does not plead privilege, I hone that the Court will deal with the case soon, so that we may contest the election on broad question of principle and policy instead of indulging in recriminations which would obscure the more important questions, particularly the paramount question of winning .the war, and enabling Australia, as an integral part of the Empire, to do its share to achieve that desirable end.  [3.22] - In my earlier remarks I referred to a leading article in the Hobart Mercury, and I attributed the sudden change in the attitude of Senators Bakhap and Keating to the influence brought to bear upon them by that journal. The honourable member for Wimmera stated thac he would welcome the appointment of a proper tribunal to investigate the ReadyWatson business, and that no request for such an inquiry had been made. Honourable members know that the Leader of the Opposition moved a motion to have these charges dealt with by a proper tribunal, and Government supporters, with one exception, voted against it . The honourable member for Wimmera said that he voted against the motion because it was tantamount to taking the business out of the hands of the Government. A division having been taken on that motion, and the Government having won, why do they not now of their own volition move for an investigation'! The remarks of the honourable member prove that he, with others on the Government side, has been influenced, by the force of public opinion during the last few days, and he is now pretending to be in favour of that which he and others voted against on Priday last. Honourable members know that the Prime Minister said. "" If honourable members require a Royal Commission or any other inquiry into the matter, in God's name let them have it . "" Why has not the Leader of the Government given effect to tbese words, and appointed a tribunal to investigate an accusation which is the most serious ever levelled against a public man in this country? """,32
255,Mr WISE,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The Watson case?  whole unsavoury business.,33
256,Mr WISE,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The Watson case does not affect the Ready resignation.  quiry into the one matter will involve the other. I still believe that as a result of the views expressed by the Hobart Mercury two senators, who are Government supporters, resolved to vote against the prolongation of the life of this Parliament.",33
257,Mr FINLAYSON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"I do not, think that applies to the honourable member for Franklin.  said before that the remark does not apply to him. But the other two senators decided to vote against the Government, and for that reason the Government did not proceed with the motion for the prolongation of Parliament. Therefore it is unfair to say that the defeat of that motion, and the consequent non-representation of Australia at the Imperial Conference, was caused by members on this side of the House. The t r u th is that two members of the Government party were so disgusted with the unsavoury action of the Ministry in regard to the WatsonReady incidents that they would not stand by them.",33
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Senato r Ferricks in the town hall expressed his pleasure that he had prevented the delegation going to England.  orable senator was not responsible for the Australian delegation not going to London. The fact that no delegation is to leave these shores is due to the actions of the Government in bringing about a state of affairs that alienated the sympathy of two of their supporters. I may say that I did not evade my responsibility to deal conscientiously with the prolongation proposals. Some people may think that in submitting myself for re-election my prospects are not bright. I do not fear the result of the forthcoming contest, but though my seat may not be a safe one, I shall never, for the sake of my own political safety, agree to the tactics that were resorted to in order to bring about a prolongation of Parliament. The Prime Minister asked what was the policy of the party on this side in reference to the conduct of the war. Beyond abuse and vague platitudes the policy of the Government, in regard to the war amounts to nothing beyond what is proposed from this sid» "" f the House. The Government say that because of the vote of the people on the 28th October they will stand by the voluntary system, and it does not matter how many platitudes they indulged in and how they appeal to popular sentiment. They cannot get awav from the fact that they are now prepared to follow the policy laid down by the Australian Labour party, and adhered to by it fro m the beginning of the war. The policy of our party is that upon whioh wo were elected two and a half years ago. Honourable members opposite who left the Australian Labour party interfered with the voluntary system of recruiting by supporting conscription. We, on this side, / have always stood by the voluntary system, and are prepared to go on with it . Every man on this side knows that in the interests of the Empire and of the country, the war must be won. cusations of disloyalty will prevent the bulk of the people from believing that. We stand for the voluntary system, and if returned will do everything in our power to give the fullest effect to it . will be carried on as it was u n t i l the October last, by which date Australia had sent 300,000 of its manhood across the seas. The only way in which to give full effect to the voluntary system is to allow the party that has always believed in it , and has stuck to it , to take charge of the government of the country. The men returning from the front will believe that if we get into power we shall provide a scheme of repatriation which will be honest, and will properly cater for those who have done their duty to the Empire. Last night an honourable member opposite told the Government straight out-and I endorse what, lie said-that the amount provided"" for the benefit of our returned men is equivalent to only £ 2 6 a man. The Government cannot say that they are doing their duty in regard to the repatriation of soldiers. They have delayed too long. It is the policy of the Labour party to stand to an effective voluntary system, and to see that those who have done their duty to the Empire shall not be neglected. In addition, the Australian Labour party will , if returned to power, stand for the building up of the industries of this country, in order to provide suitable employment for our men when they come back. No one can say that it is a right thing for this country to import something like £14,000,000 worth of goods annually more than are exported. Should we continue to do so, we must ultimately become bankrupt. The honourable member for Wimmera has admitted here recently what he did not say during the conscription campaign-that it would be disastrous to bleed the rural districts of their manhood. Even without conscription being imposed the farming districts have been depleted of labour, and the farmers have not been able to properly attend to their work. I know the effect of the home service proclamation. It showed that, if conscription were resorted to, production in this country would be almost impossible. Very little exception has been taken to the fact that the Government has hitherto denied the farmers representation on the Wheat and Wool Boards.",33
259,Mr WISE,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"It does not rest - with them. No ac- Mr. JOSEPH COOK - They have given it .  only on the eve of an election. The farmers will not be caught with this kind of chaff. They will ask why it was not It done earlier. It has been done on the eve 28th of an election, just as a mere election dodge j in the same way as it has been decided to give the sugar millers of Queensland a bribe of £500,000.",34
260,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The Government will be giving bonuses to every one before the elections are over.  Had conscription been carried, the position of the farmers would be still worse than it is, and they would have no representation on these boards. In many cases so many of the farmers' sons have gone to the war that production is seriously in terfered with. It has been asked why should not Australia do as much as Great Britain. The reply is that our circumstances are different fro m those of Great Britain . The men in camp there can easily be released to take part in farm work. But our men, when they are sent abroad, go 14,000 miles away from home. It was stated in the newspapers recently that some thousands of Australians in camp on Salisbury Plain were released to take part in farming operations in Great Britain . People talk with their tongues in their cheeks about the promise of the "" last man and the last shilling."" They know that such a thing is not practicable. Be necessary."" The Mother Country would not ask for such a sacrifice from this distant outpost of Empire. Until the 28th October, the country was doing admirably in the matter of recruiting. The Treasurer has pointed out that the war expenditure for the coming year will be something like £80,000,000. That is a crushing burden for a young country to bear, even under the voluntary system, but what would have been the position had we taken what even some honourable members opposite now admit would have fatal step, and adopted conscription ? The Treasurer has not indicated how the interest which must be paid on this money is to be raised. The Government, however, have given some indication that it is their intention to ru n away from the scheme for the taxation of war profits. If there is anything in the statement that there are meat barons in Australia who are supplying our troops with rotten meat, some of those who have been making huge profits in that way will escape taxation under the proposals of the present Government. I believe there is a great deal in the contention of the honourable member for Maribyrnong that the Government will come along presently with a proposal to meet our huge expenditure by the taxation of kerosene, tea, and other things used by the poorer classes of the people. No one will deny that in connection with the constitution of the Wheat Board and the Wool Board an injustice was done to the growers of wheat and producers of wool in denying them representation, although for the purpose of the elections an attempt has been made to remedy that injustice at the latest hour; but I should also like to say to the Postmaster-General, before he leaves the chamber, that the residents of the country districts have been in censed by his action in robbing them of very necessary facilities which make all the difference between isolation and civilization. Mai l services and other postal facilities have been cut down in the in terests of what the Government call economy. It is strange that this economy is always achieved by means which can be regarded as nothing but an attack upon people who have to live in adverse circumstances in the back places of the country. It is admitted on all sides that the men who go out into the back blocks are the mainstay of the country, and should be catered for. Instead of their facilities being reduced they should be increased in order to encourage others to follow their example. According to all we hear, and particularly from the Prime Minister, coming electoral contest is going - to be a bitter one. I shall do nothing to make it bitter. I shall make no appeal to the people in the way suggested by the action of members opposite. Only in this morning's newspapers we have seen a tele been a gram sent by the Prime Minister to Adelaide, in which he says that the coming election is going to be a war election, and that the Labour party are against assisting in recruiting. So far as the recruiting movement is concerned, since it was taken in hand by the present Director-General of Recruiting all the assistance given to it has come from this side. The Prime Minister has addressed only one meeting since the inauguration of the present recruiting movement.",34
261,Mr GROOM,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"The honourable member knows that every speech delivered by the Prime Minister has been a patriotic appeal to the whole of Australia.  honourable gentleman may put his own construction upon them, but I have seen no such appeals in the speeches of the Prime Minister. We are today faced with a most unholy alliance on the other side. Two political factions have come together that were anathema to one another u n t i l yesterday. I have the greatest possible sympathy with those who, up to the 28th October, always supported the democratic jprinciples of the Pisher Government, who did such good work in order to win the war and defeat our enemies, but who are now deluded into joinin g forces with the Pusion party, because that party brazenly claims to be more sincere in regard to winning the war. When they remember the unseemly wrangle that took place while the Fusion was being brought' about to decide whether the Liberals should have five, and the Hughesites six, members in the new Ministry, or vice versa, the people will not believe that the Fusion party opposite are going to the electorates to win the war. On the contrary, they will regard them as the' "" SOS.""-sav e our skins-party , the members of which are out to save their political skins in the most degrading way possible by an appeal to the electors under the cloak of patriotism. I shall make a clear and clean fight in my electorate, and I have the the fullest confidence that the electors will not be led astray by the introduction of side issues, but will again return to power the party who, up to the 28th October last, did such good work to enhonorable able Australia to shoulder to the fullest extent her responsibilities in connection with the war, and which will continue to do so to the end - steamer freights.",35
262,Mr CORSER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"Wide Bay) [3.45] - I shall not delay the Committee for more than a few minutes, but I think it is just to the Government and the country that a denial should be given as' early as possible to the statements which are published in the A^e and the Argus of this morning. It is stated in those newspapers that the Government given to the sugar-growers of Queensland £500,000, which had already been received, and which. ought to go to the Consolidated Revenue. Nothing of the sort has been done. There is another statement published in the Age leader which reflects upon all who have been advocating that justice should be done to the sugar industry of Queensland. quote the following: A BVmple calculation shows that the Commonwealth Government intend to raise the price of raw sugar to between f20 and £22 per ton. Before the war the producers were content to get about £12 per ton, but henceforth they will receive well over £21. I deny the t r u th of that statement, on evidence supplied by the best authority on the subject in Australia. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company in their reports show that m 1911 the price of sugar was £ 1 3 8s. 6d. per ton, and there was a bonus of £ 3 , making the full price £ 1 6 8s. 6d. . In 1912 the price was £ 1 2 17s. 2d., which, with the £ 3 bonus, brought it up to £ 1 5 17s. 2d. In 1913, when, it will doubtless be remembered, the Excise duty was abolished, the price of sugar was fixed at £ 1 5 17s. 6 j d . per ton. It is necessary to correct the false statements which have appeared in the newspapers to which I have referred, or otherwise the people would be misled.",36
263,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,The price is only £ 6 a ton more now than it was.,36
264,Mr CORSER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,Nothin g of the sort.,36
265,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,What is the price now?,36
266,Mr CORSER,INTERNMENT OF PEOPLEOF,"We hope to get £ 2 2 7s. per to n ; but, in considering the in creased prioe, honourable members must take into account the increased cost of production owing to the increase in the price of manure, the land taxes-Federa l and State-the super-income tax, the in crease of wages between the MCNaughton and Dickson awards, apart from the Dickson award, the increased of living, the increased cost of bags, [403] - machinery, and railage, and increased We must leave it to the people of Queensland to decide whether there should be a' revision of the Dickson award. It is the duty of the Government of Queensland to see that such a revision.takes place.",36

I give the statement an emphatic denial. I did attend a meeting, but all that I did'was to tell the people who assembled that I was opposed to conscription, and would fight it at every stage. The Primo Minister has been making uso of the statement to which the honourable member for Denison I gave utterance, and T take this opportunity of "" scotching"" it before it goes any further. The Postmaster-General, when speaking the other night, said that he had been connected with the Labour movement for many years, and that he was one of those who helped to build it up. I have been looking up some old records. In 1891, when the Labour party decided to run candidates for Parliament, and selected three for Canterbury, the. Postmaster-General stood as an independent in opposition to the Labour candidate.",36

If there is one matter in which honourable members of Parliament are keenly interested it is an Electoral Bill, and we are all anxious to know what the new Electoral Bill contains. We are told that it deals only or mainly with the soldiers' votes, but, as the Prime Minister said, taking the soldiers' votes on a straight out question of "" Yes "" or "" No "" is a very different matter from taking their votes for candidates in divisions. Metropolitan members, particularly in the big cities, know that some streets run into two or three electorates.

It is one of the dearest wishes of many honourable members all round the House to re-open the Tariff and correct many of the existing anomalies. The point is, however, that we cannot do that at the present time for the reasons I have stated. As to the Darling Downs constituency, it is true that the Divisional Returning Officer for Darling Downs is spoken of as a candidate for the seat, and I have here a statement by Mr Oldham regarding the matter. It appears that Mr Oldham's attention has been called to a statement in the Brisbane Daily Standard of 19th February, as follows:It is rumoured here that Mr J. Wilson (Divisional Returning Officer for Darling Downs) has been selected to oppose Mr L. E. Groom for Darling Downs. If this is so, Mr. Groom will have the fight of his life, as Mr. Wilson will undoubtedly prove the strongest Labour candidate that ever took the field in that electorate. The Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth has had this paragraph brought under his notice, and, in reply to an inquiry by him, has received the following statement from Mr Wilson:You have my assurance that the statement concerning myself in the accompanying paragraph is incorrect, and that the strictly non-partisan administration since my inception, which has earned me the confidence of all interested in local politics, will continue as long as Iremain an electoral oflicial.
