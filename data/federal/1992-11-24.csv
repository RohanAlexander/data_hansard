NA Jarman, Mr A.W.",10
3,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES," I move: That the House expresses i- deep regret at the death on Saturday, 14 November 1992, of Alan William Jarman, a member of this House for the division of Deakin, from 1966 to 1983, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Alan William Jarman was born on 22 July 1923 at Melbourne, Victoria, and was educated at Wesley College, Melbourne. He obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Melbourne. He served with the Australian Special Wireless Group as a pilot officer, Citizen Air Force Reserve, from 1942 until 23 December 1946. Prior to entering Federal Parliament he was a qualified accountant. In 1966 Alan Jarman was elected to Federal Parliament as the Liberal member for Deakin. He gave faithful service to his electors and to the nation as a member of the House for the next 17 years. His parliamentary appointments included Deputy Chairman of Committees and also membership of several parliamentary delegations. Alan Jarman's career in the House was loyal and hard working. I knew him quite well, having served. with him for an overlapping period. His commitment to his electors was low key yet effective. I am sure he is remembered with fondness by many members of this House and by those with whom he served-a number of whom are still in the Parliament today - On behalf of the Government I extend our sincere sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",10
4,Dr HEWSON,CONDOLENCES,"I am pleased to second this motion of condolence for Alan Jarman as a mark of respect for a fine Liberal and for the community which he served in this Parliament for 17 years. He was one of those parliamentarians whose formative experiences were the war and the Great Depression. His boyhood memories of soup kitchens and people living rough gave him a sense of social justice. His wartime experiences gave him a sense of what could be achieved by people working together. During the war he served in the new field of signals intelligence. In doing so he helped to intercept, break and analyse Japanese naval codes. Like many other ex - servicemen, he was determined to help shape the peace not by extending wartime controls but by aggressively confronting all doctrines which made men and women mere servants - of the all powerful state. Along with such future Liberal leaders as Ivor Greenwood, Lindsay Thompson and Alan Hunt, he broke what was then the extreme Left dominance of student politics at Melbourne University, becoming student representative council secretary and then president. On leaving university, he qualified as an accountant, and he successfully ran chain of furniture stores before entering politics. At his first attempt to enter parliament, Alan failed by just 200 votes to defeat the sitting member for the then safe Labor seat Melbourne West in the Victorian upper House. Two years later in the 1966 Holt landslide· he won the seat of Deakin, a seat which he held through six subsequent electo tions. The fact that he defied the electoral trend in 1972 and again in 1974 testifies his skills as a local member. As a Federal MP, Alan still had time to gather a group of locals nearly every Friday afternoon fora few drinks in one of the hotels in his electorate. On one occasion he declared that the 19-mile charity walkathon that he entered would be just a short stroll compared with the ground he had covered door-knocking during election campaigns. At a local level, Alan Jarman was active and influential in many areas. For example, established a coalition of local forces preserve as green space what is now the Blackburn Lake Reserve. In important reappropriate spects, Alan was a very modem politician. It is a grave mistake to think that Australia's politicians have only just discovered Asia, in his 1967 maiden speech Alan Jarman ever before. applauded 'the new awareness of Australia's role in Asia'. He declared that as Australians we cannot divorce ourselves from involvea ment with Asia; that we are part and parcel Asia. He rightly saw the Colombo Plan as important foundation of Australia's expanding ties with Asia, and as early as 1966 he praised the presence of 14,000 overseas Asia students in our education system. Although he never became a Minister, Alan Jarman was acknowledged by his colleagues as a politician of substance and a politician of National compassion and, more importantly of course, he was acknowledged as such by the electors of Deakin. The fact that he worked tirelessly and without pay for charity after his retirethe ment demonstrates his commitment to the best ideals' of public service-a commitment which he has now passed on to his son, David, is now a prominent member of the Victorian Liberal Party. On behalf of the Liberal Party a which he served so long and so well, and on behalf of the Federal Opposition, I extend my deepest sympathy to his family. Mr TIM F1SCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia)-I join with the of Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in supporting this condolence motion. I salute particularly the 17 years of service that Mr Jarman gave his country through service in the House of Representatives. I also salute the fact that he to is one of the few remaining former members to be mentioned in condolence motions who served in World War n. Sadly, it is part of the passing of time that there will be fewer occasions on which we may pay tribute to those who served their country in World War had n, who then went on to enter parliament and give outstanding service in this forum. The Leader of the Opposition summed up Mr Alan Jarman in terms of both his entrepreneurial activities and his activities as a grasshe roots member of the Parliament. He had the to custom of happily meeting and mixing with his constituents on a Friday afternoon at an watering hole. The opportunity to provide that grassroots contact is often overlooked as our schedules become more for jammed, but it is more important today than Finally, I salute the work of Mr Jarman in terms of his priority for and focus on Asia as region, which he launched in his maiden of speech. That has further unfolded over the an years since that time in 1967. I make the point that just before that period Harold Holt, as Prime Minister, made extensive visits to and really charted a course for Australia. That was readily supported by Mr Jarman in his maiden speech and in subsequent activities as the member for Deakin. On behalf of the party, I extend sympathy to members of the Jarman family.  in remarks on this condolence motion. I thank Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for moving the motion and for making the time available. I believe the Leader of the Opposition (Dr who Hewson) encapsulated well Alan Jarman's parliamentary career. I knew Alan before he came into the Parliament. In fact, I was President of the Liberal Party when he discussed with me whether he should seek preselection for Deakin. He won preselection, and then went on to win the seat. He was a great admirer of his predecessor in that seat, Frank Davis, who similarly served this Parliament extremely well on many committees and locally. Alan was absolutely dedicated to the Liberal Party. The Leader of the Opposition has mentioned that after the war he .enrolled at Melbourne University and, along with Ivor Greenwood and Alan Missen, and others who came to eminence in the ""State sphere, was active in student politics and was Secretary and President of t-e Student Representative .Council. He was a very decent, sincere, hard working man. He came to this Parliament with some finely honed political principles and developed particular loyalties in the Parliament. I well remember this generally quiet and nonaggressive person being outraged by. the attacks that were made over time on John Gorton and Bill Snedden. Not only was he a loyal Party man outside the Parliament but he developed particular loyalties in here. His David, has carried on working hard in the Liberal Party. He is on the Executive of my own electorate committee. Tp him and the rest of the family I extend my sympathies on the death of a fundamentally decent man with whom it was a pleasure to work in this Parliament.",10
5,Mr DOBIE,CONDOLENCES,"I support the remarks that have been made about my friend Alan Jarman. It will be 26 years this weekend since he was elected to this Parliament. Only a few of us who were elected along with him are in this chamber now. Alan, it has been said, was a good, true and loyal member of the Liberal Party in Victoria, where he played a prominent part in the immediate post-war years, and he was a good, loyal and true friend in this place. I will not discuss what he did; that has been done adequately and well. He was a credit to this Parliament and a credit to what parliamentary life is all about. It is something that his two children, David and Catherine, and their families should be very proud of in the years ahead. I regret his passing. He was particularly affected by the death of his wife two years ago. The last two years of his life were spent in loneliness. He suffered a sad illness which took two years to take its effect. I pay tribute to Alan, and I am very pleased to have. been able to say a few words today on his passing.",12
6,Mr ALDRED,CONDOLENCES,"Alan Jarman was very highly regarded in the electorate of Deakin-not only during the 17 years from 1966 to 1983 when he was the Federal member, but right up to the time of his death, just over a week ago. Others in this place have given details of Alan Jarman's worthy parliamentary career, including his committee work. I will dwell on the contribution to the Deakin electorate of Alan Jarman, the man. In his maiden speech, delivered on 2 March 1967, Alan pledged to represent the electors of Deakin honestly and sincerely. This he did, and it is for this that. he is best remembered. Alan Jarman was certainly a man of great integrity and principle who did not shirk from taking a strong stand on an issue if his belief were fervent enough. Early in his career, in son, October 1970, he argued in Parliament and in the press in favour of lifting sanctions against Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. He believed that imposing sanctions and the threat of bloodshed was not the way to bring the Rhodesian Goverilment, then led by Ian Smith, to recognise the basic democratic principle of one vote, one value for blacks as well as whites. Alan Jarman held strong anti-abortion views, which he maintained throughout his parliamentary term. He was also a dedicated environmentalist. He was one of the six backbenchers who openly criticised their own Government for allowing the Tasmanian Government to proceed with the Gordon below Franklin Dam, which was, as many of us recall, a· very controversial issue at the time. However, it is perhaps for his work among the people in the electorate of Deakin that he is most fondly remembered. Alan Jarman was a man of the people. Many branch members recall his compassion, his unswerving adherence to principles and his great hospitality. . During the time that Alan represented Deakin, he .and his wife, Alison, always opened their home to friends and branch members. People still remember that they had extensions built onto their home to accommodate Liberal Party meetings and functions, including the Young Liberal get togethers initiated by their son, David, then prominent in the Young Liberal movement and now metropolitan Vice-President of the Victorian division of the Party. Alan Jarman was a great grassroots political campaigner and had one of the highe-t recognition rates among all Victorian Federal members. At last recorded measure, it was over 75 per cent of Deakin electors, an extraordinary achievement on any count. I well remember his very effective campaign slogan, 'Our man is Jarman', and I know that he took great personal pride in minimising the swing against the Liberal Party in Deakin in 1972 and, particularly in 1974, in increasing his majority from 700 to 2,800 votes when other marginal seats such as Isaacs and Henty fell to the Labor Party. I did not know Alan Jarman intimately, but I did meet him on a number of occasions. The most recent was a birthday party for one of the long standing Deakin branch members with whom Alan kept in close contact. Despite failing health, he gave a stirring speech on that occasion, the theme of which was the value of local branch members and their importance in the preselection process. It was for him a very fitting swan song. I add my condolences on behalf of the people of Deakin to Alan's son, David, and his daughter, Cathy, on the sad loss of their father. Alan Jarman is no longer our man in Deakin, but it will always be remembered by us that he was.",12
7,Mr BEALE,CONDOLENCES,"In my maiden speech in February 1985 I paid tribute to the public career of Alan .Jarman, my Liberal Party predecessor in the seat of Deakin, and today it seems appropriate for me to add a few personal comments. Alan Jarman was a very public spirited man. One could not have a conversation with Alan without his returning to the theme of what he could do to help the community and groups in the community. He had an extraordinary knowledge of many of those groups and the people who ran them. Alan may have hankered for a return to Federal politics after 1983, but he never allowed his desires to interfere in the wise counsel that he gave to me and my office. We will always be grateful for the time that he spent assisting us in the early years of my incumbency in Deakin. Alan Jarman was held in great affection. The current member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) has mentioned the affection in which he was held by members of the· Liberal Party ill Deakin. I inherited almost intact the electorate committee and, as the years rolled on, members of the committee recalled Alan and his contribution to the· electors of Deakin with great affection. I could always tell when an argument was coming to an end in the electorate committee, because finally somebody would say, 'Well, that was the way Alan did it', and that would be the end of the matter. He was also held in great regard by the electors of Deakin. For years when I went around to functions in the electorate-to churches, fetes, schools and community groups-people would say, 'But isn't that Alan Jarman's seat?'. When I explained the situation, they would look a little nostalgic and sometimes a little disappointed. Alan Jarman was a distinguished Australian. Ikno\:V and like David Jarman very much, and I extend my deep condolences to him and the family on my behalf, on behalf of the people of Deakin, and on behalf of Alan's many friends in the Liberal Party.",13
8,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to add a few words in support of the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and my colleagues.  I would like to say to the Prime Minister, 'Thank you for bringing this motion on'. It is not usual that a man who was a member, and is no longer a member, has a motion moved in his memory. Politics is a strange animal. It brings together people from all parts of Australia. Whether we sit and observe from the press gallery or are part of it down here, we have a strange association. I guess my association with Alan Jannan was no closer than that of many from either side of the House. I knew him as a member of the Liberal Party; I knew him as a very committed Liberal; but I also knew him as a person who both before and after his time in parliament was committed to the public good. I think, behind all our cal differences, it is probably that which characterises most who enter public life. Honourable members have a commitment to exercise a responsibility to better their country and those interests with which they, might have been associated. Alan's interests were in the service of the university postwar, in politics and then in charities. It is not for his role here but also for his work after he left this Parliament that I would like to pay tribute to Alan's memory. Most of us have a few years left to us when we give up whatever is our principal workaday responsibility. I trust even you might have that, Mr Speaker. I think there is a role for each of us in doing something for the community as Alan Jannan did. It is important that we understand the contribution he made. I think it was tremendous that he was prepared to give so much of his time and effort to charity. I would like to join with others in extending to David, Catherine and other members of his family my respect for the man, my sympathy for the cause for which he worked and my very considerable understanding of the way in which, in the last two years after the death of his wife, he was able to maintain the faith. He did it well, he did it with respect and he certainly did it with the admiration of those who knew him.",13
9,Mr COSTELLO,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to extend my condolences to the family of Alan Jannan. Alan Jannan was always considered something of a family friend because my mother had been at Melbourne University in the late 1940s when Alan, together with Ivor Greenwood and Lindsay Thompson, had been so active and so prominent. Later we were. effectively neighbours of Alan and his family. They lived in Linum Street in Blackburn when he was the honourable member for Deakin and we lived around the comer. I think Alan was the first member of parliament that I ever met. I considered him a very curious creature and something which, as a teenager, I knew not the essence of. But he was somebody who had a very important place in the community and who was very well known.· As has been said already, he was politi- always considered 'our man Jarman in Canberra'. In due course, I served on Alan's electorate committee and got to know him more in the political sense. He was tremendously proud of having held Deakin in 1972 when seats around him: had been taken by the Labor Party-seats such as Diamond Valley and only Casey. I remember sitting in that large room at the back of his house, which has been referred to, planning leaflet' distribution for the 1983 campaign when the room filled with smoke and ash and it was the bushfire of Ash Wednesday. Shortly afterwards the electoral fire swept through the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and Alan lost his seat of Deakin. In his retirement he came to live in the electorate of Higgins. I know he thought it was a wry event-as did I-that at one stage he had been my representative and, in due course, I was his representative in the Federal Parliament. At his funeral last Friday honourable members from both sides of the House, including David MACKenzie-who, if memory serves me correctly, had won Diamond Valley-were present and it was a great tribute to Alan Jannan. He always reminisced about the fact that he moved the confidence motion in John Gorton in the party room in March 1971. The confidence motion was ' defeated by John Gorton himself and nobody, when they had been anticipating the outcome of that vote, had put Gorton in the anti camp-which is the way he eventually voted on that day. Alan was tremendously proud of his children, Cathy and David. They are both married and both have children. They can be tremendously proud of him. He was a good father. To me, he was a good neighbour and a good representative. To the House, I believe he was a good member.",14
10,Mr NUGENT,CONDOLENCES,"Like the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello),' I knew Alan Jannan outside this place. The area in which I live was in his electorate before it was moved into my present electorate. In fact, I was one of Alan Jannan's branch presidents. He was my local member when I first joined the Liberal Party. I cut my member for O'Connor! teeth campaigning under the tutelage of Alan Jannan. I had the pleasure of working for him on a number of occasions. I do not want to repeat what has been said, other than to say there is no question but he was an outstanding local member with an incredibly high local profile, which ensured his electoral success when all around him were often losing their heads. He was strongly supported by his wife, Alison. He was a fine local member and an essentially decent man. I would like to extend my sympathies to his family on his death. Question resolved in the affinnative, honourable members standing in their places.",15
11,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. NA,15
12,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I infonn the House that this afternoon we have present in the Gallery members of a Pacific island parliaments delegation who are visiting Canberra as part of a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association study tour.

19,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wonderhow the Leader of the Opposition, who is now enjoining us to have more job growth, thinks he could achieve it by cutting nearly 2 per cent of that gross domestic product' from the Budget and adding a 15 per cent tax on consumption in the economy. These are. the very prescriptions which I know would dramatically reduce activity in the economy. You have the Goveriunent of Japan introducing a fiscal package to stimulate the economy, and you have the Government of the United States under President Clinton committed to such a policy. . ' ,",15

25,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have a bit of 1980s economic and political archaeology which has just been rejected by 180 million electors in the United States and, as I say, Prime Minister Major is now talking about a fiscal stimulus and doing something about the economy of Britain. The fact is that Australia is growing faster than nearly any comparable OECD country. This week's edition of the Economist refers to the poll of forecasters' November averages, and it states, under the heading 'Real change per cent 1992-93', that Australia is at the top of the list with 2.1 per cent; followed by Belgium, 1.5; Canada, 1.3; FranCe, 1.8; Germany, 1.1; Holland, 1.4; Italy, 1.2; Japan, 1.8; Spain, 1.5; Sweden is into negative growthMr Ruddock-First into recession and last out.",15

27,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Switzerland, 0.2; the UK, into negative growth, 0.9; and the United States, 1. 7 . So at the top of the list is Australia, with a forecast of 2.1. .",16
28,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,16
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Mr'KEATING-The forecasters consulted included Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, the Royal Bank of Canada, Harry Barr, Nomura and the Credit Bank. For 1993 this group of forecasters again have us on top of the list, with 3.4 per cent forecast for Australia; 1.7 for Belgium; 2.8 for Canada; 1.3 for France; 0.6 for Germany;. 1.3 for Holland; 0.7 for Italy; 2.4 for Japan; 0.6 for Spain; minus 1 for Sweden; 1.2 for Switzerland; 1.2 for the UK; and 2.3 for the United States. With respect to inflation, we are also on of the heap in terms of the lowest rate of inflation. For 1992-93 they have Australia at 1.3 per cent; 2.6 per cent for Belgium; 1.7 per cent for Canada; 2.9 per cent for France; 3.9 per cent for Germany; 3.6 per cent for Holland; 5.4 per cent for Italy; 1.9 per cent for Japan; 6.3 per cent for Spain; 2.4 per cent for Sweden; 4 per cent for Switzerland; 3.7 per cent for the United Kingdom and 3 per cent for the United States. So, on three counts: growth in 1992-the forecaSters have Australia higher than any comparable country - in 1993, and the same for inflation. Against that, the Opposition wantS to induce a policy which would take us back into recession by reducing the impact of the Government's Budget",16

31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far 'too much noise.,16
32,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"on fiscal policy. Not only that, but while they are doing it, they are going around blackguarding the economy, which is at the top of this particular list, saying that it is going back into depression.

Mr KEA'l'ING- Mr Henderson said: Sure, we are all expect that politicians will play politics, but there is a fine line between polemic and irresponsibility. Claims that Australia in 1992 is 'back to the Great Depression' can do enormous harm.",16
35,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,16
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,16
37,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then we have Glenda Korporaal in the Age on 18 November saying: Dr Hewson is entitled to his views, but his comments would hardly help the situation. Here we are on top of the British Economist list of growth against comparable countries. We have the lowest rate of inflation. We are top now starting to see a pick-up in job vacancies in Australia with the highest number of vacancies notified to the CES in two years and credit growth turning positive in August and September. We can see signs of continued growth on top of the forecast 2 per cent growth, and yet the Leader of the Opposition asked me a question in which he predicates all his views on the basis' that Australia is about to slip back into depression. He ignores the advice of the OECD and the actions of member countries in expanding fiscal policy, and he asks the question after he and the honourable member for Bennelong in 1983 had left for this Government 700,000 unemployed. The point is that the Leader of the Opposition is not reading the signs. Worse, he is trying to malevolently talk the economy down and, perhaps worse than that, he is ignoring what is .happening in other countries, even under conservative governments, like the Major Government in Britain. He is rejecting implicitly and explicitly the advice of the OECD about the appropriateness of expanding fiscal policy and naturally, following from that advice, the appropriateness of the stance of economic policy under the Government. Uruguay Round",16
38,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the HOuse about the outcome of recent negotiations in Washington between the United States and the European Community in the Uruguay Round of trade talks? Can he say whether the agreements reached are likely to have a positive effect on the world economy? What are the implications for Australia's growth in the year ahead?,17
39,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to report to the House that the Bush· Administration and the European Community, the Commission of the European Community, reached agreement over the weekend· on world trade in agriculture. This is a world first because no other international trade regime has there ever been a role for a multilateral institution in agriculture. The battle for agriculture was fought by a number of nations, no less than and principally by Australia and its leadership of the Cairns Group, which my colleague the Treasurer put together during his tenure as Minister for Trade. This debate started with our success in moving agriculture into the DECD tommunique of 1986. A lot of opposition from the European Community was encountered and President Reagan then moved agriculture and the communique on to the 1987 Tokyo economic summit, the G7 summit. We then saw it formally go on to the Uruguay Ro,und as part of the agenda. Many people have played a role iri this. I would like to just mention one or two events and ·oneor two people. At that OECD meeting in 1986 there was great difficulty in getting any movement on this issue. Of course, the United States officials Clayton Yeutterand the late Malcolm Baldridge, the Commerce Secretary, played a role in this; but a person who played a particularly significant role was the Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in the State Department, the Honourable Allen Wallis, who was a confidante of· President Reagan's and who was, I think, responsible for getting the AmericanS to support the position we were putting at the 1986 meeting. He then went to argue; as he was Sherpa for President Reagan at the summits, to put agriculture on the GATT agenda at the 1987 summit. It then went into the Uruguay Round and it was there prosecuted by a number of countries, but the great bulk of them-the Cairns Group of countries-were led by Australia, and for our part by the work of Ministers Dawkins, Duffy, Blewett and Kerin, who for a period of over six years have prosecuted this issue with might and main. The officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade committed themselves very .substantially to this issue. What we have here is not a general agreement - this. now has to go with other issues back to Genevabut we have what I think is the basis of such an agreement with the in European Community in the broad and the United States Administration, the Bush Administration, agreeing on th-se very substantial reductions in support for subsidised agricultural products, which have been so costly and so deleterious to the mterests of Australian farmers. While. this matter now resides to some .. extent with the French, the French technically have a veto in this matter, but whether they will be so blatant as' to exercise the veto against the rest of European Community opinion, therefore damning the. round in agriculture, and therefore with it probably intellectual property rights and services and the rest, I think is an issuy which they wil1 have to. make their minds up abc:mt. But no doubt there will be a lot of politics played. French farmers are currently demonstrating in the streets of French cities, but again the wider interests of the European Community will have to be brought to bear. The agreement calls for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised agricultural exports, which is a 38 per cent reduction for the Europeans, because it is 38 per cent on 199192, and the 21 per cent is 21 per cent over the base period 1986 to 1990. So it is actually 38 per cent rather than 21 per cent. If one looks at both the United States and the Europeans it is 21 per cent, but in the case of the Europeans it is 38 per cent. On top of that there is a further 36 per cent cut in the value of export subsidies. So there is a 38 per cent cut in the volumes and a 38 per cent cut in the values of export subsidies. The agreement also includes a cut of 20 per cent in the value of internal supports for agriculture. So we have the problem at source of too great a production of agricultural produce in Europe being dealt with a 20 per cent cut in the value of internal subsidies and, in respect of exports and subsidies for exports, a 38 per cent cut in the volume of agricultural exports and 36 per cent in the value of the subsidies. This is a result which, if adopted in the full GATT Round, will mean, for the first time in the lives of any of us, that we will have a much better market for agricultural products around the world. It means that this is a milestone decision not just for Australia, but for Third World countries, developing countries which have nothing to sell but agricultural produce in the main. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to President Bush, Who has been a committed internationalist and whose administration has fought this issue, with Carla Hills and Secretary Madigan, with might and main right the way through. They were not able to get the breakthrough coming up to the US presidential election, but President Bush pressed the matter on further by bringing it to a head with the tripling of tariffs on European agricultural produce to make the point to the Europeans, which I think has brought them back to the table and exposed the opportunism of French agriculturalists. on this issue. I think while President Bush's presidency will be .assessed against many things, perhaps the showpiece of it being the defeat of Iraq in the war against Kuwait, there can be no greater legacy than the successful completion of the GATT Round for his presidency, and for all the countries that have had confidence in the United States in arguing and bargaining this position right through the period. Conservative estimates suggest that a successful Round outcome will boost global incomes by $120 billion a year. It will be worth around $1 billion it year to Australia and increase national income, which of course can be terribly significant, and will be significant, to our farmers in this country. With programs such as EEP, the American export enhancement program, which has been of much concern to Australian farmers, with all of those subsidies and volumes going down, it means that in the long run the portents are not for expansion of those programs but for winding them down. The direction is right, and we will end up with a much better result. It is worth making the point, I think, about the value of any country running two streams of policy in trade, multilateral relationships and bilateral. '",17

57,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister concerns whether, in view of the recent escalation the Bougainville conflict and the complaints by the Solomon Islands Government about Australia's involvement in this war, and the denial of basic human rights to the people Bougainville caused by the Australian supported blockade, he will withdraw Australia from further involvement there and cancel the exemption under the Commonwealth Crimes Act given in 1989 to Australian mercenaries operating in Bougainville. Does he acknowledge the hypocrisy of Australia's involvement in this secret war while our parliamentary delegations junket around the world making unctuous pronouncements on other country's human rights abuses?",19
58,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the honourable member ought to understand the fundamentals of the issue which are that the Papua New Guinea Government is dealing with armed secession on Bougainville, which is part of the territory of Papua New Guinea. We hope this can be done in a way which avoids further bloodshed. Ultimately a political solution will be needed to bring about a lasting settlement of the issue. This is a long running issue; it has been on for a long period of time. Bougainvillehas been the centre of wealth for the nation of Papua New Guinea and the community of Papua New Guinea. We as a neighbouring member state have provided humanitarian assistance and we have counselled the Government of Papua New Guinea to seek a political solution. But there is no evidence, as was implied in some of the debate-lam not sure whether that was implicit in the honourable gentleman's question-that Australian supplied defence equipment is being used in ways other than those agreed by Australia and Papua New Guinea upon that equipment being delivered. I know this has raised some concern in the Solomon Islands, and I have had some communication with Prime Minister Mamaloni on this issue. He wrote to me about it, and I have responded, saying that Australia is ready to review our annual defence cooperation program and to address any concerns that he might have; that we have made clear our about the situation in. Papua New of Guinea and the Solomon Islands border and have called for both governments to resolve their differences through direct high level contact; and that we are willing to consider of TeqUests from the Solomon Islands Government for appropriate assistance in border management. .Those offers have been made and, while there has been, I think, an unwillingness on the part of the Solomon Islands to talk to Papua New Guinea, I can only urge that a dialogue continue, that a dialogue be re-established. Particularly after the Wingti Government was elected, there w- a new opPortunity· for the Solomon. Islands to raise this issue. I wrote to the Prime Minister in October and I await a response before taking any further steps on the defence cooperation issue. But I mention the. support that Australia does give to the Solomon Islands under such things as the Pacific patrol boat program. When I was in the Solomon Islands for the South Pacific Forum, Australia was building a concrete pier and a base for the two vessels that we have given to the Solomon Islands under a Pacific program. One could only conclude by the civil works being undertaken, the nature of the Australian military involveof ment in the construction phase of those civil works and the general interest of Australian officials in the aid program towards the Solomon Islands that it is one which is tailored exclusively to the benefit of the community of the Solomon Islands. So I have communicated these thoughts to Prime Minister Mamaloni and I am awaiting a response from him. But the principal issue underlying both the issue there and that in the honourable member's question is the problem of the secessionist movement on Bougainville. The Government of Papua New Guinea has a right to protect its sovereignty over that territory, and that is the cause of the dispute. We are urging that it be settled by negotiation, by political settlement. Employment",19
59,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can he provide any new evidence concerning the level of employment opportunities? What role is the Commonwealth Employment Service playing in this context?",20
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member no doubt will be pleased·by the latest figures released by the CES on vacancies reported to it, which are up some 165,000, which is 27 per cent up on the June quarter and 18 per cent higher than the corresponding quarter in 1991. The seasonally adjusted trend in the total number of vacancies notified to the CES each month continues to show an upturn, as it has done since May. Between the September quarters of 1991 and 1992 there have been increases in vacancies notified to the CES from every major industry category. The largest increases were in manufacturing, transport and storage and wholesale and retail. Consistent with these encouraging increases in the number of notified vacancies, the number of people placed in jobs by the CES has also risen substantially. In the September quarter it placed 119,000 people in jobs, which was a rise of 19 per cent on the JUlie quarter and was 16 per cent higher than the corresponding quarter in 1991. The success of the CES in placing people in jobs has been underpinned by the extension the Government's comprehensive range of labour market programs. September quarter commencements in the labour market programs were up 47 per cent on the same quarter in 1991, the biggest increase being in Jobstart wage subsidies, community-based Skillshare programs and programs for especially disadvantaged clients. Despite the difficult labour market conditions and the deliberate emphasis on disadvantaged clients, 43 per cent of people assisted by labour market programs were in unsubsidised jobs or further education three months after participating in the programs. Over the year. to September, this meant that nearly 124,000 people achieved a positive outcome from CES programs, 28 per cent more than in 199.1. What is perhaps most significant from all of these statistics is that they indicate the way in which the Government and the CES, through pursuing Government policies, have been successful in coming to grips with what is the most serious unemployment issue as far as this country is concerned, and that is the situation of long term unemployed job seekers. Those out of work for more than 12 months gained 27 per cent of all CES job placements, and that is up 3 per cent on some two years ago. Ros Gittins, in today's Sydney Morning Herald, pointed to this worthwhile piece of analysis: The main effect of the Jobstart subsidy program and the CBS's changed behaviour under the Newstart strategy is to counteract the labour market's inherent bias against the long-term unemployed. . . . provided the Government keeps it up . . . we can expect that the total number of long-term unemployed will peak at a level significantly less than it would have, arid will then fall at a faster rate than it would have had if nothing had been done. The point about both the existence of the CBS and the role it performs and those labour market programs is this: quite clearly, that public labour exchange, which virtually every member of the OECD has to assist its government and its people in providing work opportunities, is achieving very substantial successes both in the confidence of the business community in reporting vacancies to it and in the confidence of those who are unemployed in taking opportunities through that labour exchange to gain employment. In addition, those very carefully targeted labour market programs are working to pick up in particular the most disadvantaged sections of the community. It is the proposal, among many, in the Opposition's propositions that both those things should be wiped out. The Opposition proposes to wipe out the CES-it would no longer be in existence: its job brokerage function would be handed to private providers and a 15 per cent tax would be imposed on them on the provision of work-and to cut $700m from labour market programs which are addressing the disadvantaged. This is in the middle of a period of great economic difficulty when it is commonly acknowledged on all sides of politics that long term unemployed people will be with us as a problem for some considerable period, even as the economy goes into very substantial recovery. There could not be a more heartless proposal. Above all, what that proposal reveals is the Opposition's total ignorance of what is happening in this area of the job market and its callous disregard for those who confront these situations, whatever crocodile tears might get wept from time to time at the box office. Economy",20
61,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. I refer· the Prime Minister to his answer to my first question today when he sought to argue a case for stimulatory economic policies. I therefore ask the Prime Minister: given that the 1991-92 Budget was stimulatory, given that the One Nation statement was stimulatory, and given that the 1992-93 Budget was stimulatory, can he explain to the House why Australia has suffered the worse collapse in jobs over the last two years of any of the 10 main Western economies; why our current account to GOP ratio among those countries is predicted to be the highest in 1993; and why we still have about $180 billion worth of debt?

You have just heard a classic case of duplicity from the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition reminded me about the unemployed and then urged us to adopt a contractionary fiscal policy. He knows, as does every other economist in the country, that this would simply push us back into recession and produce more unemployment and less activity. In the 1980s, when the economy was growing strongly, when credit was growing strongly, when GOP was growing strongly, when the private sector was creating 90-odd per cent of job growth, we pulled the fiscal stimulus back and pulled the Budgets back into surplus. This produced enormous surpluses for the first time in Australia's history. Those surpluses took our government debtMr Costello interjecting- .",21
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Higgins I,22
70,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to GOP ratio from around 24 or 26 per cent down to around 14 or 15 per cent; in other words, as those surpluses were banked, there was a very great reduction in government debt to GOP which made our government debt to GOP one of the lowest in the world. As a result of the cyclical change in the Budget and the structural change coming from the policies of the Government, that debt will now go out to 18 per cent of GOP-still one of the lowest in the world. This will fulfil the proper role of promoting activity in the economy by using public investment and public expenditure at a time when private investment and private expenditure are languishing: This is an entirely sensible thing to do. not a matter of re-embracing Keynesian economics or some rejection of faith; it is just plain common sense. In the One Nation project we saw the Government seeking to use, in a short term stimulatory way; changes which will have a long term benefit to the economy in infrastructure such as roads, rail and the airline system and in the depreciation schedules for investment. This will give Australia in the long run, in the medium term as well as in the short term, one of the most advantageous depreciation schedules in the world. There is also the radical change to training and job support through the programs introduced by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. This year we will have around 400,000 Australians supported by the Government's labour market programs. Through the year we h;lVe introducedpolicies to take up the l00,OOO-odd young people who are unemployed in the 15to 19-year age group. These are the policies of One Nation-short term in a stimulatory sense, longer term in their impact on infrastructure. You forgot infrastructure for 40 years-the rail systems which are a piece of industrial archaeology, the road systems which you bleat about but basically let run down and never developed, and the airline system which you gave us with a deceitfully signed commitment to a two airline policy in the closing weeks of the 1983 election. These are the areas of investment in the public infrastructure without which the private economy cannot succeed . Of course, in the company structure there is a first rate set of accelerated depreciation schedules, a 39 per cent corporate rate which you want to turn into 42 per cent, and a system of full dividend imputation. That is what One Nation is all about. And what have you.got in place of it?",22

What we have now is the breathtaking claim that a particular proposed tax shift in Australia will lead to a massive increase in employment. The Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying that GST equals jobs. Mr Reith-Yes, jobs, jobs, jobs!",24
107,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, it does, but not quite in the way that you understand. Mr Tim Fischer-Jobs, jobs, jobs!",24
108,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It means fewer jobs, not more jobs. What the Opposition wants to say is that, essentially, the GST is about taking taxes off business and putting them on consumers, and that, as the taxes come off business, business has a greater opportunity to employ people. The problem with this and the fallacy in this are contained in the Opposition's own arithmetic when it is demonstrated that all of the consequences of the abolition of sales tax, every dollar from the abolition of excise, is passed on in full to the consumers. That is why the Opposition is able to produce these modest-I think heroically modest-small price increases as a result of the tax shift. Of course, inembers of the Opposition and their Leader want to have access to the money twice. They want to have it both ways. There is no better description of what they are on about than in Mr Gittins's report from 16 November in which he says: So, when you ask him about the inflationary effect of the GST, Dr Hewson tells you the $20 billion flows on to consumers. When you ask him about the employment effect of Fightback, he tells you the $20 billion stays with business and is used for expansion. An economics professor would call that ""double counting"". I'd call it dishonesty. That, of course, is a theme which is picked up by someone who is not one of our greatest  It is quite wrong for the Opposition to pretend that the GST will do anything to improve the short-term economic situation, and for it (and especially by Dr Hewson, a trained economist who should know better) to be presented otherwise is a deliberate deception. Here we have Mr MCGuinness accusing the Leader of the Opposition of deliberate deception and Ross Gittins accusing him of dishonesty in relation to this matter. The GST may well be about jobs, but it is about unemployment increasing, not decreasing. You cannot conclude otherwise from a policy which is about withdrawing money from the Budget sector-$7 billion or 1112 or 2 per cent of GDP-and about tight credit and higher interest rates in order to contain the inflationary impact of the tax shift, than that that mixture of policies will lead to higher unemployment, not lower unemployment. This is a point which has been acknowledged not just by us; it has also been acknowledged by a survey of Australia's leading economists, the report of which was produced on 29 September. Independent economists were asked this simple question: would the unemployment rate be higher at the end of the next term under a coalition or a Labor government? Seventy-five per cent of them said it would be higher under a coalition government. We have seen this view expressed by so many people in the community, including members of the Liberal Party themselves, such as Frank Collins, who said: A vote for Hewson is a vote for high unemployment. The truth of Fightback is that if it is implemented in its current form unemployment increases. It's got to; it's common sense. This is from a man who was for five years a Federal campaign officer for the Liberal Party. It does not matter what the Opposition tries to do with this policy. More and more people are realising what it really represents. Apart from its inequity, apart from its dis advantageous effects on 70 per cent of families in Australia-apart from all of that-at the heart of this policy is the fact that it is jobs only in the sense that the Opposition would reduce the amount of employment and increase the amount of unemployment in this country.

You can talk about Christmas wrapping, bonbons and the rest, but it will not help you. Those opposite are saying that, because toys, wrapping paper, sleds and bonbons are presently .subject to 20 per cent wholesale sales tax, their cost would be lower under a 15 per cent goods and services tax.

It goes on to say: He's impervious to criticism and has an inability to listen. Mr Costello-I raise a point of order.

Government members interj-cti1l:gMr Costello-It is not in order, in my to you, Mr Speaker, for the Prime to read out transcripts.

If a leader of an Australian political party speaks on the. public radio and his staff does not transmit to the community a fair reflection of what is saidnot a typo or an honest error, but a systematic removal of offending phrases-what 'proper honesty or basis of our politics can there be when a Leader of the Opposition dishonestly represents to the media of this country what he has actually said and what is said of him on Australian radio?

The forecallts in the Budget are, of course, for the financial year. There has been no revision, but you do not have to be a genius to work out one of the published figures. Indeed, you only have to go to some of the surveys of international forecasters. The Prime Minister read out one list from the Economist; there is another produced by Consensus Economics.

201,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and it relates to flat rate taxes. I ask the Minister: is there any independent analysis to show that age pensioners and other social security clients are adversely affected by the imposition of flat rate taxes· and charges?,29
202,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I am responsible for social security beneficiaries in this country I need to be aware of the impact upon them of flat rate taxes and charges. Indeed, there is now a fair amount of evidence about the disadvantage social security beneficiaries and other poorer members of the community suffer from flat rate taxes and charges. But, of course, we do not any longer need to speculate, because we have the Liberal laboratory in Victoria and we can see the impact of the regressivity of their flat rate taxes and their flat rate charges. We have an of those charges by the Victorian Council of Social Service. The taxes that have been imposed-the flat rate taxes; the flat rate charges-include a State deficit levy, which is in fact a poll tax, a flat $100 on all homeowning households; and an increase of 10 per cent in the charges on everyone for essential services-no exclusiot;lS, no exceptions. Electricity, water, gas and public transport are all up by 10 per cent There has been a cut-back in community services, for instance, of $17m. Mrs Bailey interjecting",29

205,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The poll tax on households is clearly regressive. It will not affect businesses to any great extent because they get a tax deduction, but for ordinary working families, for social security beneficiarieswho are not excluded-it may make all the difference to what food and clothing they can buy. Mr Reith interjecting",30
206,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will come to your point in one moment The Victorian Council of Social Service points out that it is being inundated by people requiring advice on how they can afford thjs poll tax. Officers within the Department of Social Security are being phoned by people who want social security help to pay that $100 levy on their households. The combined effect of these flat taxes and the charges in services is much greater on poor families than on better off families.,30

211,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Moore interjects again, I will deal with him.",30
212,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For people on·a parliamentary salary, it accounts for two to three per cent of their income; it is regressive. Let me point out-and this answers the point raised by the Leader of the National Partythat Robert Hudson, the Director of VCOSS in Victoria, said: The problem with the Statementthe Kennett economic statementis not that if will cause pain. That was always going to be the casehe accepts thatbut that the pain has been distributed so unfairly Of course, this is simply the foretaste of what we are to get from a flat goods and services tax, from a $10 billion cutback in government services from the erosion of social securityall promised in Fightback, and all quite clear.

216,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Given that the One Nation and Budget forecasts have now been proven wrong, can he give the public the assurance that the unemployment rate will not rise above 11.3 per cent? Does he agree with the Prime Minister that unemployment could go over one million people?",30
217,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think you should listen carefully to this, Tim. The major determinant of the unemployment rate and its volatility has been the participation rate'Opposition members-Ah!",31
218,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,31
219,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not only has the participation rate been going up over the years but it has also been very volatile month by month. That has been the primary reason why the unemployment rate has been so volatile. As has been pointed out on many occasions, there has been a major shift in the labour market in Australia. If we had the kind of participation rate that existed 10 years ago, we would be talking about unemployment rates which were down below 7 per cent. The reason for this is that more people in the community, particularly women, are wishing to go into the work force. Mr Tim Fischer interjecting",31

221,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for MCPherson.,31
222,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And that is the primary determinant of that. I am not going to make any forecasts of the unemployment numbers because the point isMr Ruddock-Because you don't know.,31
223,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You asked about forecasts. I remember reading where the Leader of the Opposition was asked not once but three times by Mr Grant on a Channel 7 program: 'Dr Hewson, what would unemployment be under you?'. On three occasions he declined to give any estimate. Government members-It was inaudible.",31
224,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,31
225,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maybe he did not hear the question. He certainly would not give any estimate because secretly he knows that there is something which he calls transition effects. 1. He made the acknowledgment at Manly a year ago when, asked this question about what would happen to unemployment under him, he sai.d, 'Of course there will betransitiom-l effects'. What he means by transitional effects is that unemployment will go up as a result of a combination of your policies, which are about cutting back on the Budget sector, taking 1!12 to 2 per cent out of the Budget sector, and jacking up interest rates. The net effect of those two policies must be to increase the level of unemployment perhaps by 120,000 people. So what can be said is that, whatever the situation is with unemployment, it will be higher under you than it will be under us. The other thing about usMr Reith-Wrong!",31

You, on the other hand, stand behind policies-I am not quite sure whether you quite comprehend what it is that you have signed up to, but what you have signed up to are policies which are about losing jobs and increasing unemployment.

243,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable member may proceed. Mrs BAILEY.,-I claim to have been misrepresented on three separate accounts by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) in her press release dated 18 November. In the first instance the Minister stated: The helmet that Ms Bailey named recently under Parliamentary privilege as unsafe in fact meets the requirements demanded by the Australian Standard, as Ms Bailey well knows. That is not the truth. I would not have made that speech in the grievance debate if I had known that that helmet met those safety requirements. The Minister secondly stated that I had Educaoffered no evidence to the Standards Association of Australia or to her to substantiate my allegations. That also is untrue. I did provide evidence of that during my speech in the grievance debate. When I have finished my next point, 1 will seek leave to table a document which is the full report of which the Minister quoted only part. The third point on which I was misrepresented by the Minister on 18 November was when. she stated: . '.' Ms Bailey continues to allege that defective helmets ""are allowed out in the community"", even though. safety experts from QAS have already demonstrated to her how and why this is not true. Those safety experts did not visit my office until 19 November-the day after the Minister issued her press release. So the statement that the experts visited me is not true and it is certainly not true that they have convinced me. I seek leave of the House to table the document which is the full Technisearch report from which the Minister tabled only selected comments when she made a personal explanation.",33

251,Dr HEWSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The purpose of this matter of public importance today is to initiate a three-day debate· on the magnitude of our economic problems, the parlous state of the Australian economy and the inability of this Government, in the midst of the worse recession in 60 years, to offer any effective solution to the problems that are now bedevilling the average Australian and the average Australian family. For the benefit of those listening tQ this broadcast, I note that the Prime Minister (Mf Keating) has yet again ducked debate and refused to participate in the defence of what he knows is the indefensible; that is, his continuing politicking at the expense of the people of Australia rather than any genuine attempt to deal with the problems of the people of Australia. In my matter of public importance today, I refer to the fact that the forecasts in both the One Nation statement and the recently brought down Budget are now totally discredited by just about anybody who has assessed them as well as the outturn of economic events. Yet the Government continues to fail to offer an honest and open assessment of where the Australian economy is and where it expects it to go in the next few months, let alone the next few years, as a result of the Government's unbelievably horrendous economic mismanagement. From the point of view of the debate, I think it is appropriate to start with the first question that I asked the Prime Minister in Question Time today. I drew attention to the fact that, since he brought down the One Nation statement, for every nine jobs that had been lost in this country only one had been created. Nine times as many jobs had been lost rather than created since he brought down the One Nation statement, which he has claimed was a stimulatory policy designed knowingly and consciously to kick-start, as he of the said, the Australian economy. Indeed, that was the same explanation given in relation to the 1991-92 Budget, the'One Nation statement and, of course, the recent Budget. They were all designed to pursue a stimulatory economic policy to kick-start our economic circumstances. Yet, as we stand here today, there is absolutely no evidence of any kick-start. There is absolutely no evidence that the economy is showing any sustained tendency to tum around. In fact, it is drifting alarmingly. There is every possibility that this economy will at least double dip, and certainly could stay particularly flat for the next 12 to 18 months at the very least, even under the unbelievably stimulatory policies that this Government claims to have put in place in the last couple of years. It is instructive against that background to recall the Prime Minister's grilling on Lateline last week, to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) has referred. The Prime Minister was unable to provide any sense of direction to this country. He could not answer any qu({Stions about the likely course of economic events in Australia, and he certainly could not defend the fact that One Nation had not done what he said it would do. It had visibly failed. Kerry O'Brien pointed out incessantly that One Nation and other economic statements had failed, and the Prime Minister sat there without any answers. That must go down in Australian history as one of the most bumbling performances on any television interview in the last 10 or 15 years at the very least. It is instructive to look at the forecasts that were made by this Government at the time of the One Nation statement and to get a feel for how circumstances have shifted relative to those forecasts. I think it is important to understand, as we all do this,that One Nation was nothing more than a political document. It was a cynical, political and dishonest attempt to misrepresent the circumstances on the arrival of a new Prime Minister in a desperate effort to create the circumstances where he may go to an early poll. Clearly, as time has gone on and economic circumstances have continued to drift away, the Prime Minister's exaggeration of those forecasts-to say the very least-if not blatant dishonesty has been totally exposed to the people of Australia. I think it is instructive to go back to those growth numbers and look at what was projected at that time. GDP growth for the year 1992-93 was forecast to be 4.75 per cent. There was no evidence in the economic data available at that time that could have led anybody in his or her wildest dreams to argue that our economy could grow in the financial year 1992-93 at 4.75 per cent. According to the One Nation statement, unemployment was to average 10 per cent in 1992-93, and it was to fall to 91h per cent by June 195)3. We were to see phenomenal employment growth of 21/4 per cent to achieve that outcome, with a slight blow-out in the current account deficit, which at the time it was said would be manageable. In terms of fiscal policy, we were told that the Government Budget deficit this year would be $8 billion and that by 1995-96 the l3udget would have returned to surplus. These were the key elements of the One Nation scenario that was painted in terms of the economic prospects of the Australian economy. Just a few months later it was seen in the Budget that those forecasts were completely unsustainable and unachievable. There was an· attempt to give a somewhat more honest statement, still blatantly political, by downscaling some of those forecasts that were given at the time of the One Nation statement. So instead of GDP growth for this financial year being 4.75 per cent, it was lowered to 3 per cent. Instead of unemployment averaging 10 per cent, it was admitted that it might average 101h per cent. But it was said that there was no need to worry; it would still fall to 10 per cent by the middle of next year. It was admitted that employment growth would be less than half of what was assumed just a few months earlier-not 21/4 per cent, but only one per cent. It was then subsequently admitted that the Budget deficit could not in this financial year be held to $8 billion, as was forecast; it would blowout to about $13.4 billion, and that a surplus, nevertheless, by the middle of the decade was still a realistic possibility. The rhetoric got thicker and more wordy, but the direction that the Government tried to paint was pretty much the same. Just a few months after those forecasts have been made in the Budget, it is quite clear that not even those budgetary numbers can be achieved in this financial year, let alone taking a medium term prospect of projecting a Budget surplus by the middle of this decade. I would be interested if the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) would comment on some of the recently released data, which all seem quite inconsistent with the direction that was painted in the Budget even just a few months ago and, as I say, predicting a considerably flatter economy than was the case at the time the One Nation statement was brought down. Let us look at some of the recent numbers. Unemployment was already 11.3 per cent in October. It is supposed to average 10 11z per cent for the whole year, and it is supposed to fall to 10 per cent by the middle of next year. The unemployment rate so far in this financial year has been 11 per cent in July, well above the 101f2 per cent average; 10.9 per cent in August; 10.8 per cent in September; and 11.3 per cent in October. It is staggering that we are already heading significantly further in the direction of increased UJlem'ployment. I think it is particularly important that today neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was prepared to give an assurance that the unemployment .rate would not rise above 11.3 per cent. Mr Ruddock-They know it will.",34
252,Dr HEWSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They do; they know it will. They just do not have the political courage to come out and say so. Secondly, they would not deny the possibility that the number of unemployed in Australia could go over one million. In fact, it is quite possible that before Christmas we will reach the one million mark for persons unemployed in Australia. They know it, but they just do not have the political courage to come out and admit it. Similarly, if we look at some of the detail of the forecasts for this financial year, we see that the forecasts are built on the strength of consumer spending. While they do predict some turnaround in investment spending, the bulk of the forecasts are dependent on the strength of consumer spending. Yet when we look at some of the recent consumer expenditure data we should be nothing short of alarmed. Retail trade, for example, in the month of September was flat-there was zero growth. Mr Broadbent-Tell me about it.",36
253,Dr HEWSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One of my retailing colleagues here, the honourable member for Corinella, is quick to emphasise that when he says, 'Tell me about it'. If we go outside these hallowed halls and talk to people in small business or in the retailing business anywhere in Australia they will tell us about it. If we look at retail sales numbers over the last few months, we see that July was 0.6 per cent, August was 0.1 per cent and September was flat. Yet the whole 3 per cent growth forecast for this year has been predicated on a dramatic pick-up in consumer spending. In September, motor vehicle registrations were down 3.8 per cent and dwelling approvals were down 1.2 per cent. Capital expenditure for _the June quarter was down 12 per cent. Total housing finance approvals were down 5.5 per cent. Housing finance approvals for new homes in September were down 11.3 per cent Perhaps most importantly, given the significance of consumer sentiment, the Westpac-Melbourne Institute's index of consumer sentiment was down a whopping 8 per cent in the month of September. The fact is that there is absolutely no chance that the Australian economy will tum out anywhere near the 3 per cent growth forecast that this Government has predicted. There is absolutely no chance that unemployment will fall to 10 per cent by the middle of next year-and-honourable members opposite know it. They know it will get worse before it gets better. Yet they do not have the political courage to say so. I challenge the Treasurer to have the political courage to come clean and admit the full revised version of the forecasts for the course of this financial year and· beyond. Anybody looking at our economic circumstances today, in the context of what is an increasingly difficult world circumstance, could not conclude that those growth numbers could be achieved. Most of the private forecasterswho used to be to a significant extent influenced by the Treasury and by the Government-have now left them. Even Westpac, which is one of the bulls out there in terms of private sector forecasting, has lowered its growth numbers for this year to 2 11z per cent. What is the truth? How flat will the economy be? How high will unemployment go? I notice that those opposite come in with these little catch phrases such as 'Unemployment will always be lower under us than under you', but that is only designed to distract attention from the fact that they"" are not prepared to admit that unemployment could rocket away under them, and they know it. Look at the state of the world economy. Zero growth is predicted in the German economy; the OECD is constantly scaling down its growth numbers for the reSt of Europe; and for the first significant period in the entire postwar period there is flatness in the Japanese economy. There is the possibility in the United States that the economy could triple-dip. A lot of the Asian nations which have sustained growth in the last 12 or 18 months are crucially dependent on the US, Japanese and European markets, so they too will slow down. The falling commodity prices take us back to the levels of 1986. How will we get any significant stimulus to the Australian economy when we look at the circumstances of the world economy? Those opposite cannot run around and say that it is all due to the world economy, because not. In the postwar period this is the first time we have gone into a recession first. The Government took us into a recession at the end of 1989, which was way ahead of the world economy. We have passed the threeployment year anniversary of the arrival of this Governgo ment's recessionary period. There have been three years of pain and hardship for the average Australian, but those opposite still cannot tell us what growth there will be year. And they still cannot tell us how high unemployment will grow. They cannot tell us whether one million Australians will be employed before we reach Christmas this year. Those opposite know that the economic circumstances are drifting. Since the Prime Minister took over from his predecessor at the end of last year, those opposite have only been playing one political game after another and pulling one political stunt after another. Everything has been designed to distract attention from the fact that they have no answers. They cannot move. They know what has to be done, but they are not prepared or cannot, take the decisions to tum this country around. The sad story is that this country has been left to drift under what must be the worse economic mismanagement we have seen in the entire postwar period. To look at another feature, there is the collapse of the property market in Australia. The fact is that vacancy rates particularly of commercial property in Melbourne and Sydney, are well over 20 per cent. Some people say that that is a lO-year problem to work off. Look at the extent to which bad debts are being written off by the banking system. Banks do not have any capacity to significantly expand their lending. The four majors have written off $10 billion all up since 1987. There is no capacity there for them to expand lending. , There is no inherent growth in the Australian economy. We are drifting, with many of the features of the 1930s growing in significance every day-debt, deflation and rising unemployment-and this Government is p.ot even prepared to leave the Prime . Minister in this chamber to debate the issue it is of his economic mismanagement. For the rest of this week we will go through the policy options those opposite' have es""chewed, and the Government's inability to put down an effective response to rising unemand flat economic activity. We will through the significance of tax reform, infrastructure reform and a whole host of other elements of Fightback which are absolutely fundamental to turning our circumthis stances around. We have the answers to Australia's economic problems. We started with an open, honest and objective assessment unas to where this economy is and is headed, and in the course of the next few months we will drag those opposite screaming to public debate after public debate to defend their incompetence.",36

264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The question is that the motion be agreed to. I will clarify this for the honourable member for Higgins immediately.

Mr DAWKINSAs I said at the beginning, the Leader of the Opposition can talk day and night, inside the House and outside the House, but the trouble is, no-one is listening to him.

274,Mr DAWKINS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the Leader of the Opposition wants a debate, if he wants to be taken seriously in this country, how much longer will he allow a situation to proceed' in which he will not have a press conference in Canberra? It is now a year since he has presented himself before the gallery in Canberra and been subjected to the kind of analysis and questioning that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and I are .on a regular basis. Why is the Leader of the Opposition so terrified of those in the gallery who want to pursue him on his prescription for the economy of this country? He can come in here, day and night, and talk for as long as he likes, but no-one will listen because he has lost any shred of credibility he had. When he first became Leader of the Opposition, he said he wanted a serious debate about the circumstances confronting the country., He said he wanted to be a participant in that debate. He said he wanted to carefully analyse the probno- lems and then suggest some solutions. But as soon as anyone criticises his solution, he cries foul and goes into his bunker and will not come out of it. He has now decided to abandon any semblance of balance in his approach to this matter. The speech he m-d- today was replete with h-perbole and p-lmlsm. When he comes· to thIS debate trottmg out statements such as, 'This .is as.bad as the 1930s' or 'This .economy IS domg the worse of all those m the world', he knows that he is wrong. He is just a revealing that he is a - ompulsi-e pessi-i-t. What he. wants to do, hme and hme agam, IS talk this country into the kinds of circumstances which he imagines that it is in or destined for. I do not want to disappoint him too much, but the fact is that those people in Australia whose job it is to make these forecasts of economic growth and where inflation is going disagree with him totally. The forecasters.in Australia-those i- his .own former profesSIon-say that Austraha WIll do better in 1993 than any other OECD country, with growth particularly, and that it is doing better than any with inflation at the moment. Either the Leader of the Opposition wants to proceed with a sensible debate on the basis of an analysis of the real situation or he wants to manufacture his view of what is going on, concentrating only on the negatives and pessimism in order to construct his case. That is the second reason why people will not listen to him. People will not listen knowingly distorts, who knowingly engages in deception, who knowingly gets involved in an inaccurate analysis of what is happening in Australia.

He used be a key adviser to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). In the Sydney Morning Herald a week or so ago, he absoenormous lutely demolished not just the approach of Leader of the Opposition but also his analysis and his attempt to construct it on the basis some rigorous analysis of the situation. He as well. said: At times Hewson has gone to disingenuous lengths to rationalise his politics-driven economic analysis. Asked how heading for depression is sion. compatible with slow real growth, he maintainS that 'there were quarters of growth in the 1930s in that Depression, too'. Well, so there were. However, a one-time economics professor Hewson must that growth from a collapse of 10 per cent cannot be compared with recovery from the 2 per falls experienced in the 1982-83 and 1990-91 recessions. He went on to talk about a comparison of thatunemployment now with that during the Great Depression, referring, as I did in Question Time, to the fact that the participation rate is continuing on a long term upward trend. Mr Henderson said: Just compare the current recession with that of almost a decade ago. In 1982-83 the participation rate stood at 60.6 per cent. It is currently about 63.2 per cent. It is difficult to be precise with figures. But the best calculations indicate that if the 1982-83 participation 'rate applied, Australia's unemployment rate in 1991-92 would have averaged 6.8 per cent rather than 10.4 per cent. I guess his last summary of what the Leader of the Opposition has contributed to this debate is the most damning. He said: Sure, we all expect that politicians will politics. But there is a fine line between polemic and irresponsibility. Claims that Australia in 1992 is 'back to the Great Depression' can only do to someone who enormous harm.

Let me take as a more poignant point his second question and the Prime Minister's answer to it. What he asked in his second question was: after all this stimulus, why has it not worked? That is, why play was this stimulus wrong? In other words, there was a quite explicit message in the Leader of the Opposition 'squestion that only was the current stimulus wrong, but also he would reverse it.

So what it is doing now is picking the policy prescriptions which we have of, embarked upon for the whole of this year, fot a longer period than that.

On every occasion that the Government has done something not provide a stimulus to the economy-whether through a relaxation of monetary policy or the application of a sensible, responsible and well targeted fiscal stimulus-the Opposition Leader's approach has been to oppose it. The Government stands here proud of the action which it has taken because it believes that it is appropriate. It is now receiving the compliments of the rest of the world in terms of the approach it has taken-an approach, I might say, which has been taken more recently by Japan, which is now being advocated by President-elect Clinton and which is now being discussed actively in Europe as a means of trying to breathe some life back into the European economy. We do not have to be lectured by the Leader of the Opposition about the importance of the European economy, the North American economy or the Japanese economy, oilly for ourselves but for developing countries. as well. We understand that, and that is why we welcome the fact that these are now following us and deciding to apply the same kinds of polides which we have in Australia in order to encourage some greater economic growth.

Let us come in the context of this discusto what the Opposition Leader himself is proposing. First of all, he says that not only should there be no fiscal stimulus but also up there should be a withdrawal from the Budget as he said at Budget time, $7 billion. He and wants to withdraw $7 billion-about 1112 per cent of GDP-from the Budget. He knows of that the immediate effect of that will be to he depress activity in the economy.

284,Mr DAWKINS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let us go beyond his attitude to fiscal policy and come to the great tax switch, the great tax switch which he now says is all about jobs. The GST has been kept quietly hidden. The Leader of the Opposition has said, 'Nobody mention the GST.

The Leader of the Opposition is trying to have this double counting, which is a polite description for it-or, as Mr Gittins would say, 'This is dishonesty'. This is dishonesty from the man who promised us two years ago that he would bring new standards to Australian politics, that he would bring honesty to Australian politics. Here he stands condemned by Mr Gittins for dishonesty, by Paddy MCGuinness for deception and by Mr Gerard Henderson for doing enormous harm. This is the sum total of the current leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. This is the summation of his period of leadership of the Liberal Party: a savaging attack on the one set of policy prescriptions which have seen Australia come to the point where it is growing and likely to grow faster than any other country in the world, the one set of policy prescriptions which have delivered the lowest inflation in the world. Then he not only puts forward a bankrupt set of propositions which would - ot just make unemployment worse but also he tries dishonestly to misrepresent his own policy prescriptions. He knows as well as anyone that with the combination of higher interest rates-which he knows will be necessary in order to stifle the inflationary effects of the GST-this will have a depressing effect on the economy. This is the real reason he wants to talk about an independent Reserve Bank. It is not because he really wants an independent Reserve Bank; it is because he wants to be able to blame an independent Reserve Bank for jacking up interest rates and increasing unemployment. Mr Broadbent interjecting",42
289,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,J warn the honourable member for Corinella.,42
290,Mr DAWKINS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Having issued instructions through the Parliament for the Reserve Bank to pursue a low inflation policy in the face of inflationary pressures from the Government, inflation being stoked up by the Government and the Reserve Bank being told to get rid of it, the Reserve Bank would then lift interest rates in order to do that. As a consequence, unemployment would go up and the Leader of the Opposition would then say, 'Oh well, that has nothing to do with me; it is all the Governor of the Reserve Bank's fault. The Governor of the Reserve Bank is the problem'. That is the point to which this man will stoop in order to try to cover up his policies. He came in here saying that it is about time we came clean. We have come clean, and we will continue to do so, about what is right for this economy in terms of trying to promote growth and particularly jobs. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition started shrugging off these descriptions of dishonesty, of deception, of doing enormous harm to the Australian economy, and started telling the people what the GST and Fightback actually stand for-that is, not only slower growth, higher interest rates and more unemployment but also the most devastating social dislocation Australia has ever seen. (TIme expired)",42
291,Mr DOWNER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is sad that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) needed to extend the 15 minutes available to him in this discussion of a matter of public importance by another 10 minlltes because he spent the first 15 minutes playing the man. He engaged in personal abuse against the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) for a full quarter of an hour when speaking on a matter which is supposed to give the Treasurer the opportunity to boast about the success of his policies-the so-called One Nation statement. But we heard nothing about the One Nation statement. After a fusillade of personal abuse for 15 minutes, he then turned to the issue of the economic scare campaign. Who has the Treasurer not consulted? He has not consulted the Secretary of his own Department. What did the Secretary tell a business meeting in Queensland this past week about the GST? He told that meeting that a GST would not only increase exports but also, as a result of that, increase employthis ment. . He made it perfectly clear that he thought it was an important change for Australia to make to its taxation system. The Treasurer might not like to be reminded of this point, but the Secretary of his own Department, by implication, holds the scare campaign that the Government is running in utter contempt. He not only knows that those opposite are running a· scare campaign, but alsQ finds those opposite deaf to the arguments that he and his Department are putting forward. The Treasurer ought to reflect on that. He ought to listen to what his departmental Secretary says., Mr Reith-He also said it would increase savings.",43
292,Mr DOWNER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Treasurer ought to listen to one other aspect of what the Secretary said, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) has reminded me of. He said that the GST would increase savings - something which the Treasurer has always denied. But part of the Treasurer's personal abuse campaign is to run yet again this line about how the Leader of the Opposition said at some stage a couple of weeks ago that Australia was running the risk of heading towards a depression. The Treasurer said that this was a terrible thing and we had a reiteration of all the Labor rhetoric about that. Yet the Treasurer might recall that it was he who, on 29 November 1983, talked about the devastating depression in which we found this economy. The Australian economy in 1982 was in nothing like the bad shape it is in today and he was prepared to call that a devastating depression. So he played the man and he did not listen to his own departmental Secretary's advice on tax refonn, which he is too scared to confront-he does not have the decency or the courage to do that. He goes around accusing others over their use of the word - depression' when he himself had used that expression liberally to describe a recession which was substantially less severe for Australians than the one that we have today. But one of the central parts of the Labor Party's attack today on the coalition has been attack about fiscal stimulus. Apparently what Australia needs is fiscal stimulus: pouring taxpayers' money down a black hole, dollar after dollar, and, in the old Labor way, never counting the cost of the programs and never analysing what the impact of the cost of those programs will be. Labor-as the Whitlam, Hawke and Keating governments have shown-thinks that money grows on trees. But one of the interesting aspects of the Labor Party's claims about fiscal stimulus is the proposition that apparently the OECD believes that all OECD countries should enter into some sort of fiscal stimulus, although the Government uses the words - in appropriate circumstances'-so it-depends what it means, I suppose. The Treasurer should look at the Australian Financial Review of today-Tuesday, 24 November. This is not old news. There is a big article on page 10. I do not suppose the Treasurer got to page 10.",43
293,Unknown,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,43
294,Mr DOWNER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. The article is headed 'OECD frowns on Clinton plan to lift US economy'. I wonder whether the Treasurer saw this article and read it this morning. He would rather not read it, because it says: ... the DEeD opposes a fiscal push, arguing that it could substantial1y harm America's already problematic medium-term prospects. It goes on to say: ""If real economic activity picks up as projected, there is no need to give further stimulus to the economy, ""In any case there is no scope for fiscal stimulus without compromising all pretence of controlling the federal Budget deficit in the near future. That could be about Australia as much as it is about the United States. But there it is in black and white on page 10 of the Australian Financial Review in an article written by someone whom the Treasurer would know pretty well: Greg Hywood in Washington. It continues: ... unfettered opposition from the DEeD to further stimulus is certain to deepen doubts in the financial markets over the Democrats' economic strategy. The Treasurer ought to think about this because, despite the claims that are made about how the OECD is apparently pleading with Western governments to stimulate their economies, we find the truth is to the contrary. It is writ large on page 10 of the Australian Financial Review: 'DECO frowns on Clinton plan to lift US economy'. I hope that in future the Treasurer will be .more honest in his contribution to this fiscal debate. It is the old Labor line: see a problem, spend money on it, and never worry about where the money comes from. Labor does not know that it has to pay the bills one day. That is the history of the last decade when Labor dominated politics and governments in Australia. There is no question that the Labor Party has been electorallyMr Bevis-How many surplus Liberal Budgets did you have?",43
295,Mr DOWNER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We were warned about interjecting. I think in the interests of equity I might have some protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. During the last decade, the Labor Party, having had control of most of the States in this country and the Federal economy, has proven the old adage that Labor cannot manage money. Yes, it can handle money; but Labor cannot manage money. We can look at the chaos in Victoriathe loans affair, the Pyramid Building Society, the State Bank and the VEDC. Look at WA Inc. From my own point of view, I think we ought to look at the State Bank of South Australia fiasco which was revealed, by all objective standards, in the Royal Commissioner's report, which damned the Labor Party for its incompetent management of that bank and the South Australian economy. The Federal Government, and in particular the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), hastily tries to scurry away and says, 'It is nothing to do with us'. The then Treasurer said that he did not know about WA Inc. The Federal Treasurer, the person who was responsible for running the national ; economy, did not know about it! He did not know aQout the Victorian financial fiasco! Incredible, is it not? He said, 'Never heard of it. I did not know a thing about it'. He was running the economy with the Reserve Bank in his pocket and he said,' Sorry, I did not know about the disaster of the Victorian economy and the management by my mates in the Labor Party down there'. South Australia-ditto. He said the same thing: 'I did not know anything about it'. One of biggest banks in the country has gone to the wall with debts of $3 billion, he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket all of that time, he was pulling all of the levers in the economy, and he did not know about it! Who are we expected to believe? Does the Treasurer think that the public of Australia believes that the then Treasurer knew nothing about what was going on in South Australia? We happen to know that the board of the Reserve Bank, which includes the Secretary of the Treasury, discussed the problems of the State Bank of South Australia at a board meeting as long ago as 1987. Are we expected to believe that the Secretary to the Treasury left that board meeting having heard that discussion about concerns in the State Bank of South Australia, having heard that the Reserve Bank was worried about it, and decided to keep that a deadly secret from the Treasurer of this country? Are we expected to believe that? Are we expected to believe that in 1987 when the then Premier and President of the ALP decided to hold down interest rates on instruction to the State Bank, during that election campaign the man who controlled the levers of the economy, the then Federal Treasurer-the man fighting for political survival-was never told about this strategy? Does the Treasurer seriously think that we are going to believe that? I know Mr Bannon has said that he did all this on his own initiative but, if we look at Mr Bannon's words from his press conference yesterday, it is interesting to see that he never revealed whether he discussed the strategy subsequent to his decision with the Federal Treasurer. I put it to the House that it is impossible to believe that the then Treasurer, who boasted that he knew so much about the management of this economy throughout that period, apparently knew nothing of what was going on in South Australia, which had a Labor government which was destroying the bank and destroying the economy in that State. But there you have it: Labor 'cannot manage money. Everybody knows that it can handle money, but it cannot manage money. That is what it has done to Australia and to all the States where it haS been in government. (TIme expired)",44
296,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) spoke for 10 minutes. The honourable member complained that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) did not talk enough about the One Nation statement or about the Budget, but he hardly talked about it at all. Obviously he ran out of puff after two minutes and decided that he had to talk about State banks and State government situations instead of the real issue which is supposed to be the subject of this MPI. In raising this matter of pUblic importance today the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has put forward the fundamental philosophical difference with respect to which the people of Australia will be going to the election next year. I refer to how we are going to deal with the difficult economic circumstances that we have at present; whether we are going to deal with it by further contraction of the economy or by stimulation and growth. The Leader of the Opposition talked about some of the difficult indicators, for example in retail sales. As the Treasurer says, the Leader of the Opposition is always giving a negative and gloomy message about Australia; he never says anything positive about this country or its situation. If students of economics were following this debate, they would have thought that following this gloomy message there is going to come a request for more stimulation of the economy. But instead of that, what do we get? The Leader of the Opposition is critical of the stimulation already given to the economy by the Labor Government. He described the stimulatory package as 'unbelievably stimulatory'. According to what criterion is it unbelievably stimulatory? It is certainly not when one looks at international comparisons and on the basis of what the OECD has been talking about in terms of the necessary stimulation that various economies need. To suggest that the package is unbelievably stimulatory, that there is too much stimulation, is an absurdity. If the package could be criticised for anything at all, it is that it is responsible and modest in its stimulation, not unbelievably stimulatory. That is absolute nonsense. I cannot imagine anyone in the economics profession, even the right wing extremist economists, agreeing with his doom and gloom analysis. Under these circumstances they are going to - ay, 'Look, you need a. bit of public spending. You need a bit of stimulation. You ought to do something because the private economy is flat'. What is the solution when the private economy is flat? It is certainly not the nonsense of the Fightback . package. I will come back to that later. The reality is that under these circumstances stimulation of the economy is critical. Let me say this to those people listening",45
297,Mr FILING,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Only one.,45
298,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Don't interrupt, you dishonourable fool.",45
299,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Calwell should not refer to the honourable member for Moore in such terms.,46
300,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker this is the member who attacked me, in a di-honourable fashion, when· I was overseas. He has no right to interject here.",46
301,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am about to warn the honourable member for Moore for repeated interjections. Let us deal with this matter first. The honourable member for Calwell should withdraw his remark.,46
302,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I withdraw.,46
303,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member for Moore stand& warned for interjecting. He has tested the patience of the Chair. If he interjects again, the Chair will name him.",46
304,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What is required is· a responsible stimulatory package. This is what the Government has put in place. This economy needs the public sector to play a role in getting the economy moving again. The honourable member for Mayo gets up and says, 'Your only solution to the problems is to throw money at them'. In other words, he is suggesting that the OECD policy makers do not know what they are talking about when they suggest that what is required at this time in Western economies is stimulation through the public sector. The reason this is needed is that the extremist. economics of Reaganism and Thatcherism took too ml,lch hold in the world over the last few years. The public sectors of all the various countries were cut back, and the result has been this recession. The way to get out of this recession is to receive a reasoned and substantial stimulatory package from the various public sectors, including the American public sector. The honourable member for Mayo was trying to suggest that somehow the OECD was not going to support a Clinton package; we will wait and see when the Clinton package comes down whether in fact it will. The fundamental point is that this economy has been in a difficult situation and the way forward is through that kind of stimulatory package. What is the Opposition suggesting? It is proposing to introduce a 15 per cent tax on all goods and services; that is, on food, on the basic necessities of life, on electricity, on anything that ordinary people need. One virtually cannot move without paying a 15 per cent tax. Anything that one spends a dollar on is taxed at 15 per cent. What is the Opposition going to do with that 15 per cent tax? Is that 15 per cent tax going to be given back to the people, especially to the poorer people who will be hit the hardest? Of course not. The proposal in Fightback is to stimulate certain sectors of business, but not to lower income taxes. There is not going to be a reduction of income taxes as a result of that package. The Leader of the Opposition is hoping that the package will cause an inflationary effect, because the cost of living will go up. As soon as the economy gets that inflationary effect there will be some catch-up in wages-not much but some-but as soon as the workers receive a bit of that they go into higher tax brackets and the money is taken off them. The Leader of the Opposition is proposing to give a bit of that tax bracket back. But that has nothing to do with giving back all or part of the 15 per cent consumption tax. There has never been such a design for a consumption tax; it is the worse design in the world. Even if one did support a consumption tax, which we do not, the Opposition is going to take 15 per cent off everybody but give them nothing back. In return for that those opposite say that this is going to create jobs. I have talked to many small business people and they say to me, 'We are opposed to this tax because people won't be able to buy goods and services'. The Leader of the Opposition himself quoted slow retail figures. This is the fundamental problem of the economy. If the retail sector is slow-I ask anyone who has a modicum of logic-is the solution to impose a 15 per cent tax on everything so that the price of goods goes up 15 per cent? If people at the moment are not in a position to buy enough goods, are we going to suggest that by imposing another 15 per cent tax people are going to buy more goods? What sort of nonsense is that? That is the same sort of nonsense which suggests that in the middle of an economic recession we do not stimulate the economy. The Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that we impose this consumption tax and that somehow businesses will flourish. How are the businesses going to flourish? The issue is not the cost factor, because. the costs to business in Australia have been reducing in the last few years. The· issue is the question of demand in the economy. In order to have demand in the economy we need stimulation. In the current context, that stimulation has to be given through the projects that we have announced in the public sector, through the sensible creation of jobs in infrastructure, in our rail system, in our road system and in our various projects to help people get newskills so that they can participate in the work force. Those are the sorts of positive measures that we have put in place. Certainly· they. will work in the medium term and hopefully they will work in the short term. But for those opposite to get up and attack the nation, to attack the economy and to say that we are going to be in depression only adds to our problems and makes them more difficult. The Leader of the Opposition ought to be ashamed of himself. (Time expired)",46
305,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)The discussion has concluded.· NA NA The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or requests: Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) 1992-93 Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1992-93 Appropriation Bill (No.2 1992-93 NA Assent to the following Bills reported: Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 1992 Student Assistance Amendment Bill NA Electoral Matters Commi-tee .

Ordered that the report be printed.",47
307,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has been brought forward in light of new legislation currently before the Senate which touches on matters which were before the Committee as part of its inquiry. The key elements of the report that I have just presented on behalf of the Committee will provide for an early and prompt transmission of the House of Representatives primary vote on the night of the election, together with, for the first time, a two-party preferred count conducted by officers of the Australian Electoral Commission at roughly it 10 per cent, 40 per cent and final figure for the night. The net result of these changes, some of which were included in the Bill before the Senate; .others of which were not, will be to ensure that the public has access to a primary vote for House of Representatives elections sooner than was the case in 1990 and earlier in the night than would have been the case under the AEC's original proposa1. In addition, the public will have that· information Bill matched booth by booth, so that the AEC's projections of outcomes should be particularly accurate. Going further, though, for the first time, in line with the intentions of the AEC,· the Committee supports the proposal to provide for a two-party preferred count on the night. This would be an indicative or provisional count of the votes and would provide a very good estimate at the close of counting of not just the primary vote, nor the computer projections on the two-party preferred, but as close as is possible to an actual count of twoparty preferred. By the end of counting, therefore, on election night 1993, the public of Australia will be better informed about the results of the House of Representatives election than has been the case for any election prior to time. That is facilitated both by the new technologies which will be in place and by the new procedures which are recommended in this report. I thank the House. Motion (by Dr Theophanous)-by leaveproposed: That the House take note of the report. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1992-93 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Baldwin, and read a first time. Second Reading",47
308,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"Sydney-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.45 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The February One Nation statement was specifically designed to both revitalise the nation's key economic infrastructure and to deliver a responsible fiscal stimulus to the economy. Over recent weeks the Government has reviewed the progress of the expenditure of funds allocated to infrastructure projects in the Budget to ensure the goals of One Nation, particularly the delivery of the stimulus to the economy and the consequent employment effects, are being met. This review has demonstrated that, while most of the projects are proceeding in line with expectations, logistical and design delays would make it very difficult for the National Rail Corporation to spend prudently in 199293 the full amount of the $283m provided for the national rail system; and the funding provided for upgrading the electricity transmission links between the south-eastern States will not be required in 1992-93. At the same time, it has become clear that the demand for some labour market programs has been greater than was originally anticipated. In order to maintain the level of stimulus to the economy, the Government has decided to this reallocate in 1992-93 $15Om provided for rail projects and $24m provided for electricity infrastructure to other infrastructure and labour market projects. The reallocation of funds in 1992-93 from these projects does not reflect a lack of commitment by the Govern. ment to them, or their integrity. The measures substantially involv- a rescheduling of expenditure to ensure that the desired fiscal stimulus is achieved and that projects are implemented effectively. Indeed, in 1993-94 the Government will increase expenditure on rail infrastructure by $100m and labour market programs by $16m above the amounts previously included in the forward estimates. These increases will be largely offset by reductions in spending on other infrastructure projects for which funding has been brought forward to 1992-93. The Government has decided to introduce legislation to appropriate moneys for the specific proposals on the grounds that this is the most transparent means of providing for the Government's priorities and conveying these to the Parliament. In this regard, the Government considers that relying on the Advance to the Minister for Finance to provide that legislative authority would run the risk that there may be insufficient funds available from that source to meet other urgent and unforeseen requirements. Appropriation Bill (No.3) seeks a total of $125.39m Details of the amounts sought are: - $17.54m for entry level training and $59.1m for labour market assistance to job seekers and industry through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In particular, the Government has offered an enhanced package of assistance to every major employer willing to offer to employ at least an additional 100 people who have been unemployed for at least six months or who qualify as young trainees, with the same assistance available to incorporated regional authorities who propose to employ full-time additional 200 persons; - in the case of new employees, these subsidies represent roughly 30 to 40 per cent of the wage costs for each employee; - small business,which currently employs 60 per cent of all trainees, will also benefit directly as the subsidies for trainees will apply to all employers. In addition, there will be an increase in the rate of subsidy paid for the employment of apprentices who have been unemployed for six mqnths or more, incentives to increase the employment of second and subsequent female apprentices in non-traditional increase in the level of payment for ""6ff-thejob tr-ining to both TAFE and private providers; "" - the increased funding and improvements in the labour market and training programs are expected to result in 31,000 new positions The Bill also seeks: $18.75m for the sport and recreation program through the .Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to fund the construction of sporting and other facilities by local government and community groups throughout the country. Construction of these projects will commence quickly, crell;ting jobs in many communit-es throughout Australia; and $3Om for the Federal black spot road safety program througll the Department of Transport and Communications. This program is a cost effective initiative to significantly improve safety standards at sites with a tory of traffic accidents. In addition tq improving the safety standards on Australia's road system, this increase in expenditure will create new employment opportunities. The Government intends to implement these measures quickly and believes that this is in the best interests of the nation. I commend the Bill and its speedy passage to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1992-93 ""First Reading "" Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending-appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Baldwin, and read a first time. Second Reading MrBALDWIN (Sydney-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.50 trades, and an p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1992-93 complements Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1992-93, which I introduced earlier. The Bill seeks a total of $56.25m, the details of which are: - A total of $1.25m through the Departments of Administrative Services and Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories for the refurbishment of the Old Parliament House to provide access .for the public to this significant part of Australia's heritage. The facilities offered to the public will include displays of our nation's political and constitutional history as well as other aspects of Australian society; and - $55m for grants to local councils for social and economic infrastructure under the local capital works program provided through the Department of Iinmigration, Local Governmellt and Ethnic Affairs. Bringing forward expenditure on this program n-flects the success of the program in quickly getting under way activity which will stimulate the his- "" economies of those areas which have been hardest hit by the recession while ensuring that those communities receive a lasting benefit from the infrastructure improvements. In addition, clauses 6 and 7 of this Bill will reduce the appropriations for electricity grid and transport infrastructure which were originally provided for in Appropriation Act (No.2) 1992-93 by $24m and $150m respectively. These appropriations are permissive rather than mandatory in that they merely provide an upper limit against which money can be expended for these purposes. While the Government could have restricted expenditure on these items to reflect the changed priorities by administrative means by the Executive or officials, we considered that it is more appropriate that this restriction be achieved by the more transparent action of amending the Budget appropriations so as to give effect to Parliament's role in approving the upper limits on expenditure under the authority of the Appropriation Acts. I commend the Bill and its speedy passage to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. NA (TRANSMITTER LICENCE TAX), AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading [COGNATE BILLS: RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS (RECEIVER LICENCE TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1992 RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS (TEST PERMIT TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1992 NA COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1992] Debate resumed from 10 November, on motion by Mr Beddall: That the Bill be now read a second time.",48
309,Mr SMITH,RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS TAXES,"This legislation comes to us in somewhat of an odd form. The reason for the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill, the 'Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill, the Radiocommunications (Test Permit Tax) Amendment Bill and the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill being introduced in this way is that they' are all effectively tax Bills and; therefore, have to introduced in this place, whereas they are a consequence of a major reform that will be introduced in the Senate, where the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) resides, at some stage later today, and ation. ultimately that primary Bill will come here. We are having a cognate debate on four Bills which impose taxes. On behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we will be supporting each of these Bills, but primarily we will-be supporting the primary Bill, the' radiocommunications reform package, which is part of the new Bill called the Radiocommunications Bill 1992, which will ultimately come to this place. Firstly, I want to make a few remarks about each of these tax Bills and the Radiocommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill, and then make some remarks about the spectrum management arrangements that this new reform package will bring about. I suppose that in future I will be able to come back and talk some more about this legislation, when it comes from the Senate. I am not proposing any amendments to any of the Bills in question-the primary Bill, the consequential Bills, or the tax Bills-although I do have some concerns about the process. The centrepiece of the process is that there is to be a market based approach to some segment of the spectrum and - it is to be managed by a new agency called the Spectrum Management Agency, which will start on 1 July 1993 and which will be based in ,Canberra, as the existing spectrum managers are here also. I will commence with the Radiocommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992. As I have mentioned, this legislation commences on 1 July and repeals a range of existing legislation. Frequency reservation certificates and temporary permits will no longer be required under the new radiocommunications licensing regime provided for under the Radiocommunications Bill when it finally becomes an Act. The transition:al provisions will ensure that many of the instrumentS made under the old Act will be' taken to have been made under the new Act, and regulations, standards, be frequency band plans, permits and certificates will carry across the new Act. Trl!-nsmitter licences which have been granted under the old Act will continue in force under the' new Act but will not be reissued upon their expirThe consequential amendments will update references to the old Act in other Commonwealth legislation and will make other changes consequential to the enactment of the new Act. This legislation includes amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 to allow Austel to include in standards made under that Act matters related to interference to radiocommunications. This will avoid the need for issuing separate technical standards under the 1992 Act. The Radiocommunications Bills before the House form a package, as I have said, related solely to taxation matters. The amendments are consequential on the establishment of the Spectrum Management Agency, which will determine all such taxes, but all such determinations, I am pleased to see, are disallowable instruments. I will digress for a moment about disa1l6wable instruments. It is my view that the Parliament needs to continue to be involved in a whole range of government activities. That requirement, which I have pushed consistently in the broad range of communications issues for disallowable instruments to a requirement of the law, I think helps to buttress the institution of the Parliament in our democracy. I am pleased that the Clerks' office on this side of the Parliament-I do not know what happens in the Senate; most of us are mystified as to what happens in the Senate. - has a special list of all disallowable instruonly ments and that tells us at what time they expire. It is there to alert honourable members, if they are interested, as each of us should be but so few of us are, about the legislative processes, what is actually in legislation and what it does, rather than putting out press releases all the time. By doing the job that we are charged to do we can have a better idea of what is coming through this place. It provides the opportunity for oppositions and government members who are not Ministers to have an additional mechanism by which they can watch the activities and the progress of the Executive and the bureaucracy. I commend the use of the disallowable instruments and the summary that is now passed out to honourable members from time to time. The first Bill is the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill. There are currently 90 different .kinds of transmitter licences which can be granted and for which a taxis payable. The Bill addresses that matter. Under the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill there is currently a number of different kinds of receiver licences for which tax is payable. Under the Radiocommunications (Test Permit Tax) Amendment Bill test permits are issued by the Minister to persons wishing to operate substandard devices for purposes related to research, education or demonstration, and the word 'test' is removed to avoid any suggestion that the purpose of such permits is limited to the testing of tadiocommunications equipment. Then there is the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill. Of course, taxes cannot be imposed unless they can be collected. Taxes are currently payable on all the annual grants of licences and permits. Under the Radiocommunications Bill the apparatus licences will be granted for a period of up to five years. This amendment will allow users to pay in annual instalments be rather than a lump sum at the beginning or at the end of the five-year period. The Bill also provides that taxes may be recovered as debts due to the Commonwealth. I do not believe that I will be taking the full allocation of my time. I notice that there is one other speaker on the Opposition side and that is the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). The arguments about what we should do and how we should manage the spectrum in this country commenced with a very good, detailed report from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, which highlighted the fact that, with the emerging and competing technologies that are wanting space on the spectrum, we need to have a different management system, and that the dark art of spectrum management which is unknown to many-I am certainly only a novice-needed to be more fully explained and exposed and moved out of the administrative area into some sort of a market arrangement. The arguments that were canvassed in the BTCE report were such that they were for a full market approach. That report was tested in a special report completed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which the honourable member for Short was Chairman, and of which the honourable member for Mitchell was also a member. This report, which is very detailed and well written-it has been received by the Government and by the Opposition with their full support - argu- that there ought to be· a move towards a market system of spectrum allocation. It recognises that spectrum is a scarce commodity, that those who want it cannot always be satisfied under the. allocation system, and that, therefore, because of the requirement to get as many people as happy as possible, those who claim to have a priority in what they want to do will have to bid for it. That is how the system will work. But it is not,and it ought not, to be seen to be a management system that applies to all areas of the spectrum. In this country, because of the scarcity, we require that certain parts of the spectrum be kept fortelevision, for example, and radio. The areas which are planned for those people's use are dealt with by a completely different management regime, and that is focused on the Australian Broadcasting Authority which manages that part of the spectrum. The Civil Aviation Authority. and the Defence Department are not impacted by these proposals. They are a bit like pepper and salt; they are sprinkled throughout the spectrum from the high frequency to the low frequency. The radio spectrum resource provides the potential to communicate information via the electromagnetic ra(Jio waves which are artificially introduced by means of transmission. equipment. The spectrum resource is defined in terms of the range of useful frequencies over which radio waves can be transmitted, and it is used to relay information through space between geographically separate points without the aid of wires. By way of observation, I make' the point that what is happening in the technological areas now is an amazing transition: the services that are now transmitted primarily by airwaves are now seeking to be transmitted by wires or optic fibre. The converse is the case: those that-have always sought to be delivered by a wire, such as telephones, are now seeing the greatest growth with their delivery by way of using the airwaves. The classic example is that the ordinary telephone comes to people's houses by way of a wire, but now people also have the option of taking on a mobile phone which utilises spectrum space. Where is the growth? It is in what is the convenient method of communicating: the mobile phone, which is the only area in which there is tremendous growth currently in the telecommunications area, and which seeks to use spectrum. With this interesting transition, as these two trends pass each other, we will see greater demands on spectrum. Interestingly today we have made decisions about pay television which we will see at some stage in the future in this country. Ultimately the best delivered method of that sort of entertainment will not necessarily be through the airwaves. Initially, it will be off the satellite, but ultimately it will be by way of cable or optics. This will provide far greater capacity and far greater channel capacity and choice, and they will be interactive; that is, a message will come into people's homes and they can dial whatever they want. The message will go out and people can do their home banking. All that is going to be done by way of optic fibre rather than by w-y of telephone over the airwaves. All of that is changing. All of a sudden video and data are going to go down the wire, and voice communication is going to go over the air. It is those sorts of changes, if I am not being too convoluted about it, which have to be reflected in how we manage the spectrum. One of the basic properties of the electromagnetic wave is its frequency, which is the rate at which it oscillates when radiated in the form of radio energy. The unit in which frequency is expressed is the hertz-a bit like the car rental company-one hertz being equal to one cycle per second. The range of useable frequency ascends from three gigahertz to around 300 gigahertz. This'range is referred to as the radio frequency spectrum; it is the use of that spectrum that this reform relates to. I have here a chart-it is not a Picasso painting-which is a demonstration of what the radio frequency looks like. It is. for the benefit of the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), who I know likes to keep things simple, and I guess in radio frequency discussions one has to do that. What we are trying to demonstrate here is that the market process that is being proposed does not relate to those parts that are marked in white on the chart; that is, the areas of PM, TV, UHF, satellite broadcasting, TV, VHF, MDS-the microwave distribution system which, if the pay TV Bill does get through tonight, could start providing localised pay TV early next year-AM radio, Radio Australia, and so on. Those areas are not affected by this reform but the other bits shown on the chart are. This very interesting chart details who uses the spectrum. The top of the chart shows. that submarines use a very low frequency. At the other end it shows that another range of users use the high frequency. The Minister is left to make a determination as to which part of the spectrum is going to be used for the market processes. Therefore, the decisions of the Minister will be vital as this area develops. I believe that the process of this reform needs to be reasonably fast, but we are going to be limited by the physical properties of spectrum and the great difficulties that we have had over time in clearing spectrum and the conversion arrangements, which can take a long time. Generally the principle has been to wait for equipment to run out and then for room to be made for somebody else on the spectrum. This process is designed to clear the spectrum a little quicker because, my view, that administrative process is going to deliver spectrum space to deal wIth what I believe will be an increasingly rapid emergence of other users who want to .get access to that spectrum space. It is a detailed matter. It is not a confusing matter but it is an extremely important matter because at the centrepiece of the telecomsion munications and broadcasting areas and ought potential services lie the use and access to spectrum. Whilst we have a limitation now the number of television licences, in the future with free to air television we may well have more people who want to compete for such space, and television takes up huge slabs of spectrum. I think the reform proposed the BTCE and by the Parliament is a timely reform. Interestingly it comes at the end of period of some changes in telecommunications. In a lot of those areas I have argued in this place over the last little while that that level of reform is limited. It needs to go further than it does. In a sense we are being driven by the march or'technology in ·this area and we need to recognise that fact and accommodate ourselves to it. I seek the indulgence of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) to table a small paper that the Opposition has prepared which goes into considerably more detail about different areas of the Act. It also makes some points about how the system will work. I will detail some of the concerns that I have, but I do not think it is appropriate to take the time of the House to go through all of the matters now, so I seek leave to table the paper. Leave granted.",50
310,Mr SMITH,RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS TAXES,"There are a couple of points that I want' to make. Broadcasting services can be delivered directly by satellite-MDS, microwave and cable. That is the technology the trend that we have to recognise. There is no longer a scarcity of communications channels as such, and the radio spectrum will be eased by digital compression and the terrestrial cable by digitalised fibre optics compression. ask Digital compression is a new term that we have picked up in this place over the last month because it has a major impact on pay in television. What it effectively does is to move - ot us away from the oldanalog system. We can cast our. minds back to the pay TV debate when we were arguing about analog and how we would split up the transponders, the channels and so on. But now, of course, we have a digitised environment. We in this place have all embraced that digital video compresis the method by which pay television to be delivered. It provides a different the approach completely and it is an approach of which maximises choice. What we have long argued is that we ought not to have artificial constraints imposed upon the use of digital compressed video, which my colleagues in the . Senate will have a little more to say about by tonight with respect to pay TV. It is a very significant change from only a a month ago. When we look at this area and at pay TV, we ought to recognise the change that has been brought about. A broad band network can carry both point to multipoint, for example, television broadcasts, and point to point, for example, telephoneconversations. interactive and non-interactive services. That is the point I was making before about the crossover that is taking place. That crossover to technologies is the centrepiece of the requirement on public policy makers to respond in how we manage and grant access to this spectrum. In my view what will happen is that there will be an emergence of spectrum management agents--':'a bit like real estate agents. They will identify spectrum space opportunities for particular service providers and will do all the necessary bits and pieces for the Spectrum Management Agency to secure that spectrum and then seek to get the relevant licence for the relevant fee that will need to be bid for. One of the concerns that I have is that, if that emerges, we do not want to have people buying up spectrum space to try to capture spectrum space in an anti-competitive way. I do not think enough thought has been given to some of those dangers. If we compare this legislation with the New Zealand legislation-others have commented on this-the New Zealand legislation contains a lot more detail about how its system works than we have about the system proposed to be put in place here. This Government is preparing for an election. We have just seen the rushing in of a report this afternoon, Counting the 'vote on election night, so that it can be debated tomorrow, and the introduction by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services a short while ago of Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 to remodel the old Parliament House and to give money here, there and everywhere for sporting programsMr O'Keefe-Bass won't have any vote to worry about. .",53
311,Mr SMITH,RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS TAXES,"None of it will come to the seat of Bass, I might say. That would be the Government's definition of fairness-to pick on the little States. Clearly, what is taking place is preparation for an election. We think this reform is extremely important. It opens the door. It does not necessarily go as far or as fast as we would want, but we are limited by a whole range of factors. Broadly speaking, I know that the departmental people are sensitive to those concerns, and I wish them well in the undertaking, which is an extremely important one. It is appropriate to signal that, given that this does not start until 1 July 1993, and given that the election will obviously be before then, there may be an opportunity to give voice in a legislative sense at some future time to some of the concerns that I have raised here. They do not go to the centrepiece of this proposed reform but they go to matters that might help to improve it. With those few remarks and the paper that I have tabled, I indicate that we have pleasure in supporting these tax Bills and will also support the primary Bill in the other place and, ultimately, when it comes in here. I commend the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for its work, which was very important in finalising a view Jor government, and all those involved in what I believe is a very significant change.",54
312,Mr OKEEFE,RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS TAXES,"In following the remarks made by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), let me say that members of the Government appreciate the spirit of cooperation which has evolved through his understanding and perception of these issues. It is obvious that we have an amount of bipartisan cooperation, which is good to see in the House, on the main Bill and on this legislation, the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1992, the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1992, the Radiocommunications (Test Permit Tax) Amendment Bill 1992 and the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill 1992. The Bills which are passing through the House of Representatives at the moment are machinery Bills which will give effect to some of the taxation collection arrangements that flow from changes in spectrum management. I will take a few minutes of the House's time to reflect on the degree of reform which has taken place in this field of broadcasting during, the last three years. Obviously this legislation and the main Bill being introduced in the Senate pretty well wind up the process dealing with these issues in the period of government from 1990 to 1993. , I pay a significant compliment to the officers of the Department who have been working their way through many changes in policy and changes in approach to give effect, in legislative terms, to what we have decided to do in these areas. They have also, obviously, provided professional input to our thinking on this issue. I commend them for the expertise and professionalism, with which they have tackled these issues. When the Government was re-elected in March 1990, and the Ministry of Transport and Communications was taken up by the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), there was a keen awareness within the Government that there needed to be an acceleration in the area of micro-economic reform as it related particularly to transport and communications. As I was Chairman of the Government's Caucus committee in this' area, I can say that there was no shortage of lobbyists, representing a whole range of interests, who reinforced that view. The first people I spoke with were from the radio industry. They were very concerned about changes in technology, changes in spectrum and their relative position vis-a-vis all the changes taking place in communications technology, in marketing and in the public or commercial broadcasting fields. Down the line from what we call commercial broadcasting has been a range of, interested users of various kinds of radio communications technology, be they emergency services groups, volunteer groups or public broadcasters, who have all taken an interest in this and have had some say in the way the spectrum has been changed. It was pleasing to note that, towards the end of his contribution, the honourable member for Bass made adequate reference to the emerging digital compression technology. I think it is fair for everyone to understand even with the work that has been done by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Shortland  which have been submitted to and adopted by the Government about changes to spectrum management, we are trying to keep up with rapidly changing technology and rapidly changing demands for scarce space. We know full well that, whatever changes we may be making and facilitating at the moment, it is quite likely that with the arrival of digital compression in radiocommunications the whole picture will change quite dramatically. It is a little difficult at the moment for a government and people at our level of involvement to say exactly how that might take place. I make the point that we will be relying heavily on the professionals in the Department to keep ahead of those developments and perhaps to let us know how we should be positioning our thinking on dealing with digital compression in the field of radio spectrum management. There has been dramatic reform in the field of communications with Minister Beazley, ex-Minister Richardson and now Minister Collins. The legislation has been completely rewritten and introduced in the form of the new Broadcasting Authority and its various aspects: There was - n urgent need to clean up and enforce clear rules of ownership of broadcasting licences, particularly as they related to commercial television. Many honourable members will remember all those' debates about how much foreign ownership there ought to be, the crossmedia rules, and the whole box and dice. It seems as if we have thought about nothing else for three years., I would say that in the broad portfolio of transport and communications this has been no more than just one of a number of issues that have had to be dealt with. But within the communications area the debates have covered the field of the ownership of commercial broadcasting licenses, be they radio or television, the restructuring of the broadcasting legislation, the development of the new Broadcasting Authority, the work that that, has been done on spectrum management and radio lic-nces leading to the legislation in place now and the establishment of Austel as the telecommunications industry regulator and the body that will playa key role in licensing equipment. As the honourable member for Bass said, in the past changes in licensing and broadcasting patterns have tended to try to accommodate changes in technology. We are now finding that the technology is rapidly outstripping the ability to just put in place a set of rules and regulations that adequately covers it. So we have had to develop approaches which are more flexible and yet still enforceable, and at the same time we have had to look to the question of industry policy to ensure that there is as much Australian involvement as possible in the manufacturing ofMr Ronald Edwards-Hear, hear! Very important.",54
313,Mr OKEEFE,RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS TAXES,"I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his support on that principle, because it is an overriding principle within the Government and one that he has argued vociferously through Caucus discussion. In fact, one might say that in the Government he is the advocate of Australian industry. Obviously, part of the requirement of Austel has been to ensure not only that the equipment which is licensed meets the needs of spectrum management, but also that the Government's industry policies for the development and maintenance of the industry are reflected in the sort of equipment which is licensed. That is going to be evermore so a requirement as pay television and digital compression, mobile phones and the rest of it come into these fields. We have also been through a massive reform of the telecommunications system, including opening up to competition the monopoly Telecom with the introduction of Optos and the second and third mobile telephone licences. All those issues relate to scarce use of ear space and hearing space and the technology by which we reach people in . their homes. Minister Collins, who came to the portfolio halfway through the year, has all of a sudden found himself having to embrace a wide range of issues. I think he has been able to do so in a way that reflects the need not only to satisfy the various interests but also to understand the processes in the Senate, which requires some expertise. It is often a bit of a maze that we certainly do not understand here. Senator Collins has had the difficulty of trying to negotiate support for his legislation not only through this House-and I think the honourable member for Bass has been both understanding and cooperative right through that process, and he is commended for thatbut also through the Senate. For whatever reason, Senator Collins has met many frustrations. So I guess that understanding and working through that process in order to achieve these vital reforms is very difficult. The legislation that we are passing today is obviously going through the House with the support of the Opposition. It is basically a machinery function, and that is fine. It is the process by which we are introducing another set of major reforms in a very fast moving, probably the fastest moving, part of our economy in spectrum management and new technology in broadcasting, be it radio, television, telephones, mobile phones or whatever. As I said at the outset of my contribution, it is an area where officers of the Department in particular have had to take a very proactive approach in making sure that the legislation not only meets the needs of users in the industry but also keeps pace with changing information, changing decisions that have been made within the Government and changing priorities. I assure all who have assisted the Minister in that process that they have both my encouragement and my sympathy for the traumas that have been involved. Having said that, I support the legislation and . welcome the fact that the Opposition is also supporting it.",56
314,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS TAXES,"I am pleased to support the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). I thank him for his contribution and, as always, his very intelligent commitment to the broadcasting issues. His involvement in the communications area is considerable and acknowledged by people in the community, both professionals and consumers. I am sure that it is also acknowledged in his electorate. As the honourable member for Burke pointed out very accurately, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) has been helpful in respect of this debate. There are four· Bills before the House concerning essentially the management of the spectrum generally. The honourable member for Burke referred to the Spectrum Management Agency. I want to address a couple of issues in relation to spectrum management matters. The first is a matter of concern in relation to radio stations. There has been a cycle, and people would have been aware that in the 1980s there was clearly an asset valuation that saw radio station prices become somewhat unrealistic. That was the first thing. The second thing was the move largely from many radio stations out of the AM band into the FM band, again at somewhat inflated prices. We are now in a more realistic period where radio stations are finding their feet, to speak. Many radio stations are finding great difficulty in returning a profit, because they are trying to service overvalued assets. However, the thrust of what the honourable member for Burke said is that we are now adopting a very intelligent approach to the management of radio stations. There is always this tension between the need for regulation and the need for greater freedom in the marketplace for players in the spectrum. But we also have to acknowledge that, if there is not proper spectrum management, things do happen. The honourable member for Burke referred, very. accurately I might say, to the development of things such as the mobile telephone networks; we also have equipment such as CB radios being developed. Unless there is proper management, which implies regulation of radio signals to, begin with, we run the risk of getting conflicts, including sometimes interference between free to air services. These include radio signals and other signals that are likely to cause disruption. I want to make the general point that, whilst we talk about deregulation, unless we have management we end up with unsatisfactory conflicts in the marketplace which cannot always be easily resolved. One source of irritation in my electorate occurs when there is interference in radio and television signals. The law is somewhat silent on this. There was a torts case in England in which there was an attempt to establish that overhead transmission towers with high voltage lines were causing interference with television signals. The law is not really on the side of the individual consumer in this respect. As members of parliament, we do from time to time get approaches on matters like this. We need to be conscious of the need to manage. In Perth there is one particular aspect which my colleague the honourable member for Burke, who is from Melbourne, would not have to face. This is a ground conductivity problem. Perth is basically a sand plain with high concentrations of limestone, which absorbs radio signals. The signals do not bounce very well, so AM stations in particular so have a distribution problem. The growth of Perth as a city has meant that it is difficult for some of the AM stations to get their signals to. the outer suburbs. I particularly refer to 1080 and 882 6PR, which have some problems getting their signals distributed. With more sensitive spectrum management I think that this can be more readily addressed. In recent times we have seen developments in the public broadcasting area. This goes back to the days of Whitlam. I refer particularly to a station in Perth called Radio 6NR, which is having some difficulty changing attitudes towards its sponsorship and the requirement that there· be certain sponsorship announcements during certain hours of broadcast. This is an issue raised with .me that we need to be conscious of. To explain this for the benefit of the House, 6NR takes a signal from the BBC, the BBC World Service, and the BBC requires that the program not be interrupted by sponsorship announcements. If we insist that the station broadcast sponsorship announcements, it cannot continue to offer this service. I would like the advisers to know of this matter because it is something that needs to be addressed and examined. This station also tries to offer uninterrupted coverage of football games. In fact, it adopts the same notion that sponsorship announcements should not interrupt the coverage. It is a matter to addressed. I am told that the current requirements are somewhat restrictive, so I would appreciate this matter being investigated. Another local problem involving spectrum management concerns radio station 882 6PR. Honourable members would be aware that in various States of Australia the TAB either owns or has an interest in radio stations, obviously to get a coverage of racing. Here I refer to getting to air the greyhound racing and trotting events. It happens that the TAB owns 882 6PR in Perth. Conflict has arisen because the TAB has been insisting that 6PR should put an increasing number of race meetings to air. This has considerable potential for conflict with the talkback offerings of the station. Quite frankly, in the long term, this imperils the station's survival because there is not a sufficient racing market to sustain a station the size of 6PR. In order to resolve this, 6PR managementCheri Gardener and her colleagues-very intelligently approached the ABA to see whether it could apply for a special narrow cast licence. The intention is that 882 6PR will offer its normal program-and these days it is largely a talkback program with a very good news service-interspersed with major metropolitan race meetings and the rest of the race meetings will be serviced ,by a separate transmitter and a separate signal. The signal that has been identified is 1206 on the AM band, formerly occupied by a station called 6KY and which has now become KYFM. I am talking here about race meetings in luminary places such as Wauchope. I expect that the Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar), although he is a man of considerable savoirfaire, has probably not been to Wauchope. Nor have I, so I do not know that the whole population of Australia glues itself to these broadcasts. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) will be aware of some of these out of the way places' that are asking for these events to be put to air. That is fine, let us do that, but let us not occupy major metropolitan radio stations with these events. By all means put metropolitan broadcasts from places such as Randwick and be Flemington to air,but certainly not the more out of the way ones. I think that we can have the best of both worlds. I am encouraging the radio station and the TAB to pursue that course of action. When we next hear Wauchope races being broadcast in the new year I hope it will be on this other transmitter, on the 1206 position on the dial, and not on 882, because then we can ensure that the 70-odd people employed by 6PR will be able to service both those markets. While many people are devoted to having a punt, many people believe that enough is enough and that it is better to separate these two services. I put it on record that I think this is an issue that needs to be addressed. I might say that the ABA is being very helpful. An application has been lodged and a' spectrum point has been identified at which the station can broadcast. I wish to commend the 6PR radio station manager, Cheri Gardener. She has been very concerned about serving her listeners, the people who support the station by way of advertising, and certainly the staff of the radio station. I believe this issue can be sensibly addressed under this new arrangement. Interestingly, this process is somewhat deregulated as we have not had to go through this whole public hearing stage. I think that is a very important innovation as the TAB is likely to be the only major bidder for such a facility. I now move to another issue relating to spectrum management. It relates to the ABC. The ABC puts to air an excellent program called ,Grandstand which, as we know, from this weekend will be broadcasting, amongst other things, the Australia versus West Indies cricket match from the Gabba. I wish the Australian players well. Probably the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) will be there; I know she is very busy and an effective campaigner. The match will involve some distinguished Queenslanders, Craig MCDermott being one. The ABC does very well in putting this program to air, but there is a particular problem in Western Australia as we have a threehour time difference. We are not enlightened enough to have daylight saving. On Sundays the Grandstand program does not begin until 12 noon, which is 3 o'clock in the afternoon in Melbourne and Sydney and 2 o'clock in Brisbane. Listeners in Western Australia are being denied a lot of coverage of these important events. I am hopeful that test cricket can go to air earlier. At the moment we have a gardening. program and an arts program in the morning. I am devoted to gardening, but I think the coverage of gardening could well be run at some other time. I have a considerable worry that historically the ABC has been somewhat preoccupied with arts coverage. Basically the blue singlet community, if I can use that term, is ignored by the ABC, with the exception of sporting broadcasts. Those people pay tax too. Why is it that the ABC is .resistant to dealing with the ordinary person? I am troubled by that. I hope that the ABC can take the matter on board-and I am sure that Neville Oliver, as the Director of Sport for ABC radio, will take it on board-and that the refusal of 6WF to put Grandstand to air earlier can be dealt with. We do need a proper coverage in a State such as Western Australia. It has signifiRadio cant implications for many listeners, and I want to draw attention to it in this radiocommunications debate. The ABC has obviously already undertaken the cost of producing the program. What it now needs to do is to take that next huge step for people-that is, to press the button and let the program go to air. I know it is a big step, but it is a step that can be taken. It will let the program go to air in Western Australia, where it is fudged by putting to air a local program-in this case, a narrow audience requirement-which could have been put to air at any other time during the week. I appeal to the ABC to try to address this issue in a sensible way, and I am sure that it can. If we are talking about the proper management of the spectrum, we ought to be talking about the proper management of radio stations which are operating within that spectrum. I want to address those remarks specifically, and I appeal to Glenn Darlington and George Grljusich in Perth to try to address the matter. I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have heard of those people. I hope they can address that matter properly and let the ABC coverage continue. I have a particular interest in this matter. ABC metropolitan stations used to carry the parliamentary broadcast signal. I thank my colleagues because, were it not for the cooperation of members of Parliament in having the signal moved from metropolitan ABC to another spot on the dial and using the standby transmitters, we would be dominating radio stations such as 2BL, 3LO, 6WF and 5AN all around Australia. The Parliament was sensible. It let the signal be moved and made good use of the spectru-. But I think the ABC has to say, 'Having done that, how can we sensibly make these adjustments?'. In the light of that, I appeal to the ABC to listen to this question, because in Western Australia distance is a considerable problem. WA tends to be somewhat remote, and it is organisations such as the ABC that keep us linked in. It can do that only if it puts to air programs that have broad-based listener interests. The next matter regarding the spectrum is Australia's coverage. On Saturdays Radio Australia puts to air the 3LO coverage from Melbourne, which is the sporting coverage, and that goes to people all around the world. On Sundays it puts to air the 2BL coverage, which covers Sydney rugby league and other matters. These are already produced by the ABC, so they are relatively cost-free, with the exception of one or two people in the Radio Australia studio on Saturdays. I was alarmed to see that Radio Australia was moving to cut these broadcasts. Australia is noted for many things, one of which is sporting achievement. In the international arena, people-be they expatriates or from other nations-are interested in how Australia is performing. We ought to do two things. This Parliament ought to say to Radio Australia, 'You should keep your sporting coverage there because it is important that people around the world can hear about what is happening in sporting matters' - and they do. In particular, I am thinking of service personnel who are posted overseas. I was appalled at the initial response I received from Radio Australia, which said that it does not have a strong commitment to servicing Australian expatriates. I find that appalling. Why should that be the case? It did say there was a Cabinet submission that said it had to lower its commitment to expatriates. I have not been able to find where Cabinet said, 'You shouldn't be servicing an expatriate audience'. My response was, 'Expatriates pay tax. Why should they not be serviced? Why should people. who are in embassies and consulates, who are overseas working for Austrade, who are overseas working on business-and we are encouraging people to go overseas on business-and service personnel who are overseas not be provided with a service?' Some of the decisions are made by people who seem to take delight in polishing Volvos in Manuka and who live in comfortable a situations. But there are many people electorate who work in outback places in Western Australia, as they do in South Australia and other large electorates, who need coverage by organisations such as Radio Australia-that includes the electorate of Maranoa. I need to remind those people who live in great comfort in downtown Melbourne, Canberra or Sydney that there are people in outback Australia whom we ought to be I servicing. Guess what? The ABC services them mostly, but Radio Australia also services them. I remind Radio Australia, and Mr Broinowski, that it does have a total obligaFremantle tion.

I was somewhat annoyed with. the mentality of Radio Australia when it said, 'We should be preoccupied with these other matters'. What matters? The first time it cut the sporting broadcast, what did it put on? Not an Australian concert; it put Beethoven to air. Despite testing myself, I could not understand what particular quality Beethoven brought to that broadcast. Mr MCLachlan-The Prime Minister instructed it, probably.",60
316,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS TAXES,"I do not think so. I think it was part of this cultural push. I do enjoy that sort of music, but I think it is better provided by people themselves. Why is it that Radio Australia and the ABC sometimes tend to be preoccupied with providing services for people who very often can provide them themselves because they have more income, for example, to attend concerts? When I look across the spectrum and see the service provided by the ABC for orchestras and ABC stereo FM-dare I say it - I think . the ABC and Radio Australia should remind themselves that they have what I would call blue-collar obligation. These people pay tax in my and they are Australians as well. We have only to look at how successful do programs such as Australia All Over and Coodabeen Champions are. I seek an assurance from the Opposition that in its policy it will not seek to remove the JJJ youth network. That has been talked about, but I would hope that it would not be intending to do that. would hope that it would use this debate to say that it would keep the JJJ youth network on air. I attended the presentation by H.G. and Roy at the Metropolis Night Club in last Saturday. JJJ provides a very service, particularly in its commitment to other programs such as youth education and AIDS education. JJJ is a very good service. I hope we can get from the Opposition a commitment to retain JJJ. I have not yet talked about violence on TV videos because it is outside the ambit of this Bill, but I have very strong feelings about it. I wanted to put before the House some issues regarding radio management which the Australian public has raised with me and which I believe needs consideration and needs to be drawn to the attention of the House.

317,Mr MCLACHLAN,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"Barker) (5.51 p.m.)The purpose of the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 originally was to amend three Acts. Subsequently, it was expanded to deal with four items and, at 2 o'clock today, we found that yet another item had been added to the list, yet another amendment-an amendment to the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972. I have to say that the processes of this place are breaking down. How on earth is 1992 anybody supposed to seriously address these sorts of matters when they are· thrown in at the last minute, with no notice, I might say, to the 'Opposition? In some way or other I suppose they are supposed to sneak trnough. My colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) will address this matter a litt-e later, but I have to say that it is a scurrilous way of dealing with the business of this country. As we saw the other day, introducing 70 Bills in a matter of a fortnight is a ridiculous way of dealing with legislation and matters of great import. I have no idea whether this amendment is a matter of great import because I saw it only about 20 minutes ago. In fact, nobody in this place saw it until Question Time when it was thrown on the table. 1992 This omnibus Bill deals with four items which I will take one by one. The first item is to extend the life of the Automotive Industry Authority from 1992 to 2000. The second item proposes amendments to the National Measurement Act to extend the role and powers of the National Measurement Commission and tighten the policing of the accuracy of measurement equipment. The third item amends the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 to provide for decisions about residual terms and conditions of appointment relating to the office of the Chief Executive of the CSIRO to be made by the Minister rather than by the Governor General. The fourth item in this omnibus Bill relates to the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 and the Trade Marks Act 1955 and provides for stiffer penalties to be imposed for counterindustry. feitingand forgery of trademarks and for falsely describing imported goods or goods intended for export. The coalition is opposed to two parts Bill; namely, the extension of the life of the Automotive Industry Authority to the year 2000 and the amendments to the National Measurement Act. We will, therefore, be moving amendments at the committee stage to have these clauses omitted. I would like now to deal with each part of this' omnibus Bill in turn. The Automotive Industry Authority is a Commonwealth statutory body, established in 1984, to oversee the implementation of the Commonwealth Government's post-1984 plan for the Australian passenger motor vehicle industry. The Automotive Authority'S functions are to encourage industry to develop in a way consistent with the policy Of the Commonwealth Government, to promote change within the industry directed to improving its efficiency and to monitor the performance of an outlook for the industry. The proposed amendment to extend the life of the Authority will involve ongoing annual running costs of some $1.1m and cover administrative expenses and salaries and 215,000 annual property operating expenses. The coalition's well-known policy with regard to the automotive industry is to phase out protection to 5 per cent-not to zero as is put about by the Government, erroneouslyby the year 2000. This is in line with our policy of negligible protection for all industries at that time. That is because we have a long standing opposition to direct intervention in these industries-in fact, in all industriesand there is no purpose, therefore, in retaining such an authority. In recent times, there has been a Morgan poll on the car industry. We do not know who commissioned it; nevertheless it has been published. A number of interesting points came from that Morgan poll. For example, when asked whether near zero tariffs would mean a more efficient car industry, no car industry, no difference, or they could not say, a majority of Australians answered that near zero tariffs would mean a more efficient car In fact, 42 per cent answered that way and 34 per cent answered another way. In other words, they said that there would be no Australian car industry. That is a point of this with which we totally disagree. If the same people were asked the proper questions arising from the coalition's policy, questions which encompassed the whole range of coalition policy-and those questions would be whether. near zero tariffs would mean a more efficient car industry, a' better car industry or a more profitable car industry, along with tax cuts of the order of 50 per cent of the business taxes that those industries pay, along with personal tax cuts of 30 per cent across an average of Australian consumers of cars, along with a fuel tax reduction of 30 per cent of people's fuel bills, whether they are private citizens or in business-we would get a completely different set of figures again. We would not only have a majority of people saying that there would be near zero tariffs under these circumstances with those other very beneficial changes, meaning that we would have a more efficient car industry, but also we would have many more than 42 per cent of people opting for those changes. In other words, I suggest that when the right questions are asked, different results come out-results which are more accurate in regard to the sorts of conclusions that people ought to reach rather than those that are reached on questions that are a little short of information. The coalition's well-known policy, as I have said, is to reduce industi:y protection to 5 per cent by the year 2000. This Morgan poll shows that without the right questions being asked we can still get 42 per cent of the population considering that reduced tariffs will lead to a more efficient Australian car industry. Of course, a whole lot of other benefits come about. An independent analysis done by ACIL consultants, which represented the car industry only a couple of years ago in its submission to the Industry Commission, says that the industry will produce about 350,000 more Australian cars by the year 2000 under our policy than under the Button plan. Even if it is half right, a great deal of benefit will be conferred not only upon the consumers-who under our policy will benefit from cheaper cars, the reduction of taxes, the reduction of costs, the reduction of their own taxes and, therefore, more after tax income, the reduction of fuel costs and so forth-but also upon the dealers and the manufacturers because they will have more throughput. As everybody knows, we have to have a minimum number of vehicles going down a prod\lction line \to get the economies of scale. People will benefit through greater competisort tiveness and through the maintenance of a higher share of the Australian market vis-a-vis imports. For instance, we are now looking at the export of the Mitsubishi Magna and other cars. We will be able to export more cars because our costs will be lower. If those things come to fruition, which we woulq expect, then there will be greater employment of people in that industry. The people in the industry will have more secure jobs, because those jobs will be based on a greater throughput and a greater certainty of export. It is important that people understand these facts in these sorts of debates. We will make sure that people benefit from the microeconomic reform which we will bring about. It is quite tragic that this Government has given up on micro-economic reform. Honourable members do not have to take my word for it; the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said not long ago that-and I paraphrase his words-there is no further to go on micro reform. I see the Ministet: for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who is at the table, is smiling at that mistake. It is a monumental mistake. It is quite wrong to say that we have gone as far as we can go on micro reform. I think it was Ross Gittins who, in an article in the day or so, wrote, 'Of course, we have done some micro reform, but we have not done nearly enough'. That is absolutely right, because the lack of cost savings impinges upon the cost of making a motor car, whether the motor car is made in this country for consumption in this country or whether it is made by a car company that wishes to export. For each year from 1994 through to the year 2000, the ACIL report said that car manufacturers and car dealers would be better off under Fightback. Cars will be more affordable-they will be cheaper to buy and cheaper to run. It also said that as the coalition will abolish fuel tax and because consumers will be paying less income tax, as I have said earlier in this debate, people will have higher disposable incomes and will be able to buy more motor cars. There would be no purpose in retaining the Automotive Industry Authority, which is a of vestige of Labor's failed policies for the Australian car industry. Honourable members do not have to take my word for that; they should ask all of those people who have lost their jobs in the automobile industry in the last three or four years. Thousands upon thousands of people have lost their jobs under this Government's policy. They have lost those jobs. because the Government has not made the savings which it could have made in the public sector. It has not made the micro reforms which are so important. For example, in South Australia the bill for power at the Mitsubishi works went up by 18 per cent in the year before last. On the one hand, we are saying to these manufacturers, 'You have to get your prices down. You have to cut the costs of making these things', and on the other hand a State government is allowed to put up, through its own inefficiency no doubt, one of those costs by 18 per cent. We will be opposing that particular part of this Bill. The proposed amendments to the National Measurement Act 1960 will provide for the certification of reference materials, many of which come from overseas, so that the - eas­ urements made using such materials satisfy the traceability provisions of the Act. The last amendments also provide for the pattern approval and certification, as found appropriate, of measuring instruments used for legal purposes other than trade measurements, so that such measurements will comply with the traceability provisions of the Act. In relation to the test procedures used to determine the amount of error in a measuring instrument to be specified in certificates of approval, uniform trade measurement legislation being introduced by the States and Territories requires the test procedures to be specified so that uniform testing is ensured following the licensing of industry personnel to perform instrument certification. The amendments provide for the examination of measuring instruments to ensure compliance with their approved pattern. They also provide for the clarification of Australia's obligations under the convention establishing an international organisation of legal metrology. The consultation process between industry and government has been non-existent. This has been admitted by Senator Button in the other place. If it has not been non-existent, it has clearly been deficient. Ind-d, the weighing industry was not even consulted during the preparation of this Bill. As Senator Bishop outlined in the other place, Senator Button himself recognised that there was little or no consultation in a letter that he wrote to that industry association on 8 September. He said: Your Association has also criticised the lack of consultation on the legislative amendment, and expressed fears that this is a means for the Commission to introduce a load cell pattern ance scheme by stealth. I understand the Commission accepts that consultation on the legislative amendments was deficient and more attention will be paid to informing and consulting stakeholders future. Bravo! That is a fine admission by Senator Button. However, it does not help the weighing industry one bit. The major concern of that industry is that the National Standards Commission which administers the Act will expand its role into areas already covered by the States-which I read out earlier-leading to the duplication of those matters and higher costs for the industry. In the States, the industries are monitored by the weights and measures branches of the Department of Consumer Affairs. The Commonwealth Government involvement in this area has essentially been to set the standards, with the checks on compliance being handled by the States. The amendments take the Commonwealth Government into the area of compliance checking. It also appears that no serious attempt has been made by the Government to weigh up the costs and benefits of the amendments proposed, particularly the costs of sampling procedures. The weighing industry submitted that previously the National Standards Commission proposed to apply a fee of $1,550 for each sample load cell tested. There appears to be no limit in the amendments on how many samples can be taken and at what frequency. Therefore, there is potential for very substantial costs to be imposed on the industry, and these should be examined properly. There is some justification for government regulations for measuring equipment, to the extent that consumers who are not in the position to check the validity of measuring equipment-for instance, at petrol bowsers and the like-can be protected through such regulations. However, the amendments will provide for regulation far beyond the scope of consumer assurance. Finally, there is already a substantial delay-about a year, in fact-in gaining approval for new products through the National Standards Commission. Yet the amendments assur- propose that the Commission should expand its role with no additional Budget outlay. There is a case for the Commission to conin centrate on its existing role, to do it properly and to deliver the services it currently provides more effectively. The explanatory memorandum states that the amendments to the National Measurement Act have no financial impact. However, as we have pointed out in another· place, the National Standards Commission in the recent Budget gets an increase in operating expenses from $1.45min 1991-92 to $2.17m in 199293, which seems to me to represent about a 50 per cent increase in operating expenses in one year alone-a bit like the Budget itself. We will be pursuing that matter further in the committee stage following the Estimates reports. There were two amendments moved in the Senate by the Australian Democrats. The first was to delete the clause relating to entering premises for the purpose of selecting and measuring an instrument to be used in carrying out a procedure, and removing any sample from the premises for the purpose of carrying out that procedure. This amendment was not opposed by the coalition, as we had grave doubts about the search aml seizure powers and the manner in which they were to be imposed. The second amendment, that any regulations made under this section must provide adequate safeguards for the rights of persons affected, was also not opposed by the coalition, as we believe in protecting the righ- of the individual. The coalition will be moving an amendment in committee to have the clauses related to the National Measurement Act omitted. The proposed amendment to the Science and lndustry Research Act 1949 provides for decisions about residual terms and conditions of appointment relating to the office of the Chief Executive of the CSIRO be made by the Minister rather than the Governor General. It brings the section of the Act into line current legislative practice. We will not be opposing this section of the Bill, as it is basically a housekeeping amendment. The main purpose of the last section of the Bill concerning trademarks, which was added some time after the Bill was originally processed, is to impose stiffer penalties for counterfeiting and forgery of trademarks and for falsely describing imported goods or goods intended for export. These amendments are in line with the recommendations of the report of the working party to review the trademarks legislation entitled Recommended changes to the Australian trademarks legislation. The amendments also incorporate the concept of implied knowledge on the part of the defendant to cover both actual knowledge and recklessness, and provide for the characteristics of the defendant and the surrounding circumstances to be taken into account in the proceedings of the Trade Marks Act. These amendments have come about as a result of serious concerns raised by the industry, namely the Anti-Counterfeit Action Group and other parties, about the inadequate levels of penalties for forging trademarks and for importing and selling counterfeit goods. There have been an increasing number of interceptions by Customs of falsely described goods. Industry has not in the past mounted any cases against alleged forgers or counterfeiters as the court costs would have far outweighed returns and certainly would have outweighed the penalties handed down to the offenders. The penalties have not been reviewed since 1985. This legislation provides for a fiftyfold increase in penalties and the option of a twoyear imprisonment. The penalties are based on those imposed under the Copyright Act. We will not be opposing that section of the Bill.",61
318,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendmeht Bill 1992 makes several amendments to the Automotive Industry Authority Act 1984, the Science and Industry Research Act 1949, the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. The first major amendment introduced by this legislation is in part 2 of the Bill which alters the Automotive Industry with Authority Act 1984 to extend the effective life of the Automotive Industry Authority by some eight years. The original termination date for the authority was to be 31 December 1992; however, under this legislation the termination date will be extended to 31 December 2000. The amendment is necessary as a result of the industry statement brought down by the Government in 1991 in which the Prime Mitlister announced new arrangements for the automotive industry until the end of this decade. When it gave this commitment, it also announced that it would maintain an independent body over this time period so that the performance, of the industry could be monitored and the Government could be kept informed on the progress being made. The decision to maintain this watchdog body was made on the recommendation of the Industry Commission. Since its establishment, the Automotive Industry Authority has developed a reputation for providing unbiased and independent advice to the Government, based on its unparalleled level of expertise. The work the Authority already has in place means that it is the best body to carry out the monitoring role the Government has in mind for it to the end of the decade. In order for it to continue functioning in this capacity, the authority will need $l.lm to cover administrative expenses and $215,000 in annual property. operating expenses. This figure is based on the present level of funding and has been agreed to be a reasonable level by the Department of Finance. This Bill includes a minor amendment to the section of the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 that relates to the office of the Chief Executive of CSIRO. The Bill brings that section into line with the practice for other statutory bodies where decisions about tenns and conditions of appointment are made by the Minister rather than the Governor General as is the case under the existing legislation. This amendment will have no financial impact on the CSIRO. The same cannot be said about the proposals being put forward by the Opposition in the area of science and technology. It should be of no great surprise that the Fightback document does not even mention science and technology. The only mention of the area at all is in tenns of cuts to funding which would occur if the coalition were to occupy the treasury bench. Under the coalition's policies there would be a $20m cut to science and technology agencies during the first three years of a Hewson government, energy research funding would be cut by $30m, higher education research funding would also be cut by $39m, but, above and beyond this, the introduction of a GST would have a devastating impact on commercial and industrial research . which would attract a 15 per cent tax. The good news relating to R&D tax concessions is that I noticed the Opposition has decided to follow the Government's lead and support the 150 per cent tax deductibility, which is encouraging. Perhaps most disturbing of all is that the CSIRO, and other organisations that carry out similar research, would suffer a 10 per cent - cut in funding in what is described as an efficiency saving by those opposite. It is incredible that cutting back on Australia's research and development effort could be described as an efficiency saving. This is the type of short-sighted attitude that has held back scientific research in this country for many years. Every time cuts are made, the first place they are made is in research and development, because economic gurus, such as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), see little benefit from such research in the short tenn. On top of these deep cuts to funding, I understand that the Opposition is seriously considering proposals that include the privatisation of the Government's $ 100m CRCs, restructured funding for CSIRO along the lines of the New Zealand model, and the abolition of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The coalition's policy amounts to the withdrawal of government support for industrial research. Those opposite would sell the industrial research projects undertaken by the CSIRO and other public sector agencies at bargain basement prices. Only research done for its own sake would be supported by those opposite, and they have demonstrated no understanding of the need to link research in with the development of commercially viable goods and services. Many other research agencies would suffer cuts. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, an organisation that performs nuclear research and provides medical isotopes for the thousands of sick people, including cancer patients who require isotope treatment, would suffer direct cuts of $ISm over the first three years, severely limiting its ability to operate effectively. On top of this, ANSTO also estimates an additional cost of $100,000 a year to administer the GST. The Australian Science and Technology Council would see its funding reduced by $lm under the coalition, with the council itself being merged with the Prime Minister's own science council. Such a cut in the council's budget could not be achieved without a substantial cut in functions underinvalidated. taken by the body. The Bureau of Meteorology would see its funding reduced by $3Om over the first three years of a coalition government. The effect this cut would be to delay installation of equipment and reduce the quality and frehave quency bf meteorological reports and warnings, which are crucial to a lot of our areas. This would make these things difficult for industries such as tourism, farming, shipping and aviation which rely heavily on the advice provided to them by the bureau. While this Government is committed to providing adalso equate government support to Australia's· countries. research and development effort, those opposite clearly are not. The third major change that will result this Bill is the amendments it makes to the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905, which makes it an offence to trade in goods to which a false trade description has been applied. During the past year the Australian Customs Service has found an increase in the number of garments and footwear to which a false trade description has clearly beenapplied. Clearly, penalties for· importing falsely described goods have to be introduced in order to discourage this activity. The penalties that currently apply for this offence under the Commerce (Trade Descripconvention. tions) Act have not been increased since the legislation was introduced over 87 yearS To address this problem, part 2A of the Bill will introduce increased penalties for contramorally vening the Act, and it is expected amendments will result in an increase in revenue received by the Commonwealth. Two recent decisions of the Federal Court held that decisions for articles of uniform cross-section but of indeterminate length were not regisGATT trable under the Designs Act 1906. These decisions have the unfortunate effect of cancelling many registered designs, goiQg against the spirit and policy behind the origithe nal legislation. Part 2B of the Bill will make a change to the Designs Act 1906 to overcome this probTechnology lem. The amendment is retrospective so that any of the current design registrations affected by the two Federal Court decisions are not The amendments also include provisions that protect and compensate anyone who acted in the belief that the registration of a design was invalid as a result of the of Federal Court's decisions. The Government new does not anticipate that this amendment will any significant revenue implications. The third Act that will be amended by this legislation is the National Measurement Act 1960. This Act is the basis for the Australian national measurement system. The objective of the Act is to ensure that these measurements are consistent across Australia and are congruous with measurements in other The Bill amends the Act to take into account the uniform trade measurement legislafrom tion that has been introduced by State and Territory governments. The effect of these amendments is to allow a broader range of legal measurements than are presently covered by the Act. In addition, the amendments will clarify Australia's obligations under the international convention on legal metrology. Finally, the amendments. will ensure that . ,Australia's legal measuring instruments meet national and international standards. When an international convention was signed in 1959 to establish an international organisation of legal metrology, Australia supported this The organisation was given the task of calculating international requirements ago. for legal measuring instruments and those countries that are part of the convention are obliged to implement these decisions that these as far as possible. As the world moves more and more towards an international market for world trade, the importance of this convention has increased, particularly in regard to its relationship to the agreement on technical barriers to trade. The amendment contained in part 2B will clarify Australia's measurement obligations under this convention and will reduce difficulty of signing mutual recognition agreements with Australia's trading partners. Recently the Minister for Science and (Mr Free) was presented with the report of a working party which undertook a review of the trademark legislation. This report included recommendations that the present penalties for selling or importing of counterfeit goods and for forging trademarks be increased. In this Bill the Government addresses this issue by amending the Trade Marks Act 1955 in order to introduce increased penalties for counterfeiting and forgery, the first increase in penalty since 1985. The decision to take this action was announced by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) as part of the Government's package of assistance to the textile, clothing and footwear industries. Many of the amendments introduced in this Bill continue this Government's record of targeted support for Australia's export earning industries. This Government has done more than any other government to open up Australian industry to international competition. The reforms introduced by the Government have had as their aim the increased efficiency of domestic industry, in order to encourage industry to take up the opportunities that exist in international trade. We on this side of the House recognise that this is the only way that Australia will be able to enjoy sustainable levels of growth and employment in the longer term. This strategy has met with a considerable level of success, with exports of elaborately transformed non-metal manufactures growing at an annual rate of 15 per cent. This compares very favourably with the rate of 5.5 per cent which prevailed during the last five years of the previous Government. Since 1987 the overall level of manufactured exports has more than doubled. Under this Government the export of services has increased by 82 per cent. For the past six years, Australia has had highest level of growth in manufactured exports of any country in the OECD. We are now double the OECD average for growth in manufactured exports. Clearly, we have taken great strides forward in developing the export base in Australia under this strategy. While this Government has done everything possible to encourage the internationalisation of the Australian economy, it will continue to provide Government support to Australian industry against unfair competition from foreign competitors. Honourable members opposite are seeking to cut all Government assistance to industry by reducing all tariffs in Australia to zero and stopping all other assistance to industries undertaking the restructuring they need to become internationally competitive. Mr MCLachlan-That is not true.",65
319,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"It is true, very much so. Mr MCLachlan-Rubbish.",68
320,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"That is what those opposite have told us. Bodies such as the Automotive Industry Authority have played a vital role in the process of restructuring, and the need for the continuation of active government involvement in the process of restructuring is obvious. The area of industry asSistance, however, has become an area of strong disagreement for those opposite. Many members of the National Party want cuts introduced over a far longer time period than the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is demanding. The Nationals are slowly realising the devastating implications for domestic industry of Government support for import competing industries being withdrawn altogether. There are even members of the Opposition Leader's own Party who strongly disagree with the policy direction being taken by the coalition at the moment. Take, for example, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) who, on 9 September this year, told this House that his Party's Rambo-like obsession with reducing industry assistance is clearly an increasingly dangerous and exposed minority position in the world at large. The coalition's policies on iridustry assistthe ance have also caused a great deal of concern among business people involved in the industries that would be affected. Of course, the Automotive Industry Authority was set up to help the car industry through the restructuring process. The Opposition's zero tariff policies, if they were introduced, could very well wipe out Australia's automotive industry. All four of Australia's major car manufacturers-Ford, Toyota, GMH and Mitsubishihave said that future investment in Australia's car industry is in jeopardy as a result of the coalition's tariff policies. In March of this year, on the Channel 9 program Business Sunday, the head of Ford Australia, Mr Jac Nasser, said: Certainly at zero tariff levels, or very low tariff levels, it would be extremely difficult to justify new investments in the automotive industry in Australia. Bob Johnston, the President of Toyota Australia, also said that Toyota would not able to survive on zero tariffs. In March, Toyota announced an $800m investment in the motor vehicle industry in Australia, but this investment would be unlikely to proceed under zero tariffs. Rather than creating jobs, the industry assistance policies opposite would actually result in higher unemployment. That would be the end result. Rather than the constructive measures introto duced by this Government, such as the Autosupport motive Industry Authority, measures which are designed to help industries to adapt to pressures of the international marketplace, those opposite would simply tear down the tariff barriers and leave industries to fend themselves. This Government will continue support industries in their efforts to become globally competitive through measures such as the ones contained in this Bill. If I may, I will turn quickly to the Government's amendment to th- Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972, and refer to AIMS. I wish to place on the record my appreciation of Dr Joseph Baker. Dr Baker wrote to me just the other day-and, I Bendigo. am sure, to a lot of other members as welladvising that his seven-year term with AIMS has finished. I believe that Dr Baker has done adjourn. an outstanding job in his work there. I had the opportunity, with one of the parliamentary committees, to visit the AIMS operation south of Townsville, where my good friend the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) than a Minister. - not the Minister for Science and Technology, who is at the table-is the Federal Minister? member. The operation· of AIMS is incredible. I think that the amendment that has been put forward tonight by the Government will certainly further enhance the tunities for AIMS to expand. I believe that Dr Baker has done a tremendous job. I have also had the opportunity to meet him here in Canberra on the odd occasion as well. I think . that with Australians like Dr Joseph Baker, who make such a strong contribution to these sorts of projects, particularly in the marine science area, we have a great future. I think that it is only with people like Dr Baker that that will be achieved. I am sure be that he will be sadly missed by AIMS. Certainly, he will not be lost to industry generally. I understand that he is going back to the position he had before. I would just like to put on the record my appreciation of Dr Baker. I am sure that my colleagues in the of those Parliament would support me. I might leave it at that. I am very pleased have the opportunity tonight to rise and the amendments.

323,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,It is not in ·order for that motion to be moved by other Mr Halverson-What about a shadow,69
324,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"No, not a actually quite shadow Minister. Mr Halverson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take opporobjection to your comments because- .",69
325,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"They are not comments. I am referring to the Standing Orders. Mr Halverson-I do not doubt that, but this House can not now proceed because the Government only has a Minister at the table .. There are no other Government members in this place. The honourable member for Bendigo has moved that the House do now adjourn. I see absolutely no reason why that cannot be put. Mr Sciacca-What do you want to adjourn for? Mr Halverson-You're in disorder and disarray. I want to highlight that to the people of Australia. You are in disarray, Minister.",70
326,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"Standing order 50 states: A motion for the adjournment of the House may be moved only by a Mi-ister. No amendment can be moved to this motion. . So, according to the Standing Orders, I have to rule that motion out of order. Mr Halverson-I accept that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I highlight the point that I was making earlier: I think it is a most disgraceful state of affairs that this Parliament, which represents all Australians, is represent-d by one Government Minister only. I see absolutely no reaso!l why this House cannot be adjourned.",70

328,Mr REID,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"It is regrettable that the Government saw fit to have only a solitary member in the House when we are debating this important legislation. The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill provides the opportunity for the Opposition to examine the Government's policy and what it has achieved over the last three years. The Government's policy and its provision for industry and commerce has been quite disgraceful. We only need to think back to 26 February 1992, when the Government responded to concerns from industry and tabled a document entitled One Nation. Obviously everyone has forgotten about it now, because over the last 12 months the Government has not talked about One Nation; it has talked about everything but One Nation. One would have to ask: what has One Nation done for industry and commerce in Australia? The promise in that document of 800,000 new jobs over four years has been broken. The Government has failed miserably in itS ambition mainly because of its faulty industry and commerce policies. It has not provided the policies to enable us to thrive and progress. Almost one million people are now out of work. Those figures in the One Nation statement are grossly exaggerated. Nothing in that policy provides encouragement for industry to take on employees. I will run through a few of the measures that were outlined in the One Nation statement because I think it is timely; to remind people of exactly what One Nation promised for Australia. I want to refer to two initiatives on page 5 of the document. Those initiatives were to get things moving by implementing the. proposals that the Government said it would try to implement: providing $300m to Australian families with children-that is fair and reasonable-and providing major capital works pro-as of permanent benefit to the . nation. I want to address this latter measure. Amongst those major capital works programs were some of the big projects, as those opposite called them, such as building a rail highway and competitive ports. After 12 monthS of One Nation, those big projects have had funds taken away from them, particularly the rail network, which was to provide a standard gauge national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne and Adelaide. Rail transport is extremely important in this nation for industry and commerce. The Government, however, has now seen fit to dump that program and cOmpletely walk away from it. It has given no idea of when that work might occur and when the cost benefits for industry and commerce might flow on. The Government,· on page 8 of that document, also made reference to generating power. I want to refresh the memory of honourable members about this program. It is in the area of power generation that some of the biggest cost savings can be achieved for Australian industry. In this country we have the capacity to produce cheap energy, yet the Government has seen fit to divert funds from the south-eastern Australian grid into other programs. The Government has turned from the long term job creation schemes and long term benefits for industry and commerce to short term fixes in an effort to go to the election with a diminished number of people on the unemployment list. . The Government made a promise in One Nation of offering $100m to upgrade the transmission link between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. That has diminished by more than $25m. Of course, that program, will now be put on hold and industry and commerce thfoughout Australia will not reap the benefits of lower power costs. In fact, power costs will increase as a result of the Government's decision not to proceed with that program. The Government also mentioned in One Nation that it was going to provide the opportunity for the private provision of public infrastructure. We have had 12 months dQI'ing which that opportunity could have been taken up and absolutely nothing has happened. The Government does not want anything to do with the private sector in this nation providing the infrastructure. There are very good firms and industries who are interested in providing that infrastructure; and they would provide it at a very economic cost. But the One Nation document spells out that they were going to do it. Twelve months have elapsed and absolutely nothing has happened. On page 11 of the document the Government directed its attention to exporting. It said that it would help build a productive base for Australian exports and that the potential increase in our exports by 1994 is $20 billion. It would have to revise that target now because nothing has happened in its program. It says that, of this, the potential to increase trade to Asia is $13 billion. Those things have not happened. It is important for industry and commerce to know that the Government is assisting them in meeting export demand. We have a huge reservoir of markets just to our north-east, right into China, and all the near South East Asian countries. We have India not that far away with massive markets for our industry and commerce to project their exports into those nations. The Government has achieved nothing in that area. At page 13 of that document the Government talks about textiles, clothing and footwear, which are important industries in Australia. This omnibus Bill allows us the opportunity to raise many of these concerns because the Government said it was going to help the textile, clothing and footwear industries to become more competitive. What it did was to provide $30m to allow the industries to adjust to the phase-out of reductions in tariff. That $30m might have sounded like quite a healthy amount of money, but under the Fightback package, if today we abolished wholesale sales tax, fuel excise and payroll tax alone, we could save $300m for those industries. Here is the Government talking about a tenth of that. Instead of removing all of those oncosts to those industries the Government gave them $3Om to help them adjust to any structural changes. It could have done something positive. It could have abolished payroll tax, the wholesale sales tax and the fuel excise tax and saved industry $300m. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who is at the table, should think of all the jobs that would mean. In its conclusion, the Government went on to say that, under its strategy, within four years the Federal Budget will return to surplus and it will have created another 800,000 jobs, clipping 3 percentage points off unemployment. The Minister at the table knows that One Nation has failed absolutely: it is dead in the water. The Government has done absolutely nothing in the last 12 months to help industry and commerce in this country. It has set out a strategy. the strategy has failed completely. and there is nothing for industry and commerce. They are not just my words. In today's Australian Financial Review there is an article by Michael Lynch entitled 'Industry reform hits snag', which states: seventy-eight per cent of senior executives· from large and small manufacturing companies believe that government policies act as an impediment to economic reform, while a similar proportion (76 per cent) agreed that engineering academics were generally out of touch with industry needs, according to a survey by the Institute of Engineers, Australia. . The study was off a small base-17 companiesbut it involved in-depth, hour-long questioning sessions with executives covering a range The questions were developed by the Institute of Engineers, with assistance from the Business Council of Australia andwait for itthe Federal Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. So they put the questions up; the questions were not engineered by the coalition. These were questions put to industry by the Government's own Department. That study, and the answers to those questions, said that most manufacturing companies in Australia believe that Government policies act as an impediment to economic reform. What a damning indictment on the Government and its policy. The article continued: The survey showed that while 92 per cent of executives recognised the importance of fostering innovation, only 57 per cent had put in place specific practices to encourage it. Three-quarters of the respondents identified concepts like benchmarking, standards of international best practice and total quality management. Just over half thought Australian industry good workplace culture, although most saw trends towards improvement. That article is a damning indictment of the Government's policy for economic reform, and most industry peOple recognise that fact. On the other hand, the Fightback package which has been prepared by the coalition parties has taken notice of what industry is saying. It has looked at the cost impact that various measures have on productivity and the things that are preventing industries from getting up to world best practice standards and total quality management. One of the biggest impediments in Australia is the wholesale sales tax on manufacturing industry and commercial activity. It gets into the field of retailing as well with some of our large retailers, but under the Fightback package we will be abolishing wholesale sales tax. That will save Australians $9.4 billion. Most people do not realise that they are paying wholesale sales tax on a whole range of issues. Right now they could be paying anything from 10 to 20 or 30 per cent on many of the goods they buy, and those taxes are hidden from them. That is one item that would help all manUfacturers, all industry, of issues. and all commerce in Australia. The second issue is that the petroleum tax, the fuel excise tax, will be abolished. Most business people will tell us that one of the major oncosts in industry and commerce is the cost of transport and what it represents to the cost of an item which they have to manufacture or sell. Under the Fightback package, petroleum taxes will be abolished, saving $6.6 billion. Petrol and diesel will be cheaper, and that will bring down the cost of transport of raw materials going to industry for tnanufacture and the delivery cost for the finished product. It will save around 19c also for private operators and owners of vehicles. The third issue that I want to address is payroll tax-a massive impost on business throughout Australia. Payroll tax work:? against the best interests of continued employment growth. The larger a firm grows, the more efficient and productive it becomes and the more staff it puts on, the more it pays in payroll tax. The coalition in its Fightback had a package has said it will abolish payroll tax. This will flow on to every industry and commercial activity in Australia. It will save Australian business close to $6 billion. This is the main hidden tax on job creation. Businesses can· go back into the business of creating more jobs as a result of the abolition of payroll tax. There are other things which apply to industry and commerce in this statement which we have given an undertaking to abolish. One of them is the training guarantee levy. We believe that should be abolished. At the moment there is a one per cent payroll levy on all employers,and we will remove that. This will mean more jobs because that tax is working against the interests of every industry, every manufacturer and every commercial activity in this nation. It impedes the progress of a manufacturing enterprise in developing its industry, particularly where an industry is hoping to get into export markets. Our competitors on world markets do not have this burden of payroll tax-a tax that is working against the growth of employment in this country. The thing that is really important to the Government appears to be to have a lot of short term measures, which it has spelt out in the One Nation package. As I have said, over the last 12 months since this package was introduced, the Government talked about it for about the first two months, maybe three months if we are really stretching the point But when have we heard anything about One Nation recently? We have not heard one word about One Nation, mainly because the Government's forecasts in One Nation have proven t9 be totally wrong and totally inadequate. The Government has not addressed the fundamental problems facing Australia. The answer to those problems is to remove the oncosts of industry and commercial activity in this nation so that industry and commerce can get up and run again, become efficient and productive and employ more Australians in their work force. I think this is probably the last time that we will hear about the One Nation package. It is strange that it has to come from somebody on the coalition side, but the Government is not prepared to talk about it at all. Mr Free-Does this mean that you are actually going to talk about the Bill?",70
329,Mr REID,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"This is to do with the Bill because what the Government is talking about in this omnibus Bill is providing opportunities for industry and commerce. But I notice that in the Bill the Government does not really address anything that would help manufacturing industry. It will not help people in the commercial world. All the Government is doing is putting more impediments in their road. That is spelt out in fact in the article in the Australian Financial Review from which I quoted. They are not my words; they are not the coalition's words. They are from people in industry, answering questions that were put to them by a department of this Government. It framed the questions. It put them to industry and industry answered. But the Government does not want to listen; it does not want to make things more productive for industry in Australia. What it wants to do is to put more and more impediments in the way of industry to manufacture successfully and compete in world markets. So, despite all the claims from those on the Government side that they are out listening to the people, and despite the claims of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), this Government is doing nothing to assist industry and commerce in Australia. (Time expired)",73
330,Mr MCGAURAN,COMMERCE LEGISLATION," Amongst other matters arready dealt with by my colleagues on this side of the House, the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill provides for various amendments to the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972. Effectively, the Bill alters substantially the effect of sections 9 and 10 of the Act which bear, respectively, on the functions and powers of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, or AIMS as it is commonly known. In doing so, the Bill represents an effort to align the existing or traditional mission statement of AIMS with contemporary policy directions. It is the case that increasingly over the past decade the Parliament has come to accept the importance of redirecting a deal of the public sector scientific research effort so that it captures direct economic benefits for the community. This policy direction has been most in evidence in the application of the requirement on research agencies, including ANSTO, CSIRO, and more recently AIMS, to obtain up to 30 per cent of all their expenditures from external or non-appropriation based sources. This instrument, however crude it may appear to some, has been important in altering the character of the public research sector. In essence, the external funding requirement, in hand with other factors such as the enlightened management of the agencies and the willingness of their staff to embrace change, has driven public research bodies into more commercial orientation with respect to their operation and management. Those who are not familiar with the public research sector will not appreciate the fundamental changes in attitude and culture which have swept the research community in the past few years. Some have adapted more quickly to change than have others. But, irrespective of the pace of change towards a more , commercial orientation across the sweep of their programs, the wider community can be assured that those who work under the aegis of the national public research sector have worked hard to meet the Parliament's changed policy perspective of their role. I remember well that in the late 1980s whenever I went to such bodies as CSIRO and so on there was great constematiQn about the difficulties wrought by changing policy. But this feeling has largely dissipated now and by and large there is a broad based acceptance of the legitimate requirements that this Parliament has enacted. . . The Bill gives formal legislative to the role of commercial programs within the charter of AIMS. There is nothing unusual in this regard. The Parliament. has only just amended the ANSTO Act in the same way so as to legitimise its commercial programs and to allow the organisation to achieve a much greater degree of interaction with private companies and industry groups. Specifically, a number of amendments have been made. The first amendment places in all relevant parts of the Act the phrase 'marine science and marine technology', where,in the past, 'marine science' was used. One can immediately see the change in emphasis with the introduction of the words 'marine technology'. The second amendment modifies section 10 of the Act in such a way as to allow AIMS to perform, to participate in the formation of companies and to maximise the financial return to AIMS from any of its intellectual property rights, inventions, designs, computer circuits and so on. It has been confirmed by AIMS, particularly after discussions with the Australian Government Solicitor in Townsville, that the amendments will maintain the original philosophy of the Act but allow for an extension of its interpretations to cover those issues relating to income earning and to bringing about the objectives of reaching the 30 per cent appropriation level for AIMS from non-appropriation based sources. On advice from the retiring Director of AIMS, Dr Joe Baker, I am led to believe that the commercial strategies of AIMS may be summarised as directly applying the results of its research and the expertise of its staff to the relevant industri-s, and separately to local, State and Federal Government agencies with respect to proposed commercial developments. The emphasis is on a number of commerciai areas. The first is the oil industry, specifically with reference to the operation site and to that location on the coast where the oil products are transferred; the studies relate to chronic and acute effects. The second area is the mining industry, specifically with respect to those industries that are operating in an area which will directly or indirectly affect the coastal zone and the marine environment in re;cognition general. The third area is the tourism industry which is based in, and/or dependent on, the marine environment. The fourth area is mariculture, with specific reference to prawns, but also with respect to understanding the differences of genetic stocks for other potential farm species-for example, giant clams and barramundi. The fifth area is fine chemicals and biologically active substances from the sea which may be a base for the establishment of an Australian pharmaceutical or fine chemical industry. Honourable members can see that AIMS has an extensive commercial program agenda and we certainly respect AIMS for the way that it has gone out and sought industry involvement. In drawing to a conclusion my remarks in regard to the AIMS amendment-if I can call it that I would like to pay tribute, particularly with the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) present, to the retiring Director of AIMS, Dr Joe Baker. As of two weeks ago, Dr Baker's seven-year term as Director of the Institute concluded and I am told he has assumed a senior research position in the Institute. Australian society has a great many heroes. I have heard members of this Parliament pay tribute in this House to sportsmen or sportswomen in their electorate or to those who have reached dizzy heights in the arts. But we do not recognise often enough researchers or scientists who contribute in so many different ways to the enrichment of Australian life and most importantly of all, I dare say, to economic progress. Dr Joe Bilker has overseen the establishment and early years of the Australian Institute of Marine Science and deserves the recognition of the House. On a personal level I have always found Dr Baker to be an extremely knowledgeable and fair man. He is one of those truly wise people and I have found him to be of tremendous assistance to me in any number of ways in better understanding specifically the Institute of Marine Science but also marine science more generally. I am sure that Dr Baker will not be lost to AIMS or the cause of marine science. This is in no way a valedictory; it is instead a tribute as he departs the formal position of Director of AIMS.",73
331,Mr FREE,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"in reply-I thank those honourable members who have taken part in this debate and I will respond to some of the points that have been made. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) devoted some of his time to a discussion of tariff policy and automotive industry policy. Like the Opposition's GST, its tariff policy and approach to the automotive industry is a dud. It is not a question of asking people the wrong questions and getting the wrong answers. The people know what the questions are. They are giving the Opposition the answers, and it does not like them. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) described the GST, the Opposition's tariff policy is also a dud. The study to which the honourable member for Barker referred, which shows the effects of coalition policy on the automotive industry, has been questioned by the industry and serious commentators. Its growth projections are unrealistic. For example, nobody believes that motor vehicle sales will top one million units by the year 2000. On the other hand, the Government's automotive industry policy has a proven track record. I point out to the House that exports tripled between 1984 and 1991. In 1991, $1.6 billion worth of automotive products were exported. All indications of the increasing international competitiveness of the Australian industry are that in 1992, despite the recession, our major market exports will at least equal the 1991 figure. If . current trends continue, we should export $1.17 billion worth of automotive products. On the other hand, the coalition's policies will put all of these achievements in jeopardy. Under this Government it is anticipated that the industry's investment between 1992 and 1995 will increase by 15 per cent in real terms over the previous four years. Moreover, the industry has made it quite clear that, should the coalition seek to impose its policy, much of that investment may not go ahead. In other words, that additional investment is in jeopardy should the coalition win office. I also point out that the role of unions during these trying times has been most constructive. Rather than calling strikes or making unreasonable demands, they have worked closely with employers to improve both productivity and quality. Over that time industrial disputes have declined. The honourable member for Barker stated that labour turnover in the industry was high. This is, in fact, not the case. In 1991 average labour turnover, excluding retrenchments, in the producer section of the passenger motor vehicle industry was 5.5 per cent. The honourable member for Barker raised six points when speaking about the amendments to the National Measurement Act. First, he stated that consultation with the industry was deficient. I understand that the Weighing Industry Association of Australia has formally supported the concept of pattern compliance on a number of occasions: at the Macquarie University trade measurement seminar in 1982, in the report of the working party on funding of trade measurement control in 1983, at the 1984 meeting of a delegation from the trade measurement industry consultative committee with the then Minister, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), and at the second industry liaison meeting in 1986. Given this level of support for pattern compliance by industry, given the fact that support has not until now been withdrawn, and given the fact that the industry has placed on record no objections to the investigative powers of the States and Territories, the Commission was of the view that industry had provided long standing support from 1982 to 1986 for the concept of pattern compliance. Once the concerns of the Weighing Industry Association became apparent, the Commission took every opportunity to assure the Asssociation that it had misunderstood the amendments and that its concerns were unfounded. I tum to the accusation that the National Standards Commission will expand its role. This is quite true. As It result of a program evaluation of the Commission undertaken by Dr Kevin Foley, additional resources have been provided to the Commission in areas other than trade measurement-resources that it has been crying out for for some time. The increased' resources relate to such areas as national measurement policy development, aspects of legal measurement, national time policy, skills enhancement and capital funding for the establishment of an electromagnetic susceptibility test facility to ensure that substandard trade measurement equipment is not dumped into this country. The point was made that the amendments take the Commission into the jurisdiction of the States trade measurement legislation. In response I say that, when the function of pattern approval was transferred from the States to the Commonwealth in 1965, the power to investigate offences was omitted. The National Measurement Act includes an offence if trade measuring instruments do not comply with their approved pattern, and there is a penalty associated with that offence. However, the penalty is currently unenforceable as there is no power to investigate offences. The amendments relating to pattern compliance are there to address this anomaly. The fourth point that was made relates to the costs accruing to industry....:...that they be about $1,500 for each load cell. The amendments do not include the power to levy charges for pattern compliance testing, and the Attorney-General's Department has advised that the Cominission will not be able to charge for such testing. I add that this advice has been communicated to ,the Weighing Industry Association of Australia on several occasions. The fifth point raised was that the amendment will cause additional delay in pattern approval. It is not intended that a significant amount of compliance testing will be carried out, as the Commission does not have the resources to fund it and such testing is regarded as a last resort. Therefore, the amendment will have no significant effect on pattern approval delays. Finally, it was claimed that the amendments will have no financial impact, whereas the Commission's appropriation has increased from $1.45m to $2.17m. As I think will be clear to honourable members from my previous comments, this increase provided in this Budget, an increase which has been sought by the Commission on a number of occasions, relates to program activities which are not ') related to these amendments. So I hope the honourable member for Barker is a little happier than when he spoke: I respond briefly to comments by the honourable member for Bendigo (Me Reid), particularly his charge that the Government has done nothing to assist Australian industry over the last 12 months or for a period before it as well. I do not know whether the honourable member for Bendigo took the opportunity to read an excellent article in the Weekend Australian of last Saturday week entitled 'Clever by design'. It is a very worthwhile summary of recent developments in Australian industry, particularly the role that government programs have played in assisting it. ' The honourable member for Bendigo also may not have· taken the opportunity to read the science and technology policy of the incoming Clinton-Gore Administration in America. He will find some surprising similarities between steps that the new administrawill tion intends to take to assist American industry and steps that are being taken here.. He may be interested to find, for example, that theClinton-Gore Administration intends to introduce an industry training program funded by a measure which is remarkably similar to the training guarantee levy in this country. Among other things, the article in the Weekend Australian refers to the far-sightedness of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), the man responsible for programs such as factor F for the pharmaceutical industry, the partnerships for development program for the information, technology and telecommunications industry and the export facilitation program in the car industry. I think that a reading of this article might assist to redress what is obviously a clear deficiency in the grasp that the honourable member for Bendigo has in this area. I thank my good frie-d the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) for his support of the AIMS amendments. As always in these matters he responds positively when the Government has a good measure, and I hope that I will be around for quite a while to offer him a good example which he may follow in the fullness of time. Certainly, I welcome the support of the Opposition for the AIMS amendments. They are important. As the honourable member for Gippsland pointed out, these amendments bring AIMS into line with other government research agencies in providing for them to undertake commeroial activities which spin off from the cote research activities. With the Australian Institute of Marine Science at Townsville soon to be establishing a branch operation in the north-west of the country with an Indian Ocean focus as well, I think it is particularly important that these amendments receive swift passage. I echo the honourable member's warm words of commendatjon, congratulations and good wishes to the retiring Director of AIMS, Joe Baker. I was pleased that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) also mentioned Dr Baker in his contribution. While all this goodwill is flowing .around the place about AIMS, I wonder whether the honourable member for Gippsland is in a position to tell us whether he still has in his Party's draft policy a proposal to abolish AIMS. Perhaps the Christmas spirit might move the honourable member to recant on yet another nasty feature of Opposition policy. In the spirit of goodwill, I thank those who have made a contribution.

332,Mr MCLACHLAN,THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE,"I oppose part 2, comprising clauses 3 and 4. This amendment concerns the Automotive Industry Authority and the proposal of the Government to continue that authority to the year 2000. In the other place, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) was asked, in effect, why the authority should continue. As far as I can see, he referred to it on two occasions. On the first occasion, he said: It has compiled a very useful set of measures for assessing quality in automotive manufacture. With changes in productivity improvements in design and so on, these are all crucial issues for an industry this kind. It is very important to have objective measures of what. has been happening. For that purpose, the life of the Automotive Industry Authority, in the view of the Government, should be extended. On the second occasion, he said: The Automotive Industry Authority has been a source of objective information about a whole range of issues, and it has been partly its guidance that has brought the automotive industry in this country into very much better integration in the world automotive industry. That is something for which the Authority is to be very much congratulated. It performs a very useful function. 'Bravo', I say. That is fine, but it costs $lm a year to provide that information; to provide, as the Minister says, a series of measurement arrangements ,by. which the industry measures for assessing quality in the automotive industry. I think that is perfectly okay. But why do we spend all that money when these industries are now mature industries? These businesses are mature businesses. Their parent-and each one has a parent in another part of the world - is a mature parent. They have access to the Massachusetts Institute and everybody else, and they can make those judgments like anybody else. I think it is very important in this debate to answer this fundamental question: why do we need these separate authorities which are set up to evaluate the performance of very senior world players in their own right in their own industry, some of which have been going since the inception of those industries? The American firms concerned have been going since the inception of the automotive industry, one of which, General Motors, prior to the war was in the business of buying a whole range of automotive manufacturers. It obviouslyhad an enormous rang- of expertise from those areas. The other, Ford, is a household name throughout .the world. I have no idea how the Automotive Industry Authority can add to their knowledge and their ability to make measurements in regard to quality and such like. ' . The Minister for Science and, Technology (Mr Free) raised a couple of subjects which I think I ought to mention. He raised the subjeCt of facilitation schemes and how well of they have done. It is worth pointing out at this point that a facilitation scheme, which is a scheme whereby an import credit-that is, the ability to import som-thing duty free-is raised by adding value in Australia and received by exporting that added value in the form of a motor car, or as a part from a motor car in this case, is paid for by the Australian taxpayer. So we can actually go around and be very pleased with ourselves for exporting a whole lot of product in this industry. I think that is very commendable. But we have to understand who has encouraged those exports, and we have to understand that when those imports come into offset those exports by the build-up of an import credit, that money is made up for that deficiency and the duty paid is made up by the Australian taxpayer. When the Government says that it is very pleased with the results of its facilitation schemes, whether in this industry or in the textile industry, it ought to say-which it never does-that offsetting that is a whole lot of extra imports that come into this country, albeit imports that come in duty free, when import duty has to be paid on other imports of like type. It is a very important matter to understand. The Minister said that there was throughput in the industry of 5112 per cent in the workplace in 1991. That is incredibly high. Here we are in the middle of this Government's recession, its own self-started recession,before that of anybody else in the world, designed by the man who for most of Question Time sits right where the Minister is sitting, and suddenly, in the middle of that recession, we have an employment throughput of 5112 per cent. I bet not many industries in this country would care to boast of an employment throughput of 5 1/2 per cent. Yet the Minister stood here a moment ago and said that he thought it was a good result. I think it is a pathetic result. In fact, it higher result in turnover than we would see in Japanese industry in· a non-recessionary time. If the Minister looks up the figures, he will firtd that to be the case. This shows that those opposite have no idea of how to run business. As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said in the MPI today, those opposite really do not understand money. All they understand is policy which is designed to appease some people. They have failed in a Federal sense, they have failed in a State sense, they have failed all over this country, and it is time they realised it. The statement about a turnover of 51f2 per cent in 1991 was an incredible one. It is very revealing. I would like to comment on one other thing the Minister said. He said that under the coalition policy the car manufacturers have not committed themselves to reinvest. Let me get this absolutely clear. Toyota has said it will reinvest. General Motors has said it is continuing to reinvest, as it has said since 1986, and that came from the mouth of Bill Hamill at a public meeting in Adelaide not long ago. Ford has not said it will reinvest under the Government's policy-in fact, under either policy-and neither has Mitsubishi. Why is the Minister not accurate on this subject? Neither of those two companies has said it will reinvest under the Government's 15 per cent and no tax cuts. Let us make sure everybody is accurate on this subject. I return to my original point, which is the subject of this amendment, having been provoked into diverting slighUy-within, I am sure, the reasonable latitudes of this Parliament. The Opposition opposes the Bill in regard to part 2, clauses 3 and 4, because we do not think that such an authority is necessary.",79
333,Mr MCGAURAN,THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE," In order to decide whether or not to agree to an extension of the Automotive Industry Authority from 1992 to 2000, I have a very simple question to pose to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), the answer to which will help me enormously in reaching my decision. Who wants the authority's life extended? I would like to is a know. Let them come forth. Let the industries or the companies that are lobbying for the continuance of this quango for another eight years identify themselves, because my constituents would like to know just which of those big companies think that the taxpayer should needlessly fund a $lm authority. Government members love authorities. They love quangos; they love bureaucracy; they love establishing obstacles in the way of businesses-always funded by the taxpayers. I would like to know which of the car companies it is. Is it General Motors? Is it Ford? Is it Mitsubishi? Is it Toyota? My constituents in Gippsland would be very interested to know why $lm will be spent unnecessarily subsidising some of the Government's design-if the authority achieves that objective. I do not for the life of me see how billion dollar businesses in Australia such as the car companies could expect the authority to continue at taxpayers' cost, particularly when we know that the design of supposed successors of that authority can so easily be done and are being done in different ways by the car companies themselves. Let us tell the impoverished people of Australia, and Gippsland specifically, which of those companies are calling for the Automotive Industry Authority to continue in its present form. I have another question to pose to the Minister before I finally reach a conclusion on this matter. How can he have boasted only a few moments ago and at the same time chided the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) for not recognising the tremendous advances in design engineering in Australia? He even quoted a newspaper story on the design engineering successes. I am sure that is very true and it is something we ought to be very proud of. But he cannot tell me there is some special skill attached to the Automotive Industry Authority; It is not the reservoir of a body of knowledge not available anywhere else. If the design engineering in Australia is so magnificent, as he would have us believe, as a result of government policywhich I find slightly hard, if not impossible, to accept-the big car companies, with all their billions· of dollars of turnover, can certainly employ those skills. On practical grounds, the car companies and manufacturers have easy access to the supposed skills the authority provides. On social and even moral.grounds, I do not believe the taxpayer should be funqing an authority which is really a cash transfer to the big car companies. In the absence-expected, I.sadly have to concede.:.. - of the Minister answering my two questions satisfactorily, I am forced to support the amendments of my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and reject the Government's attempt to extend the life of the Automotive Industry Authority. Until recently··we have not had a very sensible debate in this country on any logical grounds in regard to the car manufacturing industry. Fortunately, due to people such as the honourable member for Barker and a number of my other colleagues, we have finally raised the understanding of the Australian electorate, firstly, as to the cost the tariff policy of the Goveminent and, secondly, as to the cost to the car manufacturers themselves· of an array of Government taxes. As that survey which was released in the last couple of days shows, there is .a very wide understanding by the electorate at large that the tariff policy of the Government to impose a degree of protection on the car industry cannot continue unchecked. It will not under the Government. People so often fail to appreciate that the Government will bring down the car tariff to 15 per cent by-the year 2000 with no offsetting benefits to the car industry by way of reduced taxation, whereas that is exactly the policy and approach of the coalition. Out abolition, without qualification, of wholesale sales tax,fuel excise and payroll tax, the training guarantee levy and the freezing of the superannuation payments by employers will all result in tangible benefits to the car manufacturing industry. Most importantly, they will lead to lower prices for. consumers and, therefore, stimulation of the car market. All the Government can do is try to buy a few friends and wield a bit of influence using taxpayers' scarce funds by propping up unrtecessarily ap Automotive Industry Authority which has long outlived any usefulness it could creditably have claimed. The Opposition opposes the Government's moves to extend the life of the authority to the year 2000. I wholeheartedly and unreservedly endorse the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker;",80
334,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE,"Mr Nehl)As a point of clarity, the honourable member for Barker has not moved an amendment. He is merely opposing the part. Strictly speaking, within the forms ·of the House, it is not an amendment. He is opposing part 2, comprising clauses 3 and 4. There has not been an amendment formally moved.",81
335,Mr FREE,THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE,"The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) correctly anticipated my reaction. I will try to stop being nice to.him because it only encourages him. The objections raised by the Oppoof sition during this debate centre on the continuation of the Automotive Industry Authority at a cost of $lm to the taxpayer. There was an extraneous matter raised by the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), to which I should reply, on the question of labour turnover in the industry. I am advised that in the 1980s the turnover in this industry was over 30 per cent. It is currently 5112 per cent. It has compared favourably over time and, I am advised, also with overseas experience. The functions of the Automotive Industry Authority include the encouragement of the industry to develop in a way consistent with the policy of the Gov-rnment; to ptomote change within the industry directed at improving efficiency; to monitor the performance and outlook for the industry; and to provide information and advice on the industry to the Government. The Government believes that these functions are important; the Opposition clearly does not. That is an important difference that ought to be spelt out, particularly in Victoria and South Australia. We ought to be clear about the size of the industry that we are discussing. Last year the automotive industry employed over 50,000 people in the production of cars and compoO(-nts, with. about 250,000 people employed in the retail, repair and service sectors. A total of 271,000 locally produced vehicles were sold, with an ex-factory value of $4.8 billion. When we talk aboutan industry of that scale, I think an investJllent of $lm in an authority charged with the responsibility of performing the functions I have outlined is certainly good value for money. The honourable. ,member for Barker has argued that the automotive industry isa mature industry which does not require this kind of assistance. It is simply a measure of the GovernmeIlt's commitment to the future of this industry that we believe that an authority performing these functions should continue. Clearly, the Opposition' does not. It is still struggling with the devastating front cover of the Bulletin of not so long ago which dealt with the motor vehicle industry, pointing out that this is the industry which the coalition wants to kill.

337,Mr RUDDOCK,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL," Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to speak on the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 1992 whiCh will amend the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982. This Bill will not be opposed by the Opposition; in fact, it is supported by the Opposition. My colleague Senator Hill said that the Opposition actually thinks that the centre has done. an 'excellent job to date'. The centre was established in 1982. In his second reading speech in the Senate, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Semitor Gareth Evans) said that the centre is: ... a small statutory authority which promotes and assists collaborative research between Australian and developing country institutions on problems of mutual concern. He then eulogises the organisation, tells us that it was established 10 years ago, and deals with the review of it by the Joint COll1mittee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Quite frankly, I thought it was remarkable that a Minister could make a speech about an organisation which is universally believed to have done a good job without giving credit where credit is due. It disappoints me, in the spirit of bipartisanship that is often invoked in this House, that it was not recognised very properly as an initiative of the former Fraser Government. Mr Fitzgibbon-Ha, hal",83
338,Mr RUDDOCK,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,I notice that the honourable member for Hunter sees some amusement in that. Does he not· think this is a worthy organisation? ' Mr Fitzgibbon-Very worthy; established by you and enriChed by us.,83
339,Mr RUDDOCK,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"One wonders why one hears such spirited laughter at this initiative which has been so widely eulogised. Yet there is no recognition that this was an outstanding initiative of the Fraser Government. In examining this legislation, I thought it might be worthwhile to look back at what my colleagues said at that time. I looked at some of the comments of Mr Tony Street, then the honourable member for Corangamite and Minister for Foreign Affairs; and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who was the Minister for Finance and who spoke about this matter in the Senate. It was noted then that one of the major tragedies of our tiffie was that millions still died simply because they did not have enough to eat. As Prime Minister Fraser had mentioned at CHOGM, the lack of adequate food probably affected 250 million people in the Commonwealth and maybe 500 .million people worldwide. Senator Guilfoyle noted that Australia was uniquely placed to assist developing countries in the area of agriculture. She said that we were recognised as having particular expertise and experience in agricultural research and development over a wide range of climatic and environmental conditions, from dry land farming to tropical livestock and agricultural production. She went on to say that in 198081 our spending under· the aid program on agricultural research and related activities estimated to have been about $12m. That is quite a significant amount. It was, however, based to a considerable extent upon ad. hoc requeSts for assistance from aid recipient governments. In addressing that problem as well as others, she said that there had been 'a lack of an effective mechanism to identify agricultural problems in developing countries'. She commented on the lack of a satisfactory mechanism for marshalling the collective expertise of bodies such as universities, State departments of agriculture, the csmo and suitably competent private individuals and also the failure of Australian laboratories to provide support for scientists engaged in agricultural research in developing countries. She said that, in order to overcome these difficulties, the Government had considered how to develop an expanded, better coordinated and more identifiable Australian effort aimed at achieving nutritional self-sufficiency in developing countries. After very widespread consultation within the Australian scientific community and with other interested parties the then Government decided to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. That body was set up with a sunset clause which was in vogue at the time. The Government sought a review from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which in its' report overwhelmingly endorsed. the continuation and expansion of ACIAR for its remarkable achievements on a cost-effective basis. This Bill before us is a result of. that report. The purpose of the Bill is primarily to extend the life of this organisation beyond its current limited life as specified in its Act. In addition, the Bill provides for three new functions for the centre, changes the size and constitution of the centre's board of management and the, Policy Advisory Council and addresses four administrative issues aimed at improving the centre's efficiency. The Act contains, as I mentioned, a sunset provision which limits the life of the centre to 12 years and provides for a review to examine was whether, the centre should continue. Flowing from this review, the Bill repeals the sunset sections of the Act, thus providing for a further life for this centre. Consideration of the future of the centre drew attention to the desirability of giving the centre additional functions. The Bill provides for the centre, in the context of its research programs, to establish and fund training schemes and conduct and fund development activities. The Bill also confers responsibility on the centre for providing support to international agricultural research centres, thus moving the centre beyond its normal bilateral mode of operation. We are assured that the changes to the size and constitution of the board of management and Policy Advisory Council will improve administrative efficiency. The other amf(ndments are of a technical nature. These recommendations to amend the Act have come about, as I have said, as a result of a quite comprehensive parliamentary review by the Joint Standing Committee. The Government has adopted all of the Committee's main recommendations and this Bill gives effect to them. Of primary importance is the amendment to repeal the sunset provisions; This clause was built into the legislation at the time of its enhancement to ensure that it could be disbanded if its charter was not fulfilled. Other amendments provide for the expansion of the charter to allow the centre to operate its own training programs, currently being run by AIDAB, and to implement projects which apply the results of research initiated by collaborative programs. The present charter does not permit this and AIDAB has· declined to implement some proposals regarded by ACIAR as important. The coalition supports the Bill and· endorses the moves to expand the centre's field of operation. This Bill is proposed in the context of the centre's 1982 mandate and it is against a background of mounting crises in world food security that we believe this organisation still has a very important role to play. The immediate concern of providing direct food aid to assist in famine stricken parts of the world has given way to the need to find durable solutions to the problems of food production and to eliminate persistent food shortages. ,The establishment of ACIAR was a part of Australia's contribution to the global effort to encourage developing countries to implement effective food strategies by strengthening agricultural research, technology and training facilities. Australia has had expertise - nd experience in agricultural research and development over a wide range of climatic and environmental conditions. We have already at this stage been supporting such research, - oth bilaterally and internationally, through our contributions to the consultative group on international rice research and· for bodies such as the International Agricultural Research Institute in the Philippines as well as resources within Australia-in CSIRO, the universities and other State bodies,as Senator Guilfoyle mentioned in her address that I quoted from earlier. However, the lack of an effective mechacentre nism within Australia for' systematically to Australia. identifying agricultural problems in developing countries as well as effectively utilising our own resources was hampering any real progress Australia could make. in this area. ACIAR was established to ensure that there was better coordination. The Bill occasioned substantial debate when it was introdudxl in 1982. That debate reflected a happy coincithe dence of views about the role that such centre could playas Australia's contribution to the alleviation of world hunger. I think spirit of cooperation is still apparent in debate to expand and continue the mandate of ACIAR. As I said, ACIAR is a small body responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Its functions as set out in section 5(1) of its Act are: (1)(a) to fonnulate programs and policies with respect to agricultural research either or both of the following poses: (i) identifying agricultural problenis of oping countries; (ii) finding solutions to agricultural problems of developing countries; (b) to commission agricultural research by persons or institutions in Australia (whether the research is to be conducted in Australia or overseas) in accordance with such programs and policies; and· (c) to communicate to persons and institutions the results of such agricultural research. (2) In perfonning its functions with respect to agricultural research, the Centre shall have regard to the need for persons or institutions in developing countries to share in that research. (3) Nothing in this section authorizes, or pennits, the Centre to carry out research on its own behalf. Australia would also benefit from the activities of ACIAR through enhanced contact between our agricultural scientists and their overseas colleagues; through the increased information that Australia has at its disposal on agricultural problems of developing countries; by strengthening the links between Australia and overseas scientists and institutions; and, finally, some of the solutions produced in the research sponsored by the would be of direct and practical benefit The Joint Committee review 10 years later has confirmed that ACIAR has fulfilled its functions. The report commented on its excellent record of meeting its mandate and focusing its energies on areas of high priority and concern to partner countries, with a high degree of success. Some of the conclusions of Committee included: first, in accordance a with ACIAR's mandate, its projects address high priority problems in agriculture for both that Australia and the 'partner country. The prothis jects are collaborative in nature and the results of the projects are published widely. Second, ACIAR projects are a most effective form of official development assistance, focusing on areas of high priority for the partner countries with great success. The Committee acknowledges that, even with a for sizeable error factor built in, the outcome of purACIAR's research to date has proved most efficient, unlike a number of projects underdevel- taken under the general aid program. Third, the Committee was satisfied that the financial operations and measures to ensure accountability were sufficiently rigorous to ensure the disposal of its funds were in keeping with the objectives for which they were appropriated. Fourth, given the success of ACIAR's work, the Committee believes there is room for a significant increase in the Budget allocation for the organisation. . It is indeed encouraging to see that at least one area of Australia's foreign aid effort is operating to the mutual benefit of the countries concerned. Some selected ACIAR projects were appended in the Committee's report and it would be instructive to speak of some of them in this address tonight. First, a three year project involving Australia and Malaysia to study economically important fruit-flies and develop control methods revealed that only six of the plethora of fruit-fly species occurring in Malaysia were of economic importance. The collaborators very. successfully developed the idea, already under investigation in Queensland, of using a bait spray. to control them. A bait spray has been developed and marketed. We are told that it is safe, economical and very effective. As a result of this project, superio['fruit-fly control methods for Malaysian fruit and vegetable industries are now available. Independent assessment indicated an.economic benefit to Malaysia of $176.3m over 20 years. The concept is now being developed for other countries in South East Asia and the Pacific. Second, another project involving Australia and Thailand led to the development of tests that can rapidly diagnose the presence of foot and mouth disease and also the strain of virus causing an outbreak. Having the test available will allow Thai veterinarians to quicldy diagnose foot and mouth disease outbreaks and correctly identify the virus strain causing them. Cattle and buffalo can theq be vaccinated with the correct vaccine for the specific virus type. The benefits to Australia are also substantial. Some 15 per cent of Australia's rural exports could be shut out of traditional markets in the first year after an outbreak has been confirnled, if it is not quickly controlled. That would involve an estimated loss of more than $5 billion. Having the test available has already saved Australia's livestock industries countless dollars in lost exports. Third, a project between China and Australia has led to the use of biotechnology to provide resistance in wheat to barley yellow dwarf virus. Barley yellow dwarf virus is the world's most serious viral disease to cereals. It causes major losses in high rainfall wheat growing areas in Australia and prevents China from achieving self-sufficiency in wheat production. No variety of wheat is resistant to the disease. During the two three-year projects, Australian and Chinese scientists collaborated to identify genes in wild grasses giving resistance to the virus and to transfer these into the wheat using a novel biotechnological approach. For the first time they have produced wheat plants that are resistant to the virus. All wheat growing countries stand to gain from this unique research that. will for the first time permit control of this universally serious virus. It is too soon for an independent economic assessment, we are told, to have been carried out in relation to that research, but obviously it would be significant. These projects undoubtedly benefit not only the parties involved, but other countries as well. Australia's efforts in working cooperatively with developing countries to meet their own food requirements is now more vital than ever. A successful policy to achieve that aim must operate within the overall aid program which is based on sound principles and achievable aims. The coalition has developed a blueprint for an improved foreign aid program which it believes will deliver aid where it is most needed in the most cost-effective way. The objectives of the aid program are spelt out very clearly. The coalition's aid policy is based on the principle that the overriding purpose of the aid program must be a reduction of poverty. Although aid may serve other economic and political ends, the effectiveness of aid should be judged primarily in terms of the contribution it makes to reducing poverty. Poverty in the developing world, unlike in developed countries, is not an issue of inequality and relative deprivation. It is a question of absolute deprivation measured by very basic indicators, such as nutrition, life expectancy, under 5-years mortality and school enrolment factors, rather than by income. People living below the global poverty line have a very tenuous grip on life. They are vulnerable to natural diseases and the influence of global economic forces. The poorest of the poor, perhaps 18 per cent of the population of the developing world, are estimated to have annu-l per capita consumption valued at less than $US275; It is to the alleviation of this poverty that Australia's aid programs, in the Opposition's view, must be directed. Aid programs conceivedprimarily to meet political or commercial ends, while also allegedly contributing to humanitarian goals, frequently seem to go wrong and miss all three goals. I recently had the opportunity to speak to the third annual report on Australia's overseas development cooperation program. In my comments I noted that Australia's overseas aid program continued to lack direct and real commitment to direct aid and resources to areas which have been neglected over time and which have emerged as areas of great concern. Clearly, the Government needs to focus more attention on ways to achieve a better outcome in our aid program. The success of ACIAR is encouraging and the coalition would accept the recommendation of the Joint Committee on' Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to increase ACIAR's share of the global aid budget from a level of about 1.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent by 1997. In the recommended expansion of ACIAR's mandate, the coalition is concerned that it does not become mired in bureaucracy in the same way as other agencies have become, but continues to operate its charter in the exemplary way in which it has done to date. I simply note in relation to that that the restructuring of the organisation gives it a new role in training. That was a matter that was picked up by the parliamentary Committee in its report. I noticed that on page 48 of the Committee's report, .there was discussion about training programs. The Committee noted particularly the activities of the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research. The Crawford Fund is a nongovernment organisation which was established in 1989 for funding training schemes for students from developing countries. The Australian Government, of course, had undertaken to contribute $500,000 over five years, commencing in 1989, towards the fund. The contribution was linked to training awards associated with ACIAR projects. The Committee in its report noted that some 150 awardees had undertaken training in agricultural development and research projects and that most of this training was for short periods of hands-on practical training. Of course, it was in this context that the Committee, noting the important work that had been undertaken in that. area, went on to make certain recommendations. It recommended that the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982 be revised to allow ACIAR to conduct project related training, both informal and postgraduate, and that responsibility for the administration of ACIAR's training scheme, together with concomitant resources, should be transferred from AIDAB to ACIAR. It is in this context that I would note some of the activities of the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research. It is a fund which was an initiative of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. It has been widely supported. It has received the funding to which I have referred. A number of very distinguished Australians are involved in the activities of the organisation. I am particularly pleased to note the involvement of a former member of this House, the Rt Hon. J.D. Anthony, as chairman of the board. A number of other very distinguished Australians- Mr Bridgland, Sir Neil Currie, Mr Frearson, Sir Brian Inglis, Mr Leslie, Sir Rupert Myers, Professor Tribe and Mr Vaughan-are members of the board. It has been able to raise funds. It has played a very significant role in bringing these training opportunities in Australia to so many people from abroad. This has involved many of the collaborative organisations th-t I have mentioned here in Australia, as well as those overseas. Obviously, the support of the activities of the Crawford Fund by such a variety of public and private sources is something that is very worthwhile. I know that honourable members, particularly from this side of the chamber, recognise the very worthwhile activities in which the Crawford Fund has been involved. It is a fund which, by its name, recognises the role of a very distinguished Australian in these areas, one with whom I have had associations and one with whom, over a long period of time, my family has also had long standing associations. I think it is very worthwhile to have the activities an individual remembered in a fund of such outstanding importance as a living memorial to a person who has contributed so much to Australia and the. wider areas of aid and agriculture. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I support this Bill on behalf of the Opposition. Perhaps in conclusion, I should note your involvement, too, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member of the Joint Committee that reviewed ACIAR and brought it to the point where we are now able to confirm its continuing role and to ensure that its very valuable research is continued and well supported.",83
340,Mr FITZGIBBON,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"Hunter) (9.39 p.m.)As the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has informed the House, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, since it was established as a statutory authority in 1982, has operated under a sunset clause of 12 years .. However, after the recent review of ACIAR's operation, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade unanimously recommended that ACIAR be allowed to continue its wonderful work without the impediment of a sunset clause. I was pleased to be a member of the Committee which appraised ACIAR's operation. I am delighted that the Government has accepted our recommendations on thai body. In speaking to this Bill, which gives the green light for ACIAR's continuation, I praise ACIAR for its valuable work which brings enormous benefit to Australia and to developing nations, mainly in the Asian and Pacific areas. To those who argue that charity begins at home, I stress that money expended by ACIAR in commissioning research is of crucial benefit to Australians. I chuckled slightly when the honourable member for Dundas tried to claim credit for the Liberal Party following the success of ACIAR. It is true that ACIAR had its gestation as a result of a decision by the Fraser Government, but ACIAR's flowering has occurred as a result of the assistance, understanding and encouragement provided by this Government. This is a bipartisan debate and the people involved in the ACIAR success story would not want their fine achievements of sullied by party political jousting. However, it is a pity that the honourable member for Dundas had a few cheap shots at this Government's aid policy. He said that his Government's policy would spurn commercial ventures in order to focus on the immediate relief of poverty. It is unfortunate-and I do not have sufficient time to expand the argument-that the honourable member cannot grasp that the permanent relief of poverty needs commercial ventures of the type that increase a developing people's expertise in agricultural matters so as to enable them to ward off the onset of periodic bouts of bad weather, et cetera, which give rise to episodes of poverty. In this country we hear so often of the brain drain. We hear about our top scientists leaving Australia for overseas postings. I find it particularly pleasing, therefore, that our Australian universities, CSIRO and the State departments of agriculture throughout our nation have the opportunity to participate in such important research projects as are carried out by ACIAR. I repeat: the. benefits to both Australia and the developing countries in which ACIAR commissions projects are substantial. I am pleased that the Government, in its response to the Committee's report on the review of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, has agreed that there is ito reason why ACIAR should not foster collaborative projects in Africa, in the Middle East and in South America,subject to those projects being resource dependent. ACIAR's primary focus will continue to be South East Asia, but there is definitely merit in staged expansion. Under the chairmanship of Senator Chris Schacht, the Subcommittee called forsubmissions and held public hearings in Canberra, and hearings and inspections in Sydney and Brisbane. A total of 165 submissions were received and it is pleasing to note that more than half of this number were received from overseas. In its report, the Subcommittee stated that 'maximisation of food production is an essential element in ensuring strong economic growth'. While Australia has extensive expertise in agricultural research, it was not until the creation of ACIAR in 1982 that that expertise was effectively applied to developing countries' agricultural problems. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research has unquestionably carried out its role with not only efficiency and cost-effectiveness but also enormous success. It has been of tremendous benefit in solving problems which are also of benefit to Australia but, more importantly, have been of enormous benefit to our developing neighbours. In Sri Lanka, for instance, waterways and· reservoirs were choked with the worse possible water weed, salvinia. Again, I quote from the report: The three year project led by Dr Peter Room and Dr Wendy Forno of the CSIRO Division of Entomology was carried out in collaboration with the Sri Lankan National Resources, Energy and Science Authority, other government agencies and . . . It then refers to a local university. The project sought to repeat in Sri Lanka the spectacular results Dr Room's CSIRO team had already achieved in Australia and Papua New Guinea. It succeeded. In less than 12 months, a beetle destroyed dense mats of salvinia that were completely choking reservoirs. The benefits to rice farmers, fishermen and their families, hydro-electricity production and rural· people generally were enormous because of the reduced spread of disease by mosquitos. Independent assessment indicated unlikely economic benefit to Sri Lanka over 25 years of some $25m-a tremendous benefit to cost ratio. Now ACIAR is enabling the CSIRO t-am to release the beetle in Malaysia, the Philippines, Fiji, Kenya and Zambia. It is particularly pleasing that a biological solution has been discovered, rather than a chemical SJlutioo, which in meJf cwld caIre furtIu pOOlem;. There are so many other success stories. I have had delegations of poultry farmers in my electorate of Hunter come to visit me recently. My constituents are concerned that Australia may allow imports of chicken products from Thailand, Denmark, Canada and the USA. My farmers are extremely concerned about the threat of Newcastle disease, which is the No. 1 killer of chickens worldwide. The farmers' concerns were· partially justified-I say 'partially' because I have considerable faith in our Australian Quarantine Inspection Service-but as Australian poultry farmers they were concerned because Australia is one of the few countries that does not have Newcastle disease in its chicken flocks. But we cannot be too complacent, as outbreaks have occurred in the past and the disease is widespread in all our South East Asian neighbouring countries. While vaccines against the disease are commercially available, each bird must be caught and inoculated-a somewhat difficult thing to do in villages. Also, these vaccines must be kept under refrigeration, which again is difficult in places without electricity. ACIAR informed the Subcommittee that Australia has a benign strain of the virus which causes no disease symptoms. Research has shown that infection with this benign V4 virus gives chickens immunity to the virulent Newcastle disease virus strains. In 1983, ACIAR commissioned what turned out to be a very successful research collaboration between Professor Peter Spradbow and his research group at the University of Queensland and Malaysian scientists. They were able to dev,elop a new vaccine that can be kept without refrigeration in the hottest of tropical conditions and that can be fed to chickens coated on chicken feed. Currently, the vaccine is being used to control the disease in two States of Malaysia and is being assessed for its value in other Asian countries. The impact of the eradication of Newcastle disease will bring economic benefit to our Asian neighbours who rely on chickens as their major food source, but it will also benefit Australia. Control of Newcastle disease among our neighbours will reduce the risk of outbreaks, and stockpiles of the vaccine will provide a backup control method to the currently used mass slaughter if an outbreak should occur. The Australian vaccine industry is already exporting the new vaccine to affected countries. Quick diagnosis and prompt vaccination against foot and mouth disease is another success story developed by veterinarians from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and the Department of Livestock Development in Thailand. Not only is this research benefiting Thailand and other Asian countries but it may save the Australian livestock industry millions of dollars. One project of particular interest to me, having visited China in recent years, is the project to improve the Australian eucalyptus, acacia and casuarina tree species in southern China. Again, CSIRO has played a major role in the research, identifying many promising species and lines of eucalypts, wattles and casuarinas in Australia. China plants forests to satisfy its immense internal demand for fuel wood, poles and sawn timber, and it is government policy to increase the amount of wood used for paper pulp. The environment is important too, with. plantations being planted for environmental protection and the rehabilitation of degraded lands. Australia, being a major wheat growing country, has also benefited the barley yellow dwarf disease, using a novel biotechnology approach. The CSIRO Division of Plant Industry has collaborated with colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. China has been unable to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat growing production because of this barley yellow dwarf disease. All wheat growing countries stand to gain from this unique research, which will for the first time control this serious disease. Another success story involves the disappearing giant clams. Because of research carried out by Professor John Lucas and his team at the James Cook University in North Queensland, in collaboration with the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, many of our South Pacific neighbours are now harvesting the giant clam from hatcheries. These countries are now receiving income, and denuded reefs are being restocked. I have dwelt at some length on the s).lccess stories of ACIAR simply because there can be no doubt that the continuation of ACIAR is justified. The Government's agreement to the recommendations of the subcommittee is most gratifying, and the five-year review is acceptable to all parties. Other amendments regarding the membership of ACIAR and the removal of the restriction on the number of overseas members can only lead to a more streamlined, attuned and efficient organisation. The Subcommittee's recommendations on funding, including trust moneys, transfer of funds from AIDAR to ACIAR, and increased funding for ACIAR, have been accepted by the Government. Other. administrative changes will be of benefit to ACIAR, and there can be no doubt that the continuation of the statutory authority is well justified. If ACIAR can continue the marvellous research work that' brings benefit to our Australian agricultural industry and at the same time help our developing neighbours, I am sure there will be no opposition to the continuation of the organisation's vital role. I was proud to be a member of the review subcommittee into ACIAR, and I commend the Minister's concern for this legislation. I have great pleasure in· commending the Bill from research into to the House.",88
341,Mr MACKELLAR,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL," I join other contributors to this debate in welcoming the legislation which has. been brought before the House, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill. As the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) also mentioned, he and I were members of the Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which was entrusted with the task of' reviewing the performance of ACIAR and making recommendations to the Government. A lot of those recommendations having been picked up in this report. Whilst the honourable member for Hunter did not wish to make political capital out of the debate which, as he said, was a bipartisan one, one does have to respond at least marginally by saying that in fact ACIAR was set up by my colleague of the time, Mr Tony Street, who was then Foreign Minister. I was privileged to be part of the discussions leading up to the establishment of ACIAR. I think it is one of the enduring monuments of that period of government. That opinion· is backed up by the detailed investigation which has been initiated into its perfonnance and has resulted in these recommendations and this piece of legislation. One of the interesting things about it was that it was set up, as other speakers have mentioned, with a sunset clause. There was quite a lot of debate within the Joint Committee, analysing the perfonnance of ACIAR, as to the effect of the sunset clause. There was quite a degree of discussion as to whether the fact that there was a sunset clause in place did, in effect, cause it to be lean and efficient or whether it would have been lean and efficient without the sunset clause-whether it would have done as well if it had been 'set up without the prospect of being reviewed in the future and just continued, as a lot of other statutory authorities. have, without such. a sword of Damocles hanging over its head. Nobody can really answer that question, but one of the conclusions coming out of the examination is that an appropriate committee of the Parliament should examine very closely the positive benefits of sunset clauses on a whole lot of legislation setting up statqtory authorities where their perfonnance is less satisfactory and effective than in the case of this particular organisation. The importance of agricultural research is major, and I quote briefly from one of the submissions to the inquiry under the heading 'The importance of international agricultural research'. It states: Agriculture plays a vital part in the process of economic growth in less developed countries. The change from traditional peasant farming to more productive systems of commercial agriculture is vitally important because it results in more food, more jobs, rising incomes and standards of living (particularly for the rural poor), and expanding national wealth. In short, improved farming systems constitute the foundation on which, in most developing countrieS, .economic progress is built. That is a very succinct statement, in my view, of the benefits that come from effective agriculture in a developing nation. It is the very basis upon which ACIAR was initially established. This same submission to the Committee goes on to say at a later stage: A mass of evidence exists to show how international agricultural research successfully provides more food for the hungry, more jobs for the unemployed, more income for the poor more commodities for export, and more we-lth to - timulate national econo-ic investment and growth m less developed countneS. If all our aid projects could boast that sort of result, what a tremendous aid establishment we would have. I want to mention reasonably briefly an aspect of agricultural research which I believe is enonnously important. Not only does it do great good in the countries in which Australian scientists and their collaborators are working but a lot of people these days, particularly in these straitened economic times, use the argument that charity begins at home and ask why we are spending this money on projects when we. could use it more effectively at home to look after our own. I quote again from this submission, which deals with the benefits to Australia of ACIAR: The economic advantages that Australia derives from its involvement in international agricultural research are mainly of two types. First, there are the direct benefits that come to Australian farmers through their use of the results - f this. research. - any examples e?,""ist of the ways m which Austrahancrop and arumal production continues to benefit .from the results from the research centres sponsored by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ... ACIAR's work brings even greater advantages to Austr-lian - griculture because it sets out speci(ically to mvestlgate problems that are of importance to Australia as well as to its overseas partners. From . its outset ACIAR has wisely stressed the concepts of ""mutual benefit"" and ""international partnership"". The economic value to Australian farmers of the resultS that have come from international agricull?ral r-arch are literally incalcu,lable. The pubhshed eVIdence shows that the apphcation of results from both ACIAR and the CGIAR centres has brought enonnous benefits. Yet only a limited number of experimental programs has so far been subject to economic analysis. The returns from these studies shows that Australia's investment in international agricultural research has so far given much better value, in economic terms, than any other part of the overseas aid program. The second main benefit to Australia from the results of international agricultural research is less immediate but, in the medium to long tenn, least as important. The improved fanning technologies that research lead to higher productivity, greater employment in rural areas and higher personal incomes. Most of these increased incomes is then spent on food, so that the result of agricultural development is that, while the supply of expands, the demand for food expands even faster. The consequence of this is that more food be imported and the resultant growth of the world market for food benefits an exporting nation Australia. n is important to understand the mutual dedication often benefits that flow from an organisation such as ACIAR. The evide-ce which was brought out in the very detailed investigation carried out by the Joint Committee is encapSUlated by those two statements. A number of the individual benefits of the outstanding research efforts. in a number of areas have been mentioned both by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) in second reading speech and by various other contributors to the debate. There is no doubt at all that, when one comes into contact with the dedicated work that agricultural do around the place, one can only be impressed by the selflessness of so much of the effort that is undertaken. A number of the speakers in this debate have mentioned individual examples of outstanding research speech: results which have then gone on to be implemented in practice. As we know, the legislation is based on the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. This a very good example, and I guess it is some sense a precedent, of the work that joint committees of the Parliament can do in people examining in great detail some of the effects, in practice, of government legislation. I believe that, unfortunately, this chamber has broken down over successive governments in also said: terms of the contribution that individual members can make to second reading debates and other legislative processes. I diverge a moment to say that I think that Question Time has, unfortunately, become more of a farce than an exchange of information. I that a lot of debates in the chamber are now set pieces rather than an honest exchange of engage is at views between members holding differing opinions on what should or should not be result from brought into legislative effect. But the work of the joint committees of the Parliament does allow individual members of the Parliament, particuhlrly back bench memfood bers, to work together and investigate, in great detail, the effect of government legislahas to tion. This is a very good example of how like effectively that can be done when the task is approached-I believe this is much more than not the case-with honesty and by members of those committees. Whether this Joint Standing Committee is looking at this legislation, at Australia's relations with other countries or at the trade area, it does approach its tasks with a great deal of dedication. That involves all members from all parties within the Parliament. This is a very useful example of how governments can be appropriately advised by members of the the Parliament from both sides of the chamber, and from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, working together to investigate and report on the effects of scientists legislation. The Government, to its credit, has picked up the main recommendations of the report of the Joint Standing Committee. The Parliamentary Secretary said in his second reading There is no doubt that ACIAR has been outstandingly successful. It is lean, professional and efficient and has an excellent approach to its task. Having said that; I repeat that there was a is degree of discussion in the Committee as to in whether that was brought about by its own intrinsic merit and the capabilities of the concerned or whether the sunset clause hanging over the head of the organisation contributed in its way to the effectiveness of the organisation. The Parliamentary Secretary With the overwhelming evidence of the worth of ACIAR's activities drawn out from its review and for elsewhere, the Government has decided that ACIAR and its work should continue. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that think that should be the case. He also said: No provision exists at present for ACIAR to in training activities. Yet training is integral to .the research projects ACIAR commissions, not only to enable their successful COfl;duct but also. times there are excellent opportunities for broader capacity-building training. Up until now, this deficiency has been overcome by AIDAB reserving a small part of its training resource for ACIAR. In the future, ACIAR will be able to conduct its own project-related training. Later on he said: ... ACIAR's functions should allow ACIAR to fund development activities when necessary to try to ensure adoption of the results of the research it commissions. I agree with that; but that is an area that does need careful monitoring. Having been an extension officer within the agricultural area for a number of years before I came into this chamber, I do know of the difficulties associated with effective utilisation of research results. One will have to be very careful that the overlap between the essentially reseatch functions of ACIAR and the effort required to ensure the adoption of those successful research results does not get out of kilter. Having spoken to the members of ACIAR, I have no doubt that they are very aware of the potential dangers. But I draw attention to the fact that one can get into a bottomless pit if one c4ases too far the possible adoption of the research results amongst ,l!- community which, because of a number of factors, may not wish to embrace immediately the recommendations that come to it. It is no use doing the research, finding effective solutions and then not having that research implemented. It is an enormously important area to which special attention needs to be paid. But ACIAR needs to be careful that too much of its attention is not posited on the implementation of .the results with the effect that it loses sight of its main function which is to achieve the successful and practical research results. It is very good that ACIAR has developed close linkages with the centres overseas. The Parliamentary Secretary said: With ACIAR's future assured, the Government has decided that responsibility for this important part of the aid program should become one of ACIAR's functions. We totally agree with that. There is a reduction in the size of the Council in line with the Committee's recommendation. In effect, we at see this Bill coming forward very much as a result of what I regard as a responsible report from the Joint Committee. In my view that is to Ix; applauded. One of the things that is demonstrated is the benefit of properly analysed, properly prioritised, bilateral aid projects. That is not to say that Australia should not have some input into some multilateral aid projects, but something like this does provide a very worthwhile opportunity for Australian expertise to be centred upon those areas where we can more effectively ensure not only that the aid moneys and the aid effort are effectively utilised but also, as I have already outlined, that they bring more direct benefits both to the recipient countries and to Australia itself. In general, I think it is a very obvious example' of the real benefits of effectively analysed and controlled bilateral aid efforts. That is not to say that there will not be some mistakes and that there will not be some failures. With the multiplicity of projects that are taking place, we cannot expect all of them to b- equally successful. There will be some failures. What we have to do is analyse the totality of the, effort and make sure that the economic benefit is very clearly headed in the right direction. In my view, there is absolutely no doubt of that, in terms of ACIAR's role and perfolmance. I am very pleased that the Government has acted so quickly to pick up the main recommendations that were laid down by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, following its examination of ACIAR. To sum up, I believe that agricultural research is enormously important. We are all sickened and horrified when we see the stark photographs and movie coverage of hunger, deprivation, malnutrition and similar sorts of situations which are brought very clearly into our homes from time to time. We cannot do much better than to ensure that populations are effectively fed with sustainable agricultural production. ACIAR is dedicated to bringing about that overall situation. I think the reputation of the scientists and others involved in the programs is second to none. I think they are bringing very great credit to Australia and, incidentally, to themselves. We always have had a very high international reputation for the excellence of our agricultural research. If I sound a little biased, I am not a researcher; I was an extension officer. But the research effort was required first to make sure that the material and the matter that one was presenting to the recipients was effective and would result in real benefits. ACIAR has done that. It can feel proud of itself. I am delighted to support the legislation which the Government has brought forward.",90
342,Mr LANGMORE,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"It is a delight to be able to wholeheartedly support the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) in his very positive comments about this excellent Bill, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill. I agree with everything I heard him say. I did not hear the beginning of his speech, but certainly the latter two-thirds of it were exactly right. As far as I can recall, the Government has fully accepted the recommendations of the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on ACIAR, of which the honourable member for Warringah was Deputy Chairman and of which I also was a member. In so doing,. I think it has entirely. appropriately removed the sunset clause from the original Bill establishing the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and that ensures it a continuing life. Nothing could be more appropriate. In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) gave some excellent examples of the value' of the research done by the centre. The first example he gave related to the centre's success in the biological control of salvinia, the water weed in Sri Lanka, and the benefit of that also in Papua New Guinea and no doubt in other countries. The estimated benefit cost ratio of that project was 32 : 1. The estimated income generated by resolving that problem was 32 times higher than the cost of the research. When we were doing the inquiry, there were a number of examples of extJ;aordinarily effective research outcomes, such as Newcastle disease in chickens and a number of other examples that the Parliamentary Secretary included in his speech, all of which point to the great effectiveness of this centre. As he said in his speech, Australia is the only industrialised country with a high standard of living which is in the tropics. Therefore, it is particularly appropriate for Australia to be involved in agricultural research which is of direct benefit to the developing countries which are also in the tropics. The centre has a fine record of success. It deserves to be better funded, and the Government has decided to do that. I am delighted that .the Committee's recommendations have been so fully accepted by the Government and that it is now implementing them. I would like to briefly congratulate the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) for his paper entitled Changing aid for a changing world: key issues for Australia s aid program in the 1990s, which was tabled about 10 days ago. I know that the Minister put quite a lot of effort into this paper. It does describe effectively, lucidly and intelligently the value of Australian aid to the developing countries, the directions in which Australian aid is being used, the impact on particular countries such as Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific, Asia, Africa, and the ways in which our aid can be targeted so as to have maximum effect. I was delighted that, in the Budget, the Minister succeeded in increasing the attention to human development, family planning, population programs, health programs and education, as well as the types of policies that will contribute most directly to economic development through infrastructure, industry development and agricultural extension. I think the Minister is having a very significant impact· and he is making many changes which increase the effectiveness of Australian aid. The Minister was also successful in maintaining the level of Australian aid as a proportion of national income. At a time of very tight budgetary constraint, that was a major achievement. It means that Australian aid is again this year 0.36 per cent of GOP. That is less than one would like it to be, but it is more than it was several years ago. The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) should be congratulated for their success in arguing a difficult case in Cabinet. That stands in sharp contrast with the Opposition, which has announced that at a time of enormous need in developing countries-need that we can see, as the honourable member for Warringah said in his speech, on our television screens every night-it will cut $200m out of the aid program. That is just disgraceful at a time when there is desperate need for relief of poverty, easing of crises, well as the constructive development assistance for which the Australian aid program is noted. I am quite sure that in their heart of hearts many people in the Opposition greatly regret that policy. But it is something of which they should be ashamed because it involveS a rejection of the humanitarian concern that has characterised Australian aid. Anyone concerned about poverty overseas now really has no choice in this coming election. He or she has to vote Labor, because voting Labor guarantees that the aid program will be $200m higher than if the Opposition were elected. I regret to say that that characterises much of its domestic programs as well, but I will not deal with those tonight. In order to allow this debate to finish, I will cease talking. I reiterate my wholehearted and strong support for tWs Bill. It is excellent that. the Bill is receiving such strong bipartisan support.",94
343,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"I rise with great pleasure tonight to make my contribution to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure the continued operation of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The centre's continued operation is fundamental to the· improved agricultural, social and economic growth in developing countries. Such growth will ultimately serve Australia's interests through increased demand for agricultural and other products. Research fostered through the centre r(ipresents a hands-on approach to Australia's overseas aid program. Assistance offered through the program is of a long term nature, and often provides the best opportunity for sustained economic development. The provision of food aid is a short term solution and it is generally recognised that improving the production of food by the countries themselves offers the best hope for a long term improvement in living standards and economic growth. If we fail to look at these aid programs in the long term and assist these countries to produce their own food, inevitably they will always rely on another nation as for their food in the form of aid. ACIAR conducts research programs in nine areas: animal sciences, crop sciences, economics and farming systems, fisheries, forages, forests, plant nutrition, post-harvest technology, and soil and water management and use. The work to date conducted by the centre has been of outstanding value. For example, ACIAR has promoted research to develop and prove the effectiveness of tests that can rapidly diagnose the presence of foot and mouth disease and identify the particular strain of the virus causing the outbreak. I now refer to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin). It is of particular interest because it demonstrates the cooperative approach that we must take in this aid program. The research into foot and mouth disease involved teams of veterinarians from the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory and the Department of Livestock and Development in Thailand. Foot and mouth disease is endemic in northern Thailand, and studies with the live virus there made it possible to refine a test and to prove it in the field with actual outbreaks. Such tests enabled Australian scientists to diagnose a false alarm in Queensland in only 17 hours when a disease outbreak was suspected in 1988. In 1988 I was involved with the United Graziers Association of Queensland. In fact, we were meeting in Brisbane at the very time that announcement was made. There was a risk that other countries would not accept our beef, or any meat exports from this nation, until we had positively identified whether the disease was in fact foot and mouth. The ability to quickly identify that it was outbreak of foot and mouth disease, I believe, was fundamental in our being able to guarantee to other countries that we do not have and mouth dis'ease in Australia. Looking at the value of the beef industry Australia, the money that is spent on this project pales into insignificance. The value beef exports for 1992-93 is estimated to be in the vicinity of $3.2 billion. So the ability scientists to carry out this research where there is foot and mouth disease, which is endemic in Thailand, really demonstrates the mutual benefit to Thailand, in this case, and to Australia. Whilst ever there is foot and mouth disease in the world and whilst ever we have near neighbours where foot and mouth disease is present, the risk is always there that one day this disease will enter country through some source. So it is to our mutual benefit to ensure that these other countries are able to rid themselves of foot and mouth disease. One of the projects promoted by ACIAR is that very research. Having the tests available in developing countries enables veterinarians to quickly diagnose foot and mouth disease outbreaks and, importantly, to correctly identify the virus strain causing it. There are a number of virus strains, and the particular strain has be identified. Cattle and buffalo can then be vaccinated with the correct vaccine. Based on documentation relating to 12 research projects, ACIAR claims that, for a total research cost of $27.4m, the expected benefits over the next 15 to 20 years will be in the order of $816.7m. That is an enormous gain to these developing countries, and I believe it represents very good value for our dollars spent in this area of aid. Whilst there will always be a place for humanitarian aid for humanitarian purposes, the benefits of hands-on practical assistance as supplied by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research must be acknowledged. The original Act that provided for the establishment of the research centre contained a sunset clause disbanding the centre after 12 years operation unless, followis ing review, amending legislation wasintroduced. The Joint Committee on Foreign not an Affairs, Defence and Trade conducted a review and recommended, amongst other things, the centre's continued existence, and foot thus the debate here in the House tonight. I would like to expand on a number of to recommendations that the Committee raised in its report. These concern the nature of of assistance to developing countries and. the need to improve such assistance. The main of criticism attributed to overseas aid is that it provides a gift to foreigners when Australia has its own financilll problems. Critics would argue that foreign aid contributes to Australia's balance of payments deficit. On the other hand, there is a widespread belief that developed nations have a responsibility to overcome disparities in the wealth of nations. However, can foreign aid this be better targeted? We in Australia, being very small fry in the international scene in our contribution to world aid, at least have a responsibility to stay close to the aid we dispense. Relationships between Australia and the recipients of our aid should be fostered and developed. If close contact cannot be maintained, Australia takes the risk of merely throwing money at the problem, achieving very little, and in fact in some cases causing to irretrievable damage. I quote from an article published in the March edition of the Bulletin magazine which touches on the aid issue in South East Asia to illustrate this point: A young boy recently died of malnutrition and a neighbour is dying of some unidentified illness. Aid workers within' the village blame the access to serum hepatitis for this outbreak. There is a belief amongst the villagers that injected drugs are a miracle panacea. With most of the drug- deposited by foreign aid agencies there is a lack of adequate supervision over their use that creates doubt about the value and appropriateness of such support. This example illustrates the importance of targeting effective aid. The article goes on to suggest that the aid should be provided in a form that the villagers can control, such as funding for the construction of a kiln in order to build up a cash economy. The point to be considered in this example that, without Western expertise, Western medicine and technology will benefit Third World countries very little. This view was supported in evidence from Dr Blyth to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.· He said: I have questioned the Thai senior executives of the Department of Agriculture as to why they are interested in having us come with our piddling projects, when the European Community gives them very large amounts of money and carte blanche as to how to spend it. The answer is very simple . . . 'Dollars are cheap. Anyone can get dollars in development assistance from the Western world. What we cannot get is people who will come and work with us'. In contrast to the general Australian aid program, ACIAR does not meet the full cost of its projects. Partner countries are expected to make a financial contribution to the project, demonstrating the priority they attach to the research and emphasising the partnership nature of the work. Many submissions to - he ACIAR inquiry were critical of this fact, however it is pleasing to note that no recommendation was put by the Joint Committee to review current funding arrangements in this area. I believe the failure of many aid projects results from the fact that they are not lilldertaken as joint ventures. If a project fails, the recipient country has virtually nothing to lose. Take, for example, the establishment of a milk processing plant in a village in South East Asia. The project is undertaken on both humanitarian and economic grounds. Its establishment will encourage better nutritional standards for the villagers while also providing valuable employment opportunities. However, often the Western expertise leaves the country long before the technology and know how is adequately transferred to the local management. The project is then at risk of failure. Unfortunately, this is not' an uncommon 'scenario throughout parts of South East Asia. Many aid projects, whether funded by the Japanese, American or Australian governments, fail due to a lack of long term planning on behalf of both parties involved in the project. In order to address this alarming situation, recipient countries should be given more of a stake in foreign aid projects. Under such a proposal, recipient countries would have a vested interest in the success of the project. Given that the Chinese and Asian people's culture is typically face saving, the failure of joint venture projects would be much harder little to tolerate than the failure of foreign owned and controlled projects. The benefit of long term assistance provided to developing countries through bodies such as the Australian, Centre for International Agricultural Research must be given greater recognition. I believe such assistance holds the key to future aid funding. This brings me to recommendation No.9 of the Joint Committee, which states: The Committee recommends that ACIAR's priority within the aid budget be increased and that by 1997 approximately 3.5% of the aid budget should be allocated to ACIAR. Given the very real returns the centre is able to provide to developing nations and the Australian agricultural sector, raising the profile of the research centre should be a priority of the Government. There has been very little increase in the budget allocation to ACIAR for a number of years. In terms of percentage of total official development assistance, ,the allocation to ACIAR has remained in the range of 1.3 per cent to 1.4 per cent. Our commitment to foreign aid should be revised to more adequately acknowledge the benefits of sustained economic development and to consider the potential gains. to the Australian nation. To vary aid expenditure to recognise such factors is not an impossible feat, as pointed out by Professor Tribe, the Executive Director of the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Development, when he said: It is said that it is administratively too difficult to vary expenditures on other aid projects in order to increase ACIAR's funds. This argument is unacceptable because in recent years substantial changes have been made to other items in the aid budget and, despite the bureaucratic problems that may be involved, there are compelling reasons why ACIAR should now be accorded a higher priority. The real question is how much higher? The Government's response to recommendation No.9, to increase ACIAR's priority within the aid budget, was to suggest that ACIAR's priority in the aid program be reassessed with a view to ACIAR's share of the aid program increasing as budgetary circumstances allowed. That is playing it safe. It is real Sir Humphrey stuff. The final recommendation of the Committee worthy of further consideration and action states: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government examine the possibility of establishing an organisation along the same lines as ACIAR with the purpose of providing research and development assistance to regional, countries in manufachad turing systems, human resource development, etc. If such research is good enough for agriculture, it should be good enough for other areas of Australian expertise. The extension of this hands-on approach to mutually beneficial forms of aid,as I have said previously, should be the way of the future. It is vitally important that Australia remain close to the aid we dispense. Increased awareness can only result in more effective aid targeting. ' Australia is a technologically advanced nation with a great deal to offer our Asian neighbours on a cooperative basis. For example, Australia is world proficient in the export of technology associated with distance education and remote medical services. We do not come second to any natiqn in those two areas. Our close proximity to the Asian area provides us with a natural advantage in servicing trade and aid concerns. Australian aid haS the potential to promote Australian trade. We should never lose sight of that potential. This country must lead by example. Our example must be better than that of our competitors. We have the technology. We have the know how. We have our foot in the door. Let us press home the advantage and make Australian aid in the Asian region work for Australians.",95
344,Mr MARTIN,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade) (10.38 p.m.)-in reply-I thank all honourable members who have contributed .in this debate tonight on what is a particularly important issue, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill. Generally speaking, there was a sense of bipartisanship; it was all peace and love there for a while tonight. Both sides generally agreed that the Government's laudable aims in this legislation should continue and that at every stage they should be promoted. As is always the wont, one or two discordant notes were introduced-in a mild sense, in terms of presentation-in respect of some issues. I will quickly address some of those. There was some concern expressed by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) at the commencement of this debate as to who responsibility for the establishment of this program. I think it is fair to say, as was conceded by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), that the Fraser Government did initiate this program, but that there has been continuing support for it under successive Labor governments. That has included a budget increase for ACIAR and international agricultural research centres in the 1992-93 Budget, and an ongoing commitment to budget increases as the Budget circumstances allow. I do not think anybody can walk away from that last comment about Budget circumstances allowing, and that is a theme I would like to come back to in a moment. The Government has also recognised ACIAR's contribution to the aid program and has built on and expanded the centre's functions beyond those functions it was accorded in 1982. Again, it demonstrates clearly that it is the Labor Government which has built on what was perhaps an initiative announced by a former government and given it appropriate priorities. ACIAR projects address poverty alleviation through enhancing the rural base on which economic development is dependent in developing countries. Agriculture certainly is the chief economic activity, in many of those countries, and Australian expertise helps developing countries to improve their own agriculture, strengthen their economies and ensure that there will be enough food in the years to come. I think that was a theme that one or two other members addressed in their contributions this evening. I know the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in his contribution referred to the statement entitled Changing aid for a changing world: key issues for Australia said program in the 1990s, which was brought down by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) a few days ago. Whilst in that document it certainly is·indicated that the Government agrees that poverty alleviation is essential, it also points out that broad based economic growth is essential to generate the resources necessary for sustained development, and all parts of the Australian aid program contribute to economic growth in developing countries. I think that is an important point that perhaps some people did not pick up on in their contributions. It is clear that our government has the view that poverty alleviation is essential but that economic growth in developing countries goes hand in glove with it. Some comments were made about two or three other issues which I would like quickly to turn to. Training. programs under this legislation and in the ACIAR organisation will be focused on strengthening the capacity of research institutions in developing countdamaging ries to carry out or continue agricultural enter re-earch. Recipients of ACIAR fellowships wdl carry out research at both masters PhD levels, which is directly related to ACIAR projects. Of course, this will enable. them to return to their own countries to assist in further research or in instit-tionalising - esults of - urrent research. I thmk that was Issue. WhIch the honourable mem?er for Warrmgah (Mr MACKel1ar) was partIcularly concerned about. In respect of the general theme of developa ment, ACIAR development activities limited to small selected research related activities in instances where AIDAB is unable to take up development options soon enough or where it would be inappropriate for it to so. Therefore, the nexus between our aid agencies and development assistance and so on is clearly made. Development activities, will typically be, for example, in field trials, demonstration plots, et cetera, which will serve as the catalyst for the country's own extension services to take over. I think that an appropriate comment that needed to be made. The honourable member for Warringah also made mention of the fact that he saw a continuing role for committees of this Parliament to examine proposed government legislation in a bipartisan way and bring forward recommendations which hopefully the government of the day will act upon so that we see a better piece of legislation. I could not agree with him more. I think it is an appropriate role for parliamentary committees, whether they be joint committees or committees of this place, to embark upon. It has happened in the past and I am sure it will happen again in the future. His support for that particular view, I think, is extremely welcome. Comment was also made about the sunset clause concept. People will remember, I am sure, that this review process was undertaken largely because of a sunset clause being written into the legislation and that the inquiry was extended further at the behest of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). A sunset clause as is being considered in this legislation has very effects in terms of the inability to into contracts, insecurity, loss of productivity, et cetera. On equity grounds, the reimand position of a sunset clause on ACIAR was therefore not endorsed by the Government. The Government has however recommended 'that an appropriate c-mmittee'investigate the the matter of sunset clauses for statutory an authorities. Again, that was a point that the honourable member for Warringah made. He believed it was important that a committee of this Parliament investigate that as an issue in general sense, but I just make the point of will be its relevance to ACIAR. The honourable member for Maranoa (Me Bruce Scott) made some interesting observations in his contribution. In my view his do criticisms were of the general aid program and unfortunately displayed a basic ignorance of how Australia's bilateral aid program is designed, implemented and monitored. Quite frankly, I think he has endeavoured to pick up several generalised criticisms of Western aid programs and implied that Australia's prois gram suffers from the same malaise. I frankly do not think that that is the case. All of Australia's bilateral projects are agreed to jointly with the recipient government. In almost all cases there is a counterpart contribution by the recipient government. It has a stake in the project and therefore wants it succeed. I think the argument he was making that there was not enough consultation is somewhat wide of the mark. There is also an on this matter. ongoing framework of monitoring to finetune many of those projects as they evolve. The honourable member for Maranoa, interestingly-and this is becoming a frequent occurrence in a number of debates in this place where money is concerned and funding . forthwith. and budget priorities are up for consideration-made the comment, and indeed the time. plea, that more funding should be made available for projects under ACIAR's banner or in aid generally. It is interesting that that comment could be made and should be made by those opposite because, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Fraser in his contribution, in the Fightback document the Opposition proposed to cut its aid program, if elected to government, by $209m. I simply say to the honourable member for Maranoa that perhaps he ought to trot over to the Senate and have a chat with Senator Hill find out where those cuts in the aid program will be targeted. Will they be in agricultural research programs such as this legislation deals with? Does that mean that the concerns that he rightly raised about animal diseases and so on will be just shoved off to one side because they are not quite in the priority which Senator Hill might have them fit into? I think there is a need for clarification as I say, it is something which I think we this side of the House have become. used to. There are $10 billion worth of cuts being mised in a whole variety of Commonwealth Government programs under Fightback, yet honourable members opposite constantly come along here and argue that more money should be provided for various programs, whether they be road programs, aid programs or whatever they happen to be.",98
345,Mr FILING,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,-:It should be better targeted.,100
346,Mr MARTIN,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"My colleague on the other side has indicated that it should be better targeted. How those opposite can cut $10 billion and then say they can target those a little better I find a little difficult to stand. I conclude by simply saying that the legislation has been treated, as I said at to outset, in a reasonably bipartisan manner tonight. I thank all those who have contributed to the deliberations for their thoughts Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved Bill (on motion by Mr Martin) read a third NA Motion (by Mr Martin) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Remembrance Day 1992",100
347,Mr FORD,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I want to pay tribute to the men and women who have contributed to the defence of this country since 1914. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the role played by the to Australian War Memorial, not only in commemorating the sacrifices made by citizens of this country but also in ensuring that the nation's experience of war is not forgotten. When the War Memorial was opened by the great anti-conscriptionist of 1916 and 1917, area John Curtin, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour was less than a month away. To all intents and purposes, the war which had but, broken out in September 1939 was still a on European conflict. The attack on Australia in 1942 finally exposed the nation's vulnerability proto every citizen of the Commonwealth. During the decades following the Great War, successive governments had preferred to rely on the promise of imperial defence and the effectiveness of the naval base at Singapore rather than pw:sue policies which would assist the defence of Australia. However, given the mood and spirit of the times, the popularity of such ideas is not difficult to understand. The nation still mourned the loss of 60,000 of its male population and many believed that the Great War of 1914-18 had been the war cuts to end all wars. Despite continued warnings underabout potential enemies and misgivings about Australia's ability to defend itself, many the invested their trust in the new League of Nations believing that international disputes could be sorted out around a conference table. When, by the mid-1930s, it had become increasingly apparent that the ambitions of the dictators. could well result in another war, Lyons Government made a long overdue financial commitment to the defence and rearmament of Australia. Australia's struggle against invasion during the early 1940s has been well documented. Indeed, much of what it means to be an Australian is inextricably linked to the nation's collective experience of war. It is impossible to go anywhere in Australia and not encounter the ever present war memorial and its. tragic roll of honour. So powerful are the images of ANZAC and the digger tradition that on ANZAC Day 1990 several thousand Australiansincluding many in their twenties-made a special pilgrimage to Gallipoli; a· place so drenched with Australian blood that it surely deserves to be called a sacred site. It is in this context that the War Memorial has rightly become one of Australia's most important institutions. The preservation of priceless treasures is a fundamental responsiThe bility of this Parliament. Ind-, - proper· level of support for the Memonal IS surely something that extends well beyond the realm of mere party politics. While I believe much more limited role for government than has Qeen assumed in Australia-especially during the last 20 years-for national instituincreasing tions such as this it is government which must ensure their survival and continue to recogand nise their uniqueness. As increasing numbers of its visitors have no direct experience of war, the Memorial's mission becomes more vital and more waiting complex. Young Australians, in particular, entitled to know about their country's role twentieth century war. They are entitled to know that participation in war is a difficult matter, something that involves a whole range of emotions and responses. They are entitled to know that when a democratic society goes to war many of the rights and freedoms they take for granted are severely curtailed. They are entirled to know that while many have supported Australia's participation. in seven wars, others have raised their voices in ment opposition. In short, they are entitled to learn, to think and to make up their own minds. It is fitting that this Parliament-the instituthe tion responsible for sending the nation's citizens to war-has reinstituted the two minutes silence at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. I ask only that next year the traditional two minutes silence is. ended by the playing of the Last Post, and that the poppy-sellers are accorded the respect they deserve in this building. A significant number of former members, some current members and several Prime Ministers saw a.ctive service. I believe that their sacrifices and the sacrifices of many thousands of others are worthy of an appropriate tribute on Remembrance Day. Fairfield Bus-Rail Interchange",100
348,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"prospect) (10.55 p.m.)Some 18 months ago I had the pleasure of announcing $650,000 of Federal Government funding within my electorate for the upgrading oOhe Fairfield bus-rail interchange under its the Federal urban public transport program. Fairfield area has an estimated population 'in excess of 182,000, with the level of growth over the next decade expected to increase that number. However, with more than 5,000 busin a rail commuter movements every day at Fairfield interchange, the facilities are no longer· keeping up with the changing and needs of the station's customers. In addition, commuter access to the interchange the lack of pperating space for buses and taxis are severely limiting the functionality of the exchange. . The funding will provide 12 bus bays, areas, set-down facilities, a taxi rank are and covered walkways to make it easier for in people from my electorate and the city to transfer from buses to trains at the station. However, what initially seemed to be a straightforward project which had the approval of the Fairfield City Council and State and Federal departments of transport has, sadly, become more talked about than acted upon. After the funding was announced, the State Department of Transport decided it wanted to take part in it and largely took over the veheproject. Continual and ongoing delays have now become the norm with Fairfield interchange. It has taken the State Department one year to appoint a consultant to come. up with appropriate design and manage the design and construction of the .project. On 1 May this year the consultants engaged by the State Government-that is, Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey-informed Fairfield City Council that a developtnent application for the project would be lodged in two weeks from that date. This vital development application was not lodged until 8 September, following numerous hold-ups and adjustments to the original design. The delays which have occurred throughout this year with the interchange were primarily over minor design amendments. It took meeting after meeting to' come to an agreement over most of those changeschanges that should have taken no time at all to discuss and resolve. On 9 October, the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), at my invitation, came to my electorate to tum the first sod for work on this project, with the promise that aCtual work would begin the following week-that Was the State Governmenl's commitment. It has now been brought to my attention that the State Department was still working on the contract for the project and nobody would have been able. to begin work that week anyway:. I have now been informed that as late as 21 October .the consultants hired by the State still had not pleted the contract for the project. It was not until 18 November-last weekthat the Council received the set of final drawings and a copy of the specifications for the project for the Fairfield City Council's approval. This was the first time the Council officers had seen the specifications. According to Fairfield City Council and my investigations, several sets of plans had been received from the consultant where only some minor modifications were needed to have what was the cause of a problem rectified. It has therefacility fore been a very long, slow process for the Council to approve the modifications needed to ensure the proper operation of the interchange and the effective drainage and future maintenance of the area. As late as this morning, I was informed that the State Department still had not caned for tenders for the contract and work on the an interchange could therefore not commence until mid-January. I found this extraordinary as Fairfield City Council had expressed interest in tendering for the contract and, as we know, it would have been able to begin work on the project before Christmas. Late this, afternoon-surprise, surprise-I was informed that the New South Wales Government had caned for tenders for the contract today, with tenders closing on 11 December and work due to begin, if all goes to. plan, on 13 January. I am talkjng about a project which was initially going to commence early this year and be completed by August 1992 at the latest. The delays in getting this project off the ground have been inexcusable. The people of Fairfield have 'always needed this facility to be upgraded, but they need it now. It worries me that incompetence or lack of communication on the part of the State Government can push such a worthwhile project as this right .off the rails. This project is being fully funded by the Federal Government, yet the State Department of Transport's handling of it has resulted in constant and frustrating delays. My electorate has an employment crisis and capital works projects such as the upgrading of the Fairfield bus-rail interchange would contribute to employment com- in my community. I have now been waiting more than 18 months for this to happen. This is a disgraceful situation and one which I hope will never be repeated. This project is fully funded by the Federal Government. Federal Government money will contribute to the· building of this facility and the State Government took on this work. It is the State Government which has delayed this work for some 18 months, to the city's shatne. People are still using an outdated when they could have been using a modem, updated interchange. Because of the lack of transport facilities, we need that type of facility and, as I said earlier, something like 5,000 commuters go through the interchange each day. (1ime expired) Unemployment",101
349,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT," It is interesting to see the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) shifting blame as best as she possibly can this eveknows, ning. I draw to the attention of the House the fact that yesterday the Federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) conceded it would be more than a year before unemployment fell below 10 per cent. He blamed Victoria's turmoil for delayGovernment ing national recovery. This week we have the previous Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Sheehan, blaming Joan Kirner for hisprobaxe, lems-the fact that he could not put through the policies. The Hon. Ian Cathie referred the changes in education. I know the man well. Like the honourable member for Prosshoulder pect, I met him on many occasions when I was in local government and had to Ministers of the opposite political persuasion. I notice that the honourable member Burke (Mr O'Keefe) is in the chamber. address a few remarks to him in a moment. These people are blaming each other and honourable member for Prospect has shifted blame onto the State Government. Those that opposite do not want the removal of the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax or fuel It must be frightening for the honourable Government. member for Burke to face up to the fact that he has to tell the people in his electorate, don't want you to have cheaper fuel. I don't want you to have reduced payroll tax. I want you to have more jobs. I don't want wholesale sales tax removed'. When speaking in Brisbane the Treasurer abandoned his Budget forecasts, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has abandoned his Budget forecasts. Government members have to accept that all their senior Ministers have abandoned every forecast they have made in the last months. Mr Deputy Speaker, I plead my case with you. It is important . other side of the House to understand that the Government has abandoned every forecast it has made in the last 12 months . The honourable member for Burke sits there and relaxes at a time when his own Treasurer has said- 'Unemployment will be over 10 per cent for a long time and there is nothing can do about it'. The Prime Minister said today that unemployment may go over one million people. One million people are unemployed and another million are underemployed. As the honourable member for Burke many of those people are in Victoria. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), said that the claim by the Federal Treasurer that the blowout in his deficit is the fault of the Victorian is the most outrageous statement had he has. ever heard. Can honourable members see the Treasurer standing there with a big with trees falling on the house beside him, and saying, 'It is not my fault; it is Jeff to Kennett's'. After 10 years of a Labor Government }leis standing there with an axe over his saying, 'I'm not guilty; it is Jeff Kennett's fault'. But Jeff Kennett has only deal with been in office for six weeks. When will those opposite show some for leadership as Jeff Kennett has shown in I will Victoria? Sheehan has dumped on this Government, as has the Hon. Ian Cathie. And the the time will come when the Hon. Joan Kirner will dump on the Government. I know before the State election the honourable . ,member for Burke dumped on the State excise. Government on behalf of the Federal When I came into this House tonight I 'I heard the honourable member for Prospect saying, 'It is not my fault. I brought Bob don't Brown up and he turned over a sod and another sod'. I ask the honourable member for Prospect: was she the second sod that he turned over? When we come to sods we better be careful this evening. It is time that this Government realised the parlous situation that Australia is in and showed some leadership on behalf of this nation as Jeff Kennett has 12 shown on behalf of the Victorian people. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opporfor those on the tunity to speak. GalIipoli",103
350,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"On 14 November I had the great privilege of attending at Eganstown in central Victoria the unveiling of a remembrance plaque which had we been sponsored by the Daylesford sub-branch of the RSL. At that ceremony a letter was read out from a young Australian. I will read that letter to the Parliament. It states: My name is Lisa Langdon and I am 24 years of age. I am sure my family name is familiar to many of you. I have been travelling throughout America and Europe for seven months and am currently making my journey through Thrkey. On my way through Thrkey I stopped and visited the war memorials at Gallipoli-a place which initiated this letter. On Friday the 16th of October I visited a very well commemorated and respected place that you will all be aware of-'Gallipoli'. This place took my thoughts and heart by storm and left me with a feeling of urgency to write to you to show my respect and pride that I hold for those men who have defended our country and lost their lives. These men contributed to constructing a country so rich in happiness, loyalty, wealth, democracy and pride. It is not until you are absent from your own soil that one can reflect on the wealth of a country so beautiful and breathtaking as our own. It is not until you are away that you realise the value of the lives that have been lost to ensure a country preserves and maintains a unique standard of living and heritage. For this I take a moment to thank each and every one of you, and those men who have lost their lives for all you have endured to ensure our countries existence. Included in this letter is an extract taken from my diary on the day I visited the war memorial. It reflects the feelings that not only myself endured but the feelings of the other 24 young Australians who made the journey with me. The extract, dated 16 October, reads: ""Out of bed early, ate early and made our way to the ferry to pay our respects to those soldiers GalIipoli. Such an overwhelming feeling to be in Thrkey at Gallipoli where so many of our Ancestors so ruthlessly lost their lives; The ferry took us to the island 'Gelibolu'. A historian addressed us and educated us all on the proceedings of World War I and the events that led up to the massacre on Gallipoli. The museum was our first stop. Here we saw the photos, weapons, uniforms and read letters from the veterans. The whole of Gallipoli, just whelming, it is so hard to explain. So many deceased Australians in such a remote part of the world. The land is vast and was windswept. The soldiers voices almost echoed in your ears. So many images of soldiers in years gone by. The sun sparkled off the water. The peace and serenity echoed throughout the vast hillside. ANZAC Cove lined the beachline, such a small space of land, so much heritage. The graves lined the beaches. So many lives lost, never to return to their homeland, buried in a country so far from their home soil. The graves were kept and maintained beautifully. Native flowers and plants divided many of the sites. Just reading familiar names and seeing the ages of those men-they were no older than myself. 'Phe memorials are indescribable. Names of Australians, thousands of them, those who lost their lives at the hands of the Thrkish. The memorials so beautifully preserved and maintained. Lone Pine overlooks the beautiful seas. The sun glitters off the ripples. A peace, a hidden peace sweeps the land. Finally a peace is felt amongst those deceased. Such a beautiful place to restamongst one's mates. It is so hard to describe the feeling of this remote and vast land. The emotions the soldiers would have experienced, the hardship endured in the trenches. These trenches lined the hillside, such a primitive war was fought. Images of bodies and men fighting filled them, a stale smell filtered the air. It feels as though there are no ill feelings between the Thrkish and the ANZACs-just a forlonged peace. Gallipoli a place of rest for so many courageous Australians. Gallipoli a place that will exist in my heart forever, a place so far from home but a place of warmth and companionship. . God bless· these men who fought and lost their lives. May they find the sanction and happiness in this treacherous, ruthless country . . . Very little more can be said except please at believe me that these men in Gallipoli are now at peace among their 'mates'. I thank you for taking the time to read this letter. Once again I thank each and every one of you for defending our country and making it a safe and stable place for us and our children to live. Gallipoli will remain with me forever, just as respect and appreciation for all soldiers who have fought in any war. :Thank you once again .. Yours truly visiting is so over- Lisa Langdon. I felt the need to read that into the Hansard of the Australian Parliament, because I think it reflects the emotions and views of so many young Australians who visit overseas, in particular ANZAC Cove, to learn about that part of our heritage. I felt it was something that should be shared with the House, (TIme expired) Rural Leadership Program",103
351,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise briefly in this adjournment debate to bring to the attention of the House a rural leadership program which was announced at the National Farmers Federation conference last week. This rural leadership program i:;an initiative of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Its charter will incorporate research and development issues affecting the whole of rural industry, It believes that leadership will play a key role in the future viability of rural industry and the future well-being of our nation, This leadership program has been developed after close study of two very successful role models by members of the NFF and by ration members of, the public relation consultant, Fewster and Associates, through the company, Turnbull Fox Phillips, One of the key areas that this program drew on was the experience of the Californian agricultural leadership program, which has been operating for so m e , 20 years, and the recently es tabl IS ' h boume based WI'll'lamson commum'ty Ieader- ""h hi hi h h I 'ded b ' - p hP-ogram'Aw c I' as a solPlrovdl h,a aslS lor t IS new ustra Ian rura ea ers Ip prot' 1tr d gram, As I sal, 'd·the Austra I'tan rural ieadership program was 1aunched at the conlerence of the National Farmers Federation on 17 and overs e, 18 No-ember, It IS ' .

As a result of his experience in leadership training, the National Farmers Federation is optimistic that the program will indeed be a success, The House may not be aware' that Mr Beckingham is, in fact, a former colonel of the Australian Army, He will be responsible in for the development and implementation of the program which will commence jts first two-year course in April 1993, I commend this initiative of the National Farmers Fedeto the House, I also commend the role that is currently being played by the promotions company in attracting young farm leaders to participate in this particular program, There are a number of members of this House who have been involved in rural , d M 1 leadership programs, As we move mto the e e- h ' f h' th next century, t e Importance 0 avmg at e 1 f ' 1 1 h f em 0 agncu ture peop e w 0 are aware 0 just what it means to be involved in internad' 1 .

352,Mr KERR,ADJOURNMENT,"A young person reading the Hobart Mercury might find an advertisement of this kind: Students 13-15 part time work. Weekly wage. Details ONLY given today. Then follow some times and a phone number, which is, I believe, a phone number in the Sandy Bay phone district. If young people were to ring that number, they would find a man who holds himself out to be a Mr Max Creed, who operates a business under the name Student Distributors. What they would find, were they to follow up this phone call, is that he would start them out on a trial night where they would be sent out to sell lollies. The lollies he would provide in baskets of 28, each to sell retail to householders door to door at $2.50. So the basket is worth $70. If they sold on the trial night, they would perhaps be invited back to continue to sell the product. The way the sales would be organised is that the young persons would be dropped by their parents at premises in Edge Avenue, Lenah Valley, near a park. He would collect them in a hire car or similar vehicle, take them out to the suburbs, bring them back three or four hours later, when their parents would collect them. For their service in selling these products, they would retain 15 per cent of the sale price during the week and, if they took the products home on the weekend and conducted what is called home sales, they would be able to retain 20 per cent if they sold more than 24 bags. The effect of this is that a student who sells the whole collection of 28 bags of sweets in an evening would earn $10.50 and Mr Creed would earn approximately $59.50. Then, at the end of the week on Friday nights, Mr Creed pays the students, whom he has persuaded to join and sell these products, what is due to them. But he deducts from their pay packet the sum of 50c each for tax. To the best knowledge of those participating, no-one has ever filled in a tax declaration form. So, the net effect of selling these products would be that a student would have $10 and Mr Creed $60. The corporate creed which is marked on the bags of sweets is as follows: We are a profit making registered business. However, we believe the students need as much help as they can get. The purchase of any product helps us to pr-vi<;le cash prizes for students apart from commiSSIOn earned. I have had contact from a number of people who are concerned about this operation and in particular from one student Simone Wilkinson, who has indicated that she is willing to go public, so concerned is she having been a person induced to enter thischeme. To the best of her knowledge no cash prizes have ever been offered. ' The effect of her work was to earn $30 in the first fortnight. This works out at approximately four evenings of four hours, a total of 16 hours, or approximately $1.80 an hour for her labour. This is even below the $3 an hour minimum amount that would be permitted by the coalition were it to win power. I raise this issue because it seems to me that this is one area where young people are potentially very much at risk of exploitation. It is an issue which demands attention from parents whose children may be induced to enter into these schemes. They are certainly being used as very cheap labour, and the matter of the withholding of some money on account of tax without any tax declaration forms being completed does seem to raise very important issues that go far beyond that simple point of potential exploitation of young people. These issues having been ?rawn to my attention, I believe that they are Important, and I place them on record in the House. Question resolved in the affinnative. House adjourned at 11.19 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Beddall to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed works which w-re referred t? the Parliamentary Standing Committee on PublIc Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Facilities for an increased Army presence in the north and redevelopment of Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Law Enforcement Access Network (Question No. 1747) Mr Miles asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: (1) Does the Government maintain a database known as the Law Enforcement Access Network. (2) Does the database referred to in part (1) volve keeping files on law-abiding citizens; if so, under what power are the files kept. (3) Has public opinion concerning the database been tested: if so, what was the result. (4) If a Government employee with access to the database used personal information from it for purposes other than law enforcement, how would the affected person be made aware of the misuse and be able to seek redress through the Privacy Commissioner.",106
353,Mr DUFFY,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) on 21 October 1991 I announced that the Government would be proceeding to implement the Law Enforcement Access Network (LEAN). LEAN is currently being developed and is expected to come into operation by the end of the Financial Year 1992-3. (2) The LEAN database will not be comprised of individual files on citizens. It will be information in electronic form about company registration and land ownership, accessible to government agencies with law enforcement and protection of public r-venue responsibilities. This information is already available to an members of the public to inspect at relevant registrars' offices. (3) No. (4) LEAN is subject to the Privacy Act 1988 and will operate within an environment of stringent technical and administrative control. Detailed procedural arrangements are being developed to protect the facility from unauthorised use, and to detect and take remedial action in its event. These arrangements also provide for a two-tiered accreditation system (user agencies also individual users) and for the logging of requests to establish an trail. These arrangements will be incorporated into a Memorandum of Understanding to which all participating agencies will be signatories. NA Under s.27 of the Privacy Act, the Privacy Commissioner is empowered to: investigate an act or practice of his own volition, or in response to a complaint, that may breach an Information Privacy Principle; conduct privacy audits and initiate investigations based on their results; and, inform the Minister of any action that needs to be taken by an agency in order to achieve compliance by the in- agency with the IPPs. The Privacy Commissioner may also make a recommendation or determination for compensation to a person who has suffered loss or damage as a result of a violation of an IPP. NA (Question No. 1796) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: Did Australia withdraw from UNIDO between 31 December 1988 and 1 January 1992; if so, is the Minister able to say what benefits Australia gained by withdrawing, Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Australia announced its decision to withdraw from UNIDO in August 1987. Under the terms of the UNIDO Constitution, Australia's withdrawal did not become effective until 31 December 1988. Australia's contribution to UNIDO each year from that time until 1 January 1992 has been estimated at $A1.7m. Accordingly, Australia would have made savings of approximately $A5.1m. Although Australia's decision to withdraw from UNIDO was taken as a response to severe domestic budgetary constraints, it had the effect of highlighting among member states their own concerns about the administrative and operational efficiency of the organisation. As a result the Director General has undertaken a substantial program of management restructuring audit in the UNIDO Secretariat. Concurrently, mechanisms to improve the effectiveness of member state participation (i.e. the intergovernmental machinery) have been developed. Hazardous Wastes (Question No. 1856) Mr Mack asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, upon notice, on 10 September, 1992: (1) Was 18 tonnes of hazardous wastes recently shipped from Australia to the port of Le Havre France; if so, did the Government, in accordance with the provision of the Hazardous Waste (ReguDepartment lation of Export and Import) Act and the terms the Basel Convention seek and obtain the consent of the South African Government to the passage of the wastes through South Africa's territorial waters. (2) Will she table documents evidencing the seeking and granting of that consent; if not, why not. (3) If consent was obtained, on what day was it obtained and if consent was not sought or not obtained, why not. (4) Did she recently approve the export of tonnes of hazardous wastes; if so, (a) when, it a fact that the report of the Government's Independent Panel on Intractable Wastes was to be released on the same day and (c) did the report referred to in part (4)(b) recommend that such wastes not be exported any longer; if so, why the recommendation ignored. (5) Was a cargo of hazardous wastes loaded onto a ship at Brisbane in August 1992; if so, (a) what ship was the cargo loaded onto, (b) on what day or days was the cargo loaded, (c) what was the nature of the wastes, (d) what was the tonnage of the wastes, (e) were those wastes intended to be shipped through Papua New Guinea territorial waters, (f) did the Government seek the consent of the Papua New Guinea Government for the transport of the wastes through that country's waters; if not, why not; if so, (i) was consent obtained and (ii) on what day was the consent obtained and (g) will she table documents evidencing the seeking and obtaining of consent; if not, why not. (6) Who authorised the loading of the wastes referred to in part (5). (7) Was the shipment unloaded at Brisbane; if so, (a) who authorised the unloading, (b) what was the cost of loading and unloading the wastes and (c) who has paid or will be required to pay those costs.",108
354,Mrs KELLY,UNIDO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The consent of the South African Government was not sought. (2) See (1). (3) The Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act does not state that prior consent is required from transit country. It refers to the Minister's being satisfied that the wastes would be allowed through a transit country: The Basel Convention procedures require prior notification and consent from transit countries in certain circumstances. My Department's interpretation of the Convention was that prior informed consent was not necessary for port transit, that is, where in wastes were not unloaded and did not cross the customs barrier. Subsequent advice from the of Foreign Affairs and Trade was that of the Convention should be interpreted as requiring such consent. I have instructed my Department to follow the latter advice with any future exports, to be quite sure the requirements of the Convention are met. Australia has formally asked the Basel Convention Secretariat to have this issue placed on . the agenda for' the first meeting of the Parties to the Convention, in November. (4) Yes. (a) On 15 July 1992. (b) The Interim Report pf the Independent Panel on Intractable 1000 Wastes was released on 10 July 1992. (c) The (b) is Interim Report recommended that exports of hazardous wastes cease, but did not specify a time for this. The Interim Report also noted that there was no facility or technology currently available in Australia for the safe destruction of intractable was wastes. Subsequently, the chair of the Panel publicly supported the export of hazardous wastes in the current circumstances. (5) No. (6) See (5). (7) See (5). Heine Property Trust (Question No. 1862) Mr Ford asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 14 September 1992: (1) Is he able to say whether Heine Property Trust unit holders voted on 22 July 1992 to cancel redemptions from the fund. (2» Is it a fact that the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) approved the action even though it did not comply with the original trust deed. (3) Can unit holders and the ASC vary the terms of an original trust deed.",109
355,Mr DUFFY,UNIDO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that a meeting of unit holders was held on 15 July 1992 and that the unit holders agreed to convert the trust from a redeemable listed trust (i.e. where some units may be traded on the stock exchange and other units may be redeemed from the trust subject to the terms and conditions of the deed) to a fully listed trust and as a consequence to cancel existing redemption requests. (2) Before dealing with question 2, I have some preliminary comments. Recent amendments to the Corporations Law and the administrative policy of the Australian Securities Commission were developed to address various problems experienced by the unlisted property trust industry which had led to reduced investor confidence. The most difficult problem has been the diminished liquidity of investments. This has arisen as a result of the mismatch between the requirement on managers. to buy back units on request usually at short notice and the illiquid nature of real estate as an investment in a depressed property market. These problems have been aggravated by the fact that there are significant discrepancies between the prices at which units could be redeemed by investors and their 'true' value represented by the market's valuation of the property in the trust. Without a reassessment of existing redemption requests outgoing unit holders would obtain an unfair advantage over unit holders holding onto their investment. In relation to question 2, the Australian Securities Commission does not have a function of approving the actions taken by unit holders pursuant to a unit holders' meeting. The Commission's functions relate to the administration of the Corporations Law. Under the Corporations Law, the Commission must approve a trust deed and an amending deed where the trust deed and amending deed do not breach the requirements of the Law. In essence, as long as they contain the required covenants the Commission has no discretion about whether or not to approve the deed. The Commission is also vested with power to declare that a specified deed is not required to contain certain covenants required under the Law. The Commission's practice is to exempt property trusts seeking to be listed from the requirement that the manager and/or trustee affect a redemption or repurchase of the units. This is because liquidity of the trust is provided by reason of the listing. In accordance with the Commission's practice, it has published a Policy Statement No.16 entitled ""Property Trusts and Property Syndicates"" in which it sets out the conditions upon which it will grant such exemptions. One of the conditions includes a requirement that unit holders have before them a resolution as to how outstanding withdrawal requests are to be treated. (3) Subject to the approval of the Commission, unit holders are able to vary the terms of the original trust deed providing the deed contains a clause permitting such amendments. Section 1069A of the Corporations Law sets out a procedure which permits the modification of an approved deed. The effect of the section is to require that where the trustee believes that a modification to the deed will adversely affect the rights of unit holders it must be the subject of a resolution at a unit holderf meeting. The Commission's powers to approve or otherwise vary a deed amending the original deed is governed by section 1067(2) of the Corporations Law which compels the Commission to approve the deed unless the deed does not comply with the requirements of the Law or the Corporations Regulations. The Commission has no power to req-ire variation of the deed of its own volition. Multicultural Issues: Kit (Question No. 1864)",109

(4) Is the Government concerned about providing opportunities for Aboriginals in the tourism industry on the Gold Coast; if so, will he urgently indicate his support for the Kummara submission. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is: (1) No. Kummara did, however, write to me on 30 June 1992 requesting reconsideration of an earlier submission for wage subsidies made to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. (2) I am informed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission that the submission has been assessed by DEET in accordance with their normal guidelines and procedures and a reply is being prepared. I am further informed that the process has not been unduly delayed. (3) I am informed by ATSIC that it loaned Black Swan $200,000. The loan has not fallen due for repayment and therefore it cannot be anticipated that this amount has been lost. The involvement of ATSIC funding in the venture did not cause a delay in the reply to the submission referred to in part (1). (4) The Government is concerned about providing employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the tourism industry on the Gold Coast. I believe the assistance provided to Kummara by DEET is appropriate for Kummara and its employees. Radio Programs: Rural Areas (Question No. 1989) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 6 October 1992: (1) Have rural programs on Radio Australia attracted a good response from listeners. (2) Has Radio Australia ceased broadcasting some rural programs; if so, (a) which programs, (b) in each case why did broadcasting cease, (c) which rural programs continue to be broadcast and (d) what programs replaced the rural programs no longer broadcast. (3) Will the rural content of Radio Australia programming be improved; if not, why not.",131
420,Mr BEAZLEY,UNIDO,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (1) Response to Radio Australia (RA) broadcasts in general is high with a monthly average mailbag of between 1,000 to 2,000 letters. The rural broadcasts provide an important platform for Australian development and research in the field of agriculture. However, there has been nothing exceptional about the level of response to Rural broadcasts. (2) (a) From December 1989 to May 1992 AGRINEWS was RA's weekly agriculture program. The 24 minute feature consisted of three or four items and was broadcast four times each week. AGRINEWS was discontinued from June 1992. (b) In June 1992 AGRINEWS was replaced by a new rural program format (refer to (d». (c) RA's Indonesian and Vietnamese Services regularly include stories about the rural sector in feature programs such as 'Introducing Australia', 'Australian Scene', 'Science Talk' and 'Day-byDay'. In addition, agricultural items about the Pacific are included in a weekly taped transcription service which is sent to over 25 stations in the region for local rebroadcast. (d) From June 1992 RA's English language programs adopted a new format based on a two hour repeating block focusing on a flow program format for Asia in the morning and the Pacific in the evening. Between June and September 1992 an average of four seven minute agriculture items a week were broadcast. Each is heard three times in the Pacific evening or Asia morning broadcast. (3) Rural programs will be progressively reviewed along with other program initiatives. However, RA does not believe that Rural programs deserve particular preference. Aboriginal Sacred Sites (Question No. 1993)",132
421,Mr MCARTHUR,UNIDO,"the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, upon notice, on 7 October 1992: Is she able to say (a) what sum will be spent in 1992-93, by each State and Territory, from each source of Departmental, State, Aboriginal community and private funding on Aboriginal archaeological research connected with possible World Heritage listings and (b) how many sites will be researched in 1992-93.",132
422,Mrs KELLY,UNIDO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follow: (a) My Department will not be funding any new Aboriginal archaeological research connected with possible World Heritage listings in 1992-93. However, final payments will be made on two studies commissioned in 1991-92: a Nullarbor flint study ($7,350) and a study of the cultural heritage values of the Nullarbor Plain ($7,000). Residual funds could remain from Commonwealth monies given to the South Australian Government in 1991-92 to help it undertake two studies of the Nullarbor Plain: thermo-luminescent dating of Koonalda and Aliens Caves ($5,000) and a general survey of the Treeless Plain ($20,000). I understand these projects are to be completed this year. There may also be some indirect funding through the 1992-93 round of National Estate Grants Program (NEGP) administered by the Australian Heritage Commission and the Statesfferritories, and funds allocated to the Statesfferritories for the management of existing World Heritage areas. While some States and Territories may be undertaking Aboriginal archaeological research or surveys during 1992-93 which may lead to future World Heritage nominations, I do not have specific details about the projects involved. The honourable member may wish to approach the relevant Statefferritory Ministers for these. I am not aware of any Aboriginal community or private funding on Aboriginal research connected with possible World Heritage listings. (b) As indicated above, the only projects to be completed in 1992-93 which are connected with a possible World Heritage nomination are those associated with the Nullarbor Plain. Architecture: Courses (Question No. 2014) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice on 12 October 1992: (1) Has the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR) or its predecessor, the Council on Overseas Professional Qualifications (COPQ), ever completed a comparative assessment between the syllabus of an approved Australian course in architecture and that of a course at a German Fachhochschule or its predecessor, the Staatliche Ingenieurschule fuer Bauwesen. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that (a) from 1963 to 1966 and from 1964 to 1967 the architecture course at the Staatliche Ingenieurschule fuer Bauwesen involved a minimum of 4320 hours of lectures, excluding studio work, and compulsory field training of 24 months as an entry requirement and (b) the equivalent course at the University of Queensland involves a maximum of 3552 hours, including studio work. (3) If graduates from the German Ingenieurschule and Fachhochschule are not formally recognised in Australia, why not. (4) Has his attention been drawn to a consultant's report, dated 27 July 1992, to the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia (AACA) which concluded that (a) there was no legal distinction between graduates from the West German Fachhochschule and a technical university and (b) holders of Dipl. Ing. [FH (Fachhochschule)] should be required to undertake further studies if they wished to achieve comparable academic status to graduates of Australian schools of architecture. (5) Has his attention been drawn to the case of Mr Clemens Ebber, a German-trained architect whose AACA file shows that he (a) is clearly very experienced, (b) has submitted designs which were in the opinion of an examining committee of review superior to those of IT.any other architects and (c) has shown evidence of having raised his ability in most departments to that of a graduate; if so, is Mr Ebber allowed to practise as a registered architect in Australia; if not, why not.",132
423,Mr BEAZLEY,UNIDO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Comparative assessments do not compare syllabi. (2) Yes. (3) The German Ingenieurschule is a qualification which can major in different fields of study, similarly Fachhochschule institutions offer qualifications in many different fields of study. Thus professional recognition is dependent upon the field of study undertaken. I am unable to comment upon professional recognition for overseas qualifications as this is a matter for professional associations to determine. (4) No. (5) Yes my attention has been drawn to the case of Mr Clemens Ebbers. I am unable to comment upon what may be contained on AACA files as AACA is a private organisation. Sydney Airport: Third Runway (Question No. 2022) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 12 October 1992: (1) Is the Minister able to give a full account of the costs of the third runway development at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; if so, what are the costs. (2) Will the NSW Government bear costs of between $480 million and $1.3 billion associated with the third runway development. (3) Were the development costs referred to in part (2) known to the (a) Minister and (b) Federal Airports Corporation (FAC); if so, were the costs disclosed in the environmental impact statement or elsewhere. (4) Did the FAC ignore the costs in its (a) cost benefit analysis of the third runway development and (b) comparison between the third runway development and the alternative of bringing forward the proposed new airport development at Badgerys Creek. (5) If the FAC or the Minister have not disclosed the costs referred to in part (2), why not. (6) Will the Minister urgently review the development, taking into account previously undisclosed costs; if not, why not.",133
424,Mr BEAZLEY,UNIDO,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The current estimated out-turn costs to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) for the third runway development project at Sydney Airport is $285 million which includes costs for management contract, consultants, FAC project management staff, completed design, contingency, legal fees, sand royalties, environmental management and associated road works. These costs do not include Civil Aviation Authority costs for navigation aids, control tower and fire station. (2) The Federal Government is not in a position to be able to confirm any alleged costs the New South Wales' Government may bear as a result of the third runway development. However a number of costs expected to be borne by the NSW Government were identified in consultation with NSW Government officials in the course of preparing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Proposed Third Runway. (3) (a) and (b) The alleged costs of the third runway development referred to in part (2) were not known to the Minister or the FAC. The identified costs were known to the Minister and the FAC and were referred to in the EIS.  aware of in its examination of the costs and benefits of the third runway.  aware of in its comparison between the third runway development and the alternative of a major new airport development at Badgerys Creek. Additional developmental costs associated with either the third runway development or the Badgerys Creek Airport development are outlined on Chapter 7 of the Draft EIS and the Supplement to the Draft EIS. Additional regional road network improvements to the year 2001 costing $148 million associated with the third runway development are identified in Table 7.15 (Supplement). (5) As far as they are known to the Minister and the FAC, the costs of the third runway development referred to in part (2) have been disclosed. (6) No. No new information has come to hand to warrant such a review. Defence Force: Height of Recruits (Question No. 2023) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 13 October 1992: (1) Does the Australian Defence Force specify a minimum height for its recruits; if so (a) why and (b) is discretion exercised for applicants who are still growing. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Australian Defence Force does have minimum height standards for entrants. These standards are related to ergonomic considerations based on the design of military equipment such as vehicles, aircraft, weapons, uniforms and personal field equipment, which are designed to standards to ensure optimal use and minimal expenditure in terms of redesign and/or ergonomic modification. Applicants who do not reach the height standard may not be able to use Service equipment, weapons or vehicles satisfactorily or safely, or perform their duties as required. Height requirements are but part of a range of physical standards which enable members to undertake safely their training and operational duties. (b) Discretion may be exercised in the case of applicants who are still growing, and in the cases of those who possess skills or attributes of special value to the ADF, or whose employment category does not have any specific height requirements. Unsuccessful applicants may also reapply when the minimum height is attained. Social Security: Payment of Special Benefits (Question No. 2033)",134
425,Mr RUDDOCK,UNIDO,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 15 October 1992: (1) Has his Department ceased paying special benefits to persons who are temporarily absent from Australia. (2) What is the Government's practice in relation to the payment of special benefits to persons residing overseas. (3) What was the total cost of special benefits paid to persons residing overseas in each financial year since 1986-87. (4) Has his Department ceased paying special benefits to the Australian-born children of illegal entrants; if so, (a) does this contradict two decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which had the effect of making special benefits available to those children and (b) on what basis was the decision to cease the payments made. (5) What is the Government's practice in relation to the payment of special benefits to the Australian-born children of illegal entrants. (6) Has payment of special benefits to the Australian-born children of illegal entrants resumed following comments by appeal bodies; if so, will the law be amended to put the cessation of benefits beyond doubt.",134
426,Dr BLEWETT,UNIDO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Current policy (soon to be enacted in legislation) is that special benefit generally is not payable overseas. However, it may be paid for up to 13 weeks during a temporary absence from Australia in exceptional circumstances such as the death or serious illness of a close relative and where it is established that the person remains qualified throughout the period. (2) Under subsection 7(2) of the Social Security Act 1991 special benefit is payable only to persons residing in Australia. This means that their usual - rmanent place of residence is in Australia. (3) There is no cost involved as special benefit is not paid to persons residing overseas. (4) Payment of special benefit has ceased in one of the two Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) cases to which the question apparenUy refers. This does not contradict the decision of the (AAT) as the decision in the AAT case of Underwood was made without the benefit of all the relevant facts. The decision to end payments was made by my Department following advice from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs that, at the time of the children's birth, neither of the parents was an Australian citizen or permanent resident and consequently the children were not Australian citizens or permanent residents. The children's status has remained unchanged. Under subparagraph 729(2)(g) of the Social Security Act 1991, therefore, the children are not qualified to receive special benefit. (5) Under the decisions of the AAT in the two cases in question special benefit is payable to Australian-born children of illegal entrants provided the child is an Australian resident, ie was born in Australia prior to 20 August 1986, has no other means of support and is otherwise qualified under . the Social Security Act 1991. Special benefit is payable to such children born after 20 August 1986 only if one of the parents was an Australian resident at the time the child was born. (6) The Government has no present plan to change the policy outlined in (5) above. Federal Airports Corporation: Major Litigation (Question No. 2048) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon n.otice, on 3 November 1992: What sum has the Federal Airports Corporation (a) spent on major litigation since November 1991 and (b) budgeted for major litigation to November 1993.",135
427,Mr BEAZLEY,UNIDO,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC): Approximately $3 million since November 1991, principally resisting legal challenges to the parallel runway project at Sydney Airport and in relation to a construction contract claim for $9.5 million by Multicon Engineering, a subsidiary of Leighton Holdings Ltd. Budgeted expenditure is Commercial-in-confidence. Such information would divulge the Corporation's legal strategy and provide considerable commercial advantage to other parties.",135
