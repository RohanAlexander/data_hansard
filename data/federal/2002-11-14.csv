One encouraging indication-it is only a much emphasis on it-that we can close the gender boys simultaneously is the change in the 2000. Again, I do not think we can place too frame, but over those years at both the year diminished and the achievement levels of girls can close the gender gap. We can address time promoting further achievement for girls part of a gender battle. It is not in any way by girls. Some of the comments around this-we were really quite misleading.

We tried to take that into account in the introduction, an executive summary and then substance and context to the recommendations. of this report so that we can advance this issue. I was a little taken aback by one commentary who wrote an article in the Hobart Mercury, I believe the article was also syndicated in the article says, ‘The public debate about educating public debate that he was talking about is centred the author criticises is the title of Boys: getting because, according to the critic, this report did why he did not like the name of the report. name for a report which encapsulates the issues lates debate. The author goes on to say, as a few other says that the answers to the way we deal with more male teachers into the profession, have smaller their assessment of our report. If you read that those things play just a minor role within is happening now, what we can do to assist boys learning, and the things that governments, communities If that is their full assessment of this report, parts of the report, because they then head need to point this out. I do not mind criticism-that some of our problems in trying to have this to be educators. Mr Bantick claims to be an educator, The report, unhappily, is not a waffle-free zone. What does ‘a waffle-free zone' mean? It goes on to say: Much in it is contentiousOkay. That is interesting. It then says: ... and plain wrong. That is an issue. One of the interesting Take, for example, the quoting of Ian Lillico, principal Australia. Lillico notes: “Boys, in particular cannot and how they can use it.” The author goes on to say that we all know this to the quoted submissions from Ian Lillico, great deal of time writing a submission for parts because we regarded that evidence Boys like to be able to see how what they are learning find it difficult to engage with what MAIN COMMITTEE 9199 comment on the report, one hopes that the report are not just rushing to the recommendation way we structured the report in that there is an the body of the report, which try to give some We welcome comment and positive criticism on the report by a Mr Christopher Bantick, which is a daily distributed throughout Tasmania. some other papers on the mainland. The lead-into boys is largely missing the point.' The and based on this report. The first thing that it right. I assume the title is being criticised not get it right. There could be no other reason However, it is always difficult to come up with a you have been looking at and which stimucommentators have said, that basically the report boys in education are to pay teachers more, get class sizes and offer scholarships. That is the recommendations of this report, you will see the context of assessing what the issue is, what and girls in education and in the outcomes of and schools can do to make it better. they did not read it. I suspect they did read some off to comment about some of the submissions. I is fine-but in analysing this you will see report taken more seriously by people who profess certainly in the past. His article says: things is that the author goes on to say: of City Beach High School in Perth, Western make the connection between what they are doing is ludicrous. To be fair, the author did not go a noted and respected educationalist who spent a this. The report quotes Mr Lillico extensively into be considered and well tested. It states: relates to life outside or beyond school and may appears to [be] irrelevant subject matter. NA 9200 It quotes Mr Lillico: The curriculum has to be relevant. The idea of teaching maybe have never used since school, is very difficult how it applies to their lives. Boys, in particular, doing and how they can use it. For heaven's sake, if you take the quote in its people, but particularly boys, learn best when noted educationalist for something that is totally wrong with boys, and where the report gets it are. He says that is what is wrong with the report. about the indices that are at work and that show outcomes and all other outcomes that we regard reason is that we are not concentrating on they do not do well. For heaven's sakes, if whole report is supportive of young people-all education, and of course it stresses the things regard as some of the difficulties in learning tome before us. To level that criticism at Mr Lillico be fair. I would also like to point out that Mr Bantick says: One of the clear messages the report delivers is that reasonable idea, it should not be achieved To be fair, this report constantly points out that we need more men teachers because they should have fewer women teachers so that said or implied. For him to imply that we have and are not very important in the lives of their implied. The article goes on to say: There is a risk that, following the report's recommendation key role-models may fall into the very How that is derived from the report is beyond teachers in the report is positive about male schools. But nowhere does it advocate that sake of having them. They are there for a positive report says: An understanding of gender issues is important relationship and commitment to boys The report then quotes the transcript of Boys in Focus: We know that they watch us very closely, so the the way we can work as a colleague is something environments that they are from that is not the sort aware of that sort of thing, that what we display MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 some of the things that we have learned, and to get across to kids these days who want to see cannot make the connection between what they are full context it is purely and simply saying that it is relevant to them. Mr Bantick is criticising a out of context. He goes on to say that what is wrong, is that nobody likes boys for what they He talks about what is wrong with boys and that they are not getting the desired learning as important in education, and says that the what they do well; we concentrate on only what he read the report again, he would see that the young people: boys and girls-and people in they do well. But this report deals with what we outcomes; otherwise we would have a massive and the report is, I think, absolute tripe, to boys need positive role-models. Although this is a at the expense of women teachers. that we are not involved in the business of saying are better than women teachers or that we we can have more men teachers. That was never said that women teachers are not good teachers students is absolute rot; but that is what he has of more male teachers in boys' schools, bloworst kind of misogynistic yobbism. belief. Just as an example, the section on male role models as it is about female role models in we have male role models in schools just for the reason.

I do not wish to labour critical response to this report, but I ask publicly from it to push some bandwagon that they idea up so that they can get some interest headed ‘Crazy about boys'.
