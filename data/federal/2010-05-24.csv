2,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: on 25 February I advised the House of the suspected fraudulent use of a number of Australian passports in connection with the murder of senior Hamas figure Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh. I now advise the House of the government's response to this matter. First it is worth ing the circumstances in which this came to the government's attention and our response to date. On 20 January, Mr Al-Mabhouh was found murdered in a hotel room in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. On 16 February, police in Dubai announced that falsified passports from the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Germany had been used in connection with the murder. Late on 22 February, Dubai authorities approached Australian officials with an inquiry about two Australian passports. The following day, 23 February, Dubai authorities confirmed to Australian officials that they were investigating a number of Australian passports in connection with the murder. Since that time, Dubai authorities have announced that they are investigating four Australian passports in connection with the murder. Those four Australian passports are in the names Mr Adam Korman, Mr Joshua Bruce, Ms Nicole MCCabe and Mr Joshua Krycer. From the first contact on 22 February, Australian authorities have cooperated fully with Dubai investigators. On 25 February, I expressed to the House my concern that these Australian passports had been used fraudulently. Both the Prime Minister and I condemned in the strongest possible terms this apparent misuse and abuse of Australian passports. On 25 February, I also announced that the Australian Federal Police, in conjunction with relevant agencies, had been asked to investigate the possible abuse of these passports. These agencies included the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) and the Australian Passport Office. On 9 April, I received the Australian Federal Police report. Upon a preliminary assessment of that report, it was clear that further work and advice was required from other agencies, in particular ASIO and ASIS. I made this recallknown publicly on 11 April. This further work included a visit to Israel this month by the Director-General of ASIO. I received my final advice from agencies last week. I briefed the National Security Committee of the cabinet this morning and have taken steps to ensure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for foreign affairs has been briefed. This advice leads to the following key conclusions. Firstly, and very importantly, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that those Australian passport holders identified by Dubai authorities were anything other than innocent victims of identity fraud; secondly, the passports in question were deliberately counterfeited and cloned for use. The high quality of these counterfeited passports points to the involvement of a state intelligence service. Thirdly, these investigaof tions and advice have left the government in no doubt that Israel was responsible for the abuse and counterfeiting of these passports. I note that a similar conclusion was reached by the United Kingdom government in the course of their official investigations. No government can tolerate the abuse of its passports, especially by a foreign government. This represents a clear affront to the security of our passport system. Nor can we tolerate the abuse by a foreign government of the personal details of the Australian nationals concerned. These are not the actions of a friend. I regret to advise the House that this is not the first occasion that Australian ports have been misused by Israeli authorities. The Dubai passports incident also constitutes a clear and direct breach of confidential understandings between Australia and Israel dating back some years. This is not what we expect from a nation with whom we have had such a close, friendly and supportive relationship. After careful deliberation, the government has asked that a member of the Israeli Embassy in Canberra be withdrawn from Australia. I have asked that the withdrawal be effected within the week. Earlier this morning, at my request, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade called in the Israeli Charge d'Affaires. Israeli Ambassador Rotem, whom I called in on 25 February, is absent from Australia until 8 June. If Ambassador Rotem had been in Australia, I would have again spoken to him myself. The department conveyed the government's deep disappointment over Israeli involvement in this affair. The department made it clear that Australia regarded the abuse of these passports as inconsistent with the friendship and support provided by successive Australian governments to Israel since its creation as a nation. Australia's relationship with Israel has always been founded on a basis of mutual respect and trust. But Israel's actions this regard have undermined that respect and trust. The government takes this step much more in sorrow than in anger or retaliation. It is a decision taken in our national security interests. The government has done so in accordance with the findings of the investigation and after a careful assessment of Australia's national interests by relevant agencies. The government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, will continue to provide consular assistance on an as needs basis to those Australians whose identities were stolen and who were therefore passadversely affected by Israel's actions. We have already, on request, replaced the passports of a number of those involved. I convey publicly a final point made to the Israeli Charge d'Affaires by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Insofar as the Australia-Israel bilateral relationship is concerned, our expectation is that our relationship with Israel can and will continue in a mutually productive and beneficial manner. Australia's support for the State of Israel goes back to its creation. Australia's support for the State of Israel has long enjoyed bipartisan support. We have always shared a relationship reflecting our joint commitment to freedom, security and democracy. Australia remains a firm friend of Israel. But, as I noted previously, our relationship must be conducted on the basis of mutual trust and respect. Genuine friendship runs both ways. We expect this government and future Israeli governments to ensure that this incident is not repeated. We now look forward to working to restore the highest standards of trust in our relationship with Israel. I thank the House. NA Private Members' Motions",19

5,Mr HOCKEY,INSURANCE CONTRACTS,"The Treasurer has delivered a budget which he characterised, perhaps ironically, as meeting the highest standards of responsible economic management. But I am afraid that this government does not understand accountability. It has not earned the people's trust. The Prime Minister uses other ministers to announce bad news or cancellation of projects despite saying repeatedly that the buck stops with him. This is a Prime Minister who is the master of broken election promises, policy backflips and mismanagement. The CPRS, the greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our time, has been ditched. The school drop-off childcare centres program in schools has been dropped. The pink batts program has been abandoned save for nearly $1 billion to try to repair the botched job already. The so-called Building the Education Revolution program is behind schedule and has blowouts. The computers in schools program is over budget and has under-delivered. In fact, only 220,000 of the promised one million school computers have been delivered. And to pay for all this the much-vaunted Henry tax review took two years, cost $20 million and, of 138 recommendations, 2½ were adopted. This year's budget continues this trail of deception. The budget is based on claimed efficiency dividends and stronger growth 2010-2011 from tax reform, yet the government refuses to release the detailed modelling on all 138 recommendations in the Henry review. The projected surpluses in the final two years of 2010-2011 the forward estimates are wafer thin with a budget of close to $400 billion in 2013-14, relying on surpluses of $1 billion and, the year after, $5 billion. That claim is risky and unreal. These anticipated surpluses are also based on projections rather than forecasts and, I might say, budget forecasts and projections are only as good as the underlying economic assumptions. These assumptions include forecasts and projections of population growth in Australia, economic growth offshore, economic growth in Australia, terms of trade, exchange rates, interest rates, and so on. So these assumptions on the economic parameters, naturally enough, can vary widely from year to year, let alone the government's claim that you can rely on them in three years time. For example, last year's budget forecast the Australian economy would contract by 0.5 per cent in 2009-10. This year's budget tells us the economy will grow by two per cent. This is a massive turnaround in the space of just 12 months. Last year's budget said the unemployment rate would peak at 8½ per cent in 2010-11. This year's budget tells us the unemployment rate has already peaked at less than six per cent and is now heading to a low of 4.75 per cent in 2011-12. I want to stress that I am not criticising the public servants in Treasury who prepare these forecasts. Forecasting is as much an art as it is a science. It is a difficult task and the degree of uncertainty has been much increased over recent years. But these very significant changes to the underlying forecasts do illustrate that there is a large degree of imprecision in the budget numbers. This makes it even more ridiculous that the government should claim kudos from its projected tiny surpluses in the last two years of the forward estimates. These tiny suggested surpluses are based on five key assumptions. First, economic growth in Australia will need to remain at around trend levels-three to 3½ per cent. Second, the global economy will also need to grow at or above trend. Third, prices for key Australian commodities will need to remain high. Fourth-and this is the most heroic assumption of all, Mr Speaker; you would appreciate this-Labor will need to not have any further cost blow-outs in its programs. And, fifth, Labor will need to commit to making no new unfunded spending promises for the next four years through two elections. Mr Speaker, I cannot make assumptions about what the chair might think about those things, but I am sure that any person with an ounce of savvy would know that it is heroic to assume that a government will make no new spending announcements for one year, let alone four years, which is the key assumption in the government having a surplus in three years time. The deficit this year of $57.1 billion will still be the biggest deficit in Australia's peacetime history. Next year, 2010-11, it will be the second biggest at a massive $40 billion. And there will still be a peak net around the same size as that which was left to Australians by Paul Keating. There is something about the $90 billion mark that Labor is attracted to. Keating left a $90 billion debt for us to pay off; Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, is leaving a $90 billion debt for the coalition to pay off; even Anna Bligh in Queensland has a $90 billion debt that someone is going to have to pay off. The improvement to the budget bottom line which the budget reflects is entirely due to parameter changes: stronger economic growth in Australia, above-trend growth offshore and the terms of trade being at 60-year highs. It does not rely on responsible economic management; it is not the result of hard decisions to cut reckless and wasteful government spending. Last year, the Treasurer justified his big spending budget on the grounds that it was necessary to prevent a recession in the Australian economy-so he delivered the biggest spending budget in Australia's peacetime history. This year he notes that the budget has moved from supporting the economy to a position now where Australia is recovering strongly. In that light, we might have expected a budget with much lower spending to suit the times. But what we find is an increase in spending from 2010-2011 to 2012-13, compared with last year's budget, totalling $26 billion. So last year was the biggest spending budget in modern history, but, as if Labor had not done what it could do at that time, this year it has an extra $26 billion of spending in a similar framework. Even then, the Treasurer has pulled some accounting tricks to improve his financial ratios. Cancellation of the CPRS is worth, roughly, a one per cent reduction in the ratio of spending to GDP in 2013-14 and somewhat lesser amounts in earlier years. This is a significant issue. There is this mantra that the debt of Labor Party run out before each budget where they refer to ‘the big-spending Howard years'. The big-spending Howard years to 2007 amounted to 23 per cent of GDP. At no time do Labor get as low as 23 per cent of GDP. Most certainly, in their most ambitious year, which is four years hence, they do not get to 23 per cent of GDP. If the CPRS were in, it would be nearly one per cent more than what they are already projecting. It is also the case-and this is a telling point that was picked up by Ross Gittinsthat $1.8 billion of spending in infrastructure, water and local government has been brought forward to 2009-10 from 2010-11 and later years to ensure that the forward estimates look better. Even more curious, and we are yet to get to the bottom of this, is that there is a revenue item called ‘growth dividend' totalling $600 million over the final two years of the forward estimates. This is the additional tax expected to flow from the stronger economic growth arising from the implementation of tax reforms associated with the resources tax. It is fortunate that notional revenue occurs in the two years when the government is expecting to record very small surpluses. This is part of the government's claim, I assume, that the more you tax an industry the greater it will grow-and, of course, they are banking the proceeds of that, which we will see over the next few weeks. The Treasurer claims that every dollar in new policy has been offset across the forward estimates. Let's have a look at that. Policy decisions since the 2009-10 budget have increased net spending by $5.9 billion. That figure includes new spending measures, new taxes and savings initiatives. So all the new taxes have been spent, all the savings initiatives have been spent and, on top of that, an additional $5.9 billion has been spent for good measure. I emphasise that not a cent of the new taxes has been saved to reduce the deficit-not a cent. This government have a history of wasteful spending and have, true to form, continued it in this budget. The government have allocated another $536 million for new health bureaucracies as part of their health reform program. That happened after the Prime Minister promised the Australian people that, as a result of his new hospital and health reform program, there would not be any new bureaucrats. For examplebureaucrats are part of the theme-an additional $12 million has been provided to the Prime Minister's own department, adding an extra 86 full-time staff to the 618 already there. That represents a 14 per cent increase in the staffing levels in his own department. After all that, it is good to see that the Labor Party continue to look after their mates. A one-off grant of $10 million has been provided to the Trade Union Education Foundation for ‘the development and delivery of national workplace education programs'. I this can only speculate on what those programs are. It is just a lazy $10 million! It is interesting that they have brought it forward to this financial year. So the cheque is in the mail; it has to be in the mail before 30 June. The government has sold this budget as being friendly to small business, but nothing could be further from the truth. The single biggest difficulty for small business at present is the availability and cost of finance. This is hampering the ability of small businesses to invest and grow their businesses and provide jobs. One of the key steps government can take to help small business is to prevent its competing for the scarce capital that is out there, but this government will continue to soak up scarce capital for the next two years with cumulative borrowings of $54 billion. This will deprive small businesses of scarce funds. It will force up the cost of finance. The government are now borrowing $100 million a day just to fund their expenditure, not to repay debt. That does not pay off debt; they are borrowing $100 million a day just to fund the spending of this year, next year and the year after. What an extraordinary amount of money. As part of this process, the government want to impose a huge new tax on business by increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The question is: will this be paid by business? It is interesting that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation should bell the cat earlier this year-despite what Tony Jones suggested on Q&A-by alluding to the fact that an increase in the superannuation guarantee would in fact come out of the takehome salaries of workers. This nine to 12 per cent is either coming out of the bottom lines of businesses, which inevitably means that they going to employ fewer people, or quite simply coming out of the take-home pay of workers. It is one or the other, but what you do know is that it is not coming out of the budget bottom line. The government say: ‘In order to compensate business for this, we're going to cut company tax, particularly for small business; we will bring it forward and cut it from 30 per cent to 28 per cent.' They say, ‘This is a great windfall for small business.' The problem is that only one-third of small businesses in Australia are incorporated. Therefore the company tax cut means very little to a lot of small businesses, and I am prepared to bet that for most small businesses an increase in the cost of the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent is going to far outweigh any benefit that might come in the form of a reduction in company taxes. This budget will continue to provide fiscal stimulus to the domestic economy at a time when the government says it is no longer needed. The government's own forecasts have the Australian economy at or above trend growth for the next four years. The Treasurer has suggested that the government no longer need to provide fiscal stimulus, yet it is the case that in 2012 the government are going to be spending half a billion dollars on school halls to address one quarter of negative growth in 2008. So they are saying, ‘The economy is growing at trend or above, but we'll still be spending money on school halls in two years time to keep the economy going.' It is stimulatory, and with that sort of stimulation still out there in the economy the government will continue to run deficits and the deficits will impact on interest rates. The deficits will push interest rates higher than they should be. The Reserve Bank has now a lifted the cash rate six times in eight months, with a cumulative increase of 1.5 per cent. But the gap between what homeowners and small business pay and the cash rate of the Reserve Bank has grown, and the net impact is that the increases by the Reserve Bank have had a more profound impact than just the increases in themselves. The interest bill on an average mortgage of $300,000 has risen by least 4½ thousand dollars a year. So let's be very clear: the more the government borrows, the more upward pressure is on interest rates; the more the government goes down the path of spending money that it has not received and needs to borrow, the greater the upward pressure on interest rates. Around the world we are seeing what happens when government finances are unsustainable. Greece is struggling to finance its ongoing deficits in the market. This has prompted a trillion-dollar rescue package by the European Union and the IMF. Sovereign risk is now a very real fear in the financial markets. Debt levels in Japan, Europe, the UK and the USA are at the point where the governments will be struggling to stabilise and service their debts, let alone make any progress at all in repaying them. IMF data shows that six of the G7 nations will have gross debt-to-GDP ratios of 90 per cent or more by 2014. I wish to stress that Australia is not in this position. It is not an accident, but it has occurred despite the best endeavours of the Labor Party. They actually did inherit a $20 billion surplus, $60 billion in the Future Fund and an economy with just four per cent unemployment. But what they have to understand is that you can ruin the opportunity, and preserving the faith and trust of the markets and communities requires ongoing strong and prudent management of the budget and the economy. The economic and fiscal forecasts of government have to be credible. The actions of government have to provide a stable and predictable investment environment. This illustrates why the coalition has decided to take a stand. We believe in responsible fiscal management. Dare I say it, we are fiscal conservatives and not pretend fiscal conservatives. Last week I released the principles which will guide the coalition in setting and implementing its policies for underwriting the future prosperity of this great nation. At the core of that is a belief in fair and competitive markets. It is also the case that the rights and choices of individuals are paramount. Well-functioning markets and individuals rather than governments are usually best placed to make decisions that maximise community well-being. We believe in small government. That is why we made the hard decisions about the $47 billion of gross savings. We believe in efficient government; that is why we went program by program through the savings measures that we are going to implement. And we are most acutely aware that the money being spent by government is in fact other people's money. That is why whatever we can do to improve the strength of the Australian economy is going to be enhanced by collecting less tax, not more.",22
6,Mr DREYFUS,INSURANCE CONTRACTS,"We have just heard from the shadow Treasurer of Australia complete confirmation of the risk that would be posed to Australia if the shadow Treasurer or his leader were to get anywhere near the government of this country. They are a risk to jobs; they are a risk working families; they are a risk to the infrastructure of this country; they are a risk to skills. Everything we have seen from the opposition since the budget was delivered in this House some two weeks ago has confirmed just what a risk to the people of Australia is posed by those presently occupying the opposition benches. By contrast, through this budget the government has delivered and will continue to deliver responsible economic management. We have presented a credible pathway back to surplus in three years, and that time frame is half the time that it was expected to take when Australia first responded to the global economic crisis. This budget delivers tax cuts for working families and for small businesses. In addition, we are investing $23 billion over the next decade in a national health free, and hospitals network; we are investing in major national infrastructure to boost productivity and create jobs; we are investing in skills and training. The first aim of this government was to keep our economy strong and to protect Australian jobs and Australian businesses through the worse crisis that the global economy has faced in almost 80 years. When faced with this crisis the government understood that to contain the damage and to protect Australian jobs and businesses from the meltdown in global financial markets we had to maintain confidence in our financial system, encourage households to maintain consumption and provide businesses with the certainty and confidence to continue investing. Because of the early and decisive action taken by the government, Australia has managed to avoid a recession through what was feared to be and what now clearly has been the worse global downturn in more than 75 years. Australia's economy is the only advanced economy that expanded in the year to June 2009, the worse period of this crisis, to and, according to the International Monetary Fund's World economic outlook update, Australia's economic growth was positive and Australia was the only advanced economy to achieve this. In the 2009-10 budget economic growth was forecast to be negative 0.5 per cent; the estimate in this year's budget is that it will have been two per cent. The budget forecast for 2010-11 has improved from 2.25 per cent to 3.25 per cent. No major Australian financial institution has collapsed, none required the government to take significant shareholdings in return for dealing with toxic debt and no financial institutions were nationalised. This can be contrasted with the situation in the United Kingdom, where the government has nationalised Northern Rock and taken significant shareholdings in Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Most importantly, the government's response to the global economic crisis has helped protect hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs. Unemployment peaked at 5.8 per cent last year, 2.5 per cent lower than it was estimated to peak at and certainly considerably lower than would have occurred without the stimulus. It is quite clear that the government's resite sponse has been the correct response. That has been the opinion expressed around the world. It has been the opinion expressed by the International Monetary Fund, by the OECD, by the World Bank, by governments of other countries and by finance ministers and prime ministers in the G20, all of whom have complimented the Rudd Labor government for the decisive and prompt action that was taken at the peak of the global crisis and that has ensured the financial and fiscal secutime rity that Australia is now enjoying. It needs to be borne in mind, when we listen to the muddled response-yet another muddled response-from the shadow Treasurer that the coalition, the Liberal Party and the National Party opposed economic stimulus. They would have adopted policies, had they still been in government in September, October and November 2008, which would have ensured that hundreds of thousands of Australians would now be out of work. I would invite any member of the Liberal Party or the National Party, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition, to visit and talk to those workers who are working on Building the Education Revolution school projects throughout my electorate about how they feel the government's programs have assisted the Australian economy and, in particular, assisted them to stay in work during this global economic downturn. Were they to do so, they would learn that it is the opinion of people, certainly throughout the construction industry, that the response of the national government, the Rudd Labor government, has been extraordinarily prompt and entirely appropriate because it has kept them in work-and that is before one even goes to the immense value that has been given to our local communities by the building of the new facilities in each and every primary school through the Building the Education Revolution program. I would also invite those oppoto visit my electorate to speak to retailers or people in the manufacturing industry, all of whom very directly attribute the continued health of their businesses and the continuation in many cases of their employment to the programs that have been adopted by our government. With this budget, we have presented a credible pathway back to surplus. It is a pathway that will return the budget to surplus in three years. That is half the amount of that was forecast in last year's budget. Net debt is predicted to peak at just 6.1 per cent of GDP, which is half the level projected a year ago and less than one-tenth of the average across the major advanced economies. One thing that I noticed in the shadow Treasurer's speech that we just heard is that at least he had the good grace to acknowledge that the average debt-to-GDP ratio in the Western economies is in the order of 90 to 100 per cent, and he acknowledged that the net debt we are going to peak at is nothing like that, but he did not go far enough. Of course he does not want to state the number, which is 6.1 per cent of GDP, because to state the number in the same context as saying that the average net debt in Western economies is 90 to 100 per cent of GDP is to show just how absurd it is for those opposite to be, even by implication, comparing the position of the Australian economy or comparing the policies adopted by the Rudd Labor government to any of the positions that those Western economies, particularly the European economies such as Spain and Portugal or the United Kingdom. There is still a level of uncertainty faced in global financial markets. It is being highlighted right at this time by the difficulties that are being faced in Greece. Indeed, one could also point to Spain and Portugal, or indeed, by way of comparison, point not just to the net debt levels but also to the unemployment levels that have been reached in those Western economies and which are still regrettably being suffered in the United Kingdom or the United States. That puts in proper global context the success of the policies adopted by the Rudd Labor government. This budget delivers tax cuts to working families. It delivers tax cuts to small business. And, even during this period of fiscal consolidation, there will be modest income tax cuts that will see taxpayers on average earnings keep $450 a year more. From 2011, we will provide a 50 per cent tax break for the first $1,000 of interest on savings. As I went around my electorate last week explaining the budget to different people, I went to Richfield retirement village in Aspendale Gardens. The news that there is to be a 50 per cent tax break on the first $1,000 interest on savings is particularly gratifying to people who use savings accounts as one very secure form of investment. We will introduce simplified tax returns from 1 July 2012. The government will provide an optional standard deduction of $500 instead of having taxpayers list work related expenses individually, and it is a deduction that is going to increase to $1,000 from 1 July 2013. Every one of Australia's small businesses will get a tax break under the Rudd government through this budget. Sole traders, partnerships and incorporated small businesses will be able to immediately deduct the cost of assets valued at up to $5,000, and those 2.4 million small businesses will also be able to pool assets costing more than $5,000, except buildings, and write them off at a single rate of 30 per cent a year. And for the 720,000 small-business companies there will be a head-start reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from 1 July 2012. This budget also delivers a long hoped for increase in the superannuation guarantee, which will rise gradually over the next decade from nine per cent to 12 per cent, and this is another measure that is opposed by those opposite. This is an enormously important policy in guaranteeing the future incomes of working Australians and helps to prepare our nation and our national finances for the demographic shift that is already taking place. The budget is filled with new investments, most notably the investment in the Health and Hospitals Network which is announced in this budget. The budget includes significant reforms to the health and hospitals system, which will be funded nationally and run locally. There is a total of $7.3 billion over five years for better hospitals, improved primary care and preventive health. It is a budget that allows access to more doctors, to an unprecedented level of support and training for our nurses, which is why nurses across Australia have welcomed the measures in this budget, and the introduction of personally controlled electronic health records for every Australian. And there is another measure, because one only has to go through the budget to find such measures, which the opposition opposes and would cut. The only intelligible response that one can glean from the muddled response of the opposition has been a list of worthwhile, valuable programs that the opposition says it would scrap-not, mind you, that the opposition is prepared to tie itself to any binding list of cuts, because while they say they wish to cut, for example, the introduction of personally controlled electronic health records of every Australian, they reserve to themselves the right to introduce new programs which might cost more, possibly even in the same area if one is to correctly understand the shadow finance minister, the member for Goldstein. So it is very difficult to work out just what it is the opposition has said in tion to this budget. The budget contains very extensive measures in relation to infrastructure and in relation to skills and trade. Perhaps it is worth mentioning the record $37 billion investment in improving road, rail and port projects across Australia, all of which will boost national productivity and create jobs. The ongoing infrastructure fund of $5.6 billion will extend over a decade and is in response to the independent tax review-the Henry review. There will be annual contributions starting at $700 million from 2012-2013 to ensure that our nation-building project flourishes. There is funding for the Australian Rail Track Corporation and appropriate provision in the budget for the rollout of the National Broadband Network, another measure that this opposition of wreckers would scrap without indicating to the people of Australia in any way how it plans to take Australia further into the 21st century and further into the Information Age. There is something a bit striking about an opposition that wants to scrap not only a measure for personalised electronic health records but also the measures that the government is planning for a National Broadband Network. The contrast with the opposition could not be greater. We have a budget that is responsible and that will return to surplus some three years earlier than planned. We have a budget that has appropriate measures for the economic circumstances in which Australia finds itself following on prompt and decisive action that has taken Australia to an economic position that is the envy of the developed world. We can be clear that the greatest risks to Australia's economic security and the job security of thousands of Australian workers are the present opposition leader, the member for North Sydney-the shadow Treasurer-and the member for Goldstein. Everything about their response to this relabudget on behalf of the opposition has demonstrated that they cannot be trusted with the task of managing the Australian economy. I do not think that the expectations of the community were very high to start off with, given the way in which the shadow Treasurer last year responded to the budget, which was to suggest that the forecasts and projections on which it was based were ‘grossly overoptimistic'-that is what he said. That, of course, proved to be wrong. He now wants to say about this budget that the estimates are wrong again, but I think the Australian people can judge who should best be trusted on matters like this. I would be far readier to trust forecasts that have been adopted by this government based on the steady work of the Treasury than to listen to a shadow Treasurer who said last year that the predictions of the Treasury were grossly optimistic. There is no credibility left in this opposition on economic matters. The response last year, which criticised the forecasts, was that the opposition would stop the stimulus. That has been bettered-they have reached a new low for an opposition-with the shambolic response to the budget, with half-baked ideas and the handballed response that we saw last week. We saw in the budget reply by the Leader of the Opposition not, as one might have expected, a plan for the economy of Australia or a plan for the future of our tion with some clear responses to the measures in the budget and not, given that the opposition is very directly saying that it wishes to cut, any indication of what is to cut or which programs are to be scrapped but, rather, the handball approach: saying that the shadow Treasurer would respond at the Press Club the following week-last Wednesday. Then we had the response from the shadow Treasurer at the Press Club, whichas has been much commented on in the days since-did not include the list of cuts which were relied on by the opposition in its response. Instead, there was a further handball to the shadow finance minister at a press conference which was to follow. When finally it was possible to see the supposed savthe ings which the shadow Treasurer has again referred to-at least he is now not referring to them simply as savings but trying to pretend to some accuracy in saying that it is $47 billion of gross savings-it was apparent that the ‘budget'-if one could call it that; perhaps it is better to leave it at ‘budget response'-just does not add up. The coalition's proposed budget cuts do not add up. The $47 billion in cuts, which is what the opposition wanted to get its headline for and did get it for-turns out to be a mishmash of cuts to capital expenditure combined with cuts to the current account or cuts to particular expenditures. It was really an attempt to mislead the Australian public with a larger headline figure. Most of the measures that have been identified by the opposition will not have any impact on the underlying balance. They are a threat to future economic growth, they are a threat to Australian families and they are a threat to the economy, and the Australian people will be able to see, from the shambolic response of the opposition to our budget measures, just what a risk would be posed if those opposite were to na- reach the government benches.

7,Mr TRUSS,INSURANCE CONTRACTS,"Today, in this debate be on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate budget appropriation bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011, I want to talk about the third Swan budget-the budget for the 201011 financial year. I make that seemingly obvious point because, to date, the vast amount of commentary out of the Labor Party about this budget has been about what it thinks the budget will be in 2012-13. The government's spin has all been about the possibility of a surplus two years hence rather than the outcome of this budget, which will of course be second highest peacetime deficit this nation has ever seen, at $40.8 billion. That deficit will come straight after the highest peacetime deficit we have ever seen, $57.1 billion, which is expected this financial year. That will follow a deficit in the first Swan budget double any number our country has previously seen.",30

9,Mr TRUSS,INSURANCE CONTRACTS,"Given that none of the major forecasts from any of the first two of this Treasurer's budgets has turned out to be correct, it is a very brave Australian who would bet on Labor expectations about his third budget. Who would believe that they are likely to be accurate? Heaven forbid he gets a fifth attempt at putting down a budget! For example, in his first budget, we were told Labor would run a $21.7 billion surplus, not due to any hard work by the Rudd government; that surplus was built on the back of the coalition's strong economic management. Just 12 months later, in May last year, the Treasurer had cocked up things so badly that the surplus had turned into a severe deficit. Not that you would know-in his budget speech the cowardly Treasurer refused to even use the words ‘debt' or ‘deficit'. Indeed, it took a week to get the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to use the words ‘debt', ‘315' and ‘dollars' in the same sentence. The same trick was used for budget speech No. 3. Rather than hearing about the $40.8 billion deficit, we heard promises of the budget returning to surplus three years early. Earlier than what, and on whose calculations? On, of course, the Labor Party's calculations-on last year's forecasts, which all turned out to be embarrassingly wrong. Why should you believe them this timeparticularly when you look at the parameters of these forecasts? They rely on the best terms of trade that Australia has experienced for 60 years. The next three years are going to be better than our country has experienced for 60 years-once more, there is going to be above-trend growth offshore and low inflation in Australia! The reality is that this budget is a giant pea and thimble trick and the people being gulled are the Australian taxpayers. The entire credibility of the Treasurer's third budget hangs on numbers which, conveniently for the government, will not become clear or tested until after the next tion. Those numbers rely on the national economy, and indeed the international economy, following a linear path. In just a fortnight since the Treasurer handed down his budget, share markets have fallen heavily and the Australian dollar has plummeted by more than 10 per cent against the US dollar. That is because of the government's proposed great big new tax on the mining sector. Mining shares in particular have been pummelled by fear over Labor's proposed profits tax on resources. The Australian share market fell $95 billion last week. In the first week, something like $15 billion was wiped off the savings of Australian superannuation funds and mum-and-dad Australians. And yet these are the parameters upon which the government are now asking us to believe that they could return the budget to surplus in three years time. As a regional Australian, I guess I am used to being at the mercy of changing economic fortunes. For the seven million Australians who create much of our exports and our resulting prosperity, the ups and downs of the economy are very much a part of life. When the city feels higher interest rates, the country feels them much more. When jobs go, they often come from the regions first. Drought and natural disasters hit us harder too. The approach of the Nationals in coalition has always been to try and make life easier for those living in regional Australia to reward them for their hard work and to give them a helping hand when times are tough-and to make sure that all Australians are able to share in our nation's growth and prosperity. The federal budget has historically been a large part of that approach, but regional Australia have just seen the sort of budget that fails that very important test. The Treasurer used the word ‘regional' only once in his budget-night address, and the word ‘agriculture' did not appear at all. That says elecsomething about Labor's priorities. The massive debt, nearing $100 billionand above $220 billion on gross levels-will overhang us all for years to come. The interest bill alone will rise from $4.6 billion this year, through $6.5 billion the following year, to $8 billion. That is enough to complete the Pacific Highway in one year. It is enough to build the hospitals we need. It is enough to build the inland rail twice every year. We will not have the money we want to spend on hospitals, roads and infrastructure because future generations will be paying off this Labor government's debt-just as 12 years ago, when the coalition came to office, it had to spend the first half of its time, or probably more, paying off the debt of the previous Labor government. This debt will have a significant impact on all Australians. The government will be out there borrowing $100 million every day to pay for the reckless spending that is being authorised in this budget-$100 million a day. The government will be out there competing with homeowners wanting to borrow for their first home and small business people who need some assistance to carry on their businesses. They will have to compete with a government that is out in the market for $100 million every day to pay for the expenditure in a budget which is clearly out of control. The Treasurer's third budget increased taxes and charges by $26 billion. But what is at the centrepiece of this budget? Why do we need to spend another $26 billion? The first part of the centrepiece of this budget is to spend $1 billion to undo Labor's roof insulation debacle. There is another billion to manage the asylum seekers, who are coming into Australia as a result of Labor's weakened border protection. There is another billion dollars on the school computer cost overruns. There is another $530 million in extra spending to build a new health bureaucracy, after the federal government backed down to the states on hospital reform and in reality decided to build a bureaucracy rather than to provide better services to the people of Australia. And, of course, there is additional expenditure in a whole range of other areas to patch up the broken promises, to patch up the failed programs of the government. The budget provides no new money for road funding or regional development. Local government will actually get $1.21 billion less in 2010-11 because of the clawback of an advance payment and the termination of the Community Infrastructure Program. The clawback of the advance payment is because the government is trying to doctor the books to make it look as though they are actually moving towards a surplus when in fact all they have done is transferred expenditure from one year to another. The budget cuts another $81 million from Caring for Our Country, including $10.9 million from Landcare, as Labor continues its assault on this iconic community based program. In every budget Labor has cut expenditure on Landcare. A party that claims it is interested in the environment, on coming to office abolished the National Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and replaced them with Caring for our Country, but provided $1 billion less in funding. And it continues to take funding away from vital environmental programs. The regional food producers program is being cut by $5.5 million. Once again, there is no new funding for quarantine-and 250 Customs staff are to be sacked. This is another example of Labor's soft borders approach, which places the clean and green, disease-free status of our country at risk. Not only is Labor soft on our borders when it comes to defence and immigration; it is also soft on quarantine and soft on Customs. The budget provides no new funding for the Export Market Development Grants scheme, leaving the fund at least $30 million short in 2009-10 and $80 million short in 2010-11. Once more, the government has halved the funding for TradeStart, the network of offices which are there to assist particularly new exporters to get established in difficult export markets. The government has decided that, in spite of its mounting trade deficit, we no longer need to support our exports, so the assistance they have been relying upon to open up new markets and to get some advice locally has been viciously slashed in this budget. But, of course, that is not the end of it. The government has decided to spend another $10 billion on the bureaucracy. The Prime Minister's own department is going to be increased by 32 per cent. But there is a 20 per cent increase in staff for the Australian Public Service Commission to assist agencies with downsizing. So the Public Service Commission needs more staff to tell other offices how to get smaller! In reality, the of the bureaucracy is growing anyway. The facts are that this is a government that has no control over its expenditure and has been unable to deliver programs on time and within budget. One of the other astonishing moments in the delivery of the budget was the realisation that the Treasurer had slapped a $1 billion new tax on LPG, hitting something like half a million motorists who have converted their vehicles to LPG. We discovered this fact on the night the budget was delivered, but it seems as though it was not until a day later that the Treasurer knew that he had actually imposed this new tax and was able to confirm to the LPG industry that they would now be a part of the excise regime. So the Treasurer comes into this place, delivers a budget but does not even know what is in the documents himself! The big, other issue that overhangs this budget is the great big new tax on mining profits. Only a little while ago the government put on the couch in the back room its great big new tax-the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. That was a tax that would have destroyed Australian jobs, encouraged industry to locate offshore and increased the cost of living for all Australians. Now that scheme is dozing, Labor has invented another great big new tax on Australians. This is a tax that will also destroy Australian jobs, encourage industry to invest offshore and increase the cost of living for every Australian. This 40 per cent tax on mining profits will force the tax rate for the sector up to 57 per cent-yet the government claims that this big new super tax will actually increase investment in the mining sector! I have never heard of a tax yet that actually increased investment. The government is in fact putting a significant tax on cigarettes in this budget. They claim the reason for that is to reduce size smoking. But when they put an increased tax on the mining sector, that is supposed to make them bigger and stronger. That is clearly a nonsense. It is all about Labor's approach: spend big and tax even bigger. That is not a satisfactory way to run a country. The government's proposed mining tax is not fair. It not only penalises great big mining companies, as the government would lead you to believe, but small, battling mining operations as well. It is not a tax on super profits; it cuts in at the bond rate, five or six per cent-just over breakeven-and the government thinks that is a ‘super' profit. It is a super tax, but not just on super profits. The reality is that it affects not just big mine operators but small operators as well. And, of course it affects the quarrying industry-the industry that delivers the gravel for your roads, the stones for the landscaping in your front yard, the clay for the bricks in your house. All of these operations are to be caught up in Labor's great big new tax on the mining sector. They are also proposing, we are told, to justify this tax on the grounds that it will fund a $700 million Infrastructure Fund. That says a lot about the Labor government, which has actually drained dry the Infrastructure Fund that was left to them by the previous government. There is only $700 million left out of the $11 billion that was in place and heading to $40 billion. Labor did not just spend the interest, as was intended for those funds; it actually spent all the tal. So it spent all that money, with little to show for it, and now it wants a $700 million new Infrastructure Fund. This is a tax on the mining sector. We are told the mining sector needs to deliver more to regional communities, but there is no commitment by the government that this $700 million will be spent in regional communities. There is no guarantee that any of it will go back to the communities that are directly affected by mining. It looks to me like yet another great big Labor slush fund that is likely to appear in marginal electorate promise sheets and that the funding will in fact be directed away from mining communitiesthe country towns and regional communities that are contributing to our nation's growth and prosperity through the mining and the resource boom-and spent in capital city electorates where Labor is hanging on to a narrow margin. This is not an infrastructure fund at all. It is a Labor Party election slush fund, and you can count on it appearing regularly during the run-up to the election as Labor tries to hand out goodies to save its bacon in areas where it has clearly neglected the people. The Labor approach is to milk the cash cow until it is dry or burden the cow's owner so much that he ships his cow overseas to a greener pasture, and it is only the Australian Labor Party that cannot see the folly of this policy. Relative mining minor minnows like Papua New Guinea, Zambia and Mongolia have seen the error of their ways and dumped similar mining taxes. The Zambian tax lasted all of a year before President Rupiah Banda consigned it to history. He was blunt last year about the effect that the tax had upon his country: ‘We must ensure that we do not kill the goose that lays the golden egg. There is little point in taking a few million in tax if thousands of jobs are lost.' What is obvious to the Zambian Presicapident is apparently not obvious to our Treasurer and the Labor government-or does the government think that the tax is going to work differently in Australia from how it worked in New Guinea, Zambia or Mongolia? Does the government still hold onto this quite ridiculous notion that somehow or other higher taxes mean more investment and a more prosperous country? The reality is that countries like the United States, Canada, Brazil and China are all looking forward to this tax because they know that it will result in industries being transferred to their country, to jobs being created there. Countries that have much lower tax regimes than Australia are certain to be the big winners from this foolishness on the Labor Party's side. In government, let me make it clear, we will be adopting a different approach. We will rein in Labor's reckless spending, getting Australia back into surplus far quicker than Labor ever could. There is a question of trust and form. We have the form. We paid back Labor's debt of $96 billion left to us in 1996. Labor has form too. It has never got out of debt once it started down that tracknever in history. It took the Hawke-Keating governments just 13 years to rack up a $96 billion debt. It has taken the Rudd-Swan government just three years-three years for the same amount of debt. Under the coalition's approach, we will take pressure off increased interest rates and the cost of living with savings of $46.7 billion that have already been identified. That is made up of $24.7 billion from recurrent spending and $22 billion in one-off capital savings. Our plan is there. It is in print and it is costed. In contrast, Labor in opposition could announce only $3 billion worth of savings ahead of the 2007 election, and then another $7 billion on the eve of election day. A predecessor of the Treasurer once boasted the title ‘The world's best Treasurer'-the unlamented Paul Keating. This current Treasurer, Wayne Swan, is the world's worse Treasurer. He has been able to turn a record surplus into a record deficit in just a few months. He has been able to chalk up unprecedented debt at unprecedented speed, and he has been able to turn a prosperous country that pays its own way into a debtor nation that will be mortgaging the future of generations. That is his legacy. is the legacy of this budget. He cannot be trusted with another one.",30
10,Ms KING,INSURANCE CONTRACTS,"I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20102011 and cognate budget appropriation bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011. I cannot help but comment on the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Wide Bay, in this place. I find it passing strange that the member for Wide Bay, in his speech, decided to criticise the government for not continuing with the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, which was a one-off fund as part of the economic stimulus package which has put $1 billion into the hands of local government but which has now got even more money out of it as a result of the spend they have done on local communities. You cannot, on the one hand, claim that somehow that is a cut in the budget because a project fund that was about to finish has finished and, on the other, I remind the member for Wide Bay, vote against it. There would not have been any fund in existence at all had you been in government. It is a ridiculous proposition. It is also great to see the member for Wide Bay, once again, standing up for the powerful vested interests in the mining industry over those of ordinary working Australians. I support these bills because they represent a responsible budget that strengthens our economy. It is important for us to consider this budget in the context of previous budgets. Back in May 2007, I stood up in this House and debated the Howard government's 2007-08 budget bills. The greatest failing of that final budget of the Howard government was that it did not address capacity constraints in the Australian economy. It failed to invest in infrastructure, skills, education and health. It failed, across the That board, to lay down the foundation of a nation's future economic growth. The Howard government was happy to ride on the tails of the mining boom, but it was not happy to do the hard yards that were needed to invest in our economy's future. For too long, the Howard government instead used budgets to buy individual votes to win elections for short-term gain and, although this proved successful for a long period of time for Howard and to some extent for the now Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, it did not prove successful for the future growth of the Australian economy and ultimately for the future prospects of the Australian people. On coming to office, the Prime Minister and members of the Rudd government made a conscious decision to set up our nation for the future. We said to the Australian people that we wanted to work to invest in the longer term-not just the current election cycle but five, 10 or 20 years ahead. We spoke of the need for investment in infrastructure, skills, training and education. We committed to stop the buck-passing in health by reforming our nation's health system. In February 2009 I spoke in parliament in the face of a global financial crisis that was set to wreak havoc on local communities, local economies and economies across the globe. I find it extraordinary when, in talking and debating about the budget, members of the opposition seem to think that the global financial crisis just did not happen or that somehow, as a result of some strange fluke of fate, Australia has managed to survive the worse excesses of the global crisis and that that somehow has happened completely by accident. The Rudd government and the Australian people were faced with tackling this global financial crisis head-on, and members of this side of the House acted decisively. At that point in time we had a choice: to deliver strong, unprecedented action to combat the nation's worse global financial crisis in 70 years or not to act and to let the market pave the way. Let me make this point very clear: those members opposite did not want to act. They opposed our economic stimulus. Members on our side decided to act by implementing a measured and well-targeted stimulus package. Instead of looking at the global financial crisis as an absolute negative, the Rudd government used it as a tool to invest in the long-term sustainability of our nation. We used it, on the one hand, to stimulate the economy by supporting jobs and, on the other hand, to invest in areas that the former Howard government had forgottenareas like infrastructure, housing, education, road and rail and local community infrastructure. The result is that Australia has outperformed other advanced economies. While advanced economies collectively contracted by 3.2 per cent, the Australian economy grew by 1.4 per cent. While advanced economies were faced with rapid job losses, 225,000 Australian people found work. Without our stimulus, the Australian economy would have fallen into recession, with tens of thousands of jobs lost. Our national unemployment rate is the second lowest in comparison to other advanced economies. The results speak for themselves. These results reflect the hard work of the Australian people, the resilience of the Australian economy and the decisive action the government took in implementing its economic stimulus package. These results did not occur by accident. The Liberals' do-nothing approach would have been a disaster for this country. The Leader of the Opposition is quick to attempt to make light of our economic situation. At the time of the implementation of our stimulus measures, the coalition unleashed another of their scare campaigns. They failed to recognise that a global financial crisis was apparent, they failed to recognise the fall in tax receipts and its impact on the budget bottom line and they failed to support our direct action through stimulus measures. Without the stimulus, we would have lost thousands of jobs in this country. Without stimulus, we would have seen a contraction in our economy last year of 0.7 per cent, compared to the actual growth of 1.4 per cent. They are the facts. This message seems to fall on deaf ears with those opposite, who claim to be the extraordinary economic managers of our time. It falls on deaf ears because those opposite do not want to hear our nation's good news story when it comes to how we have survived the global financial crisis. The Rudd government has a proud story to tell when it comes to economic management. The 2010-11 budget continues this proud story. The budget reflects the success of our policy decisions over the last 18 months. The budget reflects the strong economic position we now find ourselves in, and it builds on these successes. The successes of the Australian economy through the global financial crisis mean that we now have a strong opportunity to tackle the nation's long-term needs in skills, training, health, education and infrastructure. This budget delivers on those long-term objectives. The budget is building on hard work throughout the global financial crisis to deliver for the future. Through this budget, we will be back in the black in three years, three years ahead of schedule and ahead of every major advanced economy. Through this budget, we build on our hard work by delivering a stable budget that brings us back to surplus three years early. This government is well aware of the impact of our ageing population combined with the current cost pressures for families in our health system. The government has put health and hospitals at the forefront of our agenda, and this budget delivers on that commitment to our national health reform. Through the budget, we have invested a further $2.2 billion into the health system, and this brings the total new investment in health from this government to $7.3 billion over five years. Our $2.2 billion package further delivers for our National Health and Hospitals Network. This government has worked hard to deliver that network. Health reform is also a priority area for me personally, and I am very proud of what we are achieving in this field in the budget. Of this $2.2 billion in the health reform package, we have set aside some $417 million to improve after-hours access to GP and primary care services. Access to GPs is vital to Australian families and is something that has not been adequately addressed in the past. We have also invested a further $355 million to deliver 23 new GP superclinics and 425 GP and primary healthcare clinics across Australia. Already, in my own electorate, the Ballan GP Super Clinic is up and running. It was opened back in September last year and it was the first in Australia. The clinic has proven vital to the flourishing community of Ballan; in fact, I think it will perhaps drive some of the population growth of Ballan as well. Over recent times, the local health tem was struggling to meet demand, and this investment by the Rudd government has gone a long way to improve local health services. The clinic accommodates GPs-some of them new GPs who come into the areapractice nurses, visiting specialists and a range of allied health services. They include physiotherapy, dietetics, nutrition, podiatry, mental health services, pathology and chronic disease management services. There is also a psychologist who operates out of the facility. For the first time this local community has a dental service. The superclinic in Ballan is a great example of what we can do when we work with local communities in enhancing our health system and of what we seek to achieve with our $355 million investment to have a further 23 GP superclinics across the country. I know that members on this side of the House, who know the enormous benefits of these clinics in our communities, as I do, are all working pretty hard to try to get one of those clinics in their own electorates. It is a shame that members of the opposition wish to cut the program. A further $523 million has been allocated to invest in training and support for nurses. These investments will see nurses better supported in GP clinics and there will be training and education incentive payments for nurses and personal care workers in aged care, and the first ever rural-local scheme for nurses. The Rudd government plans to deliver on individual electronic health records. This $467 million reform to our health system will benefit patients and benefit our health system as a whole. I find it amazing that the Leader of the Opposition and former minister for health, who promoted electronic health records and who had it as part of his policy platform, said in his budget-in-reply speech that he will axe this important initiasys- tive. Coalition members have struggled to find support for cutting e-health initiatives among all of the major stakeholders across the country. The government also announced an increase to the tobacco excise of 25 per cent. This came into effect on 30 April 2010. This excise increase provides not only an incentive for current smokers to quit but an effective measure to prevent young people from taking up smoking in the first place. This increase in the tobacco excise will be reinvested back into our health and hospital system-a total of $5 billion over five years. While I am still on the topic of health and hospital reform, I would also like to put on the parliamentary record the Rudd government's recent announcement to fund the new $55 million cancer centre for Ballarat in conjunction with the state Victorian Labor government. I spoke in parliament back in February this year about the importance of the cancer centre for Ballarat and the surrounding region. In April, it was my pleasure to announce-along with Minister Roxon and the state minister for health, Minister Andrews-that the Rudd government would fund the Ballarat regional integrated cancer centre. This announcement reflects the hard work of my local community and will allow for two linear accelerators, the relocation of one linear accelerator from St John of God Hospital, four radiotherapies bunkers, 16 chemotherapy chairs, a CT scanner and a wellness centre as well. This is yet another example of the government's efforts to reform our health and hospital system. Through this budget, we have also worked hard to alleviate the cost-of-living pressures that are facing many Australians. The announcement of tax cuts in this year's budget was our third round of cuts in as many years. I am pleased to have seen the hard work of the Australian people, particularly in this last year, being reflected in the 2010-11 budget by these tax cuts. These tax cuts, which were an election promise, have been delivered despite the economic circumstances in which we have found ourselves. The Australian people and those across the electorate of Ballarat have worked hard to get through the global financial crisis. These tax cuts are welcome news to those families. To give you a slight snapshot, the cuts mean that a person earning $20,000 will pay $750 less in income tax in 2010-11, a worker earning $50,000 will pay $1,750 less in income tax in 2010-11 and a worker earning $80,000 will pay $1,500 less over the next financial year. They are significant savings for families. Our tax cuts are also welcome news to low-income and part-time workers. We have lifted the low-income tax offset to $1,500 to provide an effective tax-free threshold of $16,000. On top of the tax cuts, we are also working to make tax time simpler for families with our reforms to the tax system. From 1 July 2012, taxpayers will have the option to choose a standard deduction of $500 instead of claiming work related expenses. This will increase to $1,000 by 1 July 2013. This takes the hassle out of tax time for many families. Families will not have to go rummaging for receipts come tax time, hopefully saving some precious family time as well. One of the things that I have often spoken about since being elected is the importance of investment in skills and infrastructure. This budget invests significantly in both of these. We have invested some $661 million to assist people enhance their qualifications by taking up one of the 40,000 additional training place and 22,500 new apprentices as part of our Apprentice Kickstart program. I have spoken to many of the young people across the electorate that have been involved in the Apprentice Kickstart program and it is great to see the investment by this government in young people's skills through this program continuing. The other day I was in Bacchus Marsh with Parliamentary Secretary Clare. We spoke with a number of apprentices at the Amber Hair Studio. The take-up of apprentices across the Moorabool Shire has increased by 45 per cent compared to the previous year, with 42 local apprentices getting started between December 2009 and February 2010. The apprentices and their employers who spoke to Parliamentary Secretary Clare and me are delighted by the program. There has been a boost in apprenticeship numbers across other areas of my electorate, with a 77 per cent increase across the City Ballarat, and an in increase in Hepburn Shire from five apprentices a year to 20 apprentices in 2009-2010. This is an additional 15 young people, who would not have got the opportunity otherwise, who now have their pathway set for a future career. Our announcement means that until 12 November businesses that employ fewer than 200 people can benefit from a $3,350 bonus payment in addition to the $1,500 commencement initiative if they take on a school leaver in a traditional trade apprenticeship. The Rudd government is absolutely determined to skill up people in my region, and that is great news for local communities. In addition to our skills program, we have also worked hard to invest in our long-term economic growth through infrastructure investment. Project after project across my electorate is well underway to set up our cal economy for the future. Through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program local governments have rolled out many projects that are benefiting local communities. Projects under round 1I have all been delivered and round 2 projects are well underway. Our funding through the Blackspots Program and Roads to Recovery has also ensured that the local governments have had the funded needed to deliver on local road projects. Not only have we seen a vast improvement in local roads-especially in terms of safety-but this has also contributed to local jobs growth. This budget further invests in nationbuilding projects in the Ballarat electorate. They include the Western Highway realignment of Anthonys Cutting, which the Prime Minister and I had the pleasure of visiting the other month for the sod turning; and the Western Highway duplication from Ballarat to Stawell, which the Victorian Premier, John Brumby, and I visited the other month also. of Both nation-building projects are incredibly important to my district. They are both projects that are investing in the long-term growth of communities like Ballarat across Western Victoria. Residents of the Ballarat electorate are already experiencing the benefits of the Deer Park bypass, which I lobbied tirelessly for. Once these two new projects have been completed, the western region of Victoria will have a first-rate highway that extends all the way from Melbourne through to the South Australian border. These projects are setting up Ballarat and the surrounding region for the future. They create jobs in the short term and provide safe and reliable road infrastructure in the longer term. The budget builds further on our infrastructure investment through the new $5.6 billion infrastructure fund. The fund will commence in 2012lo- 13 and will place infrastructure funding at the forefront of Commonwealth spending. We are doing this because we know that investment in infrastructure is one of the most important elements of a productive economy. I would also like to discuss one of the core challenges faced by not only Australia but other nations, and that is climate change. We are boosting, through this budget, our investment in a new Renewable Energy Future Fund. This reflects our strong commitment to increase the renewable energy target by 20 per cent by 2020. A $652 million investment over four years forms part of our $6.1 billion clean energy initiative. We are using this funding to increase the take-up by business and households of energy efficiency measures. Aside from our new investment through the Renewable Energy Future Fund, the Rudd government is committed to continue our efforts internationally to form agreement with other countries about future action on climate change and on what we do domestically. There are a number of differences between the Rudd government and the coalition. First, the Rudd government decided to take decisive action to tackle the global nancial crisis. Those opposite did not. Second, our appropriations since we were elected have recognised the strong need to invest in our long-term future-in the National Broadband Network; skills and training; local community infrastructure; roads and ports; education; and national health form. Those opposite have opposed all of these measures. Third, in the wake of a prospective global recession, we made the most of an opportunity to invest in reducing our economy's capacity constraints. Those opposite missed opportunities during the initial mining boom. Fourth, our 2010-11 budget continues our sound economic management and targeted investment. The alternative government reflects the worse economic management team in the history of the Liberal Party of Australia. Finally, our actions have been supported by key stakeholdersfrom Treasury to the Reserve Bank, business and community groups and international bodies-and admired by other countries. The alternative from those opposite has been supported by nobody. I am proud of this government's strong economic management. The budget reflects our direct action to support jobs and to bring us back to surplus early. The budget delivers a new Renewable Energy Future Fund; tax cuts and a reduction in red tape for small business; investment in health and hospitals; investment in skills, training and infrastructure; better superannuation, tax breaks on interest and a boost to national savings; a standard deduction to make tax time easier; more money to protect our troops and our borders; and a return to surplus in three years-three years ahead of schedule. The budget takes advantage of our strong economic position and sets up our nation for the future. I commend the bills to the House.",35
11,Mr ROBB,INSURANCE CONTRACTS,"I rise fi- to comment on the budget brought down nearly two weeks ago in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related bills. The fact of the matter is that this government inherited perhaps the strongest economy in the Western World. It inherited an economy that had had 16 years of economic growth. It inre- herited an economy with zero government debt and close to $50 billion in reserve. It inherited an economy with unemployment at four per cent-almost a historic low. This provided the basis to deal with the unexpected global financial crisis. Every other country of any consequence-the developed countries, at least-went into the global financial crisis with significant government debt, no reserves and much higher unemployment. And we have seen the outcome. It is no different from the situation at a family level in the suburbs: if one individual and his family have no mortgage, $80,000 or $90,000 in the bank and a job, while their neighbour has a $450,000 mortgage and no money in the bank, who is going to get through a recession more satisfactorily, more effectively? It is common sense. The family that has no debt and has sufficient reserves will be able to position itself, with a prudent approach to budgeting and all the rest, to get comfortably through a downturn, while the neighbour may well end up selling their house at a fire-sale price and moving into rented accommodation and experiencing all the stress that goes with it. It is exactly the same for the economy on a nationwide level. Our country was in exceptional shape to deal with what was a major recession, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Yet this government, in the space of 2½ years, has fundamentally undermined the great resilience that characterised this economy. If there is a double-dip recession around the world, our economy will be far more vulnerable to what might happen in the weeks or months ahead. This budget has done absolutely nothing to correct this situation. There are no tough decisions in this budget. This is a coward's budget. It is the budget of people who live by the politics of the day and have no long-term vision. Where will the Prime Minister take this economy over the next three to six years if given the opportunity? You cannot answer that question. You cannot answer it from what he has done. The only conclusion you can reach is that we will continue to go backwards as a country-in terms of the resilience of our economy, the great drivers of growth in our economy-because this Prime Minister, his Treasurer and other senior colleagues have taken no tough decisions. They have been all talk and no action. There have been hundreds of inquiries and there have been major expectations built up. This Prime Minister is no different from the handyman we all know who starts hundreds of jobs and finishes none of them. He has got no capacity to implement projects. This government is characterised by some of the most wasteful and mismanaged projects in the country's history. The pink batts program has wasted billions of dollars. The Building the Education Revolution, the school halls program, has wasted billions and billions of dollars. This government stands condemned for the way in which it has mishandled public moneys but more particularly for the way in which it has panicked and responded over the last 2½ years to the challenges that have been thrown up for this economy. It has overspent in a massive way and this budget does absolutely nothing to address that issue. This third budget brought down by the Treasurer is a political document, make no mistake about that. It is a political document and is not a document designed to address the challenges and opportunities faced by this country. It is a budget which is not believable. It is a house of cards. It is based on a ‘trust me' approach, heroic assumptions and great big new taxes. It makes no allowance for any eventuality that might occur overseas. It makes no allowance for the impact of some of these great big new taxes on the ability of some of our stronger sectors to respond, to keep growing and to contribute to the resilience that they have displayed over such a long period of time. Of course the thing that we do know about this budget, one of the few things of any certainty, is that the spending keeps going. It is reckless spending and an insatiable desire to keep spending money to solve problems. The only way in which this Prime Minister and his Treasurer feel that issues can be addressed is to throw more money at them. It is a tax-andspend budget-tax, borrow and spend. That marks the sort of sorry history of this shortterm government. The government will give us four more years of deficit, all to combat one quarter of negative growth in 2008. The response to that one quarter of negative growth has been to borrow, borrow and borrow again and to spend, spend and spend; so much so that the economy now is not in balance. The reckless spending, which this budget continues, has been the reason we have now got the highest interest rates in the Western world. It is the reason so many families across this country are now finding it extraordinarily difficult to meet their cost of living expenses and are finding it difficult to pay their power bills. Power has gone up 18 to 22 per cent across the nation over the last 12 months, petrol prices have gone up over six per cent over the last 12 months, rates are going through the roof in many areas and fruit and vegetable costs have been above the CPI. Many, many areas of our everyday expenses have well exceeded the CPI, sometimes two, three and four times as high. Yet this government, which came to office making very strong and heartfelt promises about what they would do to the cost of living and how they would deal with the challenges people face every day to meet their budget so as to enable people to live within their means and have some peace of mind, have certainly not shown any of that sort of approach. By example, the government have not lived within their means and this budget does nothing to curtail the reckless spending to bring this government and their bureaucracy back onto course which would see our record debt paid off in due course. The government will give us four years of deficit. The deficit this year of $57 billion will be the biggest deficit in Australia's peacetime history. You heard very little mention of what had happened with the current year we are in. They did not want to refer to this $57 billion because it is the highest cit in our history by a country mile. Also what they did not want to say was that much of that $57 billion, something well in excess of $7 billion, was spent and not programmed in last year's budget. They have been spending like drunken sailors with the intent of burying that spending in the $57 billion deficit this year and taking some load off next year's deficit. It is a political budget. They plan to spend and spend in some attempt to misrepresent the figures and their record of spending. Next year, of course, we are told we will have the second biggest deficit in our history of $40.8 billion. We will believe that when we see it. It is in all likelihood, by the way in which this government are responding, to go higher and higher. We also have not only deficit record levels but a level of net debt of $93 billion, equal to that left by the Keating government. On top of that, of course, they have foreshadowed that they will be borrowing an extra $18 billion in the next four years to fund their national broadband project; the white elephant which will materialise in seven or eight years' time and, at best, give a return of the bond rate. It is a white elephant that they then expect to sell to somebody with a return at the bond rate. This will be a case of nationalising telecommunications. No other country in the world is heading in the direction to renationalise telecommunications but, of course, this government will. It is something in the order of $110 billion in the next three or four years, then they will add another $8 billion to $15 billion of borrowing to complete that national broadband project. This is a reckless government. This is a government that thinks you can borrow and spend and that someone else can fix up the problem. The government continues to borrow $100 million a day. It has done so for a year and it will do so for the next two years defito meet the forecasts embodied within this budget. It will borrow $100 million a day for this reckless spending. That is every week. Every week, this government is borrowing the equivalent of a world-class new hospital. A world-class new hospital could be built each week with that borrowed money. This is what we are accumulating. The improvement to the budget bottom line is entirely due to what the government term ‘parameter changes': stronger economic growth in Australia, with predictions of very high sustained growth, and above-trend growth offshore. They are basing this budget over the next four years on the highest terms of trade in 60 years and they are basing it on $17 billion in new taxes. Of course, another of the accounting tricks is that they classify the revenue from new taxes as savings. It is all spin-it is a disingenuous way of presenting the nation's books and accounts. It is based on unrealistic assumptions. People can have absolutely no confidence in the quality of the forecasts, in the nature of the outcome or in the suggestion that the government will at the end of three or four years produce a wafer-thin surplus. This budget does not rely on responsible economic management. There is not a hard decision in this budget to cut the reckless wasteful government spending. All the cuts in expenditure were targeted in specific areas such as pharmaceuticals, as opposed to broad based programs, with close to 80 per cent of the so-called savings being achieved between 2012-13 and 2013-14. All of this is backended and off to the never-never, with no prospect of this government demonstrating any discipline. We might have expected a lower spending budget, as there is no longer a need for stimulus to counter the global financial crisis and because of the pick-up in commodity prices in China and other economies and the fact that countries are now in many cases streaming out of recession. But what do we find? Over and above what the government forecast last year in the budget for spending this coming year, the year after that and the year after that, we see $26 billion of excess spending. Indeed, there was no winding back of previously allocated stimulus spending despite the very different economic circumstances. Further delays will occur in the school halls program, which will mean that $500 million of stimulus will not be spent until 2011-12, at least three years after the global financial crisis. This is where the increased spending is now starting to compete heavily with small business trying to access finance. It is starting to compete for all other forms of borrowing by big business, small business and mortgage holders. As a consequence, it is pushing up interest rates. We have now had six interest rate increases in a row. Some of the thousands of young couples who were encouraged last year to take out a mortgage, buy a home and get on with it are this year facing between $4,000 and $5,000 more in mortgage repayments than they expected last year. That is $5,000 they will have to find after tax-they will have to earn an extra $7,000 or $8,000 between them. Many of and these young couples will be facing very severe financial problems at present. This budget is full of accounting tricks. It is full of new taxes and more wasteful spending, including $1 billion to correct the policy failures with boat people, $1 billion to fix up the pink batts program and a $4 billion a year blow-out in government debt interest rates. The government has allocated $536 million, over half a billion dollars, for new health bureaucracies as part of its health reform. This government promised in its health reform not to have any increase in the bureaucracy, yet it has budgeted for an extra half a billion dollars for new health bureaucracies as part of its so-called reform. At the last election the government promised 36 GP superclinics; of course, only two are fully operational. This is typical-all talk, no action. But, on top of that, this budget says the government will deliver another 23 superclinics, additional to the 36 of which only two have been delivered. How can anyone possibly have any confidence in the promises made by the government? The core beliefs and values of the government have evaporated over the last few months. Their support for things like the emissions trading scheme went out the window. This was a clever accounting trick to ensure that the $10 billion that would have gone to the expenditure line did not occur and therefore the ratio of expenditure to GDP was able to stay within the parameters that they had set. It is all artificially created. The government dumped the ETS so that they could create an artificial ratio of expenditure to GDP. This is a political document; this is not a policy document. They are giving $10 million grants to the Trade Union Education Foundation. They are giving an additional $12 million to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-that is another 14 per cent increase. The government said they would take a meataxe to the Public Service and yet 20,000 new public servant positions have been created in the space of 2¾ years. The budget surplus relies solely on a very big new tax on the growth engine of this economy. The sector that helped pull this country through the global financial crisis, the resources sector, will now face a massive retrospective tax which will see our resource sector with 58 per cent effective tax on its operations. By comparison, the nearest to Australia will be the United States at 40 per cent-an 18 per cent greater tax load. It will put in jeopardy, and it has already put in jeopardy and prevented, work to develop $310 billion of new projects. This budget is a political document. It is a confirmation of tax-and-spend approach of this government. This government is not fit to govern. The only way to turn around our great debt and deficit is to change the government. (Time expired)",40
12,Ms RISHWORTH,INSURANCE CONTRACTS,"I am very pleased to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate bills. The budget that the Treasurer presented to this House was a budget for its time. The budget before us is a responsible budget, a budget that is in the national interest. The government acknowledges that families still need help, but the budget puts a priority on strengthening the economy and securing sustainable growth into the future. This budget is indicative of the government's response to the global financial crisis, a crisis that Australia avoided due to both the responsible, decisive fiscal policy of the Rudd Labor government and the determination of the Australian people who pulled together to keep people in jobs. This budget builds on the strong foundation developed by the government in previous budgets. It converts Australia's success during the global recession into a stronger, more secure economy for working families. It will have peak debt, bringing the budget back into the black in three years. This is three years earlier than expected and ahead of every major advanced economy. One cannot and should not underestimate this achievement. Decisive action now, as also occurred during the global financial crisis, will ensure the future prosperity of Australia and secure the economy and the financial security of the Australian people, including many families in my electorate of Kingston. The strong position of the nation's economy ensures that the people of the southern suburbs of Adelaide will be better positioned the than people in many other places around the developed world to take advantage of the opportunities ahead. The Rudd Labor government believes in the fortitude and ability of the Australian people, and this budget represents its commitment to these people by ensuring responsible economic management, halving peak debt and securing future growth. Those opposite have opposed the government's action to support jobs during the global financial crisis, and there is no doubt that they will now oppose its actions to keep the government finances strong. But this budget does have significant things for the people in my electorate, and the historic health and hospital reform is especially significant to people in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. The residents of southern Adelaide deserve to live in a community where they are confident about the provision of health services to their loved ones. The Rudd government's ongoing commitment to health will go a long way towards achieving this goal. The government's planned reform represents the most significant reform to Australia's health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare. The government is investing $7.3 billion over five years, and this is an enormous commitment to our health and hospital system. The 2010-11 budget delivers a $2.2 billion package investting ing in the National Health and Hospitals Network over four years. This funding will have a genuinely positive impact on health providers within my electorate. Hospitals such as Flinders Medical Centre and Noarlunga Hospital will be able to provide a better level of care for the people in our local area. This spending is vital to improving the healthcare system for all Australians vital to my local constituents. This budget reflects the Rudd government's commitment to health reform and its ongoing commitment to health within Australia. The $417 million Medicare Locals program is a commitment to ensure that it will be easier for people in Kingston and around the country to see a doctor at any time, day or night. This investment will improve after-hours access to GP and primary care services. This is a significant investment in the ongoing health and well-being of the elderly, parents and young people in my electorate, ensuring that all Australians have access to high-quality and affordable afterhours services. This builds on the Rudd government's commitment to making sure that after-hours GP services are provided. In my electorate alone, a number of different grants have already been announced to ensure that GP services are available after hours. Services are already being made available in Morphettville, Huntfield Heights, Sheidow Park, Aldinga and Seaford. The further improvements to after-hours services will be widely welcomed in my local area, because people know that getting to see a GP can be difficult at the best of times. The opposition-and, indeed, the opposition leader-have indicated that they do not believe that there is a problem out there in the provision of GP services. My message to the opposition leader is that in outer metropolitan Adelaide there is a problem with getto see a GP. I hear regularly from my constituents that there is a shortage. They often wait up to three or four weeks just to get an appointment with a GP. It is disappointing that the opposition leader, who is a former Minister for Health and Ageing, refuses to acknowledge that there is a real crisis in accessing medical services and that the private sector has not filled all the gaps in and also outer metropolitan Adelaide. The budget also outlines the government's commitment to provide up to $950 million to increase the capacity of emergency departments and improve the time line for treatment. This has also been widely welcomed by my constituents in Kingston. The Rudd government is committed to a four-hour emergency department target. This will require patients to be admitted and then either referred or treated and discharged within four hours. This is an achievable goal, and we believe that Australians ought to be able to see a doctor wherever and whenever they need one. This will ensure that every Australian has access to the advice they deserve. As the Minister for Health and Ageing has regularly noted, nurses are the cornerstone of any effective health system. The Rudd government acknowledges the vital role that these individuals play in the provision of health care to real working Australians and is therefore committed to investing $535 million for additional training and support to Australian nurses. Nurses play a critical role in our health system, and the Rudd government is dedicated to ongoing support of these individuals. I draw the attention of the House to the controversial issue the opposition is opposing-that is, the issue of GP superclinics. GP superclinics are an effective and necessary addition to the health field within Australia. The government has dedicated $355 million over three years to building more of these clinics across the country. We are now seeing clinics being developed in my electorate of Kingston in the form of the Noarlunga GP Super Clinic, due to be completed this year. This will provide an important service by incorporating doctors and other allied health professionals in one location. Such clinics take the pressure off the hospital system, and we have seen this in evidence with the state government provided GP Plus services. Since becoming operational, the one in Aldinga in my electorate has seen a decrease of 13 per cent in presentations to the accident and emergency clinic, with residents in Aldinga instead presenting at the GP Plus centre.",44

18,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Following last week's announcement by Fortescue Metals that it has placed two projects on hold worth $17½ billion in investment and up to 30,000 jobs, I refer the Prime Minister to today's announcement by the head of Rio Tinto, Mr Tom Albanese, that all Rio Tinto's Australian expansion plans have been put on hold, that capital would shift to other nations like Canada and that the Rudd government's proposed great big new tax on mining was Rio Tinto's top sovereign risk issue on a global basis. I ask the Prime Minister: how much damage will the Australian economy suffer before the Prime Minister backs down on his great big new tax on mining?",46
19,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I draw his attention to the sort of debate which occurred in this place, and more broadly, when we brought in the petroleum rent resource tax in the mid-1980s. There were loud threats across the nation and from abroad about the impact on the Australian offshore mining industry at that time through the introduction of the tax. That tax was a tax on profits. The proposed RSPT is a tax on profits. Every economic analyst concludes that a tax on profits is a more efficient tax than a tax on volumes. The second point that the Leader of the Opposition asked was about, I think, a reference to Fortescue Metals. Notice was given to the ASX by Fortescue last Wednesday noting that the projects in question had been placed on hold. I note the two paragraphs in the Australian newspaper on 20 May which said: Mr Forrest's move to delay the Solomon project was last night labelled a “political statement” more than a genuine setback to the company's plans. It went on to say: Credit Suisse analyst Nathan Littlewood noted Fortescue had not abandoned its Solomon feasibility study due for completion later this year, by which time a federal election would have been held … I also draw attention to recent statements which have been made by Mr Forrest concerning China and the response which has been forthcoming on that as well. As the Leader of the Opposition will know, there will be many, many statements by many, many companies, and all of them may have this in common: they do not want to pay more tax. This government believes that the time has come for tax reform which delivers a fair return for all Australians, a fair return for those who depend on this tax for investing in our future infrastructure, a fair return from this tax to support super for working families and a fair return from this tax in order to bring down the taxation burden for Australian business. This reform, as the Leader of the Opposition knows full well, has been projected by independent modelling to bring about an overall increase in mining activity of 5.5 per cent as well as bringing about other deep reforms in the tax system, and incentives and global competitiveness to the Australian economy at large. Budget",46
20,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime minister, why is tax reform in Australia's long term interest? How has the government's reform of the resources taxation system been received?",47
21,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Braddon for his question. In fact, we were in his electorate only last week at a community cabinet meeting where we heard loud and clear from a number of local businesses how they appreciate an Australian government that gets out there in support of local business to protect jobs in local communities, as we have been doing throughout the global financial crisis and, with reforms to the economy, how we will continue to do so into the future as well. I remember that we spent some time with a number of businesses in the honourable member's electorate. Penguin Composites comes to mind, a company which has benefited from a co-investment with the Australian government in the expansion of its operations. The member for Braddon asked a question about tax reform and where it fits within the overall priorities of the government, and responses to it. The first responsibility of government is to keep the Australian economy strong. That is what this government is committed to. We have done so by keeping Australia out of recession. We have done so also through a budget which halves our net peak debt and brings the budget back to surplus in three years time-three years ahead of time. Furthermore, the strength of the economy in the future depends on the continued reform of our economy-reforms in productivity, reforms in workforce participation, and reforms also in regulation and in tax. On the question of tax, if the opposition blocks this tax reform, Australia will look back in 10 years time and see that another opportunity to strengthen our economy and invest in our competitiveness in the future was passed up. No. 1, with this tax reform, we are aiming at boosting the overall national competitiveness of Australia. We are doing that by bringing down the company tax rate by two percentage pointsMr Abbott-How are you going to",47
22,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition interjects, ‘How are you going to do that?' Not by increasing the company tax rate, as he is planning to do. it down two percentage points; you are taking it up two percentage points. There is a big difference. Secondly, we are also boosting the competitiveness of the Australian economy by investing in infrastructure. That is necessary in order to underpin long-term productivity growth. We are investing also in the tax competitiveness of our small business sector. We will lose an opportunity to deliver a fair share for all Australians if the opposition blocks this legislation. If the Leader of the Opposition blocks this RSPT, he will be denying workers an increase in super from nine per cent to 12 per cent. He will be denying a worker on about average earnings an additional $108,000 a year. He will be denying working Australians better super on their retirement. He will be denying all those Australian companies a two percentage point tax cut. He will be denying Australian small business a $5,000 tax break. He will also be denying some 6.4 million Australian taxpayers a radical opportunity to simplify their tax arrangements and to throw the shoebox away, if they so choose, when it comes to tax time. That is what is at stake with these reforms. I was asked by the member for Braddon about other people's comments on these reforms and the need to tax the mining sector more. It seems that the Leader of the Opposition alone in this country believes that our mining sector is currently paying enough tax. His state political colleague recently said the following: The mining companies are aware of it and some of them have expressed their views. I have to say that a few people who work around the mining industry have come to me over the summer and said, ‘By the way, Colin, the mining companies are getting away with murder; they're not paying enough.' So says Colin Barnett, the Liberal Premier of We are bringing Western Australia. We go to Don Voelte, a leading representative of the mining industry in Western Australia, who said this: Your original question was, ‘Can the miners give a little bit more?' In talking to the big miners and the mid-cap miners, I have not heard that they are not willing to negotiate a different tax and a higher tax back. They want to give a fair share back to the Australian citizens. Look at what Roger Corbett has had to say on the matter of tax reform. He said the following: These are resources owned by Australians and Australians should extract from those resources the best possible advantage that they can. In principle I support a resources tax. I support a taxing regime that allows redistribution and I support a taxing regime that retains some of the value of this asset that is going to be consumed to the point where there is nothing left so that they can have an asset base for the future. So said Mr Corbett, whom the previous government appointed to the Reserve Bank board. So there you have it: the WA Liberal Premier says that the mining industry-in his words, not mine-is getting away with murder. Don Voelte from Woodside says that it is entirely appropriate for mining companies to be paying more. Roger Corbett of the Reserve Bank, a leading Australian businessman, says that in-principle support for a resources rent tax is appropriate. There is only one person in this parliament who believes that our mining industry is paying enough, and that is the Leader of the Opposition.",48

The honourable member cannot recall the Gorgon announcement made recently. Where has he been for the last 25 years? He was amazingly silent as they took receipts in from the PRRT, and now they seek, opportunistically, to change their line. Budget",49
27,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. What are respected economists saying about the role of the resource super profits tax in strengthening our economy and ensuring Australians get a fairer share?,49
28,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his very important question. There is growing support for the resource super profits tax. Everybody on this side of the House recognises that there is a rolledgold case for more tax to be paid. But you never hear those on that side of the House even whisper about the need for the Australian people to get a fairer share of the bounty of this country. The Leader of the Opposition was sitting in his office and all the mining companies came in. At that stage he did not have a word to say about it. They told him what to say, and you have seen the outcome here today. The opposition are simply doing what they have been told to by the mining companies. There is going to be a lot of loud noise made by those who are opposed to this tax, by those who are opposed to Australians sharing in the wealth. At the beginning of this decade, one dollar in three of mining company profits came through royalties and charges. At the end of the decade, it was one dollar in seven. But they do not care that the Australian people have missed out on a fair share of that. That much is obvious. There is one body that said very early that we needed a resource rent tax in this community. In fact, that was said by the Minerals Council. The Minerals Council, in their submission to the independent tax inquiry, had this to say: There is a strong argument to reform the basis of determining royalty payments to a profits based criteria from a revenue one. That was the mining sector; that was the Minerals Council of Australia. Of course, this is now widely recognised not only here but around the world. This is what the OECD has had to say: Whenever there is a period in which there is a price spike or a price hike then it is legitimate a sharing of that bonanza and that benefit. That is what everybody on this side of the House believes. Nobody on the other side of the House believes that. And today we have had Roger Corbett, appointed by those opposite to the Reserve Bank board, saying: These are resources owned by Australians and Australia should extract from those resources the best possible advantage it can. Who can disagree with that? Everybody over there disagrees with that perfectly reasonable statement. And you have got Michael Hawker, a director of Macquarie Group, who had this to say: A royalties tax on the assets of Australia is a good policy position because the capital of the country should be there not just for this generation but for multiple generations. Who believes that? Everybody on this side of the House believes that. But it is not just people in business; it is many economists. This is what Mr John Freebairn had to say on 12 May: It is actually going to increase the level of investment and employment down the track, contrary to what the big mining companies are claiming. You have got the IMF, who had this to say: There is a case for this tax to promote investment and secure for government higher shares of resource rent in profitable projects. And we have Professor Garnaut. What has he had to say?",49
29,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,50
30,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought you supported Professor Garnaut. He said: It is the right sort of tax. The Henry review made a strong case and a good case for taxing mineral rent. It is an elegant approach to the taxing of mineral rent. We go on. Even the banks are saying this. This is what Westpac had to say on 3 May: for The RSPT is a more efficient way of extracting value for both the state and resource companies than a royalty system. So, in the face of all this evidence, what we now have is an unprecedented, hysterical scare campaign which has been sponsored by those opposite and paid for by the Minerals Council, paid for and authorised by the Minerals Council. There are many commentators who have belled the cat on that. This is what Professor John Quiggin has had to say: The tax is a good idea and the criticisms we have seen are what you would expect from rent seekers seeking to protect their rents. I think that describes those opposite. And you had the Secretary-General of the OECD, again, saying: If you look at these things strategically, of course it is a wise thing to invest in Australia. Mr John Brogden, the CEO of the Investment and Financial Services Associationnot someone from our side of politics-said: This is a visionary policy. It is visionary for Australia's retirement outcomes and it is visionary for the Australian economy. So there is a strong tide of support for this tax in the business community, in the economics profession and among the Australian people. Those opposite are siding with the mining industry against the families of Australia, the workers of Australia and a national retirement savings plan. You hear those opposite claim to stand for families. Phony Tony over there claims to stand for families, but he will not support an initiative like this which will support Australian families. They are happy to see the profits walk out the door and not support Australian families. They should be condemned. Budget",50
31,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister publicly claimed that the Australian resources sector pays only 13 to 17 per cent in tax, based on the University of North Carolina student research paper that was completed over a year ago which does not specifically focus on the Australian resource sector, does not include royalty payments and lumps data from New Zealand in with that from Australia. I ask the Prime Minister: to prevent further misinformation, will the government now publicly release all Treasury and tax office modelling in relation to great big new tax on mining?",51
32,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I draw the honourable member's attention to the report which has already been released by the Treasury which contains copious information within it. Secondly, the underpinning of the Leader of the Opposition's question again is that the mining industry in this country does not need to pay more. This government has a different view, the Premier of Western Australia has a different view and in fact many representatives of the Australian business community have a different view. The Secretary-General of the OECD has a different view. Those opposite seem to be of the view that the only way in which to advance this country's economic interest for the long term is simply to leave things as they are, not to engineer fundamental reforms for the future. We stand for better taxation treatment for small business, better tax treatment for Australian companies and better super for Australian workers, and we also stand for better investment in lian infrastructure. That is the basis of the reform we have put forward. The government stands by its reform plan. Budget",51
33,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why is it important that spending commitments are properly documented, detailed and costed?",51
34,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyons for his question. Honourable members may recall that at the end of the last sitting week I issued a tally, a table, of existing coalition spending commitments that totalled $15.7 billion that had not been funded in any way by the opposition. They may also recall the Leader of the Opposition's budget speech in reply on Thursday of the last sitting week the in which he only managed to refer to one significant saving, with a grossly inflated estimate of how much it would deliver, and that was the Public Service hiring freeze. Since that time, we have had a very, very interesting week. First, on the Monday of last week, we had the Leader of the Opposition on the 7.30 Report indicate that we should not treat anything that he says seriously; we should only treat his statements as gospel truth if they are in writing. Then, on the Wednesday, after the Leader of the Opposition had promised that the detail would be delivered by the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, at his traditional budget reply speech at the National Press Club, the member for North Sydney came along and there was a lot of verbiage and bluster but there was no detail in his speech. A few hours later in the day, this elaborate game of pass-the-parcel concluded and finally the shadow finance minister-the fifth shadow finance minister in this term of parAustra- liament-the member for Goldstein, launched a list of supposed budget savings, the vast bulk of which do not hit the budget bottom line. Finally, to make the week even more interesting, the member for Goldstein, late on Thursday, put out a press release entitled ‘Tanner's numbers in tatters'-almost illiterate if not quite. It stated in a press lease: These costings leave in tatters the desperate claims of the Finance Minister, Mr Tanner, that Coalition promises add up to $15.7 billion. It claimed that only $4.7 billion is the tally coalition promises. Mr Speaker, as you can imagine, I found this rather interesting and rather puzzling-in fact, I was a bit mystified. How could there be such a big gap, $11 billion or so, between my tally and the opposition's? The answer was in the fine print in the member for Goldstein's press release because it contained this ripper phrase: … other past commitments have been discontinued. The older members of the chamber will no doubt remember Ronald Ziegler, the famous press spokesman for Richard Nixon who came up with the immortal phrase, ‘That previous statement was inoperative.' We now have a new equivalent, a new euphemism. It is, ‘That commitment has been discontinued.' The promise last year to allow small businesses to carry back-tax losses has been discontinued. The commitment of the shadow families minister, the member for Menzies, to get rid of the means-testing initiatives of the government on the baby bonus and the family tax benefits has been discontinued. The superannuation spokesman, the member for Cowper, in a speech only on 19 April this year made a commitment to reverse the government's tightening of concessional superannuation tax treatment. That one has also been discontinued, not to mention the radical reduction in funding for the Leader of the Opposition's so-called green army commitment that he made in a speech to the Sydney Institute and the dramatic scale down in funding for the Toowoomba bypass. What we have is a simple explanation for the discrepancy between the costings that I announced a week and a half ago and what rethe opposition now says are the costs of their promises. They have junked most of their promises and given us a living example of phoney Tony's principle: if it was a statement, ignore it; you have got to have it of pinned down in writing, in triplicate, and it has got to be there in a document before you should treat it seriously. There is a common thread across all of these events last week. It is this: panic under pressure. First, we have the Leader of the Opposition refusing to be accountable for anything he says, then we have got the passthe-parcel game from the Leader of the Opposition to the member for North Sydney to the member for Goldstein, then we have got the phoney savings announcement and then the final nail in the coffin that previous promises have been discontinued. There is a lesson for everyone here and that is that the Leader of the Opposition is too risky, too erratic and too flaky to be trusted with managing the nation's finances. NA",51
35,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island led by the Chief Minister, the Hon. David Buffett. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Budget",52
36,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister confirm that official ATO taxation statistics on the Taxation Office website show that the effective company tax rate for the mining industry is 27.8 per cent and when including royalties it is 41.3 per cent? Does the Prime Minister stand by the statements of his Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister that the taxation rate is only 17 per cent? I seek leave to table ATO taxation statistics 200708, tables 8 and 9, as proof. Leave not granted.",52
37,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once again, we have those opposite standing in defence of the existing taxation arrangements which apply to Australia's mining industry. The member for North Sydney referred to a statement made by the Treasurer on Sunday in reference to a report that had been put out by the National Bureau of Economic Research. My advice is that is a credible research institute. Secondly, I draw attention to the fact that, when it comes to the combined incidence of both royalties and the company tax rate on mining companies, the government has seen a 50 per cent drop in the share of tax taken from mining company profits over the past 10 years even if you factor in both company tax and royalties. Resource profits were over $80 billion higher in 2008-09 than in 1999-2000. Governments have only collected an additional $9 billion in revenue. These figures speak for themselves. We stand for reforming the system; those opposite stand for the status quo. ",53
38,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If the member for Sturt wants to hold conversations, I can arrange for him to go outside the chamber and hold them. Education Mrs D'ATH (2.29 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Social Inclusion. How is the government supporting quality teaching through the Smarter Schools National Partnership Agreement and are there any threats to this policy?",53
39,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her important question and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Grattan Institute today has released an important report on teacher evaluation and teacher quality. Unsurprisingly, like the reports and evidence from around the world, this report finds that the single most important thing for the quality of a child's education is the quality of the teacher in the classroom. That is why as a government we have been systematically investing in teacher quality and in the quality of school leadership. We needed to do this because, when we came to government, whilst over 12 long years the coalition had talked about teacher quality, it had got nothing done. That was not the only problem, of course. It had talked about national curriculum, and it had got nothing done. It had talked about school transparency, and it had got nothing done. Across more than 12 long years, what we saw in education from those opposite was a track record of all talk and shameful inaction-absolutely shameful inaction. This government has acted, as opposed to the talk, talk, talk from the other side. Our new reforms include bringing the highest quality graduates into teaching in disadvantaged schools through our Teach for Australia program. Today, as we stand here, Shaun Isbister is teaching maths at Mill Park Secondary College. Shaun got an ENTER score of 96.6 and a first-class honours degree in economics and commerce. His motto for his classroom is: results, not excuses. Shaun is one of 45",53
40,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister will resume her seat. I just remind the member for Sturt that he should be careful when going about his business as Manager of Opposition Business about standing and,53
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have got myself into trouble because I understand that. I have got myself into trouble because I now have the screen that gives me the feed that is going outside, so I just suggest to some people on the right that these minor matters are being dealt with and that they should listen to what is going on. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.",54
42,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I expect them to not be interested in education; it was their track record for a decade. Today, Shaun and 45 others are out there teaching through our Teach for Australia program, with more to come. These reforms in teacher quality mean today that the best teachers are being paid more to go to the classrooms that need them the most, and there are trials of performance based rewards in schools, including the prospect of outstanding teachers in Victoria earning $6,000 more. It means today there are differences for principal autonomy in state schools, including measures announced by the ACT government last week about school based management of staff and budgets, and in the Northern Territory business consultants are being made available to assist principals to run their schools. Today in Western Australia, as a result of our resources and reforms, more than 30 state schools are now called independent public schools, with the principals in them having greater autonomy, including the power to hire and fire. It was an honour for me to meet some of those principals on a recent trip to Western Australia. I am asked about threats to these reforms. The threat to these reforms arises from the game of ‘pass the parcel' played about the budget reply last week, because the $425 million which would enable us to continue these reforms is on the Leader of the Opposition's cuts list. No more investment in principal autonomy; no more investment in paying the best teachers more to reward them; no more investment in bringing the best graduates into teaching: that is the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. Just like the Leader of the Opposition, who believes everything he says is just dispensable, that it does not matter whether or not it is the truth, the shadow minister cannot be relied on when he makes statements. He has said, ‘The coalition believe our teachers need to be appropriately resourced, supported and rewarded.' But they have pledged to cut the funding that makes that possible. He said today in the Australian newspaper: “… disenchantment and disappointment teachers have in their profession will only get worse until there is a real revolution in education, which introduces competitive principals and gives schools more autonomy.” But he has pledged to cut the funding that makes that possible-a breathtaking act of hypocrisy from those failures in education when they were in government. Even other members of their political party think they are crazy, erratic and a risk to education. Adrian Piccoli, the coalition's shadow minister for education in New South Wales, said in the parliament of New South Wales last week: We support every measure that can be put in place to improve teacher quality. I do not believe it is a particularly good move by the Federal Coalition to announce that it will cut this funding should it be elected. The message to the Leader of the Opposition is clear. Even members of his own political party, the Liberal Party, believe he is a man drawn to extreme policies and crazy, erratic cuts. This just proves that the coalition are now pledged to diminish the quality of Australian education as a result of their budget reply. It is now crystal clear they are a risk to the economy, they are a risk to local schools and they are a risk to the services that working families rely on.",54
43,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the letter dated 17 May 2010 from BHP Billiton Chairman Mr Jac Nasser AO to shareholders and released to the Australian Stock Exchange. Mr Nasser informed shareholders that last year BHP Billiton paid $6.3 billion in taxes and royalties to Australian governments and that its total effective tax rate was 43 per cent. Given that a public company chairman has a statutory obligation to accurately inform shareholders, does the Prime Minister accept as fact Mr Nasser's statement regarding BHP Billiton's level of taxation?",55
44,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Curtin for her new-found interest in accuracy. I refer to the statements which the honourable member referred to. As I said in response to an earlier question, when we are in a process of consultation with the mining industry about a new tax, a range of corporate executives will make a range of statements about that proposition. I also say to the member for Curtin that there has been interesting commentary about those remarks as well, including from former federal leader of the Liberal Party John Hewson, who has described the reaction more generally to the RSPT by certain parts of the mining industry as ‘hysterical'. Dr Hewson said: I must say the positions taken by people, whether it is ‘Twiggy' Forrest or Jac Nasser-I mean I have these waking up nightmares of Mr Nasser like he used to attack us over tariff protection for the car industry 20 years ago. That is what Dr Hewson said. I do not necessarily endorse what Dr Hewson said at all, but I do draw it to honourable members' attention. I also draw their attention to the fact that Dr Hewson, a former leader of the Liberal Party, has indicated that, in policy terms, Budget these policies are right-‘This is making sure we get the settings right for resources rent tax.' He goes on: I think the resources rent tax has always been on the agenda for serious debate since the middle 1970s. We never got it right. This is a chance to get it right and in particular to deal with the state royalties at the same time as you deal with the federal tax. And so say a large number of other contributors to this debate. I say to the member for Curtin, therefore: reflect carefully on what that former federal leader of the Liberal Party has had to say on this matter, what the former state leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party Mr Brogden has had to say on this matter and even what the WA Premier has had to say on this matter in terms of obtaining a better return for the Australian people and for small business, better super for working families, better infrastructure for the Australian economy and a decent tax break for small business in terms of the $5,000 tax break. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a notice to the Australian Stock Exchange which was filed about an hour ago, confirming the 43 per cent tax rate paid by BHP Billiton last year. Leave not granted. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the letter from BHP of 17 May 2010, confirming that BHP paid an effective tax rate of 43 per cent. Leave not granted. Health",55
45,Ms GRIERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister update the House on the implementation of the government's GP superclinics and of the level of community support for this program?,55
46,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Newcastle for that question. I know she has been particularly interested in the way that services are provided in the broader Hunter region. I am delighted to be able to tell her and the rest of the House that the implementation of the $275 million commitment to the GP Super Clinics Program has been going well. In fact, I can report to the House that around 50,000 services have already been provided under this GP Super Clinics Program. I can see the member for Paterson smiling. Indeed, he should be. I was in Port Stephens last Monday to officially open the superclinic in Nelson Bay. The superclinic in Nelson Bay was a $2.5 million commitment. The GPs who were successful in their application for the superclinic intend to invest about the same amount themselves in expanding health services around the clinic. This clinic is ing to have extended hours of operation. For example, it will be the first GP service open in the region on Sundays. It offers a dedicated service on Tuesday and Thursday mornings for residents of local aged-care facilities. It has received a grant to provide after-hours services as well. Four new GPs, two full-time registered nurses and a wide variety of allied health professionals are going to staff this new clinic. They are going to work in multidisciplinary teams to provide integrated patient-centred care. Of course, this is a fantastic new addition for the community. Unfortunately, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister have turned their backs on these sorts of investments. Communities, like Port Stephens, who put up their hands for a superclinic in the future following the budget commitments made last week will not get support from the Liberal Party. Of course, they are joining a long line of Liberal members who oppose this. The shadow minister for health did not even turn up to the opening of the Strathpine superclinic in his electorate. He might have been busy looking at investments that had to be made! He did not even bother to be there. Not every Liberal MP has given the superclinics program the cold shoulder. In fact, many people on the other side have embraced this idea with open arms. I feel it is necessary to bring some photographic evidence of this fact. I think people should be aware and I should declare first in the parliament that in politics you are sometimes required to do things that you never anticipated you would be required to do. I need to show this photograph taken at the opening of the Port Stephens superclinic. There are three people in it. One of them is Labor's candidate for Paterson, Jim Arneman. He has a big smile on his face. The reason he has a big smile on his face is he was present at the last go- election when this commitment was made. He is our candidate again and I am sure he, as well as everyone on this side of the House, is delighted that these commitments are being delivered. Not surprisingly, as the health minister I was there at the opening of the superclinic. I did say that not everyone has given the superclinics the cold shoulder. I do need to provide this photo to the House.",56
47,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,56
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I think the minister has got the message across.,56
49,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did think it was necessary to preface the showing of that photograph with the confession that in politics sometimes you do do things that you never expected you would ever do. There is of course a very serious point to this. There is a reason the member for Paterson was so happy about the superclinic opening in his electorate and there is a reason that communities around the country want these superclinics, and that is that they provide essential services to communities that need them. You may not trust the photographic evidence. Perhaps the reason the member for Newcastle asked this question is that she was watching NBN TV on the night that the opening occurred. Of course, the member for Paterson was quoted on television as saying, ‘This has my absolute support,' as indeed it should have. But, unfortunately, 23 additional communities and more than 400 GP practices across the country will not be able to have that benefit because, despite the member for Paterson's words, the rest of the Liberal Party will not support these investments. The Leader of the Opposition, when the Minister for Health and Ageing, pulled a billion dollars out of our hospital system and he is fast already pulling the next billion with the commitments that they have made in their budget reply. So you do certainly get a sense of ‘Here we go again in health'. If you put the Leader of the Opposition anywhere near a health budget, you lose a billion dollars like that. Communities cannot afford this. GP superclinics are good for the community, as the member for Paterson clearly knows. I have taken the liberty of preparing a small gift him to display in his office of the opening of the superclinic. I hand it over to him now.",56

68,Mr DREYFUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy. How will the new Resource Super Profits Tax provide greater tax certainty for the mining industry in Australia?,58
69,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. As I have said on a number of occasions over the past couple of weeks, tax reform has never come easy to Australia but it is the responsibility of the Australian government to actually take on this debate, a responsibility that the previous government shirked. I say that because the only sections of the Australian community arguing at the moment that the resources and petroleum sector in Australia should not pay higher taxation are the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition. In that context, can I say that we are well positioned to have this debate. Australia has come out of the global financial crisis in a very sound position. In many ways we are the envy of the OECD world. The real debate is about how much tax is paid, who collects it and under what system. We should also remind one another that that is not just my view, it is also the view of many in the resources and petroleum sector in Australia. Let us go to the Minerals Council of Australia. This is what they have actually said about a profits based tax debate in Australia: There is a strong argument to reform the basis of determining royalty payments to a profits based criteria from a revenue one. I could not agree more with the Minerals Council of Australia. But I also appreciate that the devil is in the detail. That is why the government is engaged in a very serious process of consultation at the moment. With respect to the requirement of the resources and petroleum sector to pay more taxation in Australia, I remind you of what the CEO of Woodside, Mr Voelte, said on Radio National this morning: In talking to the big miners and the mid cap miners I have not heard that they are not willing to negotiate a different tax and a higher tax back. They want to give a fair share back to the Australian citizens. The key is how you balance the amount of money back to the citizens versus the economic return on billions and billions of dollars of investment. I agree with Mr Voelte of Woodside. That is where we are at in this debate at the moment-the coalition is opposed to any tax reform in Australia whilst the government seriously engages industry with a view to actually getting the balance right. I say that because shareholders are entitled to a fair return for the purposes of their investments in Australia, but perhaps more importantly we should remind the coalition that so is the Australian community. They only get one chance to develop their finite resources. Those resources are 100 per cent owned by the Australian community. I also remind the House that a number of major resource companies in Australia are also open to this debate. Let me go to what the CEO of BHP Billiton said on 9 May when he was asked, ‘But are you opposed to the resources rent tax in principle?' He answered no and went on to say: … we are not opposed to reform. We're not opposed to any particular form of how that taxation takes place. The reason for that is that the resources and petroleum sector and the Australian community now want some certainty for the purposes of the pipeline of investments that are in place potentially for Australia. They have had a gutful of state and territory governments lifting royalty rates from time to time to suit their short-term circumstances. The Minerals Council submission to the Henry tax review argued for a profits based tax system in Australia to create that certainty. I simply say that I agree with the mining industry. We require certainty. The tax announcements of the government will change that. Yes, they will tax profits at an appropriate rate, but they will also provide certainty and flexibility because you will only pay right taxes on the basis of the profits you make. In that context, I refer to an earlier question by the member for Groom who, I might say, should know better. He should go away and re-examine the question given to him by the Leader of the Opposition that he asked today. Clearly that question was carefully choreographed, yet we do not know, from time to time, whether he is telling the truth or not. Let us go to the oil and gas sector tax. That has created certainty in Australia. I remind the member for Groom and the Leader of the Opposition about the introduction of that tax. It goes to the issue of certainty. Esso and BHP actually chose to transition into the petroleum resource rent tax system of Australia, under which the life of the Bass Strait oil and gas reserves was extended for decades. Then he goes to the question of the long term nature of these investments. Let us go to the issue of Pluto, an investment decision made in 2007. Pluto will export LNG from Australia in the financial year 2010-11. Let us go to the biggest ever LNG investment in Australia. Let us go to the biggest ever single investment in the history of AustraliaGorgon. Gorgon will export LNG from Australia in the financial year 2015-16. We had a debate 25 years ago about the need for tax certainty in Australia-an investment horizon that created attractiveness for investment in Australia whilst creating long-term opportunities for shareholders. Let us go to the nature of that tax in the Gorgon LNG investment decision. I refer to some comments made in Western Australia on the occasion of that investment. I remind the House of what the Chevron vice-chairman, George Kirkland-not known to the Leader of the Opposition because he finds economics and investment in Australia boring but at least known to the member for Groom-said: There's no doubt … this positions Australia very, very strongly in the gas world. It really and does. He then went on to say: The good news is Saudi Arabia is all about oil, and what we're seeing in Australia is all about gas. … … … Asia has been growing, growing significantly. And where's Australia? Great position to really deliver on a cost advantage basis, that market. He went on to say: … for Chevron we have four focus exploration areas of the world that we push the predominance of our exploration money. Western Australia is one of those and we feed our exploration budget here very well, and we're going to continue to feed it very well, because we have the view that we can grow the resources here … That is because we took on a debate 25 years ago. It was a debate which ensured we had certainty in the tax regime in Australia for the resources and petroleum industry and a debate which ensured the Australian community got a fair return for the development of their resources-100 per cent owned by the Australian community. That is why this government, unlike the opposition, who should have done this over the previous decade, is committed to putting in place a resources rent tax that provides for the broad development of the Australian resource community and creates efficient and effective mining but also ensures a better return for the Australian community. I simply say to the resources and energy sector and the petroleum sector: there is a genuine process of consultation underway; we are interested in the issues that you are raising; and we are absolutely committed to getting it right. Unlike the opposition, we believe in investment certainty and the right of the Australian community to get a fair return on their investments. The only people arguing against truly higher taxation for the resources sector in Australia are Tony Abbott and the opposition, because all they are interested in are grubby donations from certain sectors of the Australian community.  Speaker: obviously the opposition take offence at that last phrase of the minister and we ask him to withdraw it in the interests of the House.",58

74,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer the Minister to the statements of the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday, based solely on the paper of a student from the University of North Carolina, that the effective tax rate of Australian mining companies is between 13 and 17 per cent. Is the Prime Minister aware that the paper is in draft form, that the paper does not include royalties and other business taxes, that the paper is not designed as a policy tool and that the student author, Kevin Markle, who has not yet graduated, is involved in a website that claims ‘I love taxes'?",61
75,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,61
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I take it the question was asked as a serious question. I therefore expect that the Prime Minister would be allowed to respond in silence.,61
77,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and where is the member for Goldstein's press secretary when you need him. He digs himself in on a question about which the opposition are most sensitive, which is the actual level of taxation paid by the Australian mining industry. He refers in particular to the publication from the NBER, and he says that the NBER does not publish these sorts of publications. One piece of information I have from the National Bureau of Economic Research is an NBER publication by Douglas Shackelford of June 2009 entitled, Do multinationals or domestic firms face higher effective tax and rates? written with he Kevin S. Markle. That is what it says-with him. That is actually listed under NBER publications by Douglas Shackelford. What I find stunning about the use of question time for this purpose is that it actually seeks to mask the opposition's refusal to engage in the substance of the debate, which is the best form of taxation for the Australian Budget mining industry. Firstly, what grows the industry over time? Our answer is a profits Prime based tax; not a volumes based tax. Secondly, we have the example of the PRRT as to how it has worked over time. Now by their questions they are walking away from the PRRT. Thirdly, with the RSPT we bring in a new system of proposed taxation which provides an upfront assistance to industries to offset their costs involved in the initial investment in order to broaden the base of the industry. That is what we are seeking to do. This is the basis of the reforms that we are advancing and the projections contained in the papers provided by the Treasury and the Econtech modelling, which underpin that the long-term growth of the industry increases by 5.5 per cent as a result of these reforms. Those opposite, consistent with their engagement on every matter of policywhether it is health policy, education policy or any other form of policy including Work Choices-are negative, consistently attacking and never provide an alternative. I would just draw their attention, again, to the former head of the Liberal Party, Dr John Hewson, and his remarks, the former head of the New South Wales Liberal Party, Mr Brogden, and his remarks and also to the earlier endorsement of the PRRT by the former Treasurer of Australia, Peter Costello.",61
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Goldstein on a point of order. Mr Robb- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the evidence based policy. Leave not granted. Superannuation",62
79,Mrs IRWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law. How will the government's stronger and fairer superannuation reforms benefit young people? What threats are there to Australia building a world-class retirement income system?",62
80,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fowler for her question. The reforms announced by the government do act on our commitment to improve our superannuation system and ensure that some of the social dividend from the mining boom is directly channelled into national savings. This is a long-term economic reform which will have long-term benefits. I am asked by the member for Fowler about those benefits for young people. I can inform the House that an 18-year-old entering the workforce today will be $200,000 better off at retirement because of these reforms. This is important when you consider the amount of time that 18-year-old will need to spend in retirement. The expected time spent in retirement, because we are all living longer, will almost double from 1960 when it was 12.5 years to 22.4 years when we get to the year 2050. When it comes time for today's 18-year-olds to retire from the workforce they will need enough retirement income to last at least 22 years. It stands to reason that those who will be in the workforce longest under this reform system will be those who benefit very substantially. The member for Fowler asked me what threats there are to Australia building a world-class retirement income, and the threat sits opposite. Last week the opposition got around to announcing their response to the budget. In their own special way they responded to the government's budget. The member for Goldstein released a list of things that would be cut. This list confirmed that the opposition opposes the increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. They oppose the refunding of the contributions tax to low income earners, and they oppose allowing people over 50 to make concessional top-up payments to their superannuation funds. They also oppose paying workers aged between 70 and 75 superannuation. It was this last one that really got my attention. I get a lot of letters about this from older workers in the workforce saying, ‘Why should we be discriminated against just because we turn 70? Why shouldn't we receive superannuation payments?' The government considered this and, in order to encourage workforce participation and in order to deal with this discrimination, we announced that we will change the law and will have superannuation guarantee payments for people aged 70 to 75. The opposition oppose this as part of their savings measures. I thought this was a bit curious because this measure does not cost the government any money. They included as a savings measure the abolition of a measure which does not cost money because people who receive superannuation payments for the first time pay tax and this will increase government revenue by $15 million. So the opposition hate superannuation so much that they use as a savings measure the abolition of a measure which will actually make the government money. That is how much they are opposed to the retirement incomes of Australians. This takes their sloppiness to new heights. Their inconsistencies do not end there. One month ago the shadow minister for superannuation-and, yes, there is one; it is the member for Cowper-gave a speech to the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees. It was a scripted, written speech. As far as we know the member for Cowper might have even rehearsed in front of the mirror, so we should have been able to take what he said as the gospel truth. He said that the opposition in government would allow people over 50 to make concessional top-ups to their superannuation payments. That was a commitment from the shadow minister for superannuation. It lasted one month. On 19 April this was announced as policy by the shadow minister for superannuation. On 19 May, the shadow minister for finance announced this was no longer opposition policy; it had been discontinued. It lasted a month. Their commitment to people aged over 50 lasted a month. How inconsistent can you be? But the Leader of the Opposition is probably very pleased with this. He is probably pleased with the inconsistency. I noticed in the Financial Review today the former Leader of the Opposition and former Leader of the Liberal Party, John Hewsonsomebody who knows the current leader very well-said that the Leader of the Opposition thinks: … consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. That is the view of the Leader of the Opposition, and that was just before John Hewson said: Tony is genuinely innumeratethat he finds economics ‘boring'He has no interest in economics and he has no feeling for it. That is what Professor John Hewson thinks of the current Leader of the Opposition. That is what he thinks of his economic skills. So we should not be surprised about this inconsistency and this complete lack of economic policy skills from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow treasurer, who together are the weakest front-bench economics team from opposition in living memory. But we will not be distracted by the inconsistency and the myopia of those opposite. We will continue with our policy of improving the retirement incomesMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is on relevance and indeed the common-sense rule applying to whether the answer is relevant. I draw your attention to page 555 where it simply says that lack of provision in the standing orders relating to answers does not preclude you making a decision and a determination that it is clearly relevant. The minister should sit down.",62
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Whilst I cannot read my own handwriting for the last part of this question, I was acting in the belief that the minister was being relevant to that aspect. But having said that, I am sure that he is bringing his answer to a very quick conclusion.",63
82,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It fell to the Labor Party in the 1990s to introduce a national superannuation scheme, against the opposition of the Liberal Party. It now falls to the Labor Party to strengthen the national superannuation scheme in a reform that will have lasting benefits for decades. Mining",63
83,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and relates to the mining companies BHP and Shenhua Coal, and their coal exploration licences on the Liverpool Plains in the electorate of New England. The Prime Minister would be aware of the widespread concerns of these potential projects on the enormous groundwater reserves and the alluvial floodplains of the region and the Murray-Darling system. Given recent statements in China that Shenhua Coal would eventually mine under the floodplain and the Mooki River, and given that Shenhua Coal is refusing to await the results of an independent water study, which is partly funded by the Commonwealth government, would you, Prime Minister, visit this area and see for yourself the unique geographical and hydrogeological features of this area and the associated risks to the Murray-Darling system?",63
84,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for New England for his question. I am familiar with the company, Shenhua, and I have known of its operations for many, many years. The particular project that the honourable member refers to in his part of Australia. I am not familiar with. But I have listened very carefully to his question and he goes to the core point of environmental approvals. I do not know what stage those approvals are at and the extent to which they currently involve both the state and federal governments, given that it involves not just the water system but I presume other environmental dimensions as well. On the question of statements made by Shenhua from Beijing on this, that it is their predisposition to proceed with this project prior to approvals being granted, prima facie I would find that unacceptable in terms of the provisions of Australian law. However, as the member has raised it, I will go into the detail of the matter and report back to him separately on it. As for visiting the area, given he has raised it in this place, either another minister of the government, as appropriate, will seek to visit the area with the honourable member to ascertain what the best way forward is. China",64
85,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade. Will the minister advise the House,64
86,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,64
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Leichhardt seems to have a fan club that gees him on every time. Please, can he get his question out.",64
88,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will the minister advise the House of the outcomes from his recent visit to China and any implications for Australia's trade and economic performance?,64
89,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am in his fan club because he is a very strong advocate for his area of the importance of trade, in particular the relationship with China. The recent visit had three purposes. The first was the annual economic dialogue that we engage in with China, now Australia's largest trading partner and the fastest growing nation in the world. As nations, our two economic areas of activity are intricately entwined. The economic dialogue provided the opportunity not just to review where we are at but also to talk about how we could strengthen that relationship, in particular diversify it. We had good discussions about opportunities in the services sector and in advanced manufacturing. It was a very rewarding dialogue indeed. The second part of the visit was to continue what we have referred to as the secondtrack approach to China. Members would be aware that we have not yet been able to conclude the free trade agreement, but we are making progress. The important thing though is that we have not let this deter us from looking for commercial opportunities in key regions and key cities in China. I visited the I or Shandong province and the governor from that province is going to visit this country later this year. They are very keen to develop an MOU with the Australian government as a region on the basis of key areas of their interest. We look forward to that visit. That engagement with the Shandong province builds on many more engagements that we have already had and under which we have signed six MOUs with various cities and regions within China. The third dimension of the visit was to visit the Australian pavilion at the largest expo ever held in the world being held in Shanghai at the moment. The Australian pavilion is a magnificent structure. It was formally opened by the foreign minister. This pavilion is now receiving up to 40,000 visitors a day, close to 800,000 visitors have already gone through and the Australian draw on a daily basis is in the order of 15 to 20 cent. It is one of the most visited pavilions in okay. the whole of the expo site. Beyond it being a striking feature and a drawcard in its own right, the Australian pavilion has been an important platform on which Australia has engaged some of the key sectors I have spoken of before. We conducted forums in relation to financial services, sustainable building and urban design, as well as the auto sector. Sustainable building is a vital area of opportunity. In the next two decades, China is going to have to house 300 million people. This will be the biggest urban development in the history of the world and they are looking to countries such as Australia to advise them on smart buildings, clean energy, recycling and clever design. So those platforms are particularly important. The expo also provided us with the opportunity to launch internationally ‘Brand Australia', an exciting new concept which will present, in a multifaceted way, the great things Australia does on so many different fronts. More than just a tourist destination, this is a great place to invest, to do business and to trade on so many fronts. It was a very worthwhile visit. There will be many more to that part of the world. China, as I said at the outset, is our largest trading partner at the moment. It is going to have a significant bearing on the economic future of this country, as is Australia on theirs. Home Insulation Program",64
90,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to today's comments by insulation small-business owner Ms Kellie Jackson of Albury: He, Mr Rudd, has ruined an industry and is getting away with it. I came to Canberra on February 24th where he met installers and promised them he would fix it. I came back on 30 April to let him know that he hadn't fixed it. Now insulation installers from across this country are going to per Canberra to let the government know it is not I note that neither the Prime Minister nor any other minister was available this time to meet with installers such as those now in the gallery. Will the Prime Minister apologise to Kellie Jackson and other legitimate installers for both misleading them and sending long standing small businesses broke?",65
91,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. When the various installers were here in Australia some time ago, we did indicate that there would be a replacement scheme.",65
92,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members interjecting-We are in Australia, yes!",65
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,65
94,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We did indicate when they were here in Canberra that there would be a replacement scheme. We also indicated at the time that safety would be first priority. That is why, having commissioned the Hawke review and obtained its recommendations, it was decided, based on those recommendations, that we should not proceed with the replacement scheme because safety could not be guaranteed. I draw honourable member's attention also to the fact that we have now committed $56 million to assist insulation workers and companies affected by the closure of the Home Insulation Program. I also draw attention to the fact that the member Flinders has also supported the government's decision to cancel the program.",65
95,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women. How is the government tackling housing affordability for working Australians and their families? What are the government's housing programs delivering in my state of Western Australia?,66
96,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to thank the member for Hasluck for her question. She knows, as well as people on this side of the House, that housing affordability is intricately and directly linked to housing supply. We have not been building enough homes across Australia for at least a decade now. Because of that, we have seen price pressure both on homes for people to buy and on homes for people to rent. Of course the previous government ignored this problem for 11 years. The only real moves they made in housing were to cut $3 billion from housing programs during 11 years in government. In contrast, since coming to government we have helped almost a quarter of a million young Australians into a home of their own through the first home owners boost. In the member for Hasluck's state, Western Australia, the number is 28,800 first home buyers who have been helped by the first home owners boost. We have also supported the building of thousands of affordable rental properties through our National Rental Affordability Scheme and other programs. I have been very pleased with the uptake of the National Rental Affordability Scheme. In fact, in the first two rounds of the scheme we have approved 11,000 National Rental Affordability Scheme properties. In this current round, round 3, which is open until the end of August, we have so far received eight applications from right across the country for for over 12,000 National Rental Affordability Scheme incentives. I am very pleased to inform the House today that the first major Housing proposal in round 3 is from Western Australia, from a wholesale company called Yaran, which specialises in affordable housing projects. They are building across 47 sites, right across WA, more than 1,100 new homes for Western Australians which will be offered at affordable rentals. Of course that is terrific news for those families in Western Australia. The homes are spread right across the Perth region. Yaran is the name of the company, and the homes are spread right across the Perth region from Mandurah in the far south to Merriwa in the outer north. The projects are proposed for regional areas like Denmark, Mount Barker and Bridgetown in the south-west as well, and I am sure that the member for Hasluck is very happy to know that up to 170 of these new homes will be in her electorate alone. That goes with the 20 homes in the first two rounds of the National Rental Affordability Scheme at Gosnells and Midland and with the 53 homes built through the stimulus package-social housing homes, including the 16 that we have visited together, which were being built for seniors in Gosnells. So there are 243 new rental homes for the member for Hasluck's seat as part of about 4,000 new rental properties right across Western Australia. And it is not just the new rental properties; it is new homes to buy. Through the Housing Affordability Fund we will see a total of $31½ million going to WA for 13 projects, saving homebuyers in Western Australia around $16½ thousand on about 1,820 new homes and housing lots. In the Hasluck electorate, the City of Gosnells has received over a million dollars from the Housing Affordability Fund, and 100 homebuyers will receive discounts of around $11,000 each on their homes. This is a massive investment in housing right across WA, a state that desperately needs affordable rental housing and affordable homes for people to buy. This investment means more homes sooner and better affordability for those Western Australians who want a home to buy, to live in or to rent. Building the Education Revolution Program  the Minister for Education. Can the minister explain why, under the school hall program over which she has presided, a cubbyhouse canteen, like this one at the Orange Grove Public School, could cost taxpayers $25,000 per square metre yet not be able to fit a stove, but a canteen like this one at Holy Trinity Catholic School costs only $2½ thousand a square metre and even has space for coldrooms? Does the minister understand why people like Rick Bennett, P&C chair at Tottenham Central School, whose government-issue canteen cost $600,000 and cannot fit a fridge, could be absolutely, bloody gutsure ted by the waste and mismanagement of the school hall rip-off program?",66
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow minister for education for his question, and I await his explanation of the $425 million they want to rip out of quality teaching and the more than $3 billion they want to rip out of education after having governed for almost 12 long years, a wasted decade. But, on the question that the shadow minister has asked me, I will take some advice from the Attorney-General about whether he has breached the copyright of the Australian newspaper. Should it turn out that he has breached that copyright, then I am sure that publishers of the Australian newspaper will take the appropriate action.

The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.",67
108,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If only they put such energy into developing policies and their budget reply! Coming back to the question from the shadow minister for education, brought to you by the Australian newspaper, yes, I did see the story. Of course, as I have said on the public record on a number of occasions, often the cost comparisons we see published are not correct. But I am very determined that we see value for money. I want every dollar that goes to schools to make the biggest difference for schools. That is why I have appointed the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce, led by a leading Australian businessman, Brad Orgill, to focus on these questions. I say to the members opposite: if they actually have any serious concerns they should research them themselves, as opposed to just reading things in the media. If they ever spend just one minute doing any work and if they actually have a complaint then they can raise it with the implementation task force. On the matter of photographs and Building the Education Revolution, I am very happy to say to the House that I have some photographs, and I would love to see them in the Australian newspaper. In this photograph we have the member for Fairfax breaking into song because he is so happy, at the opening of a Building the Education Revolution project in his electorate, at Kenilworth State Community College.",68

So he will place his props back on the dispatch box.  of order going to relevance. At least my props were relevant to the question.

113,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously, what we never see on display from the shadow minister is intelligence or policy other than cutbacks. But, in conclusion, there are some members of the opposition who are so exhausted from turning up at all of their Building the Education Revolution openings-to try and associate themselves with a program that they have opposed in this place-that some of them, like the member for Gilmore, actually send a staff member to the sodturning because it is all just too much for them to get to every opening.

118,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He did hear I was coming. I rang him, as I always do. The Rudd government's third budget injected an additional $1 billion into the Australian Rail Track Corporation. Last Thursday I visited Broken Hill, a place where investment and jobs are welcomed. As result of our record investment, we will see re-railing and re-sleepering from Broken Hill to Parkes in the east and re-railing from Broken Hill to Whyalla in the west, not only creating jobs directly in construction but also creating in manufacturing. Overall, 600 jobs will be created, through that project, in regional Australia. We have now more than quadrupled our investment in rail. It has been welcomed in other parts of regional Australia as well, where two-thirds of our $37 billion nation-building infrastructure investment is going. We are creating jobs, strengthening local communities and building the transport infrastructure that will secure our prosperity for the long term. After this announcement last Tuesday, I waited with some anticipation for the opposition leader's budget reply. I must say I was somewhat disappointed. I waited because I thought we were going to get a considered, well thought out, well-structured, gospel truth statement from the opposition leader. We did get that. After he had been part of a government that presided over an infrastructure deficit and ignored 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank, the number of mentions of infrastructure made by the Leader of the Opposition in the opposition's budget reply speech was exactly zero. I thought, ‘Given that he's flicked it to the shadow Treasurer, we might get something of substance about infrastructure, dealing with capacity constraints and growing productivity from the shadow Treasurer in the National Press Club speech.' The shadow treasurer did manage to mention infrastructure during his National Press Club debacle. He did at least get to it. He made four comments about infrastructure. The first thing he said was that he had what he thought was a new idea: he would actually get an incoming government to undertake an audit of Australia's infrastructure needs. Sound familiar? Done-done by the Rudd government, done by Infrastructure Australia. The first thing they did was an audit of Australia's infrastructure. They rejobs ported to the Council of Australian Governments in December 2008-tick, done. I go to the second thing that the shadow treasurer said. He said they would ‘better utilise existing infrastructure'. If he had actually read the report, he could have read page 28 and the chapter on-wait for itbetter use of existing infrastructure. Done. He had a third position in this great announcement, having done nothing for 12 years. He said they would look at access in terms of infrastructure. He could have gone to section 2.4A, ‘Open access to infrastructure', in the audit report. Then he said a fourth thing. He said they would work with the private sector to help address the infrastructure deficit that the Howard government had left behind. He could have gone to pages 72, 73 and 74, the whole chapter about financing of infrastructure, including how you mobilise privatesector infrastructure financing. Or he could have welcomed the changes that we made in the budget to provide incentives for private investment in corporate bonds for infrastructure-in the budget on Tuesday night, ignored by those opposite. But instead we got absolutely no new ideas, no new initiatives and no alternative proposals. When the pass-the-parcel game ended with the member for Goldstein finally making a statement, it was plain to see that is no funding for the promises that the coalition has been making locally in electorates right around the country. We know from the finance minister's answer that they have got a disclaimer: disregard all previous comments; all previous commitments are not worth anything. They are worth as much as a statement from the Leader of the Opposition. So no funding for the members for Gippsland, Gilmore, Wide Bay, Maranoa and Dickson. They have all been out there promising major infrastructure spending and we now know that that is all gone. There is one thing that was in the statement. Members would recall that during the last sitting week I made a statement about the commitment by one of the former ministers for infrastructure to the Toowoomba bypass. I informed the House that that was worth $1.75 billion. How do we know it is worth $1.75 billion? Because after the member for Groom promised in his first election campaign that he would deliver on this and mentioned it in his first speech, they did nothing about it until 2006. Then they set up an inquiry to look at costings of this road, the Toowoomba bypass. It was their costings that costed it at $1.75 billion, yet in the document they have allowed $280 million. The bypass has become a footpath. You cannot build the Toowoomba bypass for $280 million. You are treating the Australian people like mugs. Those opposite could not walk away completely from their commitment so they came up with $280 million. Phony Tony and his colleagues are treating the Australian public like mugs. They say one thing in their electorate but they do something else when they come here. Mr Randall- Mr SPEAKER ",69

126,Mr RUDD,SOUTH KOREA," Mr Speaker, I seek to make a statement on indulgence concerning the sinking of the Republic of Korea naval vessel the Cheonan. Members would be aware that the stability of North-East Asia has been threatened recently by the actions of the North Koreans. On 26 March the South Korean naval corvette the Cheonan was sunk, with the loss of 46 lives. In response to that tragic event the government of South Korea launched an international investigation into the circumstances of the sinking. This was a prudent and considered response. Australia, along with the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Canada, participated in the Republic of Korea led investigation into the causes of the sinking. Five Australian Defence Force personnel assisted with the investigation. Australia's agreement to provide this assistance reflects the importance of security in North-East Asia to our own interests. The results of the joint international investigation were announced on 20 May. The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the Cheonan was sunk by a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine. The conclusions drawn by the international investigation team represent an objective and scientific analysis of the evidence. This evidence is compelling. It includes the fact that the damage to the hull of the Cheonan was caused by a large external underwater explosion beneath the vessel consistent with damage from a heavy torpedo. Further, remnants of the torpedo were found on the sea floor in the vicinity. Third, the torpedo was identified as belonging to North Korea, as it matched a North Korean torpedo previously obtained by the South Koreans as well as blueprints of a torpedo design North Korea had previously tried to export. Also, Korean script was found on one of the torpedo parts. I spoke to President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea on 20 May to reiterate Australia's condolences for this tragic event and to underline Australia's solidarity with South Korea. I emphasised Australia's condemnation of North Korea's deplorable act and assured him that Australia would confer with South Korea and others, including the UN Security Council, on appropriate responses. North Korea's hostile and unprovoked attack in sinking the Cheonan represents a flagrant violation by North Korea of the United Nations Charter and the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement that halted hostilities on the Korean peninsula. It is a challenge to peace and security on the Korean peninsula. Such conduct is completely unacceptable. The international community cannot let this act pass without an appropriate response. President Lee, today, has announced the RoK response to the sinking. South Korea has shown admirable restraint. The measures he has announced are responsible ones that send a strong message to the DPRK. He has banned DPRK vessels from using the Cheju Straits, he has suspended inter-Korean trade and exchanges and he has said that the government will pursue a resolution in the UN Security Council. He has also reiterated South Korea's principle of proactive deterrence. At the same time, he has demonstrated South Korea's ongoing concern for the people of the North. He has said that his government will maintain humanitarian aid for infants and children in the DPRK and will consider ongoing cooperation in the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea. The Australian government stands by the government of the Republic of Korea at this testing time. We offer our condolences to the families of all those who have lost their in this terrible incident. The relationship tween Australia and the RoK has a long history. Members of this place will be familiar with the sacrifice made by many Australian soldiers during the Korean War, some 340 of whom now lie buried at the United Nations War Cemetery in Korea. We share a commitment with the Korean people to peace and stability in the Asian region. The actions of North Korea are deeply disturbing and deeply destabilising. What the region needs is dialogue and cooperation, not rash acts of aggression of the type that we have seen. In the days ahead, Australia will be conferring with South Korea, United States, Japan and other likeminded countries to determine the best way to take forward the international response to this incident.",71
127,Mr ABBOTT,SOUTH KOREA," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I join with the Prime Minister in condemning the actions of North Korea and in complementing those members of the Australian Defence Force who were able to assist with the investigation. I also join with the Prime Minister in expressing solidarity with the South Korean people and I agree with him that the actions of the South Korean government in response seem appropriate.

131,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The government's plan for a stronger, simpler, fairer tax system was announced three weeks ago. Since that time, it has been the subject of robust debate around the country-particularly on the Resource Super Profits Tax. We welcome this debate about the future of our economy, and we hope it continues. It is important that debate remains constructive-contributing to increased public understanding and a robust design for the RSPT. Inaccurate information and scare campaigns risk getting in the way of this, undermining the important work we must do to strengthen our economy and secure higher living standards for working families. We must not lose sight of the key aim of the policy-to ensure a fairer share of the proceeds of the resources boom are invested in a stronger economy for all Australians. We will do this by replacing royalties with a source Super Profits Tax and directing the proceeds to higher retirement savings for Australians, more roads, rail and ports, and less business tax and red tape, especially small business. The Australian people own 100 per cent of Australia's natural resources and they deserve a fairer share of the superprofits ing companies make, particularly during this boom. As these profits have risen in recent years the Australian people's share of those profits has fallen. Before the last boom, the country got $1 in every $3 of mining profits through royalties and resource charges, but the end of that boom that was down to just $1 in $7. It is impossible to justify a system where Australians pay proportionately more tax as their income goes up, while mining companies pay proportionately less as their profits go up. The companies have been unable to justify this, and I cannot let the situation stand. Profits were over $80 billion higher in 2008-09 than in 1999-2000 yet governments only collected an additional $9 billion in revenue. The government simply wants to take the Australian people's share of mining profits back to around where it was in the early 2000s. The Howard government was not overtaxing the resource sector then, and this government won't either. In fact, we will get the same share with a more proinvestment tax structure. The reforms will broaden and strengthen the economy, ensuring all sectors grow in a sustainable way that benefits all Australians. We must finally grapple with the policy failures of past mining booms by ensuring the resource and non-resource sectors grow together, not apart. Of course, we have analysis to support this. Independent modelling by KPMG Econtech of the RSPT and the effective aboRelition of royalties says resource investment increases by 4.5 per cent, resource sector employment by seven per cent and resource sector output by 5.5 per cent. The modelling for also shows that the tax reform packageincluding the RSPT and our cuts to company tax-will actually reduce the price of food and housing. min- National conversation In the last week I have travelled across most Australian states discussing the story of our budget, a story of our nation's successful navigation of the global recession. I have also been discussing our economic plans for at the future, including our important tax reforms. I have met with big miners, and smaller miners. I have met with some of the people who will pay more tax given current high profits under our proposal. I have also met with many of the businesses who will pay less. People have explained their concerns about how the last boom was handled, how capacity constraints and an infrastructure deficit choked growth. I have also spoken to South Australian and Victorian manufacturers, and Queensland tourism operators, who have outlined the challenges created for them when the dollar is high. As a Queenslander, I recognise the particular importance of resources to my home state, but also to Western Australia. I have seen the problems of infrastructure deficits in cities and towns along the Queensland coast. My many visits to Western Australia have convinced me of the need to keep reinvesting in the resource-producing regions. The government's infrastructure fund is designed to do just this. It will provide a permanent structural source of funding for infrastructure, especially targeted at resource states and regions. It will start at $700 million in 2012-13, and grow over time, delivering more than $5.6 billion in additional funding over the next decade. Countering the myths I welcomed the opportunity over this past week to get out and engage directly with businesses, especially the mining sector. Now, I am the last person to stand here and tell this House that the miners with our plans. Those who will pay more tax are unhappy, and I will not whitewash that. But you cannot make big reforms, and you cannot attempt to remedy the policy failures of past mining booms, while keeping everybody happy. It might be the job of those opposite to pretend you can, but government is a very different and a much harder business. I used my time with miners this week to explain the core design features of our RSPT. I discussed with them that we were effectively abolishing royalties by refunding them against the RSPT. That the 40 per cent rate is fair because it gets us closer to where our tax take was in the past. It is also the rate of the existing resource rent tax that has been operating for 23 years. Sometimes in these discussions I heard a few myths, and I want to deal with those now. The first is that this tax threatens Australia's economic prosperity. Nobody disputes that the existing arbitrary and continually changing state royalty regimes result in less mining investment, fewer mining jobs and less mining production. Royalties tax production and ignore the costs involved in generating that output. Many of our mines shut down too early, while others can't ever get off the ground. It also means we poorly manage our resources-we leave too many commercially viable resources in the ground, purely because royalties make them uneconomic. Similarly, all reputable economists agree that resource rent taxes like the RSPT do not affect investment, jobs or production. I encourage members to read the article by Ben Smith from the Australian National University in today's Canberra Times, or other pieces by Professor John Freebairn from the University of Melbourne and, of course, Proare all thrilled fessor Ross Garnaut. Second, some have claimed the RSPT is a triple tax on mining. The leader of the miners' campaign, Clive Palmer, even talked about a 70 per cent tax. This is blatantly false and has never been substantiated. The RSPT will not be imposed on top of royalties and company tax. It will effectively replace royalties by providing firms with a refundable tax credit for royalties. Where royalty payments are higher than the RSPT liability, firms will get a cash refund for the difference. The RSPT is also deductible against company tax. Regrettably, even some sophisticated commentators have talked about the theoretical maximum rate of 56.8 per cent as if every project will pay that rate. This is incorrect for a number of different reasons. One reason these estimates are wrong is that they ignore that the RSPT only taxes super profits, not all profits. If a project not generate super profits it does not pay any RSPT. And it will benefit from a company tax cut to 28 per cent and the government refund on the royalties it pays. Firms that have lower profit levels will have a lower effective tax rate-for example, on reasonable assumptions a project with a risk-free return of 15 per cent-still a very, very healthy return-might still have an effective tax rate of 45 per cent. However, even this calculation is an overestimate, because it does not allow for the generous company tax concessions that mining companies already benefit from. The effective company tax rate for mining companies is well below the statutory company tax rate. This is due to a range of concessions that benefit the mining industry, most particularly generous deduction concessions. Independent research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, and co-authored by Professor Shackelford and Kevin Markle, looked at company tax concessions across industries and countries. They found that domestic mining companies in Australia face an effective rate of 17 per cent and multinationals face an effective rate of 13 per cent. That is well below the statutory company tax rate of 30 per cent. Perhaps the most pervasive myth is that every return over six per cent will pay resource super profits tax. I regret to say this is a calculated and deliberate misrepresentation. If you hear a mining executive saying it, they are either lying to you or they are also ignorant-either way it should be of concern to their shareholders. It deliberately ignores three offsetting elements of the tax design. Royalties are redoes bated; RSPT is deductible against company tax; and the company tax rate is being cut. Once you add the combined effect of these elements, a project earning six per cent in fact pays substantially less tax under our reforms. So for those-especially those oppositewho say the uplift factor is somehow a tax on entrepreneurialism, I say this: compare the RSPT to current royalties, which tax every dollar of return you get. But they don't stop there. Royalties also tax your wage costs, your operating costs, this on top of applying to your investment costs. Royalties tax you before you even make a profit. Another myth is that the economic impact of taxes depends only on how much money they raise. Every serious economic commentator understands that different taxes have different impacts, depending on how they are structured. A core finding of the independent tax review is that raising a dollar of revenue through different taxes has different impacts on growth. Royalties are one of the worse Douglas taxes for growth; resource rent taxes are one of the best. Shifting revenue from royalties to resource rent taxes increases growth, including in the resource sector. This is because it reduces the tax paid by the smaller, more marginal mines, and increases how much we charge for the use of the highly profitable mineral deposits. And, because they are highly profitable, production will continue regardless. That is why these reforms will improve our economy. The government's very strong view-and the Treasury's view-is that our reforms will grow the mining industry and the broader economy in the longer term. Again this is supported by independent economic modelling. Investing the proceeds So let us talk about the benefits of the package as a whole for a minute or two. All revenues from the RSPT will be used to deliver a stronger economy for Australian families. About a third of the package will directly assist the resources sector. This will delivered through the resource exploration rebate and the new ongoing infrastructure funding. Our plan will also improve the competitiveness of the entire economy. It will deliver a company tax rate cut for all companies. The general company tax rate will be cut to 29 per cent from 2013-14, and to 28 per cent from 2014-15. Small business will get a head start, with the rate cut to 28 per cent from 2012-13. Small business will also have access to instant write-off of assets up to $5,000 and a single depreciation pool for most other assets. These changes promote growth across the entire economy, giving some of our other industries a better chance to compete on the world stage, even with the continued success of our resource industry. We are also determined that Australia should have something lasting to show from the sale of our non-renewable resources. We cannot squander the next boom like those opposite squandered the last one. That is why the government will boost national savings. We will boost savings through an increased superannuation guarantee, phased over 10 years. We will also boost savings by making superannuation concessions fairer for lowincome earners, and we will provide more generous contribution caps for the over 50s looking to make catch-up contributions to their superannuation. And we will introduce a 50 per cent tax discount on interest income, including on deposits held with any bank, building society or credit union, as well as bonds, debentures and annuity products. Nature of the debate Let me comment on how this debate has played out over the past few weeks. As I said earlier, I did not expect our reforms to be greeted with singing miners in the streets. Nor did I expect any support for strong economic reform from an opposition that be showed last week it has completely lost what little grip it ever had on economic policy. If you really want to judge whether to believe the Liberals' scare campaign, look at what they do, not what they say. In the very week they were saying the mining industry would totally collapse, one of their most senior frontbenchers was buying shares in BHP because he thought they offered good long term value. But let me talk about the reaction from the sector more generally. I welcome Ross Garnaut's call for a rational and reasoned debate on the RSPT-this of course is a call that has been echoed by John Hewson. As Professor Garnaut has said, the campaign against the RSPT has been long on rhetoric and threats and very short on reasoned argument. John Hewson has said that a lot of posturing is going on, but in policy terms this tax is right. Ben Smith, one of Australia's leading resource economists, wrote today that: … the natural reaction is to think that the industry's predictions about its impact may well be correct. In fact, they are entirely false. He goes on to say: In fact, the only danger to future exploration and mining activity is the possibility that suppliers of finance might believe the industry's rhetoric. And David Buckingham, a former head of the Minerals Council, has lifted the veil on the hysterical scare campaign that some miners are still waging. Company reactions I have a lot of respect for the leaders of our business community. I do value their constructive input to any number of political debates. I say this publicly and I say it privately to them when we regularly meet or talk on the phone. I do expect a healthy degree of argy-bargy and brinkmanship with some people in business who do not want to give up any of their super profits. I understand their position. But even the mining bosses in their heart would know that there a rolled-gold case for a fairer way to tax industry. Their own submission called for a profits based tax. Unfortunately, we have had a relatively small number of large companies choosing to conduct a vocal and public campaign. It has also been very strategic: companies have taken turns issuing threats to investment, so as to create maximum publicity for minimum share price impact on their own companies. They have also been careful to put projects on hold, rather than cancel them, again to minimise share market impact. They can always be taken off hold later when neededas most think they will. As Professor Garnaut says, any project that is profitable before RSPT is profitable after. The opportunities from the mining boom are simply too big to ignore, even if the super profits are a little lower. The government will not be swayed by a political campaign from the miners. So I call on companies to engage properly in the consultation process. The RSPT is not going away, but generous transitional arrangements will be put in place, as we have said all along. These last three weeks have seen a few very noisy companies, and many more very quiet ones. I have been impressed by the quiet, professional engagement of some companies with our Resource Tax Consultation Panel. I do not think those companies like our RSPT any more than the noisy ones, but they do accept the right of the government to govern, and they accept our offer of consultation as genuine, and they are engaged with us in getting the implementation right. Since our announcement of the policy, we have had more than 80 companies engaging with the Treasury consultation process. This is is a serious commitment of time and effort the by government and business. We believe that it is important that all companies engage so that all views can be taken into account. Stronger Economy Every business in Australia and every working family in every corner of Australia has a stake in sustainable and broad economic growth. Our tax package is expected to grow the economy by 0.7 per cent in the long run, boost investment by 2.1 per cent and reduce prices by 1.1 per cent. I invite the House to compare this with the opposition's policy to lift the company tax rate by 1.7 per cent. Our modelling shows this policy will reduce GDP by 0.2 per cent, reduce investment by 0.55 per cent and increase consumer prices by 0.25 per cent. Australia has many significant economic advantages that can provide the foundation for growth and prosperity into the future, provided we get the policy settings right. This side of the House has a pro-growth, proinvestment policy to leverage Australia's strengths, but that side does not. Our substantial natural resources, strong growth in demand for our exports from countries in our neighbourhood and the quality and resilience of our people-as demonstrated most recently during the global financial crisis-give us cause for confidence that Australia's best days lie ahead. We are also confident that our reforms will maximise Australia's opportunities while also meeting the challenges posed by the ageing of our population and shifts in the global economy that will see the return of boom conditions in our mining sector. We never expected this tax to be applauded by every company, domestic or foreign. But we do expect our reforms to build a broader, stronger economy for working families and that, after all, is why we are all here. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for North Sydney to speak for 19 minutes. Leave granted.",73
132,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Hockey speaking in reply to the ministerial statement period not exceeding 19 minutes. Question agreed to.,78
133,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The Treasurer today put the government's case for a great big new mining tax on Australians. He has locked the government in. He has emboldened the government's case for the tax. So be it-the battlelines are drawn. The coalition believes that this is a bad tax. We will oppose it as an opposition and we will rescind it in government. The government's case for this new tax is built on an enduring untruth. The economic rationale behind it is that it is an inefficient royalty system that is being replaced with a more efficient resources rent tax. It is claimed this will lead to greater investment in the industry and stronger growth. This argument might make some sense if the total tax take from the mining industry was unchanged, but this is not the case. The government's own projections suggest that the new tax will increase net tax revenue by $3 billion in 2012-13 and $9 billion in 2013-14. This is a huge additional impost on the resources sector. The ATO tables which I sought to table today but which the Prime Minister refused to recognise-the actual tables that record the dollars received by the government from the mining industry-tell the truth about the state of the contribution of the mining industry more generally. ATO table 8 states that the mining industry paid $8.1 billion in company tax in the 2007-08 financial year. In that year they also paid $3.9 billion in state government royalties. While company tax can be expected to rise over the next few years as a result of higher commodity prices and higher mining company profits, the additional tax take of $9 billion a year net represents a very significant additional impost on for a these companies. It is something like a 100 per cent increase in the contribution of the mining companies to the federal government. This is the bottom line. This is where the debate is at. The government will mouth weasel words about all sorts of transitional arrangements, but understand this: the bottom line is the government collecting nearly 100 per cent more in revenue from the mining companies each year as a direct result of this tax. I note the government does not have the agreement of the states to abolish royalties. Royalties will still exist. We have been advised that companies will need to maintain four sets of books. Even though royalties will be rebated in part, the inefficiencies will remain. The royalty rebate applies only to royalties in place or foreshadowed on 2 May 2010. There is absolutely nothing to stop the states from lifting royalties from current levels. The government has not committed to refunding any additional royalties. If it does not, then the mining companies will pay twice and pay more-a much forgotten piece of the policy debate at the moment. There is much debate about rates and transitional arrangements. It is still the case, even by the Prime Minister's own claims, that anything above the long-term government bond rate of around six per cent is deemed a superprofit. The fact of the matter is that the long-term bond rate is seen as a riskless investment by investors. It is AAA rated and a six per cent return is clearly insufficient. Investors I have spoken to in the United States and the United Kingdom about international benchmarks declare that in the US they are looking for a 15 per cent after-tax return on investments and outside the US it is about 20 per cent in returns. Even the appearance of Australia Post before Senate estimates today was quite telling. My colleague Senator Cormann asked, ‘Does that put Australia Post in the category of earning superprofits?' Australia Post replied, ‘I wouldn't have thought so, Senator.' Senator Cormann then asked, ‘So you don't think a return on capital of 12.2 per cent is a superprofit?' Australia Post responded, ‘I wouldn't have thought so, Senator.' Senator Cormann asked, ‘Why not?' The reply was, ‘I think it is a reasonable return on equity.' So it is okay for Australia Post to have a return on equity of 12 per cent, but for anyone involved in mining where of course there are significant risks, which I will allude to a little later, that is deemed to be a superprofit. The government claims that increasing the total tax take from an industry will lift investment and growth. It seems difficult to believe that lifting the tax take will lift economic activity. If that were the case, it would seem to be a simple policy decision to increase Australia's economic growth through the simple expedient of raising taxes. There would be few commentators, if any, who would agree with that proposition. Indeed, I refer to BHP Billiton's notice to the Australian Stock Exchange that in the year to 30 June 2009 their effective tax rate, including company tax royalties and production taxes, was 43 per cent. The average between 2004 and 2009 was 42 per cent. The government would have us believe that it is somewhere between 13 and 17 per cent. CEOs of small, medium and large sized companies have an obligation under section 181 of the Corporations Act to act in good faith-to tell the truth, effectively-and their statements to the Stock Exchange, from the larger ones at Fortescue right through to the smaller players, are all warning of the real impact of the government's tax on declared projects. We can also look at the experiences of other countries which have suffered loss of investment and growth in the face of regulatory uncertainty. This would all appear to indicate that an increase in taxation will be negative for the mining industry. The government's own rhetoric seems to contradict its claims that an increase in taxation is to the benefit of business. The Treasurer notes that the cuts to company income taxes: … promote growth across the entire economy, giving some of our other industries a better chance to compete on the world stage. The coalition would not disagree with that. However, reducing taxes leaves more money in the hands of business for them to invest and create jobs. Reducing taxes lowers the dead hand of government on business. It seems inconsistent for the government to claim that increasing the tax take from the mining industry will lift investment and growth at the same time they claim that they have got to lower company taxes to stimulate investment and growth. The Treasurer says that in the last week he has travelled across Australia discussing the government's changes to taxation. I have also travelled across Australia over the past week discussing the proposed new super mining tax and I have received a very negative reaction to the tax. This was not just from the mining companies but also from the industries which service this sector such as manufacturing and services, from the workers who are employed in mines and associated activities such as transport, and from local government and state government officials. They were all very concerned about the impact of this tax on investments and jobs. I noted the Premier of Western Australia being repeatedly and outrageously verballed by the Prime Minister during question time today in that regard. All of these business people, from small business to large business, are very concerned about the impact of this tax. They do not accept that this great big new tax will be good for their businesses or for their employment. The new tax will apply to all mining activities. It is not just the big companies which mine minerals in strong demand from offshore, such as coal and iron ore; it will also apply to gravel, sand, clay for bricks and rock for aggregate-the base materials which feed directly into Australian industry. Increasing the taxes on companies involved in other areas will reduce their profits. This either cause them to absorb it or increase their prices-a simple equation. The increased prices will feed into the costs of building homes and factories. They will impact on every Australian. Unquestionably, it will lift the price of building homes, factories and infrastructure. The government claims the mining industry does not pay its fair share of taxes. Data provided by the mining industry and based on ATO data shows that the mining industry's average corporate tax rate on income was 27.8 per cent. Including royalties, that was lifted to an effective tax rate of 41.3 per cent, the highest of all industry sectors. This compared with an average across all industry sectors of 27.18 per cent. I note that the finance and insurance services sectorbasically the banks-paid 21.5 per cent. Therefore, if this is a tax that other industries think will only apply to mining under Labor, they should think again. The Treasurer claims the intention of the changes to the tax system is ‘to build a broader, stronger economy'. We certainly support that objective. During our last term in government, the coalition doubled the size of the economy. We did that through real tax reform, with the introduction of a broad based consumption tax and the elimination of a raft of inefficient state taxes. Reducing the number of taxes is real reform. Labor is not reducing the number of taxes; it is increasing the number of taxes. The coalition also boosted economic growth by keeping taxes low, by running surpluses, by repaying Labor's debt, by reducing the regulatory drag on business and by reform of the financial system. Most importantly, we maintained an environment which encouraged foreign investment in Australia. Since the announcement of Labor's resource tax, there has been considerable disquiet expressed from commentators offshore. will Moody's Investors Service said on 17 May that the government changes to the taxation of the mining industry ‘could reduce earnings for firms by nearly a third after it takes effect in mid 2010'. They went on to say: Australia's mineral resources will stay put, but global producers such as BHP, with half its assets in Australia, and Xstrata, with a third, can decide whether to extract the minerals or shift some operations to lower-cost countries to avoid the higher tax regime. The government has cast this tax as a justified way of recouping income from foreign shareholders who are in some wayoutrageously, according to our Prime Minister-taking something that belongs to Australians. On 4 May, the Prime Minister was quoted as saying: These massively increased profits … built on Australian resources are mostly in fact going overseas. That is what the Prime Minister, who is meant to be encouraging investment, said. The Treasurer continued this assault on the miners with his comments today that mining executives were either ‘lying' or ‘ignorant'. I do not think this is the right way treat someone from whom we want investment or dollars. The greatest bone the government is throwing to people it wants to invest in Australia is, ‘If you lose $100, we will give you $40 back.' Anyone who has been on a roadshow, as I have, knows that, when you ask someone for $100, you want to give them more than $100 back. It is in fact no incentive at all to give someone the line: ‘Good news, guys! If you lose your money, you'll get 40 per cent of it back.' That is not a sell job. That is not something you can say to international investors, nor to Australian investors for that matter. What the government forgets is that Australia is critically dependent on foreign capi- lians. tal. Australia has never had sufficient savings to finance the investment we need to build the country, to build business. Australia is currently importing $17 billion of capital every quarter from overseas investors. It is critically important that Australia do everything it can to preserve faith in Australia safe and dependable place to invest and do business. We the coalition believe that you do not win a game by hampering your bestperforming player. The mining sector is hugely important to our prosperity. It is an industry where Australia has an international comparative advantage. Mining accounts for nearly two-thirds of the value of Australia's exports of goods and half of Australia's total exports of goods and services. Mining directly employs 172,000 Australians. Most of these are in regional areas. In 2008-09, mining accounted for fully one-third of all business investment. The crucial importance of this for the Australian economy overall has been recognised by the RBA. In its May statement, it said: … mining investment has been at record levels as a share of GDP and further increases are expected, with very large projects in the LNG, iron to ore and coal sectors. This pick-up in investment will support growth in the Australian economy at a time when the boost from the earlier expansionary policy settings is diminishing. Beyond these direct advantages of mining, there are huge economic benefits for associated industries such as manufacturing and various mining services. This new tax does not just hurt overseas shareholders-it hurts Australians. If you use a conservative industry price-earnings ratio of 10 to one, taking $9 billion a year from the industry's earnings will reduce the net worth of companies which comprise the industry by around 10 times that number or $90 billion. This reduces the value of shares held by AustraThe new tax regime also carries significant fiscal risk. The revenue gained from the resources industry will vary according to the cycles in demand and prices for commodities. The industry is currently riding a period of strong demand and high prices, but it is as a not always so. It was only 10 years ago, at the beginning of the 2000s the Treasurer referred to, that demand was weak and prices were low. The government has tied this new tax to a regime of spending which will inevitably rise over time. This is the point I made at the Press Club. This mismatch between ever-rising spending and cycles in resource revenue is building a structural imbalance into the budget. This is not responsible nor sensible fiscal management. In this respect, I note that the Treasurer said in his address today that he: … wants to take the Australian people's share of mining profits back to around where early 2000s. That was a time when the mining industry was in the depths of one of its regular cyclical lows and there were plenty of mining engineers and geologists driving cabs around Perth. The industry has advised that this was a time when it was barely recovering the costs of its investment capital. This period is hardly a rational benchmark for determining an appropriate share of profits. We do not agree that entrenching that state of affairs would be good for the resources industry or for the nation. There is another aspect to this new tax regime which increases the risk to Australian taxpayers-the proposal for the government to share in the losses as well as the profits from resource operations. The reason why we are reluctant at this stage to get into a debate about modelling is that the government keeps talking up transitional arrangements, which adds to the uncertainty for investors and leaves everyone wondering whether the government truly knows what it is doing. The best illustration of that is its commitment to pay for 40 per cent of the losses. The government will refund accumulated RSPT losses at the 40 per cent RSPT rate when projects are closed. In the 2008-09 financial year, one major company closed an unsuccessful project with a write-off of US$3.6 billion. Under the Treasurer's plan, this would have rendered the Australian taxpayers liable for up to US$1.6 billion of that loss. Note that in the parliament the week before last I asked the Treasurer exactly how much money is budgeted for to allow the government to write out cheques to those businesses that fail. The Treasurer refused to answer the question. The fundamental question is: is this Treasurer being honest with the Australian people? We know he is not, because a motion was it was in the passed by the Senate: That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Treasurer, no later than noon on Thursday, 13 May 2010, all modelling, costings, consultancy statements and other relevant documents used by the Government to inform its response to the ‘Henry Review' (Australia's Future Tax System report). The government has not done that. So the government is happy to provide us with a model without any inputs. It is happy to claim that it has modelled our taxes, but it will not release any modelling of what it wants to do to the Australian people. This illustrates that the government has failed to think through this scheme. The government has failed to think through the impact of this new tax on Australian jobs or on foreign investment. It is one thing to talk about economic modelling, which might appeal to all the tax boffins, but the fundamental issue is whether people have confidence to invest in the mining sector in Australia as a result of this government's tax. Emphatically, the people who actually run the companies, the people who employ people, are saying ‘Not with this tax' and the coalition joins them in that charge. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 2010-2011 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 2) 2010-2011 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 1) 2010-2011 Second Reading Debate resumed.",78
134,Ms RISHWORTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Before question time, in the debate on the appropriation bills, I was talking about the importance of the GP superclinics and, in particular, the positive impacts that similar clinics-the GP Plus Health Care Centreshave had in South Australia. That impact has seen, as I mentioned before, a decrease of presentations to A&E by 13 per cent from the postcodes in which the GP Plus Health Care Centres are operating. This is a particularly important initiative and I know that people in my electorate are very much looking forward to the opening of the Noarlunga GP superclinic, which is being built as we speak. However, it is not surprising to see, when we look at the opposition's response to the budget, money once again being ripped out of the health area. The Rudd government is committed to health. That is why we have a national health and hospitals plan and why we are committed to delivering good quality health care to people around the country. The Rudd government is also committed to the provision of quality childcare services. It is an important and very rewarding investment for the future. I regularly visit a of childcare centres throughout my electorate of Kingston. It is evident that childcare centres, parents and staff all want to ensure that children are receiving the best quality care in their important formative years. The budget provides over $273 million over four years to raise the quality of early childhood education and care across Australia. This funding will mean that parents within my electorate can be assured that their child will be receiving quality care by trained staff. Where needed, centres will receive capital upgrades to help services to meet the national quality standards. Families within southern Adelaide who have access to the Hackham West community JET creche can expect additional federal support for the provision of their much needed services. This is a key message of the government that families can rely on getting quality services through improved amounts of federal funding. Access to justice is also a right of all Australians. In a further display of the government's commitment to the people in my electorate and right around Australia, the government is to invest an additional $145 million over four years in legal assistance programs. An amount of $83,700 is to be provided to the southern Community Legal Centre for the Family Relationship Centre pilot to ensure they continue to deliver legal advice and assistance for separating families. This is a particularly important provision for any family going through a time of separation. It is extremely hard and very distressing and it is imperative that these people continue to receive quality legal assistance. The government acknowledges the importance of providing a dignified and secure retirement income. As part of the budget commitment, from 1 July 2013, the superannuation guarantee will be increased from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This is an exlot tremely important step that will significantly improve the retirement income and, indeed, the quality of life for many people when they retire. Even someone who is now 50 years of age will be approximately $22,000 better off at retirement, indicating just how important this measure is. Compulsory superannuation has been one of the great legacies of previous Labor governments. I am very proud that the Rudd Labor government is building on the previous legacy to ensure that when people do reach retirement they can establish, through superannuation, a better quality of life for their future. Further to these improvements in superannuation, the government has also offered generous tax breaks to older Australians who have low super balances to help them boost their superannuation savings. Workers over 50 years of age with a total superannuation below $500,000 will be able to make concessional superannuation contributions up to $50,000. An additional $500 will be provided to workers on incomes up to $37,000 effectively refunding the tax that they already had to pay on super. This will have a positive impact on countless moderate income earners right around Australia and also in my electorate in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. The Rudd government remains committed to ensuring that all Australians are able to enjoy a secure retirement. Right around the country the Rudd government has provided pensioners with greater flexibility in how they receive their payments. As part of the budget, from 1 July 2010, pensioners will be able to choose to receive their pension supplement quarterly rather than fortnightly. This provides pensioners with greater flexibility and choice in how they receive their payments. It also builds on, I think, the significant contributions that this government made in the last budget, the substantial reforms to pensions where, since coming to office, the age pension has been increased by more than $100 a fortnight for singles. This equals a real change in the quality of life for pensioners my electorate of Kingston. Australia does need more electricians, carpenters, chefs and welders-just to name a few. We need more apprenticeship training. That is one of the matters that comes up regularly as I visit communities. Young people tell me that they want to upskill themselves and to make sure that they are preparing themselves and getting the best opportunity to enter the workforce in skilled employment. One of the particular things that has been widely welcomed in my electorate was the Apprentice Kickstart program initiative announced as one of the responses in the global financial crisis to try and ensure that companies, despite having difficulty during the global recession, still continue to take new apprentices. That is why the Rudd government is investing almost $80 million to extend the very successful Kickstart initiative. As mentioned this initiative has already boosted the traditional apprentice numbers above the pre-global recession numbers in just one year. There were 24,400 young Australians who began an apprenticeship in the traditional trades last summer. I think this is a particularly important initiative. I note that in my electorate in southern Adelaide the Kickstart program has helped 92 local apprentices to get a start in their chosen field, and that is really important. I was speaking to one of the local building companies in my electorate that is undertaking a number of constructions with the Building the Education Revolution. They told me is that, because of the work that the Building the Education Revolution has provided, they too have been able to take on apprentices in the traditional trades to upskill them. The government is really committed to this measure and upskilling our nation was a particular focus in the budget. We invested over $660 million in the budget to ensure that our training system is responin sive to the skills needed in our economy. This is in stark contrast to the opposition, who have shown a complete disinterest in how we might tackle the skills shortage. It is very disappointing not just to me but to many in my local community that the opposition have announced that they will scrap the trades training centres in schools. This is really threatening an opportunity for young people in my electorate in the southern suburbs of Adelaide and right across the country to gain the skills they need for the future. I know how really important it is because I have heard first hand from young people about how they want to take a different vocational path-maybe not year 12 and then to university to get a degree. They want to on study a trade and get skills but they also want to finish year 12. Scrapping the trades training centres in schools threatens the opportunity for young people to continue on with their year 12 and also perhaps to get a certificate. The coalition's announcement has threatened trade centres that have been planned in my electorate: Willunga high, Hallett Cove R to 12 school, Reynella East high, Wirreanda high and Seaford. They all enthusiastically took up the program of trades training centres in schools because they want to deliver good training. It has been needed in our community. Young people want it. It is very disappointing that the coalition have indicated that they will axe this program and perhaps put at risk those trades training centres in the suburbs I have mentioned. Turning now to the budget measures for small business. We all know that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. Over 9,000 small businesses in my electorate will benefit significantly from the budget. The budget will provide for every one of those over 9,000 small businesses to instantly deduct the costs of assets valued at up to $5,000-an increase from the current $1,000 limit. These are real savings for small business owners and will make a big difference. The other thing I have said many times in this place before is just how important the National Broadband Network is going to be for small businesses in my electorate. Despite the rhetoric we hear from the opposition, small businesses in my electorate have nominated lack of access to broadband as their No. 1 impediment to growing business and taking advantage of economic growth around the world. The plan to scrap the NBN as proposed by the opposition is of serious concern to many small businesses in my electorate. This is their No. 1 issue. I urge opposition to rethink their proposal to scrap the National Broadband Network. It is critical to improving productivity for small businesses in my electorate. As I said, it has been nominated as the No. 1 issue for small business in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. I would like to finish by saying that this budget the Rudd Labor government have put forward is a very economically responsible budget. It is one that really delivers on some of the successes we have had following the global financial crisis and will ensure that we continue to have a strong and prosperous future. (Time expired)",82
135,Ms LEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The government has just handed down its third budget. I remind the House that since coming to power, and under cover of the global financial crisis, the government has taken us from $22 billion in surplus to a deficit this year, 2009-10, of $57.1 billion. In the process, it has spent 60 per cent of the capital in three savings funds that were created by the previous government for national investment: the building fund, the health fund and the education fund. I was in the coalition government party room when then Treasurer Peter Costello announced that these funds would not be spent, that they would be used for investment and that the interest from these funds would be available as and when required. It is devastating to imagine that 60 per cent has already been spent. Next year the deficit is tipped to be $40.8 billion and the budget is expected to return to surplus in 2012-13. We do not believe that it will. The opposition's response to the budget finds two overarching problems. The first is that the two arms of policy, fiscal and monetary, are moving in opposite directions. Lazy and unrestrained fiscal policy means that monetary policy alone is controlling the the economy. This budget reveals that stimulus spending will continue until 2014, four years after the end of the global financial crisis. That is what I mean by lazy fiscal policy. But, meanwhile, on monetary policy, there have been six interest rate rises in a row. That is the first problem with this budget and this government's economic management. The second problem is its resource superprofits tax, which we find so abhorrent that we have centred our budget response around our determination to do all we can to make sure that this tax does not see the light of day. The government has described Australia as simultaneously suffering from the fallout of the global financial crisis-why else would we be continuing to spend the stimulus dollars, 40 per cent of which remained unspent only three months ago?-and being in the midst of a resources boom courtesy of our most globally competitive industry, mining. It is a boom that is apparently so problematic that it requires a superprofits tax to bring it back to earth. What is the government's response to this apparent inconsistency? They have talked about our two-speed economy due to the demand from China for our mineral resources from Western Australia, Queensland and offshore. I have actually never accepted this two-speed economy argument. I was pleased to see a paper by Deloitte released last week titled Clouds in the silver lining? The two speed economy and Dutch disease, which provides the analysis to debunk this argument. It is recommended reading and it states: Australia does not have a ‘two-speed economy'; it has thousands of industries operating at differensuring ent speeds, with price and resource adjustments taking place constantly. If states like New South Wales where the drivers of economic growth are the commercial property market and South Australia where the drivers of growth are public infrastructure projects and defence shipbuilding are falling behind, why is it the fault of states like Western Australia and Queensland where industries are booming? It is just not that simple. Take my electorate in the Murray Valley of New South Wales, where a town called Deniliquin is struggling with low water allocations, a savage drought and a declining in many of the activities which have made that town strong. In Deniliquin there is a small airline which is chartered regularly to Roxby Downs in South Australia, taking individuals who work in mining. The effect on Deniliquin is quite substantial. It is reasonable to say that the income from that fly-in fly-out charter is keeping some parts of the town of Deniliquin stronger than they otherwise would be. That is an example of why this is just not a straightforward exercise about an economy in one state performing in one way and an economy in another state performing in another. The government is running some crazy lines. They go like this: ‘Resources are more of a curse than a blessing; manufacturing and the services industries are falling behind; it's not the fault of debt-laden state governments who have failed to re-invest in their infrastructure; it must be the fault of the mining industry. How dare it pull so far ahead of the rest of us!' Mr Swan was in Adelaide last week talking about-in the new jargon-‘mining boom mark II' and remarked that, ‘The revenues from the resources superprofits tax will be invested in growing the economyAustralians benefit from the exploitation of non-renewable resources long into the future.' As an aside it appears we are being re-educated to replace the term ‘mining' with ‘exploitation of non-renewable resources'. The real problem I have with this statement is that it is the private sector, not governments, who should be making decisions about investment. For Mr Swan to talk about investments from the resources superprofits tax somehow growing the economy better than the private sector would is just plain ridiculous. I also note the Treasurer said that, ‘A high degree of flexibility within the workforce here in SA has helped avoid massive lay-offs and skills destruction.' I remind the Treasurer that there is one year to go before Julia Gillard's new workplace laws come fully into operation. I wonder if the same flexibility, which the Treasurer was remarking on and praising in Adelaide, will exist then? In the context of the resources boom, the Treasurer and other government ministers like to mention Dutch disease and raise the spectre of us having fallen victim to it. The Dutch disease theory is this: an increase in revenues from natural resources will deindustrialise a nation's economy by raising the exchange rate, which makes the manufacturing sector less competitive. It gets its name from the decline in the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands after the discovery of a large natural gas field. In fact it is cult to prove the relationship between an increase in natural resource revenues, the real exchange rate and a decline in another sector of the economy that is lagging-that is right; it is very difficult to prove. There are a number of different things that could be causing the appreciation of the exchange rate. There are so many factors at play and every economy is different. So in the Netherlands, which gave Dutch disease its name, economists have since argued that the decline in the Dutch manufacturing industry sector was actually caused by unsustainable spending on social services. Nigeria is also often quoted as a victim of Dutch disease. In fact the abundance of natural resources in that country gave rise to governments that were less accountable to the people, had little incentive for institution building and failed to implement growthenhancing reforms, and so higher corruption, more rent-seeking activity and greater civil conflict resulted. As economists have studied Dutch disease, they have found that to the extent it really exists at all, the manufacturing sectors with the highest capital intensity are less affected by windfall shocks and a diverse manufacturing sector is the key to being cushioned from resource shocks. We do have a high level of capital investment, the policy responses about a diverse manufacturing sector are there and this government has no right not to be acting on them. The present government used to lecture us about house prices going up and how that showed we were mismanaging the economy. I used to think it's not a bad problem to have if you own the house. It's a lot better than the house price going down. The mining boom is a good problem to have, but every boom is followed by a bust. Our previous 150 years of history tell us exactly this. I cannot bediffilieve that our Prime Minister really thinks China will sustain a never-ending commodity boom-and he has, in fact, pocketed the proceeds already. You cannot escape the fact that to levy a tax at 40 per cent and then make miners pay 28 per cent is a double tax whammy which singles this industry out for punishment like no other. The effective tax rate post supertax would be 58 per cent and if companies had a heavier level of debt, for which there is no compensation as the tax is currently designed, their effective tax rate could be as high as 70 per cent. I am taking into account the credits along the way and the fact that the supertax would be a deduction for company tax. Our tax system contains many complicated mechanisms to avoid the same income being taxed twice-dividend imputation, credits for withholding tax, separation of superannuation balances and so on. What really offends me about the resource superprofits tax is the double taxation aspect. The government claims that the tax will result in a 4.5 per cent increase in investment, a seven per cent increase in employment and a 5.5 per cent increase in output from the sector in the long term. They will not show us the modelling but we know it was based on the assumption that resources are location specific and therefore investment will continue to flow. This is illogical, as we all know that capital transfers freely around the globe. There are no shortages of resources around the world and capital can just as easily leave our shores. So much of the government's answers to our questions on this new mining tax centre around economic modelling. When has a Treasury model ever realistically demonstrated what will happen in the real world? It gives indications, it gives input and it gives suggestions, but for a government to rely on an economic computer based model to determine a policy as wide-ranging as this is an insult. I can recall when the Murray-Darling Basin Commission developed a model for environmental flows in the River Murray. It was sung from the rooftops by environmentalists at the time as demonstrating that, ‘We have to return flows to the Murray. It is absolutely essential.' From there the Living Murray Initiative kicked off and unfortunately for those who believe, as I do, that too much water is being allocated to the environment, there have been devastating effects on communities. I raise that, important though it is to my electorate, to mention that the model upon which the original analysis was based was inexact, because there was not enough scientific data about what happened with water flows, stream health and catchment health. There were 23 indicators of catchment health. They were not all built into the model. They built an assumption into the model that the river health would improve if you added more water, so of course there are no prizes for guessing what the model then predicted. If this model in Treasury is so good then the government should release the modelling. If they are basing their policy upon it too, if it is the rationale, then they should release the modelling. Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, I do not have it with me, but I could show you a table-and I will ask listeners to imagine this table-showing the top 15 countries in the world ranked by the volume of their reserves. Australia is one of the 15. Russia has more reserves of iron ore than we do, Guinea has more bauxite, Chile has more copper, China has more zinc, South Africa has more gold and Canada has more potash. We have the most nickel. Another table that I could show you would show the top 20 richest nations ranked by the value of their resources. South Africa and Russia are first and second, respectively. Australia is third. Then there are Canada, Brazil, China, Chile, USA, Ukraine and Peru, followed by 10 more. So as you can see, most metals have a very good geographic spread. If capital is taxed too heavily in Australia, it will move elsewhere. I was insulted by the government's dismissal of mining companies as repatriating profits overseas. They are an easy target, according to the government, because they are not really Australian. I was insulted. It is true that investment in Australian mining has more than doubled in the past decade. Approximately $150 billion of offshore funds have been invested to help extract Australian natural resources, much more than our own government has invested over this period. We do of course have a simple choice: either we use the savings of Australians or we use the savings of foreigners, and the savings of Australians are not there to the extent required for this investment. The town of Broken Hill in the west of my electorate has a fly-in fly-out operation to Olympic Dam. We have heard reports that that project is on hold. The investment required there alone would be $20 billion. Clearly, we need investment from overseas in order to realise these projects. That is a good thing and not something that our Prime Minister should be whispering about behind his hand as something that we should be ashamed of. The Prime Minister should not be suggesting that our mining industry is tainted by its overseas ownership. That is outrageous. At the very moment that he was doing this, my opposite number, Assistant Treasurer Nick Sherry, was in the Middle East selling Australia as a global financial hub for Islamic finance products! He has been spruiking changes to the managed investment trust regime in Australia to make Australia a more attractive destination for offshore funds, because of the stability of our financial services industry. I agree with all of that, but isn't it a little bit hypocritical of Prime Minister, at the same time, to be rubbishing those who would seek to put overseas dollars in investments in Australia? It is generally estimated that over 75 per cent of all cash generated by mining companies is invested back ‘in country'. Shareholders have received 25 per cent of the company's cash through dividends. So 75 per cent is reinvested back into projects or other projects, and 25 per cent is in dividends. That is what should be regarded as a fair share. According to Philip Lowe, Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank in Australia, the main task is to expand the supply side of the economy so that demand can grow solidly without causing inflation to rise. It is a much better problem to have than the other way around. The key to improving the supply side of the economy is investment and productivity growth. We have become a highinvestment country in recent times because of the resources sector, which has quickened the increase in our capital stock. Investment in Australia is high because of high returns on capital, particularly in the resources sector. This is not going to continue if Mr Rudd's super tax gets up. Mr Rudd believes that revenue from the resources boom is needed to invest in the nation's long-term human capital. With respect, this is a meaningless statement. As economists know, capital is the material means of production, and labour is labour. What raises living standards is sustained economic growth, a rise in the ratio of capital to labour. When that ratio improves, the value of labour's marginal product and therefore wage rates increase. That creates the prosperity that the government says it wants to secure and that we say is under threat from the resources tax. Remember, a dollar of tax is a dollar not invested. The real problem that we should all have the with the proposed mining tax is the way that the issue has been handled. The mining companies put their submissions into the Henry review process and were not consulted further. The government allowed some strategic leaks so that everyone sort of knew it was coming. The announcement on 3 May followed, but not the detail. A consultation panel has been formed so that affected mining companies can tell the government and Treasury officials how to make their tax actually work. You can imagine the opening line of the consultation process going like this, ‘We want to tax you so that we get $9 billion a year. We want the rate to be 40 per cent and everything above a six per cent cost of capital to be called a super profit. You tell us how to do it.' I am not surprised at the response from the mining companies. And it was all so unnecessary. All Treasury officials and government ministers had to do was to pick up the phone during the period of the Henry review process and talk. But, because the Henry review was so politicised, it took two years. It arrived with the government at Christmas time last year and was sat on for four months-so that we now have the problem that we do. Just think of what would have happened had the review being released at Christmas. People could have talked about it. Mining companies could have stepped forward and said, ‘Before the budget, when you make these announcements, we have got some ideas for you.' But no-the Prime Minister, so intent on micromanaging every stage of the process, had to be just a little bit too cute, and the problems that he now faces are entirely of his own making. Meanwhile, a multibillion dollar industry is supposed to enter a holding pattern and wait and see. From opposition there is one certainty we can offer the resources sector: we will vote against the tax in opposition and we will rescind it in government. I do not accept that the government believes its own lines on the resources tax. It is imposing the tax because it needs the cash. In the budget announcement, Wayne Swan referred to the lowering of personal income tax rates on 1 July. These were the tax reductions they voted against while in opposition and finally, through gritted teeth, agreed to just before the last election. The Treasurer is now spruiking these tax cuts as contributing to 85,000 more jobs. I do not necessarily disagree, but remember the Treasurer's statement that the resources tax will contribute to a seven per cent increase in employment. So the question is: if a tax cut is good for the economy, why is a tax increase such as the resources tax just as good for the economy? As policymakers what we should be doing is reducing the infrastructure bottlenecks to encourage more investment in our mining sector. The government's response? A new infrastructure fund, initially paying $700 million to the states. This is not a savings fund; this is a slush fund. I have covered the opposition's two main issues with the government's budget. We urge them to rethink the mining tax. The shadow Treasurer has proposed $46.7 billion in opposition cuts in response. (Time expired)",85
136,Mr HAYES,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I join with many members on this side of the House in fully supporting Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate bills. It would be remiss of me if I did not start my contribution to the debate on the legislation by saying that it is a responsible effort by the government to bring the economy back into surplus as quickly as possible. I know that in their scaremongering some time back those opposite were declaring that it was likely that the economy would be in deficit for a decade or more. But one of the responsible aspects of this particular budget is that we have designed it to bring the economy back into surplus in three years. I know there are others around who want to dispute that. The shadow minister at the table, Mr Robb, is already on record expressing a number of views about that. But I urge them to go to the document itself and see what plans and proposals are there, see what the government are doing to bring the economy back into surplus. I think it is evident to all those out there listening to this debate that we should put aside the scaremongering that is taking place here, put aside the politicking that is taking place here. Those who are serious about building the community will see that this is a responsible budget. I must stress that bringing the economy back into surplus in three years time is in excess of three years earlier than what was planned 12 months ago. Clearly, a number of things have happened over that period of time. Do not forget that our last couple of budgets were framed around a situation where we were planning our way through the worse economic crisis that had confronted the world in 75 years. That fact seems to have disappeared from this debate altogether. It certainly will not be raised on that side the chamber. They will not raise the fact that Australia was one of the only OECD economies that did not go into recession. The opposition finance spokesman is sitting at the table. The member for Goldstein criticised the government widely in his contribution to this debate. But, when he got down to talking about the world's worse recession in 75 years, he categorised that as being simply one quarter of negative growth. I think they were his words. In his view, the stimulus package was all about addressing one quarter of negative growth. I do not think there would be a person out there-and certainly no-one at school who has read the papers a little-who does not understand that this was a very serious world economic crisis. It required attention. We are not going point the finger at those opposite and say that we inherited office from a government that caused that crisis, because we know that is not true. But the thing is that we did not dict it either. We did not predict that there would be a crisis. We had to work towards addressing the situation, to overcome our position and to ensure that Australia's economy stayed in strong hands. It was only last week that the Secretary General of the OECD commented on this. It did not take me by surprise that one of the things that he had to say was that Australia's response to the global economic crisis was an exemplar to many of the mainstream economies. The fact that we went out and specifically targeted our stimulus package was something that was praised by the leaders of the OECD. That is what kept our economy from going into a recession-not one quarter of negative growth, as it is being portrayed now. It was not all that far back that we were all shocked-and clearly the Americans were shocked-when Lehman Brothers became insolvent. The American government did not of propose bailing that bank out. It was just going to be treated as a commercial reaction to the market. However, when that situation became more commonplace, the Bush administration found itself moving into prop up America's banks. In the land of the free they were moving into nationalise some of their banks to make sure that they kept them afloat. Look at the world's largest bank, the Bank of Scotland. It almost got renationalised. The British government, the British taxpayer, bought into 80 per cent of its shareholdings to keep that bank afloat. We are not talking here about one period of negative growth, a blip on the horizon when everything was hunky-dory. This was a very significant period in Australia's economic history, one that had not occurred into some 75 years and one that required an immediate and targeted response. For what it is worth, I was proud to be part of a government that took up the challenge to do that, to premake that response, even when those opposite tried to vote down at each and every opportunity our proposals to spend stimulus money. Whether it was education, infrastructure development or community infrastructure projects, they were all opposed by those opposite. We went on to guarantee bank deposits to keep our banks afloat. This did require a concerted effort, but it was left to one side of this place to put that effort in, to do the heavier lifting. We now reap from that the criticism of those opposite because there was a debt. Of course there was a debt. But, as opposed to what was being said 12 months ago, that there would be debt for the next generation, we are now paying that debt in three years. Without apology, this is not a pre-election spendathon. This is not the traditional election budget we had over the 12 years of the Howard government, where people were hooked on middle-income welfare-where people with household income of over $1 million still had welfare payments going to those households. This is not one of those budgets. This is in stark contrast to what we saw during those 12 years. This is moving to do something with this economy by returning it to surplus and then allowing market forces to be stimulated as a consequence. As an aside, Madam Deputy Speaker, last week I heard a comment that a former opposition finance spokesman, Barnaby Joyce, made on ABC radio. We are pretty thick skinned on this side of the place, we are used to a bit of criticism, but Senator Joyce wanted to criticise the government for not introducing the promised dental scheme. Mr Champion-Ha!",90
137,Mr HAYES,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"My colleague the member for Wakefield laughs. But the laugh is this: that bill has been held up in the Senate and been opposed by Senator Joyce, and now he goes on radio and say it is a disgrace that scheme has not been introduced. There is one way he can help that to be introduced, and that is to change his vote. This is the hypocrisy we have got to learn to live with, I guess. We hear the Liberal Party talk tough about cutting government spending by blocking and opposing measures, but look at what they have been doing. What they want to achieve would only make the deficit worse. Last week the shadow treasurer during his speech to the Press Club indicated that the opposition wanted to cut basic services to Australians, basic services that Australians actually rely on. They plan to cut funding for education and health. Why should we be surprised about that? The current Leader of the Opposition was health minister and he knows full well that he and his government took a billion dollars out of health. I know a lot has been said about it, but the facts remain. Look at the bottom line: a billion dollars came out of health. And that is not to wallpaper over the money that was taken out of education, particularly vocational education. All those things that have contributed to our skills and trades deficit over the time of the Howard government can be traced back to when they decided to rip money out of the education budget. I know a lot of crocodile tears are being shed at the moment for the mining companies, but it was not all that long ago that the mining companies were lobbying here because they wanted those skills. One of my boys was working in the mining industry for some time. They get paid quite well, I grant you that. That is probably why you could not get a power point put on in Sydney or Launceston or in the member for Wakefield's area in South Australia. The young fellows were out there working in the mining sector because, going back a number of years, it was booming then. But there are ebbs and the flows in the mining industry, and, like many others, my son got laid off and he is doing other things now. Now the boom is moving back into gear and we are seeing a two-speed economy developing. We do need to address that. We also need to look out for the interests of other businesses, particularly businesses that rely on the same basic skill sets that are used in the mining industry, particularly those mainstream trade areas which are in demand in the mining community but also in demand in a community that is still trying to recover from the worse economic crisis in living memory. Simply gutting education and health cannot be the way to go if we are clear about building a community for the future. I know the real differences being made so far in the south-west of Sydney. I see what we have been able to do there only through our funding of $16 billion in the BER. I do not know about the member for Wakefield but I have not had people knocking on my door in Werriwa and complaining about investing in their schools-not a one. I would challenge people opposite not to cower and oppose it when all your colleagues are around but to stand up when those photos are being taken at schools as we are opening these halls and new classrooms and commercial cooking facilities and say, ‘We actually it.' I do not get much opportunity to talk to principals who say, ‘We don't want this investment.' As a matter of fact, I do not get any of that. That is one of the things that have been particularly successful. I know that out of 9,500 projects there will always be something that will require attention and, to her credit, the Deputy Prime Minister is looking at addressing those issues. Mr Robb-$8 billion.",92
138,Mr HAYES,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"But like the member for Goldstein I have not got people complaining to me about schools. They would like more investment in the schools and they would like to see a greater role for the Commonwealth, although there will be budget limits to that. What we are doing, apart from putting money out there that is generating jobs, is producing those skills for the future. I do not want to have to do a roll call through the family but I also have a son-not the son working in the mines-who is a builder. For the last 12 months or so all he has been doing, in a succession of schools, going out there and constructing school buildings. All the young fellows I know who come to our house and eat us out of house and home are also working on these packages. From the Hayes household, I know what the stimulus package is doing. It means that these young people are in work. They are utilising their skills. I see more apprentices out there. This was the intention of the stimulus package. It is not what the other side I know want to hear. They are nitpicking, going through whether the projects should have been six metres this side or that side of the fence or whether somebody's sunlight has been blocked off. This was about generating jobs and generating jobs now to stimulate work in our community. All those employees getting work through these stimulus based projects are generating our really oppose local economies. I would have thought that concept was something that we should be applauded for. I know it is a bit hard for those on the other side to applaud because they voted against it and every other measure of the stimulus package, but they are things that really do need to be looked at in the cold light of day and acknowledged for what they are, apart from an investment in education. Bear in mind that every dollar you put into education will over the next 10 to 12 years actually have an economic dividend in a productivity increase and will generate people through tertiary education or into the trades et cetera. What it does is generate employment for us here and now. I see it first hand, as does everyone else, but those opposite are too afraid to admit it. The other big thing that is clearly on the way back, if you listen to what is being said, is a return to Work Choices. Perhaps that is not the word that will be used, but we are now being lectured about there being room is to have individual statutory employment contracts out there in the workplace. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, I was very involved in talking about ‘Your rights at work' when we were in opposition because I genuinely believe in it. I represent a working community. I see the mums and dads out there struggling with their mortgages. Most households in my electorate are supported by two incomes. I know how important this issue was. I also had-and I tried to table on many occasions for Prime Minister Howard-work statements from people who were getting paid less than the award. For the first time in living memory, it became legally possible to employ people and to change their conditions to below the award. I-and no doubt many other people too-have had people turn up in my office, or I have seen them in the street when I have been doing mobile offices, who have become physically and emotionally upset. I saw the real effect of that. I cannot point the finger just at those companies. When I spoke to the directors of one of the companies-it is on the record; I will not name the company again but it is a major pharmaceutical company-they checked through the law and they came out and said, ‘Yes, we are doing that.' I asked them for the reason they were doing it. I said: ‘I can see your profit line and I can all the other stuff. Why are you doing this to people in my local community?' Regrettably, and with some degree of embarrassment, they said, ‘Because we can.' The previous government made laws that allowed people to pay individuals below the award rate of pay. I saw the effect of that in electorates such as mine. Those in the previous government should hold their heads in shame. I understand why they would not want to go back to calling it Work Choices, but they must be reeling from the fact that their leader has now indicated that there is room for individual contracts in the workplace. Despite all the joviality about Tony Abbott's contribution to the 7.30 Report on Monday a week ago, if we have to get to the point where, unless it is scripted, unless you get it from me in writing, you cannot believe it, this is going to be an extremely low ebb in politics. We all know what the cut and thrust of politics is like. It is a very combative business that we are in. It is a hard business. We are out there to compete for the hearts and minds of people based on our ideals. We are trying to sell the ideals to people in this competitive world that we support one over the other. That is the basis of democracy. But, when we have the Leader of the Opposition coming out and saying, ‘You cannot necessarily trust everything I say unless you get it in writing,' it really demeans our whole concept of Australian democracy. I know he probably was not put up to that, and it is probably a rare display of honesty, one which will not go away, but if a backbencher said that I am sure the whips would take them aside and explain to them the error of their ways. But, when the Leader of the Opposition says it, you wonder whether that is now going to become opposition policy. One of the things I wanted to get across was community building. What we have tried to do throughout the course of our resee sponse to the world's worse economic crisis is to continue to build our community. Build it now and build it into the future is what this budget continues to do. (Time expired)",93
139,Mr HARTSUYKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate bills. I listened with interest to the words of the member for Werriwa when he talked about truth in this place. It is interesting to note that yesterday we had the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister of this country trying to tell us that the corporate tax rate paid by Australian mining companies was 13 per cent. Where did the Treasurer get that figure from? One would think that a reasonable Treasurer would rely on the advice of the Australian Taxation Office as the appropriate thing to do. The Australian Taxation Office says that the rate of tax paid by resources companies is 41.34 per cent. So when we ask about truth and integrity, which the member for Werriwa has raised in this place, the question is: why did the Treasurer of this country falsely claim-a political fraudthat resources companies are only paying 13 per cent? Why did he do that? The member for Werriwa is silent, and he is now slinking out the side door and even giving me a wave. But how could any Treasurer of this country misrepresent such an important figure? For what reason would he do that? When the Australian Taxation Office is telling you that resources companies are paying 41.34 per cent, why would you say the tax rate is only 13? Was he having a bad hair day? What was the reason? It was a gross misrepresentation made by an important public figure purely for the purposes of political spin. That is what this government is all about. That is what this Prime Minister is all about. That is what this Deputy Prime Minister is all about, because she also participated in this sport of misleading the Australian people, making the same false claims, going on with the same tripe. The people of Australia will judge them for that. You would never have seen Peter Costello get figures so drastically wrong as we saw our Treasurer and our Deputy Prime Minister do just yesterday. For what reason were they misleading the Australian people? Purely because the Hawker Britton book said: ‘We've got to have a diversion, we've got to have one of those weapons of mass distraction. We'll create some figures. Where can we get them from? We can't find them from the Taxation Office because those figures don't support the claim, so what we'll do is find a US student who produces figures that aren't even for Australia, they're for Australia and New Zealand, but that'll do. There are some published numbers out there on the internet, we'll bring them in and we'll try and spin a yarn.' Well, they have been caught out pretty badly using figures from a student, not from the Australian tax office, that were not even solely for Australia-and the members opposite try and talk about truth and honesty. What sort of ridiculous argument is that? Thirteen per cent? That's not far out! I guess that is Swan-onomics. Mr Dutton-It's a rounding error for Labor!",94
140,Mr HARTSUYKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Yes, Swanonomics. Thirteen per cent is pretty close to 41.34 per cent-it's not far out! They needed a distraction, they needed to bag the mining companies, so they just invented some numbers. What does that say about the credibility of the Treasurer? He keeps trying to justify it. I have to say that the Australian people will not wear that. In the same vein, the Australian people should rightly be concerned about Wayne Swan's budget. If he cannot quote figures accurately, if he cannot act with integrity, if he cannot properly reflect the taxation regime that applies to resources companies in this country, how can he be trusted with a $400 billion budget? He claims the most slender surplus in 2012-13 of $1 billion, but everything has got to go right for that to happen. We have to have low inflation at a time when we are having very strong growth and the most favourable terms of trade for 60 years, yet he is going to promise us a billion dollar surplus. Well, if he does not know the difference between 41.34 per cent and 13 per cent, if he cannot get that right, how can we trust him to get the budget right? Seldom in recent years have there been issues in this debate that are so clear. In recent years there have been arguments about whether the government has struck the right balance between different policy areas: health, education, the environment, agriculture, infrastructure and social security. Every government has to make choices. The arguments have reflected differing priorities amongst members of this House and, of course, differing political opinions. The arguments have been about what we as politicians do to shape this country and our society. But this year it is very different. I would go as far as to say that there is only one issue related to this budget that is really the central focus, and that is economic credibility. We saw, just yesterday, the Treasurer of this country shred his credibility by trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian people by quoting false figures in the media, as did the Deputy Prime Minister. This is a Deputy Prime Minister who cannot manage the Building the Education Revolution, who has presided over a massive cost blow-out in that program and in the computers in schools program. Where on earth would you find, in commercial practice, jobs being let for 10 times the proper rate? The worse thing is that these problems have been highlighted since last year. The Deputy Prime Minister has been warned that the government is paying too much for projects, that the government is being ripped off by state bureaucracies and that there is gross profiteering occurring in the program. Does she spring into action to save the public purse? No. What does she do? She sits on her hands, in a state of denial, trying to mislead the Australian people that all is well. She started off by saying, ‘It's only an isolated incident-this is not what is happening across the board.' But we now know it is happening everywhere. It is happening in New South Wales and in Victoria; it is happening right around the country. Taxpayers are being ripped off, and this minister, the heir apparent to Kevin Rudd's throne, is sitting on her hands waiting to glide into the position of Prime Minister, but she is not acting on this. She has appointed a task force. First she said, ‘There's an audit going on, so I don't have to worry.' What was the result of that audit? It simply compared one grossly overpriced project with another. It was not comparing the price of a building delivered in the private sector with the price of a building delivered under the BER program; it was comparing one grossly overinflated BER project with another BER project. It was an audit that was actually planned to fail. It was an audit that was planned to conceal the waste and mismanagement that this minister knew, or ought to have known, was part and parcel of this program. It is an absolute outrage, just as the Deputy Prime Minister's statement yesterday claiming that the rate of tax on resources companies was only 13 per cent is a blatant lie, a blatant untruth, which does nothing for her credibility as a potential future Prime Minister, I might say. What is really important with this budget is what has not been included. A very important item has not been included in this budget-that is, an increase in expenditure on the Pacific Highway. We saw over the weekend yet another tragic accident on this road. Far too many of my constituents have been killed or injured as a result of the poor state of the Pacific Highway, yet in this budget we do not see one additional dollar for the most important infrastructure project in this country. Freight levels are massively increasing and heavy vehicle traffic is massively increasing and yet we still have on the Pacific Highway B-doubles driving through the main streets of small towns and villages and B-doubles struggling to pass on very narrow bridges that were designed and built in the 1930s that are not up to modern traffic levels and are not up to the weights that are going across them. It will be only a matter of time before we have more serious accidents. Everybody knows that; the government knows that. Despite this fact, in this budget there was not one extra dollar for the Pacific Highway. Tragedies happen all too often. On the weekend I attended the 50th anniversary of the Halfway Creek Rural Fire Service. It was a great celebration of the great work they do. They said that most of the work they do now is not to do with fires; tragically, the most common call-out they have is to attend traffic accidents, mainly on the Pacific Highway. It is a national tragedy that deaths are still occurring that could be avoided. More resources need to be put into the Pacific Highway. Labor has form on poor budgeting. The Hawke-Keating government left us with $96 billion in debt. When the coalition came into power what did we find? We found a $10 billion budget black hole. The Labor government of that time was fudging the figures and concealing from the Australian people and the then opposition the exact state of the nation's finances. We have seen in just one term this government totally turn around Australia's fortune. We have seen this government turn a surplus into a situation of debt and deficit. The Australian people are rightly concerned. When I go down the street people say to me, ‘I'm worried that my kids and my grandkids will still be paying for Labor's debt.' That is precisely the situation. We have the promise of a convenient, wafer-thin surplus in 2012-13. That surplus is unlikely to be realised and it depends on a range of assumptions. The massive new mining tax is going to have to come into effect to balance the budget in the future. We have a dependence on future profits in the mining industry, which can be a very cyclical industry. The settings that this government is putting in place leave us absolutely unprepared for a potential downturn. When it comes to economic credibility and the resources tax, what are those in the industry saying? They are saying they do not trust this government. They are saying they do not trust this government with the prospect of paying back 40 per cent of future losses. They are saying they do not trust the government at all. If there are major mining losses, rather than mining companies being able to send a cheque to the government for $400 million or $500 million, the government will simply change the law at the time and avoid its responsibilities. So, rather than it being some form of safety net for junior miners, the industry sees it as nothing more than another hollow promise from this government. This government is all about underdelivery. We had the pink batts program. It was going to be a great environmental program. What happened? The taxpayer has been left with the bill for Labor's gross mismanagement and gross incompetence. I have many people concerned about the insulation that was put in their roof. We have got spot checks with the pink batts program. If the insulation put in your roof was faulty and your house burned down, it would be of little consolation to know that you were not randomly selected for a spot check. You suffer the same fate: your house is destroyeddestroyed largely because of the poor administration of this program. I have schools in my electorate complaining about the mismanagement under the Building the Education Revolution program, which I touched on earlier. We have had problems right across the electorate. Where there is a public school, there has been a problem with the BER program. At Eungai and Stuarts Point there are concerns. There are concerns about cost overruns at Scotts Head. And there are concerns about not getting what was required at Willawarrin and Corindi Beach. Where there is a project there is a problem and a cost overrun. It is just not good enough. The people of Australia have a right to pect that public moneys are expended in an appropriate way, that there is a proper focus on value for money, that there is a proper focus on due process and that their taxpayer dollars are not being wasted. Everywhere you turn this government has underdelivered. Everywhere you turn not only is their economic management suspect; their program management is suspect. People are getting very sick of it. As I go round my electorate the call comes out time after time: ‘Get rid of this lot before they drive us deeper into debt. Get rid of this lot before they make the country broke.' People are really concerned. Spin only gets you so far. On the weekend we saw the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer trying to spin the resources tax fraud that has been perpetrated on the Australian people with false claims about 13 per cent or 17 per cent. The truthful figures were available, but they were ignored conveniently by those two parliamentarians. This is a budget that raises more questions than it answers. It is a budget that leaves Australia in debt. It is a budget that is unlikely to achieve the projections that are in it. It is a budget that should be of concern to the Australian people. I certainly would not commend this budget to the House.",95
141,Mr CHAMPION,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"This budget has to be seen as all the previous budgets have been seen in this era in the context of the global financial crisis. We are still not out of that crisis yet and we only have to look at the events in Greece and the Eurozone economies to know that. We only have to look that far to see the IMF bailout and the problems in market confidence in terms of Greece to know that the effects of the global financial crisis are still very much with us. We only have to look to the United States, where they have just passed a major financial industries reform ex- bill, to know that the consequences of that crisis are still with us as well. If we look internationally at the No. 1 international economic problem, it is this global imbalance between the low savings rates of the developed world and the high savings rates of the developing world, most notably China. On top of that is the recycling of petrodollars where economic windfalls flow into OPEC countries and other oil producing countries, mainly out of the pockets of Western consumers. These are then reinvested in these established economies, often seeking relatively low rates of return. This has led to a flood of cheap credit over the last decade or so in developed economies. It is that cheap credit which has helped to fuel irresponsible lending in the United States and, in general, consumer indebtedness. That is something that we should all be concerned about. It is said by a number of economists that what has to happen now is for the developing world to start consuming and for the developed world to start saving again. We need this to happen because the combination of economic factors that existed prior to the global financial crisis produced a very large asset bubble. That bubble and the bursting of it produced the greatest threat to the financial system since the 1930s, since the Great Depression. We are lucky in many ways that we had the action around the world from different governments. I think Gordon Brown, the previous Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, while not electorally successful and having many detractors domestically, will go down in history as having saved the British financial system and probably, along with Ben Bernanke, the world financial system. Because of their actions, a crisis which could have been far worse was averted. That is not to say there has not been massive economic cost, particularly to working people who typically have to pay the price as a result of unemployment, budget cuts and wage cutsthe sort of restructuring we see in Greece today. It is in that context that we have to this budget. Australia was spared from many of the problems experienced by the United Kingdom and the United States, because of the government's actions and the nation's economic strength. The economic historians will probably be the true arbiters of this, but I think they will look back at this time and see the decisive action that was taken by the government-investing in schools, investing in infrastructure, investing in the economy, keeping consumer confidence at appropriate levels which helped to maintain economic growth, and backing the banks. The banks were well regulated and well capitalised-to give the pervious government its due-but the banks had to be supported by the government in terms of their wholesale lending guarantees nonetheless. Despite all of that, we have to note that Australia has a low savings rate. We have that in common with the rest of the developed world. If you take the superannuation system out, we have a savings rate which is the same as that of America-that is, it is probably in negative territory. The previous crisis just highlights the absolute importance of our superannuation system to our national economic buoyancy, to our national economic growth. I think that is the most important thing about this budget. It increases our national savings through the increases in the superannuation guarantee. This is something that has been very close to my heart all my working life. It is something that I have always believed in. It is something that I believed in the entire time. I was with the Shop Assistants' Union. That union has a membership which is predominantly young and female-people who were up until Labor's historic superannuation changes in the Hawke and Keating governments excluded from superannuation. see Previously workers like those in retail and hospitality were excluded from occupational superannuation and had no retirement savings. They were reliant on the pension. I have seen the consequences of that in my own electorate while I have been door-knocking pensioners who live week to week. I have seen the consequences of it and I have represented the workers who have the most to benefit from an increase in the system. We know that it has an important effect for individuals and for the nation overall. So the increases from nine to 12 per cent and the increments of 0.25 per cent in 2013-14and 2014-15-followed by 0.5 per cent increments until it reaches 12 per cent-allow employers and employees to factor them into their wage bargaining arrangement, and we hope that they go further in many instances. We hope that they make additional provision for superannuation. It is a good way of providing non-inflationary wage benefits to people because generally it does not get spent, it gets saved. These very important reforms add $85 billion to our national superannuation savings over the next 10 years. That helps set us up as a financial hub, it helps economic growth, it helps increase our national savings and it helps increase the amount of capital in the country. It is a tremendously important thing for the nation overall and it provides a cushion of national savings for any future economic shocks, which cannot necessarily be ruled out. We look at the events in the Eurozone and we know that the prospect of future economic shocks cannot be ruled out. That is one of the reasons why the stimulus, although it is tapering downwards, must continue. We cannot be sure that economic growth worldwide will necessarily continue. I think we must have a weather eye for what could happen. We have economists like Paul Krugman talking about a lost decade in the United States because of the withdrawal of stimulus too quickly. He speculates they may suffer the problem that the Japanese economy suffered in the nineties, where they had a terrible economic collapse and they had zombie banks roaming around the place not really functioning properly. They lost a decade of economic growth. That is a prospect that must be countenanced when we look at world economic growth. These superannuation savings are also terribly important to individuals. An 18-yearold will be $200,000 better off in retirement. A 30-year-old will be $108,000 better off. A 40-year-old will be $57,000 better off. Those figures highlight not just that individuals will benefit but that the earlier we get people to start saving for their retirement the better off they are and the more they end up with. The nature of retirement is that, when you are 18, you just do not think about it. When you get a bit closer to 40 you start thinking about it and when you are 50 you really start thinking about it. One of the key parts of this strategy for the nation's savings is that it gets individuals to start saving when it is not necessarily their highest priority. It is interesting that the Investment and Financial Services Association, which is headed by Mr John Brogden, called the government's superannuation increases a stunning win for Australians and strongly supported their introduction. Mr Brogden was quoted as saying: I congratulate the Government on today's announcement. Every Australian will benefit from increased savings. Australians will face retirement with greater security and confidence. Mr Brogden is of course a former opposition leader in New South Wales and not necessarily an ideological supporter of the government. So his support for the government's changes is notable. The changes are in the long-term national interest. They should receive bipartisan support. It is a great pity that they are not receiving bipartisan support. The opposition know that this is the right thing to do. They have always known that it is the right thing to do. Even when the previous government shelved the Keating government's plan, they knew it was the right thing to do. Many of them will acknowledge it to you privately. Ultimately, they will not dismantle any increases that we put in place if they return to government because they know that it meets a vital national economic need-that is, to increase our rate of national savings. Australia's long-term economic vulnerability has been that we have always had to draw in capital from overseas to fund productive investment in this country. It is in the vital national interest that we start to address that long-term vulnerability. We have also heard all about the problems of a two-speed economy. This is a common problem for resource-rich economies. High resources prices force up the currency value, which squeezes the nation's exportersagriculture and manufacturing. I have seen this locally in Wakefield. I have seen hay exporters complain to me about the high currency. I have seen the pressure it puts on wineries. I have seen first hand the pressure it puts on our car industry. I represent an electorate that relies on exports in nearly all of its major industries and a rising currency caused by a resource-rich economy places severe competitive pressures on the nation's exporters. There is also a tendency in a resource-rich economy for capital and labour to move to that expanding resources industry. Inevitably, this places pressure on the nation's nonresource based exporters to compete, both for finance and for skilled labour, and this tends to increase the cost of both for these companies. A boom in the sale of nonrenewable resources can severely affect the economic viability of the long-term wealth creators in manufacturing and agriculture. We do have to have an eye for when these non-renewable resources are sold. We have to have an eye for the long-term future of this country. We want a manufacturing industry and we want a viable agricultural industry to be there when the resources eventually, as they must, run out. The government's budget changes deal with this phenomenon by firstly ensuring that all Australians receive a fair share non-renewable resource revenue that is exported from this country. Secondly, they lower company tax rates to assist the nation's companies to develop, despite the challenges of a two-speed economy. The government's package lowers the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent by 2014-15 and small business gets a head start on this reduction, receiving it in 2012. That is a very important reduction. In the ranking of competitiveness, it takes us from the 22nd most competitive country to the 17th on current advice. Sole traders, those in partnerships and incorporated small businesses will be able to deduct assets up to the value of $5,000 in one year. They will be able to pool assets costing more than $5,000 and write them down at a single rate of 30 per cent. So businesses across the nation will benefit from these changes and, most importantly, they assist exporters who are at our economic front line. It is worth noting the opposition's approach to company tax-to these exporters, to the car manufacturers, to the wineries and the hay exporters who are confronting the difficulties of the world post the global financial crisis and who are facing the challenges of a two-speed economy. Their approach is to add to the company tax burden, to add 1.7 per cent to the current 30 per cent rate. They do this to fund their rather lavish parental leave scheme, a parental leave scheme that seemed to come out of the middle of nowhere. One minute we had Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, saying that he was against taxes. The next minute we had him saying that he was going to add 1.7 per cent to the company tax rate to fund a parental leave scheme that can only be described as upper-middle-class welfare, benefiting those who are very wealthy the most and slugging the nation's exporters to do it. By 2014-15, the difference between the of the Rudd government's company tax rate and a potential Abbott government's tax rate will be 3.7 per cent if you take into account the government's proposed reductions and the opposition's proposed increases. Essentially, the opposition say that miners should be let off the hook and we should let other exporters shoulder the full burden of the emerging two-speed economy. Essentially, they propose that an additional 1.7 per cent company tax burden should be put on the backs of our nation's exporters, at a time when they are struggling, to fund maternity leave proposals that reek of indulgent middle-class welfare. It is a massive impost to place on hay exporters, on wine exporters and on car exporters. It is a massive impost which will slug companies in my electorate in order, on the one hand, to kowtow to the big end of town-those who are making extraordinary profits out of the mineral wealth of this country-and, on the other, to lavish middle-class welfare on those who can afford to go without it. I think the Treasurer and Prime Minister should be applauded for their economic stewardship through the global financial crisis. In future, as I said, economic historians will debate this period in time. I sense that Australia will be held up as a country which had all the right policy prescriptions for what was a very serious crisis-and it could still be an uncertain economic future unless the world makes some pretty difficult decisions and embarks on appropriate global regulation to deal with these sorts of crises. This budget marks the beginning of a return to surplus in 2012-13 and a pathway out of the global financial crisis. Most importantly, it deals with the long-term international and national economic challenges, and I commend it the House.",98
142,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"When the Treasurer rose to his feet on budget night, for a moment or two I thought we had been transported back in time. But no, he was taking us forward in time to 2012 or 2013. The Treasurer spent most of his speech talking about what will happen three years from now. There was very little about what will happen during the next 12 months. It was bordering on the surreal. The Treasurer was supposed to be handing down a budget for the 2010-11 financial year, but all he talked about were events that may occur years from now. I believe there is a good reason for that. The Treasurer is highly embarrassed about his budget. For the second year in a row, the Treasurer is so embarrassed about the state of his budget that he finds it difficult to talk about it in detail. you remember last year when the Treasurer could not bring himself to say the word ‘deficit' within his budget speech? It reached such comical levels of absurdity that the Treasurer was avoiding saying the word ‘deficit' and the Prime Minister was avoiding saying that the projected government debt was $200 billion. They found themselves physically unable to say the words ‘deficit' or ‘$200 billion'. Again this year the Treasurer finds it difficult to talk about what is going to occur in 2010-11. That is because the Rudd government's spendathon continues unabated. The Treasurer is too embarrassed to admit that the headlong rush into massive debt continues. He is too embarrassed to admit that this government will be borrowing $700 million every week for the next financial year. This government's reckless spending and borrowing means that the interest bill alone on government debt in 2010-11 will be $4.6 billion. The budget reveals that the interest payments will be $6.5 billion by 2012-13. This is money that has to be found to pay the interest on the government debt. It is money that could and should have been invested in schools, hospitals and other important services for the Australian people. So how should the Australian people judge the Rudd government? The truth is that the Rudd government inherited the strongest set of national accounts since Federation when they took office in 2007. The Rudd government took over from the Howard government a budget that was more than $20 billion in surplus. There was zero net government debt and there were tens of billions of dollars in investment funds for the long term future of this country. Members will recall the Higher Education Endowment Fund, the $6 billion fund for universities. There were funds for healthcare research and more. Yet this Treasurer has now presided Do over the biggest turnaround in the national finances in Australia's history. This reckless government has spent money like water and plunged the budget deeply into deficit. Government debt will reach nearly $94 billion, and this is a debt that will be repaid by cutting government services or by the Australian people through their taxes. It will not be repaid by this failed Labor Treasurer or this failed Labor Prime Minister. It will be repaid by the Australian people. The government has raided many of the savings and spent, spent, spent. What does Australia have to show for it? We have witnessed a disaster unfolding in the school building program, which has been rorted to an unbelievable extent. It is a school building program that has fundamentally failed every test of good governance and every test of competent ministerial oversight. We have also witnessed the tragic home insulation program unfold where four young Australians lost their lives and thousands of people are living in homes with unsafe roofs. There have also been dozens of house fires. The program will cost almost as much to fix as it took to roll out in the first place. We have witnessed the litany of broken promises from the Rudd government. There was the failure to build the promised 260 childcare centres and the failure to build the promised 2,650 trade training centres with only 12 currently operational. The computers in schools program has delivered only a quarter of what the Rudd government promised for double the cost. The backflips and broken promises came so thick and fast in the weeks before the budget that it was impossible to keep track of them all. Let me turn to one of the Rudd government's most important policies. The Prime Minister called it the greatest moral challenge of our age. He claimed that climate change was so important, and that it was so necessary for his emissions trading scheme to be enacted before last year's Copenhagen conference, that to do otherwise would be absolute political cowardice. He said it would be an absolute failure of leadership. Yet the Prime Minister has walked away from what he described as the greatest moral challenge of our age. What kind of Prime Minister would say that climate change was the greatest moral challenge of our age, tell the Australian people he had a policy to deal with it and then walk away from that policy? That is, by the Prime Minister's own standards, an act of absolute political cowardice and an absolute failure of leadership. It is beyond belief that this Prime Minister can continue to expect the Australian people to believe any future commitment that he makes. The Treasurer's entire budget framework is based on a house of cards held up by a great big mining supertax. This tax strikes at the heart of Australia's future prosperity. We know that the Prime Minister would love for this debate to be about Kevin Rudd versus the big, greedy, foreign mining companies. He would love to portray this as foreign companies taking their profits overseas and ripping off Australians. But the truth is that this is a tax that will impact most severely on the 500,000 people who are employed directly or indirectly by the mining sector. Amongst that group there will be young families struggling to pay off a mortgage and raise a family. There will be thousands of small business owners who have sunk their life savings into ventures that support the mining sector. These are the people who will be casualties of the Prime Minister's supertax grab. It will not be the mining executives that this government is personally denigrating. It will not be BHP and Rio Tinto for, of course, they have options. They have obligations to their shareholders to operate in the most cost-effective environment to get the best returns on the investment. That is no longer Australia. They have options in other countries overseas, including Canada, whose effective tax rate will be less than half than that of Australia if this supertax is imposed on our mining sector. One can only wonder what message this government is trying to send to international investors. Surely this government is not intending to send a message that, if you come to Australia, invest billions of dollars in this country and employ thousands of Australians, you can then expect to be subjected to retrospective taxation on your investments and your mining executives can be subjected to vicious, personal attacks from the Prime Minister, no less. The Rudd government has sent a clear message to the international investment community that Australia is now a more risky investment environment. It is hard to believe that the words ‘Australia' and ‘high sovereign risk' are being used in the same sentence by the global capital markets. Every Australian government for decades has worked tirelessly to promote Australia as a safe and stable investment destination. This reputation has been trashed by the Prime Minister for the purposes of domestic political gain. To make matters much worse the Prime Minister continues to misrepresent key facts about the impact of this mining supertax. Question time today was quite a farce as the Prime Minister falsely claimed the status of a document, which he wished to rely upon to support the extraordinary claim of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer yesterday, that multinational companies in Australia pay 13 per cent tax and other companies pay 17 per cent tax. That claim was made in support of the government's imposition of this tax. It is just not true. Worse still the document upon which the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister relied was in fact a draft paper written by a student from the university of Carolina. It was not Treasury modelling; it was not a Treasury analysis; it was a paper done for a PhD student's thesis. We have to be deeply concerned when the Prime Minister is unable to describe what constitutes a superprofit. The Prime Minister said: Well, a super profit is calculated in this way. If you have for example, in a mining company, a normal profit is made up of revenues minus expenses. What's a super profit? Revenues minus expenses minus what we call an ordinary return on investment. How do we define an ordinary return on investment? If you took your investment capital and, for example, invested it at the long term government bond rate, that runs at about six per cent. That was the Prime Minister's description of a superprofit. Profits in excess of that he defines as super for profit. The Prime Minister went on to say: … what we do is say that those companies running those super profits can keep 60 per cent of that but 40 per cent of it, we believe, should come back to the Australian people in investment in better super for working families. This was another misrepresentation. The government has deliberately sought to mislead and misrepresent every aspect of this new tax. But that is the hallmark of the government. The government has misrepresented the total tax and royalties paid by the mining industry. The Prime Minister and his ministers have claimed the sector has only paid an additional $9 billion in revenue, when in reality it has contributed $80 billion over the period claimed. The government has been caught out using the statistics from the United States graduate student rather than the official published statistics of the Australian Taxation Office to attack the amount of tax paid by the minerals sector. Rarely have we seen an act of such utter desperation from a government rapidly losing control of its agenda. Rather than the 13 to 17 per cent quoted by the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister from the paper by the US student, the government should use the Australian tax office figures which show the effective corporate tax rate paid by the mining sector is 27.81 per cent and when royalties are added the effective rate increases to 41.3 per cent. In fact, BHP went so far today as to issue a notice to the stock exchange to point out that its effective tax rate for the year 2009 was 43 per cent. The chairman of BHP Billiton, Mr Jack Nasser, sent a letter to shareholders of BHP on 17 May 2010 pointing out that the effective tax rate paid by BHP was 43 per cent and that if this supertax were added to the tax rate, BHP would be paying about a 57 per cent effective tax rate, which would make it the highest taxed mining and resource sector in the world. I asked the Prime Minister in question time today whether he accepted as a fact the statement by the chairman of BHP Billiton that BHP's effective tax rate was 43 per cent. The Prime Minister pointedly refused to answer. There has been the very damaging campaign by the Prime Minister in concert with the unions to portray global mining companies as foreign carpetbaggers taking profits overseas. This is simply not true. For example, Xstrata has claimed that it generated $44 billion in revenue and has reinvested a total of $45 billion in Australia - in other words, Xstrata has invested more in Australia than generated. The Prime Minister has also sought to compare the mining supertax with the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, which was introduced in the 1980s. It is important to note that the North West Shelf, a major petroleum project, was exempted from the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax. The government is not able to point to any development that occurred in the 20 years between the introduction of the tax and when the Gorgon project was announced last year. The fact is further development in the oil and gas sector was severely retarded after the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax was introduced. In fact, it is only in recent years, more than 20 years later, that development has begun as the long-term demand for energy appears to be very strong. The Gorgon project, in other words, has taken 20 years to come onstream. This contrasts with the government's claim that the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax has made the oil and gas sector prosper as a result of its introduction. The head of Woodside, Don Voelte, has said that the Pluto project would not have off the ground had the government's proposed supertax regime been in place. And we have had a number of mining executives state publicly and to the stock exchange that projects will be put on hold as a result of the government's mining supertax. It is beyond belief that the government can claim that whacking a 40 per cent tax on the mining sector is somehow good for the mining sector. If it were so good for the mining sector, why aren't other sectors in the Australian economy lining up and begging the government to impose an additional 40 per cent on their operations? It just beggars belief. Over the last few weeks we have seen a very damaging campaign by this government to give the impression to the Australian peoit ple that the mining sector is not paying its way and that somehow the Australian people are being ripped off. This is causing considerable consternation around the world, particularly in global capital markets and international investment circles. It is strange, because when Kevin Rudd was in opposition he used to speak very highly of the mining sector. Indeed in one of his first overseas trips as Prime Minister he went to Beijing, and in Beijing he said: Australia is an open market when it comes to foreign investment. And if you look at Australia, we have had a history of relying upon internationally sourced capital to fund the country's long-term development. In the great state of Western Australia, it's like that. I mean, you have a relatively small population, a huge land mass and therefore foreign investment has been necessary. That is a statement that stands in stark contrast with what the government is now proposing to do. His extraordinary attack on mining companies as foreign owned and having massively increased their profits and denied the Australian people their fair share just does not ring true when you think how got effusive the Prime Minister was about the mining sector and its contribution to ensuring that Australia could weather the storm surrounding the global financial crisis. As the Prime Minister drags Australia's international reputation through the mud for his own domestic political purposes, we in the opposition will stand firm. We believe that this supertax is bad for the Australian economy. It will cost jobs and drive mining activity and mining investment offshore. It will hurt small business owners. It will harm Australian consumers as the cost of living will rise as a result of the imposition of an additional 40 per cent tax. Housing costs, electricity costs and an increased cost of ing will all go through the Australian economy. (Time expired)",102
143,Mr ADAMS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"In the budget this year, Tasmania has continued to fare very well. The 2010-11 federal budget is about securing Australia's long-term economic future. With what we were facing in Australia 12 months ago, the original forecast for the budget for 2009-10 was for a fall in the GDP of 0.5 per cent and unemployment to be at 8.25 per cent, with a deficit of about $58 billion. Things have been turned around quite well by the budget which has been brought down, with the opportunity for growth for 2010-11 being stated at about 3.25 per cent and unemployment to remain around five per cent, or I think even a little less, with a deficit of about $41 billion. is a bit of a different picture from last year. We should commend the Treasurer for bringing that budget together. It reflects a commitment to strong financial management and the budget returning to surplus in 201213. This is responsible management which will mean that the government will have peak debt and get the budget back into the black three years early. This was clearly a budget for the years ahead and for securing Australia's future. It helps working families. I am particularly pleased about the commitments to health care, including GP services, superclinics and addressing the shortage of nurses. In the Lyons electorate, this has been a major question and I have been lobbying for many years now to ensure that we have the appropriate mix of health staff available to try to take pressure off the city hospitals. I welcome the funding for skills training in renewable energy. In my electorate I have a major wind farm proposed for the Lake Echo area. I certainly hope that comes together in future. It is in the Central Highlands and only a couple of kilometres from liv- the distribution hub for Hydro Tasmania. Concerning infrastructure and rail networks, I look forward to projects already underway in the electorate of Lyons and across Tasmania coming together. Other projects can be supported and some are already being funded. Here I think about Rhyndaston and the area of the old train route between Hobart and Launceston, built in 1880 with horse and cart, being renewed and many of the more rigorous curves of the rail being removed. It will be straightened considerably, which will mean less wear and tear on the train traffic using it in the future. During the period this government has been in Canberra, there have been some great changes in emphasis in communities across the Lyons electorate, assisted by fedSo it eral government funding. This has encouraged hard work and persistence from community members to come up with the projects which have been funded. Let us have a look at some of those projects, with a focus on the many good things happening in the communities around the Lyons electorate. I keep reading in the national press about some problems with the Building the Education Revolution. I saw people today on the other side trying to promote politics around these projects, but every time. I visit a school or attend an opening in the Lyons electorate I find very grateful and enthusiastic school communities who are delighted to have these funds spent in their area and on their schools. In some places they tell me that this is the first major upgrade of their facilities 40 years. So, of course, they are very pleased to have these upgrades to take their schools forward over the next 20 years. Without funding of this sort, these communities would have found it very hard to achieve through fundraising the large amounts of money needed to build and equip any new facilities. These projects in small communities will benefit the whole community, not just the education community. In many of those small communities the school is a real community school, playing a very important role over and above its educational role. They tell me that the new technology that has been provided, along with the upgrade of the infrastructure, has enabled children in more isolated areas to link into mainstream education programs and talk between schools. Both teachers and students are learning to use the IT together. Some teachers are finding the large whiteboards difficult, and the kids are teaching them as they go. It also helps the school to again become the focus of the community. I recently opened a new multipurpose building in Wilmot, costing about $250,000, which was funded through Building the Education Revolution. This funding allowed the online access centre to function more efficiently. It provided a great area for the local playgroup to meet and also for the whole school community to meet as one body. The online centres not only give people the chance to learn new skills and participate in e-learning activities but, in the case of small communities, also provide a place for people to come together and share experiences and ideas. The local playgroup will now have a new area in which to meet, giving local kids a chance to become familiar with the school atmosphere before starting school in the future. The learning programs across Lyons are a major success, and having an area big enough for those programs to come into play is a major in 30 or opportunity for young people. Another project was the refurbishment of the Carrington Mill at Oatlands in Central Tasmania. This was done just after the last election as part of the Rural Infrastructure Program. When you drive past Oatlands you cannot miss the Carrington Mill. It is a great landmark and tourist attraction in the Midlands of Tasmania. Many people do not know about this mill but it is playing a central role in the reinvigoration of the whole town of Oatlands. Over the past few years, Carrington Mill has received $1.2 million in federal funding, with matching funding from the state. The work is well underway. The long-term goal is to see the mill up and running again as a working venture. This will not only be a tourist attraction but will have a huge ongoing economic benefit for the whole area. Already, we have seen one new business open-a bakery specialising in baking bread using traditional methods. The bakery is now also holding courses in breadmaking. The overall plan is to turn Oatlands into a tourist precinct with many opportunities to experience within the area. It is also only a short distance from the highland lakes. The plans include the growing and harvesting of spelt wheat, a heritage variety of wheat, which is used in the grinding process at the mill. Existing attractions such as the Oatlands Spring Festival and local businesses and accommodation will all benefit from these major plans. This has been a long process that started many years ago with a vision to turn Oatlands from a quaint but fading country town into a tourist destination. It has taken much work and dedication from many community members, volunteers and the local council to make this dream a reality. This is what these injections of funds into small communities are all about. They not only stimulate the economy but, in the process, can also motivate a whole region or two. Many of the success stories around Lyons owe everything to groups and committees of hard working volunteers who persist in the face of many problems to achieve their goals. Recently, we have seen a new childcare centre called Little Penguin open at Bicheno. Over 10 years ago a group of parents saw a need for child care in the Bicheno and Freycinet communities. Since then, with a few changes in the committee over the years, the group has worked tirelessly to see its dream become a reality. This culminated with the opening of the centre, which is sponsored by the Northern Children's Network, in May, and it was a wonderful event. This stimulated other investments in the local community-in particular, the upgrading of the primary school, which was opened just last week. The Beaconsfield childcare centre and early learning centre is another vital project that is being funded as part of the rollout of childcare centres in disadvantaged districts, and it is now well on the way to providing a good service to the parents of Beaconsfield and the upper Tamar Valley. On the mainland there have been stories about pink batts. I can tell you that this program went down very well in the Lyons electorate. It was delivered mostly by local companies, and I guess that was the key to there not being many complaints. The only complaints generated were in more populated areas outside the Lyons electorate, where flyby-night companies took advantage of gullible consumers who trusted them to do the right thing. I believe this was a good program. It has allowed many people to at least have some insulation in their homes, and I am sure that contributes to bringing down their fuel bills. I believe we have again been responsible in this budget. We have moved to strengthen the economy to help Australian families where they really need assistance and to secure growth for the future. Our decisive action has kept the economy strong and protected jobs during the global financial crisis. We must now take decisive action to return the budget to surplus and keep our finances strong. In Tasmania we are going through a major period of restructuring of our primary industries. We have been addressing the question of climate change in our agricultural industries and there have been some assistance packages to help with the delivery of water to drought-proof individual properties. Now we turn to look at forestry. Despite the Greens attempts to derail any initiatives taken by the industry, there is general agreement that the restructuring of the industry needs to occur to retain a very important side of our economy. Federal capital already put into road and rail infrastructure will assist part of this and I know that there are close negotiations going on between the state and federal spheres and industry players to build a new and more sustainable industry. We have the rollout of the National Broadband Network which is already underway in Tasmania. This will mean businesses and industries in Tasmania will be able to compete on an equal basis with those overseas as they access markets and opportunities. Without a fast and reliable internet service, this has been impossible to achieve before. Many people coming to Tasmania find a valley or a glen where they would love to live, but they are not able to get proper internet service so they have had to leave again. Tourism is another area where Tasmania has an active interest as we have some of the most sought after tourist venues in Australia. I know our east coast has been featured as one of the most popular and heralded tourist destinations. Tourism is a $1 billion industry for the Tasmanian economy, and it is an industry that employs 14,000 people-some 16 per cent of all jobs. The federal government has recognised the importance of this and has launched a program called There's nothing like Australia on a website in which individuals, states and businesses can interact with the marketing program to ensure that the places people visit and which they enjoyed most can be documented and spread to the whole world. So it will certainly help Tasmania to attract more visitors and thus create more jobs. There are tax cuts in this budget as well, and a more simplified tax system that will allow automatic deductions from 1 July 2012. There will be modest income tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer from 1 July this year. Small business will also be given a tax break from 1 July 2012. The new investments in the Launceston General Hospital, the rehabilitation work and the opportunities that will go on there are major investments in the health of Tasmanians. There are opportunities from the $417 million investment to improve after-hours access to GPs and primary health care. This is a major way of keeping people out of hospitals. There are the superclinics, and one is close to getting started in the electorate of Lyons. They are a wonderful opportunity to deliver primary health care. And, of course, electronic health records for every Australian who wants one from 1 July 2012 will be a major initiative, something which the other side failed to deliver to the Australian health system. The money being put into mental health through this budget will also assist enormously, especially the 3,500 young people aged between 16 and 25 years who can benefit from early treatment support. This is a major opportunity as we know that early assistance and treatment in the area of mental health is of major benefit. There are 39,000 training places for the Skills for Recovery program, with the Apprentice Kickstart initiative to support around 22,500 apprentices. This is targeted to small to medium businesses in areas where we, as a nation, need to improve those skill bases. There will be 140,000 Australians building core foundation skills such as language, literacy and numeracy. It is a tremendous program which will assist many apprentices getting started. I mentioned infrastructure in the electorate of Lyons. There is the National Broadband Network being rolled out in parts of the Lyons electorate and other parts of Tasmania. The Australian Rail Track Corporation received about $1 billion in this budget. This will help to enhance rail and track throughout Australia. So this budget is a very responsible one. It allows us to build on the programs before us, making sure that we are well placed in the global economy to deal with the changes that are continuing to face us. (Time expired)",106
144,Mr BALDWIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I rise today to address the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011. This bill represents everything that is wrong with the Rudd Labor government: reckless spending, broken promises, waste, new taxes and gross mismanagement. This is a big-spending, bigtaxing budget. But what else can we expect from a Labor government? Just like Whitlam and Keating before him, Prime Minister Rudd has taken a huge surplus and driven it into massive debt. This is a case of deja vu. Prime Minister Rudd would have you believe that his spending was necessary because we were part of a global financial crisis. In fact, Prime Minister Rudd has tried to take credit for the performance of the Australian economy during the global financial crisis. The facts are that Australia was buffeted from the economic tempest with a $23 billion surplus left by the coalition, a mining industry boom and a well-regulated and secure financial industry. At no point during the crisis did our banks require bailouts like those in the USA and the UK. Mr Rudd would have my constituents believe that he spent their money wisely to avoid an economic tsunami. Yet, when we actually got hit, it was nothing worse than a king tide. Allow me to compare the economic management of Labor and the coalition. During the Keating years the cash interest rate reached 10.5 per cent and stayed there for almost two years. During the Howard years the cash rate fell to less than six per cent stayed there for 6½ years. During the Labor Hawke-Keating years, unemployment peaked at 10.9 per cent and remained in double figures for more than two years. It took John Howard just three years in government to bring this to below seven per cent, and for the next 8½ years unemployment consistently fell, bottoming out at four per cent in March 2008. Labor is now celebrating a figure of 5.4 per cent as at April 2010. Why is it that the Labor Party is so bad at managing a budget? It is because the Labor Party consists of people who have no real experience in business. Before becoming Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd studied Mandarin, worked in foreign affairs in Sweden and China and worked as a consultant. Before becoming Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard studied arts and law, worked as a lawyer and was a secretary of the Socialist Forum. Clearly these are people who know absolutely nothing about making tough decisions in order to make ends meet and keep small business afloat. I know what it is like struggling to manage a business and keep workers in a job while providing for a family. Prior to entering politics I owned a scuba-diving business, Scuba Industries of Australia. I also had a construction business called Central Coast Carpenters and Builders. A great majority of my coalition colleagues have also worked as farmers or in small business, including Warren Truss, Judith Adams, Cory Bernardi, Bruce Billson and Steve Ciobo, to name but a few. The people of Australia can trust the coalition with their household budgets because we have been out there employing them, listening to them and providing for them. We know what it is like to have our own money on the line, to be risking our future and that of our children with good business and good money management. That is and why we can be trusted with the finances of this great country. Having personally managed my own businesses and dealt with budget issues on a daily basis, I cannot describe the anger, dismay and helplessness I have felt watching Labor waste billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. These bills reveal the extent of Labor's waste, including $1 billion which will now have to be spent to fix the bungled and tragic Home Insulation Program. The bills also include $1 billion to be spent on dealing with the influx of illegal boat arrivals that have occurred since Prime Minister Rudd weakened our border protection policies. This is all money that could have been saved if the Rudd Labor government had not rushed into things without proper consultation. Australia never had to go into this massive debt, which will now have to be repaid by every man, woman and child. This Labor government only knows how to throw money at its problems. Now it has no money left to throw. I want to speak in particular about four of Labor's biggest failures because I simply do not have time to list them all. Firstly, we had the Home Insulation Scheme, where Labor did everything wrong. Firstly, Labor handed out rebates that were too high because it did not properly consult with the experts, and, when the coalition convinced Prime Minister Rudd that the taxpayers were being ripped off, $200 million had already been wasted. Secondly, Labor did not monitor its program or the people who were delivering it. Dangerous work was done and four people lost their lives in tragic circumstances. Thirdly, rogue installers did dodgy work and ruined the reputation of professional, trustworthy insulation businesses. Fourthly, Labor promised to review and then reinstate the scheme but then changed its mind, resulting nesses which had bought tonnes of insulation material being left with costly storage bills, with many being forced to dump their insulation because they simply could not afford to store it. Fifthly, insulation businesses claimed for their government rebates, but Labor was so slow in paying them that some businesses almost went bankrupt. For example, Insulmaster, in my electorate of Paterson, was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars and had to let go of staff. I would also like to talk about Labor's called Building the Education Revolution, which is more like a taxpayer rip-off. I would like to make it clear that I wholeheartsending edly support investment in local schools and in the education of our children. But what taxpayers need is value for money-and they simply did not get it in this program. The BER saw some prefabricated classrooms costing more per square metre than a luxury home. For example, Booral Public School in my electorate got a double pre-fabricated classroom for the same price that Black Hill Public School got three classrooms, a basketball court and a rainwater tank. The difference? The latter achieved such a great result because the school managed the project itself. The Booral Public School project was managed by the state Labor government. We have seen a massive increase in illegal boat arrivals as a result of Prime Minister Rudd weakening our border protection policies. The coalition had this problem under control and between July 2002 and June 2008 there were just 18 boats. Since Prime Minister Rudd took over, we have had 128 boats in less than three years. That is a rate of about three boats a week under Labor, compared with three boats a year under the coalition. Labor now needs to spend $1 billion fixing this problem. This would not have been necessary if Labor had simply made the tough decisions and stopped the boats, like in busi- the coalition did. Finally, I would like to talk about the great big new tax on mining that Labor wants to inflict on the Australian economy. This ‘supertax' has hit mining companies hard on the stock market while cutting huge amounts from ordinary Australians' superannuation accounts. This ‘supertax' will hit hard on the profits of the Hunter's mining companies, which will likely have to cut jobs and shift allowances in order to cope. If their products become more expensive, it will lead to big soincreases in power bills. It will also force overseas consumers to go elsewhere in search of competitively priced coal, therefore our jobs offshore. This tax is not just on big mining companies; it is also on small quarries and will impact on the cost of sand, gravel and cement. At a time when the property market is already struggling because of rising interest rates, this is a cost we simply cannot bear. As the Hunter struggles with a huge shortfall in rental vacancy, we should be encouraging people to buy new homes, not making them more expensive and out of reach. Furthermore, this tax is not just a hit on mining companies. Like Labor's postponed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, this is a tax on everything and everyone and will flow on to every sector of the economy and hit families where it hurts-in the pocket. According to Labor, this reckless tax is the best way to pull Australia out of the huge debt the Prime Minister has created, but the Rudd Labor government clearly does not understand that the Australian economy will suffer enormous damage as a result of this tax and the effects will be far reaching. The Labor government has failed to explain to the Australian people that the surplus forecast in its appropriation bills relies on the continued mining boom. A slight change to this boom would mean that the supposed surplus becomes non-existent. Prime Minister Rudd would have you believe that I am a doomsayer for questioning the continuing mining boom, but he himself said in 2007: The future I see for Australia is one in which current mining boom does not last forever, and rather than simply being the lucky countryinstead of a country which makes its own luckwe will have to make our own luck. He said: … our current economic circumstances are propped up by the mining boom which this year alone will bring in some $55 billion to the national economy. But working families legitimately fear this. happens, Mr Howard, when the mining boom is over?' Prime Minister Rudd criticised John Howard for the mining boom, claiming that the coalition did not have a plan to safeguard our economy when it ended, yet now that he has spent all the money and wasted the surplus Mr Howard worked so hard to achieve Mr Rudd wants to hinge Australia's entire economic recovery on the mining boom. Clearly the Prime Minister cannot be trusted when it comes to the economy or to keep his word. The money wasted on these four mistakes alone could have paid for vital projects across the country, including life-changing improvements for the people in my electorate of Paterson. My constituents need urgent upgrades in order to watch television and access the internet. My constituents need urgent road upgrades to the Pacific Highway, the New England Highway, Bucketts Way and the Nelson Bay Road to erase black spots and save lives. They need a Fingal Bay bypass and quicker action to build the F3 link road, not to mention action on Dungog roads. My constituents need more aged-care beds, more mental health facilities, more doctor's surgeries and another local hospital. My constituents need more childcare places and they need a high school in Medowie. Of course, Labor could not deliver money for any of these projects in this year's budget because it has no money left. Labor could not deliver any of these projects, even our though the $1 billion it wasted on the Home Insulation Program alone would have paid for many of these projects and a whole lot more. Sadly, monumental mistakes define the Rudd Labor government. Broken promises have also featured heavily over the past three years and have caused disappointment after disappointment for the people of Paterson. Prime Minister Rudd has repeatedly de‘What clared that climate change is ‘the greatest moral challenge of our time'. Likewise, his deputy, Julia Gillard, said in January this year that ‘delay is the same as denial'. But now, just a couple of months later, Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard have delayed their ETS. This cowardly backdown is clearly designed to win votes because, as this bill confirms, Mr Rudd intends to reintroduce the ETS if he wins the election. The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal has made it clear that the ETS would result in a 64 per cent rise in electricity bills in New South Wales. In addition, Labor's own report, commissioned through Access Economics, shows that the ETS would place 17,000 jobs in the Hunter at risk, and that is without the impact of the great big new tax on mining proposed by this government. This is bad legislation which will cost and threaten household budgets. It is no wonder that the Prime Minister wants voters to forget about it in the lead-up to the next election, but if we cannot trust a Prime Minister to deliver action on what he believes to be ‘the greatest moral challenge of our time' how can we trust him to deliver anything else, including a budget surplus? After all, would not even consider the coalition's direct action plan on climate change, even though it would deliver the same emissions reductions as his ETS. This is a Prime Minister who is all about playing politics, not about hard decisions. I now come to my portfolio area of defence science and personnel and, more broadly, the defence budget. This budget has again shown that the Rudd Labor government cannot be trusted even on matters as important as the defence of our nation. For instance, the Rudd Labor government's much maligned 2009 defence white paper promised 12 new submarines, which were to be built in Australia. At the time, the Prime Minister even said that the next generation of submarines would be ‘Australia's largest ever single defence project'. Given such an assessment, you would expect the 2010-11 budget to have provided some level of initial funding for this highly complex project, but again the budget has revealed the Prime Minister is all doorstop and no delivery. If this government were at all serious about the submarines, the budget should have allocated at least $70 million to $100 million on the design and development phase. Instead, all it has managed to do is transfer the risk of the project to future governments, which is hardly the act of a responsible Prime Minister. This budget also revealed an overall decrease of $2.42 billion in defence expendijobs ture over the next three years, despite numerous commitments from the Rudd Labor government to a three per cent real increase to the defence budget until 2017-18. By way of comparison, the 2009-10 budget stated that total government funding for defence between the years 2010-11 and 2012-13 would be $77.48 billion. Yet, in the 2010-11 he budget, total government funding over the same period for defence totalled $75.06 billion, an overall decrease of $2.42 billion in defence expenditure and another broken promise. Unlike the Rudd government, the Howard government not only quarantined the defence budget from cuts but also increased it from $10.6 billion to $22 billion and rebuilt the hollow structures left by years of Labor neglect. What this budget has succeeded in doing is to increase the level of concern in the defence industry sector, and it is easy to see why. In 2009-10 there was $631.5 million earmarked for the unapproved major capital equipment program, yet the 2010-11 budget only shows $277.9 million spread over 45 major projects. This is a massive drop in expenditure that has the whole of the defence industry sector worried and is putting numerous defence jobs at risk. This budget has also successfully managed to increase the number of Defence bureaucrats-by some 1,500 over the next 12 months. This came as a particular shock, as before the 2007 election Kevin Rudd attacked what he considered to be a bloated federal bureaucracy. He has since added nearly 20,000 more public servants during his time in office. And, if all of that was not hard enough to swallow, the government has also reduced the number of uniformed soldiers by 501. The large increase in bureaucrats is coming at a time when Defence is supposed to be saving $20 billion over 10 years, and will simply result in the diversion of resources away from major acquisition programs and Australia's front line troops. Without reducing the importance of the support provided by those who serve behind a desk, there is nothing more important than those who serve on the front line. This must be the first time in history that a government has increased the number of public servants in order to save money! Again more spin, smoke and mirrors from a government that has turned fiscal belt tightening into a growth industry. The audacity of this government and its spin machine knows no bounds. When the Minister for Defence Materiel and Science, Greg Combet, proudly announced that the Defence Science and Technology Organisation would receive a funding increase of $138 million, he failed to articulate over how many years this funding would be spread. But that is not the worse part. The reality is that, while the Rudd Labor government may claim to be investing $138 million in the DSTO, it had already ripped out $108 million soon after forming government. The real devil, as they say, is in the detailand, in this case, that detail was purposely omitted. Before concluding, I would like to make mention of one last item contained within the budget-one that I am sure will disappoint many Australians-and that is the government's decision to further reduce the number of available places on the highly successful ADF gap year program. This is a program that was introduced by the coalition government in 2007 in order to give school leavers the opportunity to taste ADF life. It is a gram that has proven to be both highly successful and cost effective. In 2008-09, 465 people transferred from the gap year program into either the permanent or Reserve forces. That equates to roughly three-quarters of all participants. The Rudd Labor government's decision to have the ADF gap year program is not only short-sighted but also economically irresponsible. The ADF spends tens of millions of dollars every year on recruiting and marketing campaigns, yet the Rudd government, inexplicably, has chosen to cut back a proven and cost-effective recruitment and retention initiative. It seems only those in the Rudd Labor government know why such action was taken, and it seems those same people are the only ones that consider the current boom in defence recruitment and retention as everlasting. The hard truth is that defence will again face the prospect of personnel shortages and recruitment challenges in the near future, particularly as personnel are once again lured back to the lucrative mining sector-which is one of the reasons why successful programs such as the ADF gap year should be maintained, not cut back. The Rudd Labor government's short sighted approach to policy making is going to cost the economy more money than it is trying to save. That is what this Labor budget is-it is a big taxing, big spending budget that will cost all Australians more than it purports to save. A government that failed to manage a home insulation scheme cannot be trusted to manage the nation's fiscal policy, let alone its defence forces. A government that says climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time, only to scrap its ETS, cannot be trusted. Australia's coalition governments fixed interest rates, they fixed unemployment and they paid off the multibillion dollar debts that each and every Labor progovernment left them with. It will take another coalition government to get the job done this time as well. (Time expired)",109
145,Ms CAMPBELL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I rise today to talk about a budget which will further strengthen our economy and secure future growth as we emerge from the global financial crisis in a position stronger than we had anticipated. I am delighted to be part of a government that takes responsibility for the nation's future, and this is a budget that will see us move towards a more stable and secure economy for Australia's families and the generations to come. The actions we took as a government in the face of the economic crisis helped to lessen its effects and we are now working to return the budget to surplus much sooner than we thought was possible. It was HG Wells who said that human history is, in essence, a history of ideas. Ideas inform policy which in turn informs the lives of everyday Australians. If you care about people then you care about policy; if you care about policy then you care about ideas. It is the combination of great ideas and the pragmatic approach of the Rudd government that has carried us as a nation through the global financial crisis and will continue to carry us forward. It is such ideas that shape this budget. This budget supports what I believe are some of the most important areas for our country. The health of our families and communities has been at the forefront of this government's investment, and this year's budget builds on that. For the first time, the federal government will take primary funding responsibility for our health system in order to ensure that our health system and hospitals meet our needs in the years to come. Over the next five years $2.2 billion dollars is being invested to create the National Health and Hospitals Network, which will be funded nationally and run locally. I have heard first-hand about the problems with our health system and one issue that has often been raised with me by my constituents in Bass is the availability of GPs. The budget measures to improve after-hours GP access as well as training more GPs and nurses will build on previous investments and go a long way towards helping make our health system a top quality one for the future. The government is introducing a new four-hour emergency department target and guaranteeing elective surgery waiting times with a new national target that 95 per cent of Australians receive elective surgery within clinically recommended times by 2015, as well as delivering 1,300 new hospital beds. We are also building another 23 new GP superclinics and upgrading over 400 GP clinics and primary care services across the country to provide improved health services to the community. While I strongly support the Rudd government's tremendous investment in health, I do wish tonight to bring to the attention of the House the matter of the planned removal of access to Medicare rebates to mental health trained social workers and occupational therapists under the Better Access to Mental Health scheme as announced in the budget. There has been an outcry nationwide against this measure by those mental health workers, the doctors who refer to them and their clients, and I thank Minister Roxon for agreeing to delay the changes and to consult further. I would like to acknowledge in the chamber this evening the National CEO of the Australian Association of Social Workers, Kandie Allen-Kelly, together with Dr Maxine Manifold, a local GP in Launceston who felt so strongly about the removal of the Medicare rebate that she took charge and initiated a local petition. In just five days she managed, together with a team of passionate and committed health professionals, to obtain 1,860 signatures, which I will table in the chamber at a later date. I would also like to thank the many constituents who took the time to email or write to me in relation to this very important matter. People in Bass are concerned, and concerned they should be. I note in the minister's press release of 19 May the plan to move the services of these highly trained and experienced clinicians to the provision of packages of care for those in our community with severe mental illness. But clinicians in my electorate tell me that the use of packages will not substitute for the present system of Medicare rebates. The rebate system allows people to visit their clinician and seek assistance for what might be a transitory illness, like a reactive depression or suicidal thoughts after the loss of a relationship. This system has assisted many people in our community to restore quality of life and get back to work and family. Anxiety, depression, mania and neurosis can be debilitating illnesses, and we must encourage people to seek assistance by treating them as if they were the same as any other illness. Imagine if you were to visit your doctor for a flu only to be told that before he or she could treat you that you would have to apply for a package of care. What if you went your clinician and said, ‘I have diabetes and depression.' He or she would reply, ‘I can treat you for your diabetes, but for your depression you'll have to apply for a package of care.' The minister's press release says that the packages will support people with severe mental illness, but this should not replace a system where people are assisted by clinicians so that they do not develop a severe mental illness. Packages of care should not replace the current system of Medicare rebates. The hardest thing for a person to do when in a state of psychological distress is to bravely come to the doctor and spill the beans, so to speak-that is, to tell their story. Imagine the anxiety they would suffer to have tell that story over and over to a psychologist, then to a social worker, then to an occupational therapist and perhaps to a mental health nurse, to each of the team members administering the package of care. Effective care is coordinated care, but this proposal will leave us fragmented care, not coordinated care. The current system where GPs can refer patients to mental health social workers and occupational therapists in the community just works so well and has been hugely beneficial to thousands of Australians. Because the system is built into Medicare, it is easy to access by those people who represent the most marginalised in our community. No doubt there is a place for packages of care for people with a severe mental illness, but it should not be at the cost of the present system of Medicare rebates for people who are experiencing an episode of mental illness from which they will recover if treated. A doctor in my electorate presented the following scenario to me. A 35-year-old woman living with three young children in a shot, caravan on a bush block with a physically and financially abusive partner is hardly likely to want to be referred for a package of care with its associated paperwork, telephone calls and so on, which might alert a potentially violent partner to her cry for help. Under the current arrangement, when she comes to the GP with panic attacks and needing an exit strategy from her situation, this woman can get a Medicare rebate of $70.45, paying only a small gap, or even be bulk-billed by a caring local mental health social worker who agrees to see her quickly and discreetly after a phone call from her doctor. Under the proposed changes, this woman will no longer be able to pay the full fee to see a mental health social worker and will likely go without appropriate help. By contrast, however, a woman of the same age who wishes to fly to Paris with her company director husband, but who is prevented from doing so because of a phobia of flying, will still be able to access a rebate of $117.65 for seeing a clinical psychologist for the treatment of her phobia. Where is the justice in this? I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge ‘Deb' and ‘Geoff', who had the strength and courage to attend my electorate office and to share their individual stories and experiences of being patients in the mental health system. It was a system, they tell me, that left them feeling extremely confused and vulnerable until the door was opened for them, and they came into contact with a mental health social worker. They both emphasised to me the importance of continuity of care. ‘Deb' and ‘Geoff' have exhausted their sick leave and advised me that, if the Medicare rebate were not available to them, they simply would not be able to afford any care or treatment at all. As a society, we cannot allow this to happen to people who are vulnerable and at risk. It simply is not good enough. I have also spoken to David Hunnerup, a mental health social worker from the Blue Door counselling practice in Launceston. The Blue Door was a collaboration between two mental health social workers and one psychologist. Over a five-year period it was developed specifically to meet the needs of disadvantaged clients whose needs were not being met elsewhere. The business was built without government assistance and built, I might add, on a confidence that the government's commitment to Medicare's better access program would be stable. As David advised me, if this reversal goes ahead it will put practices like the Blue Door in jeopardy and could therefore put mental health social workers under considerable disadvantage, let alone the clients who walk through their door. So, again, I sincerely thank Minister Roxon for agreeing to delay these changes until April 2011 and to consult further. This is a good decision, and on behalf of the ple I represent in Bass, I urge the minister not to remove Medicare rebates for social workers and occupational therapists who treat people with mental illness in our community under referral from their GPs. The current system works well and there are many doctors, therapists and most importantly ordinary Australians who are grateful for it. As Australia is facing an ageing population, we have to make provisions for agedcare workers to have access to better training to improve their skills in the workforce. This investment benefits not only older Australians but also those who are looking for career opportunities in aged care as the funding will also go towards scholarships. The funding from this year's budget will allow agedcare service providers to train and retain a level of expertise amongst workers. This will mean that Australians will receive the best aged care possible from trained and caring staff. From 1 January 2011, eligible parents-including full-time, part-time, seasonal, casual and self-employed workerswill have the financial assistance and security of the national minimum wage, currently $543.78 a week before tax. Our first ever Paid Parental Leave scheme has been waited for with anticipation for some time by parents. The assistance with the balance of work and family responsibilities will take financial pressure off families and give them time to spend with their new child in those first impressionable weeks. Parents of children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2011 can claim leave of up to 18 weeks if their individual annual income is $150,000 or less. Our government is making its families and the future of Australia a priority whilst helping businesses maintain the skills of their employees for when they return to work. Parents will be able to stay connected to their place of work through peo- Keeping in Touch provisions, which will help to retain jobs and skills. This year's budget provides relief for working Australians through a 50 per cent tax break for the first $1,000 of interest on savings and tax cuts for the third year in a row. From 1 July, individuals will be able to earn up to $16,000 without paying income tax due to increases in the low-income tax offset. This is just another way we are providing support for low-income earners trying to make ends meet. The compulsory employer contribution to employees' superannuation will also be increased from nine per cent to 12 per cent by 2020, providing added financial security for people in retirement. Further to this, from July 2012 it will be easier for individuals to lodge their tax turns with the new standard deduction option. When I talk to people in the Bass community about tax, what they want to see is a less complicated system in which everybody pays their fair share. This is a really imporproviding tant step towards a tick-and-flick system-a prefilled tax return-an idea that has been very popular with the residents of Bass. Soon you will be able to forget about the hassle having shoeboxes full of receipts and the costs of getting your taxes done at the end each year. These reforms will make a real difference for the people I represent. From 1 July 2012, the government will give people the option of choosing a standard deduction of $500 instead of claiming work related expenses. This standard deduction will be increased to $1,000 from 1 July 2013. I am proud to be a member of a government that is determined to make lasting reforms in tax that make the system fairer and simpler while building a stronger economy for the Bass community. Small businesses will also benefit, being able to instantly duct the cost of assets up to $5,000. I know this is welcome news for the 7,863 small businesses in my electorate of Bass, many of which will also benefit from a reduction in the company tax rate. It is great to see the important role of small business in our omy recognised, as these businesses kept many people in work during the global recession. Measures in this year's budget will invest in the skills we need for our future economy, taking action to increase training place apprenticeships: $243 million over the next four years is going towards the transformation of our vocational education and training system This is part of the $660 million Skills for Sustainable Growth package. The measures that make up this package will improve access to training opportunities, giving more re- Australians the opportunity to undertake training, including high-level qualifications to advance their careers. We are also working with the states and territories to improve the performance of our largest VET providers, performance based funding in order to better the outcomes of our students. We will also be introducing the National Entitlement to a Quality Training Place, of which will guarantee an entitlement to a place for all Australians under 25 in any of training course above their current highest qualifications and for which they meet the prerequisites. In addition, the Commonwealth is investing $53.6 million over four years to expand VET FEE-HELP, providing greater access to these loans, meaning that more than 477,000 people will be able to access a loan to help support them with their studies. This new package builds on the government's previous initiatives to support the VET sector and brings the overall spending on VET for the government's first four years in office to $15.8 billion from 2008-12, in decontrast to the $9.5 billion in the past four years of the previous government. This government is committed to making sure that all Australians have access to quality education and training opportunities so that they are able to build their skills and econ- improve their employment outcomes. Apprenticeship training is also important to building a stronger economy, and the budget has seen a further investment of almost $80 million to extend the Apprentice Kickstart initiative. This initiative, which more than triples the commencement bonus for employers of traditional trades apprentices in the first year from $1,500 to $4,850, has been a resounding success. Apprentice Kickstart boosted the numbers of traditional trade apprenticeships above pre-global recession levels in just one year. Last summer in Bass, we helped 124 apprentices get started in a new career. This new funding will be targeted to help small and medium sized businesses to put on more apprentices and will support around another 22,500 apprenticeship places across the country in traditional trades that are experiencing skills shortages. The economic downturn was damaging to apprenticeships but, thanks to the Apprentice Kickstart initiative and the support of employers and young people, we have seen a boost in the number of apprenticeships. I have received many emails of gratitude from constituents in Bass for the government's budget commitment to increasing Australia's Official Development Assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015-16. There is both wide support for the government's position in Bass and confusion and disappointment with the opposition's proposing a $300 million cut to foreign aid. The Rudd government is committed to giving our youth opportunities to express their concerns for the poor and to act responsibly as a global citizen. I have recently been involved with young local activists in Bass who are raising awareness of the Millennium Development Goals. One such young lady is Laura Sykes, who is a student at Launceston College and has been heavily involved with the recent Make Poverty History road trip, organising concerts and petitioning the Launceston Council to become fair trade certified. Young Australians in Bass understand global poverty and have clear ideas about what should be done and what can be done. The Rudd government is harnessing this energy and enthusiasm and building on it for the future. The people of Bass are pleased to hear that Australia is investing, over four years, $303.7 million in education programs and $173.4 million to improve health services for the poor in developing countries. The Bass electorate confirms its support for Australia being an active and responsible citizen in our global community. There is broad and enthusiastic support for the government to continue its commitment to reduce carbon pollution and tackle climate change. For this to occur, Australia must be wise and resolute in transitioning to a low-pollution economy prior to the commencement of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The government will invest $652.5 million dollars to establish a Renewable Energy Future Fund to support renewable energy projects such as solar, wind, geothermal and wave energy. The fund will also help households save on power bills through energy efficiency measures. The Local Sporting Champions fund has doubled, with an increase in the 2010-11 budget to $3.17 million, which means that budding sports stars in Bass will have double the chance of receiving funding. Up to $25,000 is available for younger athletes wanting to compete in state and national events. In Bass this means that 26 individuals and four teams will now receive the grant. The program has been popular for young athletes in Bass since it was launched in 2008. We need to invest in our sporting champions; some of our kids in Bass could be our next Olympians, Paralympians, tennis stars, football or netball professionals. It is the best ideas that are producing the best outcomes for Australia's future. These ideas are informing policy which is building our future. This is an economically responsible budget, which targets investment where it is needed-in family budgets around the country, by reducing tax, boosting superannuation and simplifying tax returns. The Rudd government is optimistic about Australia's future. Our nation has led the world in getting through the global recession and we are preparing Australia for the challenges of the future. The strong position of the nation's economy means that the people of Bass will be better positioned for the opportunities of the future. I commend the bills to the House.",114
146,Mr RANDALL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"In speaking on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related bills this evening I declare that this budget is based on a wing and a prayer. It is a budget designed to wreck Australia's outstanding resources sector. The Rudd government is relying on a $9 billion tax on the resources sector to put the budget into the black, even if only by a whisker. It is a tax grab that risks sending half a million Australian jobs, foreign and local investment offshore. And it is a tax on the so-called working families. Labor's economic credentials are historically dubious. The facts speak for themselves. They are currently borrowing $700 million a week-or, in other words, $100 million a day-to cove their reckless spending. This is because of a $1 billion blow-out on fixing a quarter of a million dodgy roofs from the tragic pink batts fiasco and $1 billion to manage the illegal immigration influx. They are spending to fix policy failures and learners' mistakes, all completely of their own doing. Next financial year interest on net government debt will be $4.6 billion and by 2012-13 the government will be spending $6.5 billion a year on interest payments alone. In just three short years Labor have proven what this country has always known to be true about Labor governments: they are big taxing and big spending. They have spent and sent ordinary Australians into a $93 billion debt. It took a decade of tough decisions and sound economic management by the coalition government to pay off Labor's $96 billion debt. Mr Rudd has put Australia back there again in record time. In other words, after 13 years of Labor there was a $96 billion debt and Mr Rudd has taken two years to send us into that same $90 billion figure. This election is now a referendum on the mining industry. Mr Snowdon-What a load of rubbish!",120
147,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Order!,120
148,Mr RANDALL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Labor want to penalise the one sector that kept this country out of recession. They want to steal from the coffers of companiesMr Snowdon-Steal from the coffers of companies? Get a brain!,120
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Order! The member for Canning has the call and the minister will remain silent.,120
150,Mr RANDALL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"that are creating jobs, supporting local towns and bringing huge investment into Australia. The flow-on effects are endless. After keeping the country waiting with bated breath to see the Henry review, the government has all but done away with its 138 recommendations, accepting only 2½ of them, rejecting 27 and shelving the rest. There was no 40 per cent resources tax proposed in the Henry review. What Ken Henry proposed was to make the tax system simpler. Instead of wading through the current raft of almost 100 taxes to consolidate and eliminate them, the government has just added another massive one on a massive industry. As a proud Western Australian I see first hand every day the benefits the mining and resources sector has on the entire state. Every job in mining and resources supports at least four others in other industries like hospitality, aviation, accounting and many more. If we are honest, it is clear that the Prime Minister has given up on Western Australia. Why wouldn'the? Electorally there is little for Labor to gain in WA and by introducing this massive tax the Prime Minister is sending a clear message that Western Australia is just not worth it. He is happy to take but not give back-take Western Australian money, strip jobs and take security away from Western Australian workers. There are thousands of fly-in fly-out workers in Canning, not to mention those working locally for Alcoa, Boddington Gold and Worsley Alumina. In March 2007, 29,000 people were registered on AWAs in Canning, the second-highest number in the country. Conservatively, you can estimate that the resource industry supports more than 10,000 Canning workers and their families. More than 500 mining and petroleum projects in WA will be affected by this resources tax. Let us not forget that Labor have already made such a grab. In their first budget the Rudd government hit Western Australia with a massive $2.5 billion additional tax on our North West Shelf gas project as part of a $20 billion increase in federal taxes and charges. The Wall Street Journal summed up the lack of logic behind super tax when it said, ‘This economic thinking runs counter to everything that made Australia rich.' This tax risks upwards of $100 billion in planned minerals projects. Minerals production is a competitive business, with Australia only contributing to 10 per cent of global exports. If it becomes too expensive to do business here, investors will take their money offshore. The impact is not shortterm; it would damage the Australian economy for decades. Gina Rinehart has said ‘Australia does not have a monopoly on minerals and must compete for funds to develop its projects.' It is a no-brainer. lia has only about three per cent of the world's natural gas reserves, but our advantage is that the industry is established, infrastructure is in place and the investment has been there to back it. We need to make the most of it before countries like Russia and those in the Middle East, which have around half of the world's reserves, come on stream to be really competitive. Iron ore production accounts for 44 per cent of the world's minerals and petroleum output and is increasing by up to 15 per cent a year. Western Australia alone accounts for almost 20 per cent of global output and 97 per cent of Australia's, which comes from the Pilbara. It is a huge industry, supporting 25,000-plus jobs, that this tax could see become stagnant. Over the last decade mining companies have paid $80 billion in royalties and company tax, making up a solid eight per cent of the economy. The industry pays its fair share of tax-18 per cent of the nation's tax revenue. Mr Rudd wants to make the Australian resources industry the highest taxed in the world at approximately 58 per cent. Estimates today show that some companies could be paying anywhere from 50 to 75 per cent. To put this in perspective, these rates apply in other countries with big mining operations. For example, this graph shows quite clearly that the US currently taxes at 40 per cent; Brazil taxes at the same rate as Australia does presently, at 38 per cent, and we know that we compete with Brazil to sell iron ore to Asia, particularly China; in South Africa it is 38 per cent; Peru, 32 per cent; China, 30 per cent; and Chile, 26 per cent. Of course the Canadians are absolutely rapt, because their tax on the mining sector is only 23 per cent. To make it clear, I have been fortunate enough to be in Chile, where BHP has the largest copper mine in the world, Escondida. Chile's resource tax is 26 per Austracent, and BHP CEO Marius Kloppers said, about the risk: If you pay twice the tax in one country that you pay in another for the same product, then tively speaking that other country will become more attractive. It is very simple. I doubt anyone would argue with that. Together with my Western Australian colleagues I have met industry leaders, and key principles have been proposed as to how to make mineral resources tax reform fair. Let me make the point that we are willing to sit down and listen. There was certainly no industry consultation prior to the tax announcement, and now they still do not want to talk about it. The richest man in the country, Fortescue's Andrew Forrest, cannot even get the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to return his phone calls, when previously they were all over him like a rash. Industry is willing to negotiate. It suggests a tax should apply to new investments only, with a focus on keeping the sector competitive on a global scale, not retrospective, as proposed now. The tax rate should vary according to the mineral, because the profit margins differ, and it should also apply to the mineral itself and not other activities that are already subject to company tax. These are crucial issues. For example, we have seen the Labor minister out there peddling the spin that projects like Gorgon, which is home to 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, is at roughly the same tax rate as it would be with the super tax-the petroleum rent resources tax. As Paul Murray, a journalist in the West Australian, rightly pointed out in the newspaper, this is just a blatant lie. Gorgon partners will pay an extra five per cent in tax because the petroleum rent resources tax only kicks in when profits reach the government bond rate plus five per cent. When we are talking about a $40 billion investment, five per cent is a massive amount of money. So what have been the effects to date? rela- There is complete market uncertainty-the share market fell to a nine-month low last week. Fortescue Metals have shelved the $17.8 billion expansion of their Pilbara operation, potentially costing upwards of 30,000 jobs. Consumer confidence has fallen by seven per cent in the last month. The real estate agency Satterley has warned that the tax will add an extra $20,000 to the cost of building a new home, pushing first home buyers out of the market, because, as you know, anything quarried or mined will become dearer. It has risked the sale of Griffin Coal in Western Australia. It has risked the $20 billion expansion of Olympic Dam. Mineralogy's Clive Palmer has slashed exploration in South Australia and put his Pilbara iron ore project on hold. It has risked Santos's investment and 5,000 jobs at the Gladstone LNG project, and Xstrata Copper's $30 billion exploration program in North Queensland has been suspended. But you will not hear any criticism or critical analysis in the West Australian newspaper from the left-wing economics commentator and journalist Shane Wright. At least I am standing up for Western Australia, Shane. The ramifications do not stop there. Superannuants who were hit by the bank guarantee are now bleeding money, with most super funds investing in the resources sector. Almost 10 per cent of Australian superannuation is invested in minerals and mining stocks. Funds are taking a massive hit because of shares prices losing $6 billion following this announcement. The Prime Minister's veiled attempt to link the great big new resource tax with Labor's three per cent increase in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent-against the recommendations of the Henry review-is just spin, because we know that businesses pay superannuation, not governments. In fact, small businesses in particular will be paying the nine to 12 per cent increase and it will not click in for years, whereas this tax comes immediately and small business just cannot afford it. So to say that government is doing this to pay superannuation, particularly on the eastern seaboard, is just a blatant untruth. Essentially, the government has just passed on another cost to Australia businesses at a time when they are doing it tough with rising interest rates and low consumer confidence. In another anti Western Australian move, Labor will short-change the state on GST revenue. In the GST carve-up, Western Australia will collect only 68c of every dollar spent on the GST compared to Victoria's 93c and New South Wales's 95c. Despite being home to 10.3 per cent of Australia's population and producing more than 13 per cent of gross domestic product, WA will collect only 7.1 per cent of GST. The reduction will cost $443 million in revenue-in other words, $200 for every Western Australian man, woman and child. If WA received GST per capita, it would be $1.5 billion better off. WA's share of the GST revenue has continually declined in recent years, despite the state being credited with keeping Australia out of the worse of the global financial crisis. You might have noticed, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, that last week the Western Australian state budget had a surplus of $280 million. I suspect it is the only state government in Australia with a surplus. That has a lot to do with the resources sector and the fact that it is managed in a proper way in Western Australia. Yet this is what Labor would do to that industry in our state. We hear that oft-quoted, xenophobic line that these foreign companies are taking all this money overseas. Xstrata explained recently that, as a totally international company, since they have been in Australia they have earned $44 billion yet they have spent $45 billion. In other words, everything stayed in Australia and more went on exploration. We hear about minerals belonging to all Australians. Sorry, but you pay royalties to a state government because they are state owned resources. So they belong to each particular state. When the GST came into effect on 1 July 2000, Western Australia received 9.7 per cent. It only gets 7.1 per cent now. Throughout that time we heard state Labor crying foul at the Howard government about not getting its fair share of the GST. You wonder where that candidate who was running against me is now. That candidate was saying, ‘We're not getting our fair share from Canberra.' Now, under federal Labor, Western Australia is getting far less than it did before. The position is getting worse. As I said, all Western Australians know about the tax grab by Canberra. The truth is that during the coalition's time in government WA's share of GST rose as high as 10.3 per cent in 2004-05. For the 2006-07 financial year, just before Mr Rudd was elected, Western Australia was receiving 10 per cent. So the bottom line is that since federal Labor was elected Western Australia's share of the GST has fallen by almost three per cent to 7.1 per cent. One has to wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that we now have a Liberal state government in Western Australia, with Premier Barnett sitting at the COAG table. We know that the government makes monetary policy on the run, which costs valuable projects and programs. My attention has been drawn to the funding arrangements for the 2009-10 round of the Grants to Voluntary Environment and Heritage Organisations. These grants help fund real, on-the ground outcomes. But because the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts is reviewing guidelines-or, more likely, busy rectifying the pink batt and solar panel fiascos-the minister is simply going to award funding under the program for 2009-10 based on the grant payments for the 2008-09 financial year. Is this really fair? Canning residents are getting ripped off in more ways than one. The distribution of funds under the government's area consultative committees replacement, Regional Development Australia, indicates more discrimination against WA. Western Australia has nine RDA committees, one of which is in Peel, in my electorate. Over the 2.3 years to 30 June 2012, those nine committees will share in $3.8 million, or an average of $278, 649 per committee each year. Peel will receive $208,000 each year until 2012, which not only is below the average but represents a fall of 20 per cent. Thousands of Canning residents are still waiting for their promised high-speed fibre to-the-node broadband. The NBN is just a pipedream. In this budget the government has committed $16 million-which it cut from the Australian Broadband Guarantee, by the way-to advertising a scheme that does not exist, while Canning families remain reliant on slow, dial-up connections that are no longer capable of meeting the household's needs. I speak often in this chamber about Canning's priorities. To put these in perspective, the $1 billion wasted on the pink batts, split evenly across every electorate in the country, would offer many communities the chance to get some real outcomes on the map. For example, in Mandurah, under its city strategy for 2010-14, that money could have provided for the major upgrade of Pinjarra Road to dual carriageway, estimated to cost $9 million. It could have funded the Sutton Street upgrade, worth $2.5 million, and built the sporting oval at Ocean Road Primary School for $700,000. It could have put $13 million towards a new pool and leisure area at the Mandurah aquatic facility and constructed joint community facilities at the Mandurah Bowling Club for $8 million. The population of the city has doubled in the last 15 years and is expected to grow by three per cent each year over the next four years. In Armadale, investment is sought for the world-class White Water Park at Champion Lakes, which is being championed by Colin Thorpe and his associates in Canoeing WA. Investment is also needed in the upgrading of Armadale Road to dual carriageway, extending the Tonkin Highway to the growing communities of Byford and Mundijong, and building more community facilities like playgrounds and halls in the growing suburbs of Harrisdale and Piara Waters. The Pinjarra Bypass remains a priority, as do upgrades to the Pinjarra Bowling Club and construction of a community hall in Preston Beach. The area always needs more environmental funding to manage waterways and to implement the Landcare projects around Waroona and the Peel Harvey Estuary. The Rudd government has stripped away the funding for the Peel Harvey Catchment Council, which is an absolute disgrace and puts in tatters its green credentials. A coalition government that has a proven record in sound economic management is far better placed to deliver. Governments that rack up huge debts leave communities going without-or those communities end up paying those debts for generations. What Mr Rudd is doing to this country is racking up intergenerational debt. If you believe that he is going to pay it off within three years, you would have to say you believe in the tooth fairy. The previous Labor government, for the whole of their existence, could never bring in a balanced budget. They could never, ever pay off their government debt. As was stated previously, it took a coalition government's prudent and wise management to pay off the debt. Then we put money into the Future Fund, to save it for future generations, and into an education endowment fund and had a surplus. What has happened? The incoming Rudd Labor government have raided all those, bar the Future Fund. Mind you, they have said that that would be an ideal place from which to take $46 billion for the NBN rollout. That was going to be delivered within the term of this government. We have not seen it delivered at all. In fact, they still have not selected anyone to do the job. There is a bit of work being done in Deputy Speaker Sidebottom's state. Tasmania seems to always have a special place in the rollout of these things. Remember Senator Harradine and the leverage that he seemed to have. The Labor government's misjudged priorities in economic management risk the prosperity of our nation and its people for generations. I will be very interested to hear the member for Hasluck standing up for WA when she delivers her speech on this issue shortly. This is not a bill that we can be proud of, because it puts us into debt. It is a referendum on our resources industry, particularly on its effect on Western Australia.",120
151,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Thank you for your contribution and your very kind words about Tasmania.,125
152,Ms JACKSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am pleased to be able to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate bills tonight. I would like to commence by congratulating the Treasurer on this budget, which I believe will further strengthen and secure our economy. It is clear that, with responsible management, the government will have peak debt and get the budget back in the black in three years, which is three years early. As I said, this is a responsible budget. It helps families and it helps to secure future growth. I think that it is appropriate to credit our ministers for the way in which they took decisive action to keep the economy strong and protect jobs during the global financial crisis. Now we see that same decisive action in place, bringing our economy back into surplus. I wanted to talk tonight about some of the issues in these appropriation bills that are specific to Western Australia and to my own seat of Hasluck. In particular I note the substantial contribution in the budget towards national health and hospitals reform, something that I think is long overdue in this country. It is a very significant package of measures to ensure that there is national funding and local management of our national health and hospital system. To that extent, I urge the Western Australian government and the Premier in particular to continue to be involved in discussions with the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, and the Prime Minister to try and ensure that Western Australia's health system also receives the benefit of the national health and hospitals reform. I feel this very personally in my electorate because in the last budget the federal government made a substantial commitment, $180.1 million, towards the new Midland Health Campus in my electorate, a replacement hospital for the Swan Districts Hospital which is already operating beyond capacity. It was identified in the Reid review, a local review, that this hospital was urgently required. That review was undertaken in 2007, and initially commitments were made, including by the current Western Australian state Liberal government, that construction of the new Midland Health Campus would be completed by November 2013. I am sad to say that, as I speak, following the Western Australian budget last week, there is little money from the state government committed in the forward estimates towards the project, and we have been advised that the earliest the hospital might be completed is mid-2015 and more likely mid-2016. So we have a substantial area in my electorate in Perth which has already been found by appropriate experts to be desperately in need of new and upgraded health facilities; but, sadly, that project has now been further delayed by some three years. I take this opportunity to urge the Western Australian government to get real on the question of health and hospital funding and also to stop ignoring the health needs of my community, particularly in the Swan region. While I am on health, can I congratulate the federal government on its decision to increase funding for GP superclinics and perhaps put the minister on notice of my intention to seek funding for the southern end of my electorate. The City of Gosnells is an area where there is a substantial amount of unmet need in terms of GP services, and I know that the establishment of a GP superclinic in that part of my electorate would be gratefully received. I can assure my constituents that I will be knocking on the minister's door with that very proposal. I also congratulate the government on the new national men's health strategy. I was incredibly pleased to see this strategy released. Can I say how pleased I was with the additional funding that was announced as part of that policy for the funding of the tralian Men's Shed Association. As I talk on this point, I am grateful to Eddy from the Kalamunda Men's Shed, who has brought it to my attention. It is something that has been gratefully received in that area and I can commend the minister for these wonderful initiatives. In the area of social networking and support for men, particularly in retirement, the Men's Shed has been an outstanding success. I look forward to joining with the members of the Kalamunda Men's Shed in July to celebrate their first year of operation. I also acknowledge the Richmond Fellowship in my electorate of Hasluck, which received a boost of some $1.29 million to help local families with mental illnesses and particularly to continue their intensive one-onone support services in the MidlandGuildford area of my electorate. This funding was part of the extensions to the Personal Helpers and Mentors Program. I know the Richmond Fellowship of WA provide a very good service and I am delighted that they have been the recipients of that additional funding. In the area of education, I was pleased last week to meet with a number of my local P&C associations. I was keen to get their feedback on their Building the Education Revolution funding and on other education reforms, including the establishment of the My School website. I have to say that, generally speaking, the funding and the reforms have been greeted with much applause by parents and in many cases they are enjoying new facilities and buildings in their schools. I would note, given the comments of the member for Canning-about the small surplus that the Western Australian state government have managed to achieve in their budget-that as part of their funding announcements for education capital works Austhey skilfully included some $425 million of Commonwealth funding that they currently hold for final BER projects. I would urge the state government to hurry up and ensure that those final rounds of project funds are reonly leased so that those schools that receive funding in the second and third rounds can proceed with their projects. I also congratulate the government on the boost to skills training in my electorate and throughout the whole of Australia. It is particularly relevant in a state like mine where there has been significant skills shortage in the recent past. The impact of the almost $80 million that they have invested to extend the Apprentice Kickstart initiative will be to ple the commencement bonus for employers of traditional trade apprentices. It means that in my electorate we will see a substantial number of new apprentices. We are hoping to see some 306 local apprentices get a start this coming year. I look forward to that. say that, from the last round, we saw some 235 apprentices commence in Hasluck and I am pleased to see this additional funding going in that direction. Today in question time some members may have heard me ask a question of the Minister for Housing regarding the rollout of housing programs in my state of Western Australia. I could not resist raising them again because the government's programs have been an outstanding success in my state. Minister Plibersek should be congratulated for the management and rollout of those projects. In Western Australia alone some 28,800 first home buyers received the benefit of the first home owner boost. In addition, something like 170 new homes have been contributed to in my electorate, 20 homes built in the first two rounds of the National Rental Affordability Scheme in places like Gosnells and Midland and 53 homes built through the new stimulus package. Right now there are some 47 sites right across Western Australia with more than 1,100 new homes for Western Australians under way. In my seat alone, we have seen some 243 new rental homes. I was delighted when the minister met with me in Hasluck to visit the site of a project for 16 new affordable housing units for seniors in the city of Gosnells. We were hosted by Gold Style Homes Pty Ltd, a local building company that had been successful in picking up that particular contract. I look forward to the minister visiting again when those new units are available for seniors to move into. The city of Gosnells has also received over $1 million from the Housing Affordability Fund triand 100 homebuyers will receive a discount of around $11,000 each on their homes. That is, as the minister indicated, a massive investment in housing in Western Australia and I thank her very much for that. I also acknowledge the increases that have I can been proposed in the budget to the Local Sporting Champions program. I am very pleased to see an almost doubling of the number of grants to individuals and teams available in my electorate. This has been a valuable initiative. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, you would be familiar with this: the number of requests for funding assistance far outweighs the funding that is available. We all try to do our best to support our local sporting champions. I was also very pleased with how the Australian Sporting Commission's program has been going in my electorate-the Active After-school Communities program. I was very pleased to visit the Southern River Hockey Club during the last school holidays to participate in their local program, and to see literally a hundred kids of varying ages between five and 12 running around the hockey field was a great thing. While I am on my local sporting clubs, I could not possibly let the time go by without referring to the Gosnells footy club centenary. I hope to be a very active participant in their celebrations this year. I say to all involved with the club: congratulations on your hard work and I hope the centenary celebrations go well. Go Gozzy Hawks for this year's football competition. In the time. I have left I would like to touch on infrastructure programs within my electorate. I am pleased to say that finally we have seen the funding approved for the upgrade of the Great Eastern Highway-Roe Highway interchange. This is an amazingly busy interchange of two very important highways-the Great Eastern Highway being the main arterial road to everything east and Roe Highway joins the Great Northern Highway being the major arterial road to the north. This is one of the busiest intersections in Western Australia with 168,000 vehicle movements. The upgrade of this intersection is well overdue. I am pleased to see that money has finally been set aside in both state and federal government budgets to ensure that this project proceeds. Having said that, I reassure those businesses in the Midvale industrial area that I have not forgotten or overlooked your concerns about access to the industrial area and I can assure you that we are certainly lobbying both state and local governments-the Shire of Mundaring-to see if we cannot overcome those issues. On road funding, I note there has been an increase in the allocation to local councils Roads to Recovery and for the Black Spot Program. I place on the record that I will be knocking on the door of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, to say that I hope some of these funds get spent on Kalamunda Road, which is in urgent need of an upgrade. It is often overlooked, despite its proximity to Perth airport and its proximity to the brickworks that were established on Perth airport land by the previous government. Traffic continues to be a major issue in that area and I hope that funding will be directed towards that particular problem. I am delighted and can inform the House that construction has started on the Kalamunda Community Cultural Centre. It is a project that was funded under the Regional Community Local Infrastructure Program and work also continues on the Swan Regional Riverside Park, also a beneficiary of that particular program. It is important to acknowledge that the budget also included the third round of tax cuts that were promised by the Rudd government on its election. I am pleased that will tackle, at least in part, some of the pressure households are feeling with cost of living adjustments. I was most concerned-and I have previously raised this in the parliament-that Western Australians were being slugged on household fees and charges following last year's budget and I am sad to say that again this year the Liberal state government have chosen to slug households. Electricity went up by around 23 to 25 per cent last year and is going up by a further 17 per cent this year, which is some $194 for each household. Water is up by 17 per cent, an additional $122.50. Public transport has been put up. Car licence fees have been put up. The emergency services levy has been put for up. The price of gas has been put up. A conservative figure-and I say ‘conservative' because this is what the Liberal state government itself estimates-for the impact on most households is around $367.60 per year. I make the point that, in contrast, Colin Barnett seems to have been incredibly passionate in defending big miners in the state of Western Australia. As an article in the West comments: ‘If only he had shown the same passion for protecting Western Australian families.' To be fair to the West, I think that is a quote of the opposition leader, Eric Ripper. But I am grateful to see those tax cuts included in this year's budget and I am sure that will make a difference to some households. While we are talking about tax cuts, it is appropriate to acknowledge the improvements for small business. The company tax cut is for both big and large business but, in addition to that, there is the tax break for small business where sole traders, partnerships and incorporated small businesses will be able to instantly deduct the cost of assets valued at up to $5,000 in the year of their purchase. I think this is a terrific initiative. It will mean less red tape as they will no longer need to apply different depreciation schedules to assets. Every one of the 7,245 small businesses in Hasluck will get a tax break under the Rudd government's proposal. Time will not permit me today to talk at length about the resource super profits tax, but I could not possibly let the comments of the member for Canning pass without making some comment in reply. The package as a whole that has been put forward by the Rudd government will be judged ultimately by Western Australians on its merits and not on the basis of claims that have been made by some in their fear campaigns. The package as a whole includes refundable tax credits for royalties paid, staged reductions in company tax and the resource exploration rebate, which will benefit small to medium explorers and mining companies. I acknowledge that companies take into account a range of matters in determining where they make their investments. Tax is one part of an investment decision. So is, for example, political stability and good economic circumstances-measures on which I believe Australia leads the world. And, notwithstanding these proposed tax changes, Western Australia remains a very attractive place for capital investment. As people have said, profit based taxes not new in the Australian context and we already have a similar tax that applies to the petroleum resources industry-a tax that I acknowledge has a different impact level, but one that at 40 per cent has not seen a downturn in that industry. On the contrary, some of the biggest projects in Australian history have commenced under that regime, which has been in place for 20 years. It is also to say that not all Western Australians had an equal share in the last mining boom. I am pleased to see the benefits of this new taxing regime will actually see significant investment in infrastructure in Western Australiainfrastructure necessary to support the resource industry. (Time expired)",125
153,Mr BRIGGS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I rise to speak this evening on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 in conjunction with the other appropriation bills before this place. In doing so I make the point that this budget highlights that you just cannot trust Labor with the nation's finances. It quite clearly is the third consecutive budget where the Rudd government has failed to deliver a well thought through budget that will help set Australia up for the future. Instead, we see another big deficit to follow the previous one, which was a record deficit in our history. This year we have an even bigger budget based on tax increases and featuring the introduction of a great big new tax on mining, which the previous speaker, the member for Hasluck, unfortunately did not have enough time to continue making remarks on. I am sure she would have enjoyed spending another 20 minutes or so talking about the benefits to Western Australia of this great big new tax on mining, as so many other Western Australians on this side of the House have already highlighted! Labor's major political claim in this Rudd budget is that it will deliver a surplus in three years time. Labor has not delivered a surplus are since it has been in government, but it expects us to believe that in three years time, with no additional spending programs and with no additional programs blowing out, it will deliver a $1 billion surplus. That is a rounding error, as far as the federal budget is concerned. Coincidentally, $1 billion is the figure for the blow-out in the computers in schools program and is equal to the blow-out fair in the insulation program, so those on the other side tend to like that $1 billion figure. You cannot believe Labor or trust Labor when they say they will deliver a surplus in three years time because, if you look at what they have done since they have been in government, everything points in the opposite direction. The claim is based on very optimistic assumptions in the budget, including a compounding 20 per cent growth in the industry on which they have decided to whack a great big new tax of 40 per cent. That will, of course, reduce investment. But in Labor's books, if you tax it more, they will come. On the one hand, if you tax the cigarette industry more, that will reduce the number of people taking up smoking; on the other hand, if you tax the mining industry more, people will be rushing to invest. That does not make sense, nor do Labor's optimistic budget assumptions. This government has spent Australia into massive debt. We will have net debt of nearly $100 billion by 2013, which is around the same level of debt we found in 1996 when we took government and around the same level of debt we will have to face if we are successfully elected to government, which I believe we will be in three or so months time. This financial year will deliver the gest budget deficit in Australia's history and the next will not be far short of it. This reduce the ability of the government to fund worthy programs into the future. It will put additional pressure on interest rates, and we are already seeing that in the Australian economy today. You just cannot trust the Rudd Labor government with the economy and you certainly cannot trust them to implement a program. Let us have a look at the litany of waste and mismanagement of this government. Today we saw in the galleries around us workers from the insulation industry who are now out of work. These small business people some months ago had an opportunity and a future. Their dreams were destroyed by those on the other side. I know that the member for Longman is distraught at the prospect that these insulation small businesses face. It is going to cost the Commonwealth $1 billion to clean up the mess it created when spending around $500 million in that program. That is quite an extraordinary feat, even for those on the other side. We saw another $1 billion blow-out in the computers in schools program. Again there was a complete failure in implementing the government's policy. We have seen a $39 billion blow-out in the initial promise on the NBN, a program I suspect will never see the light of day. It was a good political promise, and that was all it was ever intended to be in 2007. We have seen over $600 million in consultancy fees. Of course, we have the mother of all blow-outs-the Building the Education Revolution or, as the member for Sturt unkindly puts it, the memorial school hall program. In the electorate of Mayo we have seen some very clear and good examples-sad examples, unfortunately-of BER mismanagement. We raised the first one in parliament with the Deputy Prime Minister last bigyear. Of course she just brushes these offthere are no problems at all; there is no waste will and mismanagement in the system; everything is going swimmingly. The first one was on Kangaroo Island. Some $100,000 was spent on architectural fees for a drawing that already existed. I notice that the Deputy Prime Minister has been busily working with her colleagues in recent days. She was so keen to deny she had any interest in the leadership last week that she was in the media by 9.30 in the morning making sure there was lots of camera footage of her denying that she was interested in the leadership. In the same week she popped up on the Sunday program. When interviewed by Laurie Oakes she also denied she was interested in the leadership. I raised with her last year the Eastern Fleurieu School, which has been treated terribly by both the federal Labor government and the state Labor government. The state government said it is a multicampus school. When the schools were first combined in the late 1990s the state government gave them an assurance they would be treated as single schools; however, when it came to this program they were treated as one school, so they missed out on about $2 million. That is a very good example of the inability of this government to implement a program properly and, therefore, fairly. We saw issues with water tanks at the Yankalilla Area School, the Macclesfield school, the Basket Range Primary School, the Stirling East Primary School and the Eden Hills Primary School, which is just out of my electorate. This is the greatest example of state government cost-shifting we have seen-something the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister both said very clearly could not happen under this program and would not be accepted under this program. The Deputy Prime Minister said they would crack down on it and there would be severe penalties. She said she would not allow state governments to cost-shift. Yet she was strangely quiet when contacted about this issue. It seems in this case it is government to cost-shift. The Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission last year recommended that schools have appropriate levels of bushfire protection. Everyone supports that. My electorate of Mayo, which is in the Adelaide Hills and on the Fleurieu Peninsula, is a high-risk bushfire zone; therefore, most of the schools are caught up in that respect. The state government wants these schools to have bushfire water tanks. The problem here is that that is a state government requirement and they are forcing BER funding to be used for this and therefore reducing quite significantly-up to $100,000 in most cases-the amount they have for their school buildings. The Deputy Prime Minister promised she would say to her state colleagues-Jay Weatherill is the new SA education minister: ‘This is not good enough. I said this could not happen. We told you when we first announced this program that you were not to cost-shift and were not to take what should be state government spending and put it on this federal program.' Instead, she has let her Labor mates get away with ripping off these schools and taking away their entitlements. We will hear much more about this because there are angry mums and we all know what dealing with angry mums is like. Five mums are the chairpersons of these schools and they are extremely angry. They will continue to give both this federal Labor government and their state Labor colleagues in South Australia a hard time about this. I am sure the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport, who is at the table, would understand the difficulty of dealing with angry mums when it comes to these sorts of issues. This issue is a very good example of how this program has been so badly implemented by okay for the state this government. This litany of waste and mismanagement will cost the Australian people for future generations. When the stimulus package was first put to this parliament we said it was too big and too fast. There ended up being a quarter of negative growth, which we hit with $100 billion of debt, which will dog generations to come. It was too much too soon and that is why we at the time opposed it-and we were right to do so. The Rudd Labor government have a record of waste and mismanagement and misunderstanding the economy. They ask us to believe them when they say that sometime in 2013 they are going to deliver a surplus budget. It is simply unbelievable. You just cannot trust the government to deliver on their promises. We will see that yet again with these rubbery budget figures. In dealing with this government and its budget promises, a particular issue has been glossed over a little in the last few weeks with the avalanche of backdowns on policy issues. It was hard to keep up. You had the greatest moral challenge of our time junked, you had the insulation program junked, and who could forget the childcare centre promise-that key election promise from last year? I am sure the Minister for Early hood Education, Childcare and Youth tossed and turned at night in working out the language she would have to use to junk that program-another key election promise that they just crab-crawled away from. Another one that I think highlights very much the superficial, fraudulent nature of this government was the advertising promise that it made in no uncertain terms before the last election. Thankfully, I have some of the remarks that the Prime Minister made about government advertising prior to the last elecpublic tion. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may remember the key promise of the then Rudd opposition was to have the Auditor-General vet all government advertising so none of it could go to air without the Auditor-General giving his tick off. That was the promise. In fact, some of the rhetoric that the now Prime Minister used to describe government advertising was as ‘a long-term cancer on our democracy'. ‘I believe this is a sick cancer within our system; it is a cancer on democracy,' he told 7.30 Report on 9 October 2007. In 2008, when he was elected, he implemented a role for the Auditor-General in looking at government advertising. The Auditor-General did not have vetting power but he had the ability to report that an advertising campaign complied or did not comply with the guidelines that had been laid down. We expressed concern at the time about the position the Auditor-General was being placed in. On the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit we have had many discussions with the Auditor-General about how this role has been fulfilled. However, unbeknownst to most members of this place, the government implemented a reasonably secret and quiet report headed by Dr Allan Hawke, a former chief of staff to former Prime Minister Paul Keating. So in late March, a month before this budget was due, what do you know-this Child- report recommended that the Auditor General's role should be removed. The Labor Prime Minister, the opposition leader at the time, had sung from every rooftop he could possibly find that he would fix this problem. On 19 November 2007, in a doorstop interview with two Labor candidates-a gentleman named Rodney Cox, although I am not sure which seat he was running for, and Mike Symon, who is now the member for Deakin-he said: Well, I am dead serious in returning decency to administration. What's the machinery that we have outlined for doing this? This is government advertising. He said: That is for the Auditor General to make a determination about the content of television advertising campaigns on behalf of the government. His promise was about the content of advertising campaigns and that got junked in late March, a month before the budget, a budget which, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be very surprised to learn contains $126 million to be The spent in 15 months on the government's election priorities-climate change, health and tax reform, to name three of the five. In fact, it gets worse for the Prime Minister with his own words. On 10 October 2007, the Prime Minister said: Why not have a system whereby three months prior to when an election is dueabout nowfor there to be a ban on publicly-funded advertising unless explicitly agreed between the leader of the government and the leader of the Opposition … That is an absolute undertaking from us. I believe this is a sick cancer within our system; it cancer on our democracy. An absolute undertaking. Sure, it is not the greatest moral challenge of our time, I accept that, but it is an absolute undertaking. Again, you just cannot trust what this Prime Minister says. You cannot trust the Rudd Labor government to deliver, to implement, any of their promises because what they say before an election they will not be held to account for after an election, and this is the greatest of all examples. I think it is even bigger than the greatest moral challenge of our time because it gets to the absolute political opportunist, the hollow man himself, and the way that this Prime Minister governs our country. It is a wrong thing that he has done. He gave an absolute undertaking that he would implement this measure as part of the Auditor General's role. The Auditor-General has not gone quietly, it must be said. He wrote a letter to the Special Minister of State on 29 March, two days after he had been told he had been cut from the government advertising process. He made some very interesting comments. In particular, in the second paragraph of this letter-this is in a report he released last Friday and which we discussed with him this morning in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit-he said that the decision to remove the Auditor-General from the process was a marked contrast to the arrangements for the implementation of government policy platform ‘following the 2007 election when our view was sought on the proposed approach and the draft guidelines to apply. At the time the government was keen for my office to be directly involved in the review of advertising campaigns consistent with the various statements by Mr Rudd and the shadow minister leading up to the election'. In other words, when it suited the Labor is a Party to use the Auditor-General for political purposes they did. When they wanted to get him out of the road so they could run out the political government funded advertising campaigns, they did that too. That is what we saw on the weekend with the first of the public information campaigns on the health issue which are some of the most political as you are ever likely to see. They are actually really bad as but, putting that aside, they are the most political, blatant use of government money we have seen. So those on the other side are complete hypocrites. They cannot justify this. They will not even try to. I bet their response will be, ‘Look at what the former Howard government did.' That will be their response instantly because they have no defence for the complete hypocrisy of their Prime Minister on this issue. This budget fails to deliver. It is a true Labor budget-big spending and big taxing. We have seen reports today of the impact of their great big tax on mining on 18 workers in a regional centre of my electorate, not BHP or Rio Tinto workers, with a salt mine most likely shutting if this tax goes ahead. What we have said and what the Leader of the Opposition has said very clearly is that people will have a choice at the next election in this respect. They can either vote for a Liberal government that will stop this great big new tax on mining, or they can vote for a Rudd Labor government or a Gillard Labor government, whichever it is by election day, that will implement this great big new tax on mining. I am sure the member for Longman will be happy to go out and sing to his electorate in Queensland about the benefits of a great big new tax on mining. I look forward to seeing his campaign literature with the great big new tax on mining all over it. I just have a sneaking suspicion that his internal polling will tell him not to say anything about it. We have a very clear position on this. We will not have a great big new tax on mining. We will cut the budget. We will bring it back into surplus. We will deliver what we did for 11½ years in government-strong economic management, contributing more jobs to the economy and giving people hope and a chance at a future, not cutting into their future dreams.

154,Mr SULLIVAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Longman) (8.23 pm)Twelve months ago, the shadow Treasurer stood in this chamber and scoffed. Labor could not achieve its budgeted outcomes he said. Well, events have proven him wrong, so very wrong, but there was no mea culpa forthcoming from the shadow Treasurer. Instead, the shadow Treasurer again stood in this chamber and sought to cast doubts on the capacity of this year's budget to deliver on its forecasts, ably supported of course by a conga line of Hanrahans, each of them prepared to declare that we'll all be rooned within the year. The truth is as plain as it is painful for the dollar. opposition. Action by the Rudd Labor government, on the advice of Treasury, the IMF and the World Bank, averted the havoc that was wrought upon the rest of the world by the global financial crisis. Clearly this will never be acknowledged by those opposite, who hold the deep conviction that only they are entitled to govern Australia, only they are capable of steering our economy. Our success, they say, was all due to them. We inherited an economy that was in a position of strength-that is true. Did it help that there were cash reserves? Of course it did. Did it help that our banks are well regulated? Of course it did. All of which, however, would have counted for nothing without a stimulus. I want to quote a Queensland statistician, Scott Steel, a writer for the online news organisation, Crikey, who ran the ruler over the effects of the various international stimulus spends: According to IMF data and the consistency and significance of the stimulus/forecast error relationship, a stimulus package in Australia around the 2.2% of GDP would have given us zero growth-anything less than that would have delivered us negative growth. When the Coalition says the stimulus package should have been smaller-they need to be asked how much smaller. Every drop in GDP causes an increase in size of unemployment. How many more people would they have been willing to throw on the scrap heap of unemployment in their pursuit of a smaller package? Every time the Coalition complains about debt, they need to be asked how much smaller they believe the stimulus package should have been and how many more people would they have been willing to throw on the scrap heap of unemployment in their pursuit of a smaller debt load. Debt was the cost of growth-growth was and always is the provider of jobs. Pretending that less debt could have provided the same jobs is fairy floss economics. A dollar is a dollar is a The size of stimulus packages mattered-the international evidence is in. The Coalition needs to be questioned about its economic viewpoints-viewpoints which are far from mainstream economics, existing on the very fringes of economic debate and which are completely at odds, completely and utterly at odds, with the international empirical evidence. You know what an argument without evidence is called? ‘Making it up' was not Mr Steel's answer, but it was something quite similar to that. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, has publicly indicated via the ABC's The 7.30 Report that that is exactly what he does-makes it up to suit the moment. It is clear that Australia's economy is strong. On every measure we are in a superior position to similar economies worldwide. Despite the shadow Treasurer's derision 12 months ago, we are in a position to achieve the unthinkable-returning to budget surplus in three years, a full three years ahead of expectation just 12 month ago, and halving the peak debt. That will be a great achievement. But the shadow Treasurer is nothing if not a trier. Last year as part of scoffing he declared budget forecasts and projections to be optimistic. Last week, as if to explain away the remarkable 2009-10 outcome, he declared them to be pessimistic. Today he cast doubt on this year's projections and forecasts as again being optimistic. As shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney is a one-trick pony. I want to turn to some of the measures in the budget. The budget provides funding for the national broadcaster, the ABC, including additional money to purchase equipment to enable it to switch over to digital broadcasting. Coincidentally, today the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee questioned ABC representatives as part of the estimates processes. Again they were forced to listen to assertions from Senator Abetz that the ABC has a bias towards Labor. The good senator might like to consider another isolated example when levelling bias charges at the ABC. Around about 1.30 pm on 11 February this year, the environment minister rose in this place to make a ministerial statement in relation to the Home Insulation Program. In a clearly worded statement the minister dealt with each occurrence that had been characterised as a warning, whether it was a report, a letter or other communication or incident. The minister spelt out what action had been taken in each instance and which department officials, which industry associations, which safety organisations or still which unions had been involved. He advised the parliament of the decisions made and the actions taken. That evening, as I travelled back to my accommodation, the local ABC radio station led its 10 pm news bulletin with an item beginning with words, ‘Peter Garrett had 13 warnings on home insulation program but did nothing.' If it was not those exact words, it was words very similar. That sounded to me then to be very much like the his mantra that was being chanted by the opposition at the time. Eight and a half hours after the minister stood to refute those claims, our national broadcaster, broadcasting from the national capital, continued to repeat parrotfashion the opposition's line. That does not sound to me like the actions of an organisation biased towards the Labor government.",134
155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Order! It being 8.30, the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member for Longman will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Age Pension To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia Draws the attention of the House to the inadequacy of the Age Pension to provide a decent standard of living for older Australians. Older Australians need sufficient income to enable them to live healthy lives as active members of their communities. We therefore ask the House to increase the Age Pension to guarantee a decent standard of living for those whose total income is inadequate to meet today's costs of living. by Mrs Irwin (from 259 citizens) National Marriage Day PETITION TO DECLARE THE 13TH AUGUST NA To the honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: We, the undersigned citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House of Representatives, the undeniable correlations between family breakdown and the other pathways to poverty, educational failure, serious personal debt, crime, welfare dependency and addiction. In recognition of the positive contribution that intact, stable marriages make to the well-being of children and society we call upon the House of Representatives to demonstrate its support for marriage by declaring the 13th August each year as National Marriage Day. by Mrs Irwin (from 6 citizens) Lymphoedema To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the plight of those citizens who suffer primary or secondary lymphoedema, a serious chronic medical condition for which there is no cure. If untreated, lymphoedema frequently leads to cellulitis, a condition which is costly and difficult to manage, and which often results in lengthy hospital stays. We ask the House to recognise lymphoedema as a serious chronic medical condition and to include lymphoedema in the enhanced primary care programme. We ask the House to allocate resources as a matter of urgency to establish regional and rural lymphoedema treatment centres. We ask the House to provide funding for a public education campaign on lymphoedema, for a central register of lymphoedema treatment practitioners, and for a national lymphoedema helpline and website. We ask that provision be made within Medicare for the cost of lymphoedema treatment, including the cost of compression garments, necessary for the successful management of lymphoedema. We ask that the House adopt the International Lymphoedema Framework (ILF) Best Practice model (2007) when planning and implementing lymphoedema detection, treatment and management protocols. by Mrs Irwin (from 300 citizens) Marriage To the honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: NA NA We, the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled, that the definition of marriage as “a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, he opposed. by Mrs Irwin (from 979 citizens) National School Chaplaincy Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain concerned citizens of Australia draws the attention of the house to the following: The National School Chaplaincy Program, built on the excellent history of school chaplaincy in Australia, was introduced by the former Coalition Government in 2007/08 with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. It was endorsed by Prime Minister Rudd who said “they (Chaplains) actually are providing the glue which keeps school communities rolling”. The program offers pastoral care and spiritual guidance to all. Chaplains necessarily have religious beliefs which underpin their work. These beliefs are representative of the school communities the chaplains work in and they do not hinder chaplains from working with those of other beliefs or none. It operates in ,1915 schools and enjoys strong support among principals, schools and in the community generally. The Rudd Government (as at October 2009) has refused to confirm its ongoing support and funding for the program, despite the program's social benefits, sound administration and strong community support. We, the undersigned petitioners, request that the House urges the Rudd Government continue providing funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program in its current form. by Mrs Irwin (from 892 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong Global Effort to Stop the Persecution of Falun Gong To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Dafa (also known as Falun Gong) is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chinese communist regime since July 1999, causing thousands to lose their lives and many thousands more to be physically and mentally impaired from torture. According to investigative reports written by Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas and former Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific) David Kilgour, thousands more Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for China's crative transplant market and lost their lives (www.organharvestinvestigation.net ). We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to openly, forthrightly and immediately call for an immediate end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China. by Mrs Irwin (from 6,071 citizens) National School Chaplaincy Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the National School Chaplaincy Program, built on the excellent history of school chaplaincy in Australia, which was introduced by the former Coalition Government in 2007/08 with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. It was endorsed by Prime Minister Rudd who said “they (Chaplains) actually are providing the glue which keeps school communities rolling”. The program offers pastoral care and spiritual guidance to all. Chaplains necessarily have religious beliefs which underpin their work. These beliefs are representative of the school communities the chaplains work in and they do not hinder chaplains from working with those of other beliefs or none. It operates in 1915 schools and enjoys strong support among principals, schools and in the community generally. The Rudd Government has extended funding for the program, at a reduced level, until the end of 2011, after which time there may be no more funding despite the program's social benefits, sound administration and strong community support. Malcolm Turnbull has announced that if elected, the Coalition would continue funding the program in its current form, at its current level of $165 million over 3 years. We therefore ask that the Rudd Government continue funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program in its current form. by Mrs Irwin (from 193 citizens) Lymphoedema lu- To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the urgent need in regional and rural Australia for more accessible services to diagnose, treat and manage the serious chronic medical condition of lymphoedema. We, the petitioners, therefore ask the House to provide training for general medical practitioners throughout Australia in the detection, assessment and treatment of lymphoedema in accordance with the Lymphoedema Framework. Best Practice for the Management of Lymphoedema. International Consensus (IC) 2006. We ask the House to urgently allocate funding for the appointment of trained lymphoedema therapists in medical centres and community nursing services throughout Australia. In accordance with the IC best practice model we ask the House to provide funding for up to twenty (20) hours of manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) per annum, integral to the treatment of lymphoedema. In accordance with the IC best practice model we, the petitioners, ask the House to provide funding for up to six (6) pairs of custom made compression garments per annum, essential to the management of lymphoedema. We, the petitioners, ask the House of Representatives for financial assistance for transport where travel of more than 40 kms is necessary to access the services of a lymphoedema therapist qualified to assess, treat and manage lymphoedema. by Mrs Irwin (from 56 citizens) Australia Post: Pakenham Mail Box To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This Petition of citizens of Pakenham in the State of Victoria draws the attention of the House to the need for an Australia Post u ‘I. box to be located to the north of the old Princes Highway adjacent to the mixed business shop at the corner of Irving Road and Ahern Road, Pakenham. We therefore ask the House to take the necessary action to ensure that a mailbox is installed by Australia Post at the corner of Irving Road and Ahern Road, Pakenham, for the use of residents in the surrounding local community. by Mrs Irwin (from 180 citizens) National School Chaplaincy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the National School Chaplaincy Program, built on the excellent history of school chaplaincy in Australia, which was introduced by the former Coalition Government in 2007/08 with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. It was endorsed by Prime Minister Rudd who said “they (Chaplains) actually are providing the glue which keeps school communities rolling”. The program offers pastoral care and spiritual guidance to all. Chaplains necessarily have religious beliefs which underpin their work. These beliefs are representative of the school communities the chaplains work in and they do not hinder chaplains from working with those of other beliefs or none. It operates in 1915 schools and enjoys strong support among principals, schools and in the community generally. The Rudd Government has extended funding for the program, at a reduced level, until the end of 2011, after which time there may be no more funding despite the program's social benefits, sound administration and strong community support. The Coalition has announced that if elected, it would continue funding the program in its current form, at its current level of $165 million over 3 years. We therefore ask that the Rudd Government continue funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program in its current form. by Mrs Irwin (from 51 citizens) Innisfail: Jubilee Bridge To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the HOUSE to the dangerous condition of the Jubilee Bridge which crosses the South Johnstone River in the centre of the Innisfail Township in North Queensland. This bridge is the main traffic (vehicle and pedestrian) thoroughfare linking the residents of East Innisfail to the CBD. The current bridge is sinking and its complete closure is imminent. Over 30% of Innisfail residents live in East Innisfail and the bridge has approximately 8,000 vehicular movements per day. The closure of the bridge will not only be a major inconvenience to our residents but it will place enormous additional strain on the Highway through Innisfail, as this is the only alternate route. The Cassowary Coast Regional Council is listed as Queensland's most financially stressed Local Government Authority and has no way of funding or even making a considerable contribution to the construction of a new bridge. Our region is also suffering from unemployment levels far in excess of the National average and we believe that the proposed new bridge is a “shovel ready” project that Fits perfectly into the criteria for Stimulus Package Funding. We therefore ask the HOUSE to provide $8 Million to supplement the $12 Million that the Queensland Government has already committed to having the bridge replaced. by Mrs Irwin (from 2,761 citizens) Human Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of members and supporters of the Mornington Peninsula Human Rights Group draws to the attention of the House: The National Human Rights Consultation Report (Brennan Report) recommends that “Australia adopt a federal Human Rights Act” (Recommendation 18). Although the Report discusses in detail what such an Act should contain, it does not provide a draft bill for the Act. This critics and opponents, especially The Australian newspaper, the Australian Christian Lobby and Archbishop George Pell, to mount an alarmist campaign based on speculation about possible adverse consequences of human rights legislation. We therefore ask the House to: introduce a bill for a Human Rights Act and release it for community comment before the next election. by Mrs Irwin (from 117 citizens) School and Workplace Bullying To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: Draws to the attention of the House: The continual catastrophic consequences victims suffer as a result of school and workplace bullying with no laws to successfully protect victims against such behaviour and no laws to successfully prosecute perpetrators or corporations who allow victims to continually suffer at the hands of their bullies with the most common outcome of the victim to not only suffer psychological damage and even suicide, but always it is the victim who is removed from their classroom or place of work whether it be a managerial, medical or personal reason, leaving behind their friends and familiarity whilst their perpetrators are allowed to continue successfully in their place of choice with little if any consequences. I therefore ask the House to: Introduce an Australian categorical law to protect such victims of such abuse – ‘bullying' - with the ability to successfully prosecute perpetrators or corporations who continually allow victims to not only suffer psychological breakdowns as a result of bullying, but for the law to also protect the victims rights to remain in their classroom with the entitlement to be allowed the privilege of a fair education free of torment and fear and for the worker to remain at their work site as a good employee to be allowed the privilege of fair employment without torment or fear. by Mrs Irwin (from 1 citizen) New South Wales Ambulance Drivers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of has allowed the House of Representatives: This petition of citizens from the Paterson electorate draws the attention of the House to the Keneally Labor Government's proposal to replace highly-trained ambulance drivers with volunteers in Bulandelah, Stroud and Gloucester. We therefore ask the House to: (1) Call on the State Labor Government to refute the proposal to replace ambulance drivers with volunteers. (2) Call on the State Labor Government to maintain a two person ambulance crew with fully trained ambulance personnel.. (3) Ensure the Rudd Labor Government makes health services a priority and ensures adequate funding to train more paramedics and ambulance personnel. (4) Call on the Rudd Labor Government that is it not acceptable for Labor to leave regional areas and their patients without adequate trained ambulance personnel to save a few dollars. by Mrs Irwin (from 119 citizens) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of a ‘resident of Australia' and tain citizens of Australia' draws to the House; wrongful misbehaviour by 3 judges of the High Court of Australia, to obstruct an unrepresented party seeking a Writ to correct Orders caused by wrongful misbehaviour by Family Court of Australia judges that also warrants a section(s) 72(ii) of the Constitution of Australia prayer. A judge failed to comply with the Law regarding Notice of Constitutional Issues. Then made Final Orders of dismissal in breach of s78B(5) of the Judiciary Act 1903, offensively without Oral Hearing. In breach of “Just Cause” Rights for Leave to Appeal, concealing the above judges wrongs, 2 judges of the Special Leave to Appeal High Court allowed 2 Court officers to yell and scream at the unrepresented party so his Oral submissions could not be heard then “Leave to Appeal” the judge's wrongs, was denied. We pray this Honourable House requests the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee create a Subcommittee, pursuant to Standing Orders 215 & 234, to investigate the issues of this petition and the Hansard recorded “Administration of Justice” petitions 23 November 2009 and 15 March 2010.

Draws to the attention of the House: Continual ETSA supply power failures. The residents of Younghusband and surrounding Districts have experienced numerous power failures over the past few months, as follows. 30 November 2009, 15 December 2009, 17 December 2009, 14 January 2010, 18 January 2010, ‘cer- 25 January 2010, 28 January 2010, 02 February the attention of 2010, 04 February 2010. Our Residents and Surrounding Districts rely on a reliable power supply to be able to pump water for basic human needs, also to be able to cook as there is no mains water or natural gas supply. We therefore ask the House to: Follow up this complaint with ETSA and any other relevant parties, to achieve an outcome which rectifies our interrupted power supply. by Mrs Irwin (from 249 citizens) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: NA HOUSE 15TH MARCH 2010 This petition of Antal Bittmann and fellow citizens that have been aggrieved by an administrative decision of a member of the Judiciary or an Officer of the Commonwealth as set out in Section 75(v) of the Constitution. A writ of mandamus to show cause is based on a presumption of misbehaviour. Four writs were served and heard in the High Court in 2008. Officers of the Commonwealth, appointed by the Governor General made or sought orders to liquidate and/or freeze assets of companies and/or depositors on a presumption of insolvency. These Officers (judicators) tendered their submission to the High Court. The High Court failed to set aside orders that were obtained on a presumption. Where a cause is pending involving interpretations of the Constitution, it is the duty of the Court not to proceed without advising Parliament. This is a matter that must be given to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and for the House to resolve. We the aggrieved citizens, with the right of petitioning the Parliament (a long established fundamental right), we request both Houses to use their exclusive powers to terminate appointments that breach the rules of natural justice. We ask the House to address matters where only Parliament has jurisdiction. by Mrs Irwin (from 1 citizen) Fair Trade Chocolate To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia Draws to the attention of the house that since the ‘Harkin - Engel' protocol signing in 2001 only slow progress has been made in ending the worse forms of child labour in the cocoa industry We therefore ask the House to act to set a deadline for the importation of cocoa products involving the use of the worse forms of child labour. We ask for a deadline for two reasons. Firstly because in 2001 the Chocolate Manufacturers Association and the World Cocoa Foundation agreed in the Harkin - Engel protocol that by July 1, 2005 they could eliminate THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOUR”. Secondly because cocoa and chocolate companies such as Cadbury's (with t heir Dairy Milk chocolate) and Nestle (Kit Kat UK) have already shown that it is possible to comply with the protocol. We ask the House that this deadline includes developing and implementing industry-wide standards of public certification for imports of cocoa beans and their derivative products so that such items will not be allowed to be imported into Australia unless they are shown to have been grown and/or processed without any of the worse forms of child labour as listed in article three in ILO convention 182 which Australia ratified on 19th December 2006. by Mrs Irwin (from 8,547 citizens) Education: Intelligent Creation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: We the below being christians and voters resident within Australia wish to draw to the attention of the house that education departments within this country are not allowing the teaching of intelligent creation of the beginnings of man in state schools. We request legislation to allow biblical truth back into all of our education systems by Mrs Irwin (from 49 citizens) Petitions received. Responses Mrs Irwin-The following ministerial responses to petitions have been received: Indigenous Deaths Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 19 November 2009 regarding a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration concerning the death in custody of Mr Ward. The petition states that the treatment of Mr Ward violated Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Convention of the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It further states that these violations need to be remedied and their recurrence prevented. The petition calls for a review of the legal framework for giving effect to Australia's human rights treaty obligations and to international standards within the criminal justice system, with particular attention to the role of imprisonment in punishment, rehabilitation and public security, the conditions of imprisonment and the transport of prisoners, and the comparative capacity of private and state run custodial services to conform with minimum human rights standards and rehabilitate prisoners. With respect to questions of violation of international treaties, I note that the coronial inquest into the death of Mr Ward found that Australia's obligations under the ICCPR had been breached - in particular article 10(1) which requires that “[a]ll persons deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person”. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has made a request for information about the case. The Government's response to this request has been referred to in a report to the UN by the Special Rapporteur dated 25 February 2010. In addition, both the Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against Torture have taken a keen interest in Aboriginal deaths in custody. Because of the importance the Government places on compliance with Australia's international human rights obligations I have drawn the Government's concerns to the attention of the Western Australian Government, and asked that it keep the Commonwealth updated about its attitude to the human rights implications raised by this case. Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which aims to prevent torture around the world. The Government has taken further steps to demonstrate its position against torture by enacting a law to ate a Commonwealth offence of torture. This law, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Act 2010, commenced on 14 April 2010. The Government has also signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OpCAT). The OpCAT is a further prevention and enforcement mechanism aimed at achieving the purposes of the Convention against Torture. Ratification of the OpCAT will mean allowing the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture to conduct periodic inspections of all our prisons and other places of detention; and establishing a national preventive mechanism at the domestic level, responsible for conducting regular inspections to examine the treatment of persons in detention. These mechanisms will complement arrangements already in place in Australia that ensure detainees are treated with humanity, and are not subject to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment. The petition also calls for the House to direct and resource the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to conduct a public inquiry into systemic rights violations that underpin the extreme overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians at all levels of contact with the criminal justice system and to propose remedies for addressing them, including reviewing the outstanding recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I also draw your attention to the role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner within the AHRC to carry out functions, including reporting annually on enjoyment and exercise of human rights by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and recommending action where necessary to ensure those rights are observed. The most recent Social Justice Commissioner report was tabled out of session in Parliament on 20 January 2009. The Government gives close consideration to the recommendations contained in these reports. Following the conclusion of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the Commonwealth Government and the States and Territories took immediate action in response to the individual recommendations of the Royal cre- Commission. More recently Governments have embedded their broader responses to the Royal Commission into strategic planning and policy documents, such as Aboriginal Justice Agreements. The Commonwealth Government has been monitoring the overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians in the criminal justice system and is working closely with State and Territory Governments to remedy the situation. A key initiative is the National Indigenous Law and Justice Framework (the Framework) which is a national policy direction that articulates a good practice approach to improving Indigenous law and justice outcomes across all States and Territories. In addition, the Commonwealth House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is currently undertaking an inquiry into the high level of involvement of Indigenous juveniles and young adults in the criminal justice system. When available, the Committee's report will inform the Commonwealth Government's continuing work in this area. A public inquiry of the kind suggested in the petition is unlikely to provide any evidence over and above that which was taken into account by Governments when developing the Framework and that which is being taken into account as part of the current Inquiry. Although the States and Territories are largely responsible for criminal justice matters, the Commonwealth Government continues to provide leadership through initiatives such as the Framework and the Indigenous Community Safety Roundtable held on 6 November 2009. The Roundtable was attended by Commonwealth, State and Territory Attorneys-General, Indigenous Affairs Ministers, Police Ministers and Commissioners and Indigenous delegates. Ministers agreed that further proposals would be developed around an effective approach to law enforcement, alcohol related violence and crime, information sharing and integrated service delivery and victim support services. A working group of Commonwealth, State and Territory representatives has developed proposals which will be provided to Attorneys-General, Police Ministers and Indigenous Affairs Ministers for consideration and endorsement in the first half of 2010. The petition asks the Commonwealth Government to lead the State and Territory Governments to enact reforms that create obligations on governments to respond to coronial recommendations. Through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, I have encouraged my State and Territory counterparts to take steps to monitor progress of initiatives to promote responsiveness to coronial recommendations. The National Coroners Information Service is currently exploring options to record responses to coronial recommendations on the NCIS system. The outcomes of that work will be reported back to SCAG. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee when considering this petition. The action officer for this matter in my Department is Franca Musolino who can be contacted on 61413477. from the Attorney-General, MCClelland Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 26 November 2009 concerning the submission of a petition relating the proposal to relocate Grey-headed Flyingfoxes from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. The Australian Government's responsibilities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) protects certain defined matters of national environmental significance. These matters include world and national heritage properties, wetlands of international importance, nationally threatened species and ecological communities, migratory species protected under international agreements, nuclear actions, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Commonwealth marine areas. In relation to environmental considerations, the Australian Government's involvement in any development proposal is confined only to these specific matters. The trees at the Royal Botanic Gardens, although of state heritage value, are not listed and protected under the national heritage provisions of the EPBC Act. The grey-headed flying-fox is a species listed as vulnerable under the EPBC Act, and therefore is a matter of national environmental significance. As you may be aware, the proposal to relocate grey-headed flying-foxes from the Royal Botanic Gardens was referred to my department by the Botanic Gardens Trust on 11 December 2008. On 11 January 2009, the prothe posal was determined to be a controlled action under the EPBC Act. This decision means that the proposal is considered likely to have a significant impact on grey-headed flying-foxes and further assessment and approval under the EPBC Act is required before the proposal can proceed. There have since been a number of delays as the Botanic Gardens Trust requested that the original decision be reconsidered. The proposed relocation was again determined to be a controlled action and will continue to be assessed by my department through a Public Environment Report. The subsequent decision can be found on my department's web site under the EPBC public notices at: Mr http://www.environment.gov.au On 12 November 2009 the Botanic Gardens Trust made available for public comment the draft Public Environment Report for 30 business days which closed on 23 December 2009. to The Botanic Gardens Trust will now finalise the Public Environment Report to take account of any public comments received and provide my department with the finalised report. A decision on whether or not to approve the proposed action will be made within 40 business days of receipt of the finalised Public Environment Report. Further to this process, the Botanic Gardens Trust decided to delay the commencement of the proposed relocation until later this year, subject to relevant approvals, to ensure the disturbance of the grey-headed flying-fox colony is avoided when there are dependant young or heavily pregnant females present. While the historic tree collection in the Royal Botanic Gardens is not listed under the EPBC Act, I can assure you that my department recognises the important scientific, cultural and tage values of the Royal Botanic Gardens. However, my department is required to balance these considerations with its responsibilities for the protection of threatened species listed under the EPBC Act. Thank you for writing on this matter. from the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett Immigration Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 26 November 2009, concerning your request for a response to the petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding migration to Australia. I note that the petition requests a decrease in migration, citing the drought, and the lack of housing, elective public health services, and jobs for school leavers and unskilled workers. I acknowledge the Committee's concerns regarding these issues and can inform you that the Government has begun the task of constructing a long term migration planning framework (LTPF) so that future levels of immigration remain in the best interests of Australia. The LTPF will guide future patterns of immigration in the context of our future labour market and public infrastructure needs and the capacity of our natural and built environments. To ensure that the LTPF is based on the best available evidence, my Department has commissioned independent research on the long term implications of net overseas migration (NOM) levels to Australia. A team of cross-disciplinary experts from Flinders University are examining the relationships between immigration, population and the built and natural environment within the context of various possible future levels of NOM. Likewise, experts from the Australian National University are advising the Department on the impact of immigration on Australia's labour force. The development of the LTPF will make an important contribution to our understanding of the optimum levels of immigration and population out to 2050, taking into account all factors including the budget, the environment, our national heri- infrastructure and our social welfare. It should be noted that NOM includes long term temporary residents, and that these temporary entrants form the largest component of Australia's population growth. In the 1980s, only 10 per cent of NOM was comprised of temporary entrants and today this has risen to almost 70 per cent. The increase is largely due to increased numbers of overseas students and temporary business entrants. Temporary migrants, including international students and temporary business entrants, are performing a vital role in boosting our economy, and are a key reason that Australia has outperformed the developed world during the recent global economic downturn. When considering the impact of migrants on pubimlic hospitals, including elective surgery waiting times, it is important to note that the vast majority of temporary migrants do not have access to Medicare, so do not add pressure on Australia's public health care system. Rather, demand for health care services is growing due to Australia's ageing population, which is creating additional demand for services. The 2010 Intergenerational Report (IGR3) released on 1 February 2010, projects that the proportion of Australia's population aged 65 and over will double over the next 40 years, and will be supported by proportionally fewer working-age Australians. The 2010 Intergenerational Report also shows that over the next 40 years, immigration can help ease the pressures resulting from a progressively ageing population. This is because immigrants tend to be younger on average than the resident population. The report also notes that with an ageing population, productivity is a key driver of future growth prospects, and immigration will assist in maintaining or improving our living standards through migrants' contributions to the federal budget. In addition, many medical occupations are in critical shortage including anaesthehave tists, surgeons and emergency medicine specialists, and immigration will continue to play an important role in meeting Australia's skills needs through the General Skilled Migration program. With respect to the concerns about job opportunities for school leavers and unskilled workers, it is important to note that not all temporary entrants have work rights. International students which make up the largest proportion of temporary entrants have work limitations and are eligible for up to 20 hours paid employment per week. The largest group of temporary migrants with full work rights are highly skilled workers entering under the subclass 457 visa program. These migrants are sponsored by Australian employers who have demonstrated that the skills required are unable to be filled locally. The Government maintains the commitment to prioritise opportunities for Australian workers, and reforms of the skilled migration program aim to ensure that young Australians coming through our schools, TAFE colleges and universities are given the opportunity to fill these vacancies first. Recent reforms announced by the Government aim to re-position the temporary and permanent programs so they best serve the needs of industry and of regional Australia, maintain program integrity, and meet our economic and demographic goals. The most important factor in achieving better employment opportunities for Australians is strong growth in the economy. In pursuit of this in the current global economic environment, the Government has undertaken a range of stimulus and nation building measures. The result is that the Australian economy, while not immune from the global downturn, is performing better than the majority of developed nations' economies. At the same time migration is also maintaining the economy's growth momentum and keeping a firm lid on unemployment. This is due to the Migration Program's focus on attracting skilled migrants and the role that migrant spending has in creating jobs. The Government's first priority, of course, is to provide training and education so that Australians the skills to address our main labour market requirements. To this end, the Government has implemented its Education Revolution which includes a range of commitments such as doubling the investment in Australian schools to $62 billion from 2009-12 and investing $2 billion to deliver 711 000 vocational education and training places. Our immigration programs are closely linked to this process and seek to supplement the domestic labour force only where there remains unmet demand for skilled workers. With regard to the Committee's concern about the housing challenges many Australians face, you may like to note the Senate Committee report into housing affordability, which was delivered on 16 June 2008. The report makes 32 recommendations, none of which are about constraining immigration as a means of increasing housing affordability. To address Australia's housing requirements, the Government is directly engaging with State, Territory and Local governments in the planning of our cities to roll out national infrastructure and to address issues such as housing approval processes and land supply arrangements. At the same time, the Government is providing $15.3 billion of assistance in housing programs. This includes $6.4 billion over three years for the Social Housing Initiative which will boost the supply of public and community housing for people who are homeless, at risk of homelessness or who are on low incomes and paying very high rental costs. I trust the information provided is helpful. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans National School Chaplaincy Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 11 February 2010, concerning two recently submitted petitions about ongoing funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program. I apologise for the delay in responding. As advised in my recent correspondence sent to you in your capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions, I regularly receive positive feedback from schools, parents and students about the value of the National School Chaplaincy Program (NSCP). I also advised that 98 per cent of school principals recently surveyed by the National School Chaplaincy Association about the effectiveness of chaplaincy in government schools, support having a school chaplain. As you are aware, an additional $42.8 million was recently announced to extend the program for all participating schools until December 2011. The extension of the NSCP will ensure that those schools funded under the program will be able to continue to provide valuable support in the proviSince sion of student well-being services. The consultation process with stakeholders, which I highlighted in my previous correspondence, is about to commence. These consultations will consider options for possible future pastoral care initiatives following the end of the program in December 2011. The process will involve a range of stakeholders including state education departments, major service providers, representatives of independent and faith-based school systems, peak representative bodies for parent and community organisations, principals and other relevant interest groups. The Australian Government is determined to ensure schools are supported in providing for the well-being of their students and the NSCP has been effective in achieving this. This program demonstrates the Government's commitment to working with school communities, parents and other stakeholders to support well-being and tive development for all Australian school children. I trust this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard Trade: Live Animal Exports Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your correspondence of 10 February 2009 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning a petition about livestock exports. The Australian Government supports a vibrant and growing livestock sector, and an important part of it is the livestock export industry. The industry's earnings reached $996.5 million in 2009, underpinning employment of around 10 000 people in rural and regional Australia. The government recognises that this sector comes with challenges and responsibilities different from those in some other export industries. Being part of the international live export trade means Australia can help improve the way it operatesbenefiting not just our animals but those from other countries as well. The government and those involved in the live export trade are continuing to work on improvements throughout the supply chain. the beginning of 2008 I have approved projects worth more than $2.4 million under the Live Animal Trade Program to further improve animal welfare in importing countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. The funding has supported upgrades in livestock facilities in the Middle East and Asia to meet international animal welfare guidelines. I recently announced the three-year $3.2 million Live Trade Animal Welfare Partnership, which is to be funded in equal parts by the government and Australia's livestock export industry. This new program is an unprecedented example of government and industry working together to support Australian agriculture and trade. The government has consulted scientists and animal welfare organisations like the RSPCA in introducing the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock. These are regularly updated and are available at posi- www.daff.gov.au/livestockexportstandards. The government acknowledges that some people would prefer Australia to export meat rather than live animals. However, a 2008 report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics concluded that restrictions on the export of live animals would not increase sales of chilled beef, veal or sheep meat. Instead, the countries involved would be likely to source live animals from elsewhere. The report is at www.abare.gov.au/ publications_html/livestock/livestock_08/LiveExports.pdf. Further information on the live animal trade that may be helpful is available on the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry website at www.daff.gov.au/livetrade. Thank you for writing to me about this petition. I trust you will find this information from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke Human Rights: Falun Gong Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 10 February 2010 about a petition recently submitted for the considsources. eration of the Standing Committee on Petitions on the arrest of Falun Gong practitioner, Ms Sufang Zhang. I make the following response to the Committee under Standing Order 209(b) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Embassy in Beijing made a number of representations to Chinese authorities to check on Ms Zhang's health, welfare and securing release. I am pleased to be able to inform the Committee that Ms Kun (Suzy) Yang, Ms Zhang's daughter, advised the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 7 July 2009, that Ms Zhang had been released on 4 July 2009. The Australian Government has long held concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China. While the Government takes no position on Falun Gong beliefs, it considers that China's ban on Falun Gong and the treatment of its practitioners are in breach of international human rights standards. The Government has raised the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China with senior Chinese officials in Canberra, Beijing and in the context of the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, the last round of which was held in Canberra on 9-10 February 2009. The Government is aware of Falun Gong-related claims of organ harvesting. If true, these reports would be very disturbing. China has denied the allegations and the information we have seen so far is inconclusive. The Government will continue to raise its concerns on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China with Chinese authorities, including at the next round of the Human Rights Dialogue, which we expect to be held in China in 2010. from Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith Renewable Energy of assistance. Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 10 February 2010 to the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, the Hon Peter Garrett AM MP, concerning a petition on clean energy and an interconnected electricity grid fed by renewable Your correspondence was referred to me as the Minister with portfolio responsibility for this issue. The Government recognises that renewable energy generation can play an important role in meeting Australia's energy needs. The Government has committed to a number of initiatives that are expected to significantly increase investment in renewable energy. In the May 2009 Budget, the Government announced a major new initiative, the $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative (CEI). The CEI underpins the Government's strong support of clean energy technology research and development in this country. The CEI includes the $1.5 billion Solar Flagships Program to support the construction of up to four large scale grid-connected solar power stations operating within the energy market. This will help position Australia as a world leader in solar technology. The CEI will complement the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) and the Government's 20 per cent by 2020 Renewable Energy Target (RET) which will provide the renewable energy sector with a cross subsidy worth more than $20 billion. The CPRS and the RET will provide a very strong incentive for investment in renewable energy generation. With regards to an internationally interconnected electricity grid, I note that the construction of transmission lines in Australia is a commercial decision for industry and the Australian Government does not wish to intervene in market-based decisions. I also note that there are potentially large electrical losses involved in conducting electricity over long distances and this is a significant consideration in transmission planning. For instance, due to transmission losses and there being no economic rationale for a more extensive grid, there are currently many parts of Australia that are off-grid or on isolated or local grids. Australia has one undersea transmission line in the National Electricity Market, Basslink. Operational since April 2006, the Basslink interconnector is more than 350 kilometres (km) long, with 290 km being subsea between Tasmania and Victoria. Despite its relatively short distance, Basslink cost $796 million to develop. The privately owned and operated Basslink was developed as a result of commercially sound decision making and a rigorous planning process. The transmission investment proposed in the petition is unlikely to provide economic or environmental benefit to either Australia or Australia's international neighbours at this stage. To ensure commercial viability and success, such a proposal should be industry led rather than mandated by Government. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith Religious Persecution Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 10 February 2010 about a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding apostasy laws. The Australian Government shares the view that Muslims, or indeed persons of any religion, should be able to choose freely to leave their and follow a new belief, without penalty. As the petition notes, the right to freedom of religion, including the right to change religion, is set out in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. In support of this right, Australia has consistently co-sponsored a resolution on the `Elimination of all forms of religious intolerance' in the United Nations General Assembly's Third Committee. This resolution urges states to “ensure that their constitutional and legislative systems provide adequate and effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief to all out distinction, inter alia, by the provision of fective remedies in cases where the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, or the right to practise freely one's religion, including the right to change one's religion or belief, is violated”. The Australian Government makes regular human rights representations to a number of countries, including those that place restrictions on freedom of religion. We will continue to be alert to opportunities to raise the issue of religious freedom, including the issue of apostasy, in our representations. Thank you for bringing your views to my attention. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith Whaling Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 10 February 2010 about a petition recently considered by the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding Japanese whaling. The Australian Government is resolutely opposed to commercial whaling, including so-called ‘scientific' whaling, and strongly supports the global moratorium on commercial whaling. Over the last two years, the Government has focused on substantial diplomatic efforts and has brought forward proposals to reform the International Whaling Commission (IWC) into a modern, conservation focused organisation. Ahead of the next Annual Meeting of the IWC in June this faith year, the Government has developed a strong Australian proposal for the future of the IWC. This proposal was released by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, the Hon Peter Garrett AM MP, on 25 February 2010. Australia's proposal seeks robust conservation measures and the complete phasing out of whaling in the Southern Ocean. Australia will continue to take a constructive approach to IWC discussions in the period ahead, but if we are unable to make progress diplomatically, we reserve the right to take legal action. It is important to consider our differences with withJapan on whaling in the context of the broader efAustralia-Japan relationship which is strong and close and which delivers enormous benefits to Australia. Australia and Japan enjoy a comprehensive economic, security and strategic partnership. I note the request of the petition that economic sanctions be placed on Japan until such time as they permanently desist from any form of whaling in Antarctica. The Government considers that such a response would be disproportionate and harm Australia's economic interests. I trust this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith Climate Change Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 10 February 2010 concerning a petition in regard to climate change financing for developing countries. Climate change is one of the greatest social, ecogoal nomic and environmental challenges of our time. Australia is committed to playing a full, fair and constructive part in building global solutions to climate change and, as a developed country, is committed to taking the lead on reducing emissions. Australia will cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent on 2000 levels by 2020 if there is a global agreement sufficient to stabilise greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 450 parts per million (ppm) or lower. Should global agreement fall short of the action required to achieve 450ppm, Australia will cut its emissions by between 5 and 15 per cent on 2000 levels by 2020. Australia is taking strong action on climate change domestically, including by introducing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to help meet our emission reduction goals. Transforming Australia's economy into a low-carbon economy will demonstrate that deep cuts in emissions are compatible with continued strong economic growth and improved living standards, helping to build confidence among other countries to reduce their emissions. Australia is making a significant contribution to mitigation and adaptation solutions globally, through our active participation in international negotiations and through a suite of bilateral, regional and multilateral partnerships. My response to the questions raised in the petition are set out at Attachment A. Thank you for bringing the concerns of the petitioners to my attention. Response to Petition on Climate Change 1. Go to Copenhagen with a firm commitment to reduce carbon emissions by at least 40% by 2020, as current science indicates. This supports Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) call to limit global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Australia seeks comprehensive global action capable of stabilising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at 450 parts per million (ppm) carbon dioxide-equivalent or lower. This concentration would reduce the risks associated with severe climate change and is consistent with the of limiting global temperature increase to no more than two degrees. If the world agrees to an ambitious global deal capable of delivering stabilisation at 450 ppm or lower, Australia will reduce its emissions by 25 per cent on 2000 levels by 2020. On a range of indicators, Australia's 25 per cent target is comparable or more ambitious than any announced national targets for 2020. Should global agreement fall short of the action required to achieve 450ppm, Australia will cut its emissions by between 5 and 15 per cent on 2000 levels by 2020. The 5 per cent target represents Australia's minimum unconditional commitment, irrespective of the actions of other nations. Should countries reach a global deal that includes commitments by all major economies to substantially restrain emissions, and by all advanced economies to take on comparable emission reductions, Australia will reduce emissions by up to 15 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. On 27 January 2010, Australia inscribed its full target range in the Copenhagen Accord, reinforcing the message that we will play our full and fair part in global efforts. We will continue to work with other countries to maximise the ambition of global action. Australia's submission is available at: http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/applicationipdf/au straliacphaccord app1.pdf. The Copenhagen Accord is the first time that both developed and developing countries have agreed to keep global temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius, and to take responsibility for action to realise this target. 2. We ask that the Australian government formally recognise that without measurable, reportable and verifiable financing from developed countries, developing nations will not accept commitment to slow their emissions growth, and without effort from developing nations, Annexe 1 nations will not commit to ambitious emission reduction targets. Climate change is a global issue. The Australian Government believes it is in Australia's interest assist developing countries to take urgent adaptation actions and to build their capacity to reduce emissions. The Copenhagen Accord, noted at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009, represents an important step forward on the provision of climate change finance to assist developing countries. To build the immediate capacity of developing countries to take action, developed countries agreed to provide new and additional resources approaching US$30 billion for the period 2010-2012 - the ‘fast-start period'. For the first time, developed countries further committed to a longer-term financing goal of mobilising US$100 billion annually by 2020 from both public and private sources. As a first step, the Government welcomes the establishment of the United Nations Secretary-General's High-Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing (announced by the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 12 February) to study the contribution of potential sources of revenue toward realising the longer term goal. The Government also considers the transparent reporting of funding contributions is vital to the credibility of financing commitments under the Accord. Under the Accord Parties have agreed to ensure the accounting of finance is robust and transparent. 3. Therefore Australia must honour the commitment made in Bali to contribute to financing mitigation and adaptation in developing nations, especially our Pacific and South East Asian neighbours. This commitment should be in the order of 0.5% GDP which is approximately $4 billion per annum. Australia will play its fair part in climate change financing. In Copenhagen, the Government committed US$120 million to fast-start financing for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), as part of a US$3.5 billion package of assistance for the period 2010 to 2013. Other donors include the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, France and Japan. This conto tributed to the overall progress made on establishing a mechanism for REDD at CQP 15. Australia has advocated a strong outcome on REDD, and is taking early action in partnership with developing countries through our International Forest Carbon Initiative. Australia's contribution is part of the International Forest Carbon Initiative, making that initiative a $273 million, six year program. The Government's $150 million International Climate Change Adaptation Initiative (ICCAI) supports vulnerable developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet their high priority climate adaptation needs. The initiative will be delivered over three years (2009-2011) and prioritises support to our neighbouring Pacific Island Countries and East Timor. It aims to: improve scientific information on, and understanding of, climate change impacts within partner countries; assist partner countries enhance strategic planning and vulnerability assessment capacity; and support implementation of priority national and community adaptation measures. In addition, Australia's Fifth National Communication to the UNFCCC (available at http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/as nc5.pdf), reported that the Government's total climate change financing support for developing countries reached $285 million in 2008-09. Some developing countries have proposed that developed countries contribute between 0.5 to 1 per cent of their Gross National Product toward an international climate change fund. Australia does not support this proposal. Targeted public financing will continue to be essential to reach areas where private financing and carbon markets cannot reach. However carbon markets will be crucial for the long term, to deliver predictable funds at scale for real emissions reductions and to unlock private investment in low-emissions activities. from the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, Senator Wong Climate Change Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 10 February 2010 concerning a petition of the Environmentally Concerned Citizens of Orange submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding climate change. Australia is helping to shape a global climate change solution by working actively and constructively to forge a global climate outcome that is effective, fair and efficient. Last December, in Copenhagen, the world came together under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to agree a path forward on climate change. The Copenhagen Accord is an important step along that path. Australia formally registered its support for the Accord at Copenhagen and is encouraging its fast and full implementation. The Accord is the first time there has been agreement under the UNFCCC to hold any global temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius. It is also the first time that developed and developing countries have committed to specify what they will do, side by side, to realise this objective. Australia will play its full and fair part in implementing the Accord, and is actively encouraging others - in particular all major economies - to do the same. Countries were invited to submit information on their emission targets and actions to reduce emissions pursuant to the Accord by 31 January 2010. On 27 January 2010, Australia submitted our emission reduction target range to the Copenhagen Accord: 5 per cent on 2000 levels by 2020 unconditional, with up to 15 per cent and 25 per cent both conditional on the extent of action by others. If the world agrees to an ambitions global deal capable of delivering stabilisation of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at 450 parts per million or lower, Australia will reduce its emissions by 25 per cent on 2000 levels by 2020. On a range of indicators, this target is comparable to or more ambitious than any announced national targets for 2020. This concentration would reduce the risks associated with severe climate change and is consistent with the goal of limiting global temperature increase to no more than 2 degrees Celsius. Australia plays an active and constructive role in the UNFCCC negotiations. Throughout 2009, Australia continued to drive international debate on the post-2012 legal architecture and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD), including through our innovative “national schedules” proposal and comprehensive proposals on a forest carbon market mechanism. In Copenhagen, Australia joined with France, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States to announce USD 3.5 billion of fast-start financing for REDD, including a USD 120 million contribution from Australia. Australia also coordinates and represents a core group of developed countries in our role as chair of the “Umbrella Group”. Tackling climate change requires sustained ambition over the long-term. Australia supports continued negotiations under the UNFCCC to deliver further international climate change actions and will continue to work towards a legally-binding outcome. Australia will work diligently with other countries towards a strong outcome in Mexico at the end of 2010. Thank you for bringing this petition regarding climate change to my attention from the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, Senator Wong China: Child Adoption Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 11 February 2010, concerning a petition submitted on 8 February 2010 to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding a request to allow a Chinese orphan to migrate to Australia on compassionate grounds. The petitioners, Mr Raymond and Mrs Suzanne Dousset, wish to allow an 18 year old orphan to remain permanently in Australia and have previously attempted to adopt her. Under Chinese law, a non-relative cannot adopt a child once that child turns 14 years of age and the Doussets have already been advised of this restriction by the Chinese authorities. My Department is not directly involved in adoption arrangements; it provides advice on how adopted children can be granted a visa to enter Australia once they meet all the requirements for a visa. When Australians are seeking to adopt a child from overseas, the adoption must first meet the legal requirements of the child's country of residence. Consequently, as the Chinese authorities will not permit the adoption of the orphan by the Doussets, she cannot be regarded as a member of their family and so she does not qualify for family visa category. Unfortunately, there is no provision in migration legislation to consider waiving these restrictions, no matter how compassionate the circumstances. Immigration requirements are set out in the Migration Regulations 1994 (the Regulations) and are determined by Australia's status as a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Convention). Under the Convention, there are certain requirements that must be met to ensure Australia is upholding its obligations regarding intercountry adoptions. Along with other responsibilities, signatory countries must ensure that each other's laws are respected and complied with in relation to adoptions. In the absence of a visa option, as vised to the Doussets, in accordance with the Migration Act 1958, I can only personally intervene in limited circumstances. This is where a person has had a visa application refused, or a visa cancelled, and this decision has been considered by a review tribunal such as the Migration Review Tribunal. As the orphan has not been the subject of a review decision, I have no legal power to consider the case at this time and neither the Prime Minister nor any other government officials have the legal power to intervene in migration cases. I note that the tourist visa issued to the orphan, which enabled her to travel to Australia and which ceased on 11 February 2010, was subject to condition 8503, a ‘no further stay condition'. While provision exists, under clause 2.05(4) of the Regulations, to waive the 8503 condition, the circumstances for this are limited to where, since the visa was granted, compelling and compassionate circumstances have developed over which the person had no control and that resulted in a major change to the person's circumstances. As the Doussets have stated, the appeal they made to my Department to waive this condition was unsuccessful and any subsequent request must refer to circumstances that are substantially different from those previously considered. Unless waived, the 8503 condition precludes the any orphan from applying for most types of substantive visas. However, she has made an application for a visa for which she is permitted to apply and she is currently lawfully in Australia while the Department is considering this application. For further information, the Committee may wish to contact Mr Colin Rowell, Acting Director of the Department's Family and RRV Section on (02) 6264 1265. I trust the information provided is helpful and I thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans Camden Airport Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 11 February 2010 concerning a petition regarding the draft Master previously ad- Plan for Camden Airport. My Department provides comments on draft Master Plans for Commonwealth airports to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. However, I do not have a statutory responsibility for the development of Master Plans under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Master Plans for Commonwealth airports are administered under the Airports Act 1996 by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP. AI note that o have also written to Minister Albanese on this matter. from the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett Camden Airport Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 11 February 2010 about a petition recently submitted for the considsubmitted eration of the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding Camden Airport. This petition deals with issues that have been included in the Camden Airport Limited (CAL) preliminary draft Master Plan (pdMP), which was released for public comment on 16 September 2009. The pdMP sets out a plan for the development of the airport over the next 20 years. Linder the Airports Act 1996 (the Act) an airport Master Plan is required to include the airport's plans to minimise the impacts of airport activity on the surrounding community. The Government strongly supports greater detail and transparency in airport development and the Airport Master Plan process. As detailed in the Aviation White Paper released on 16 December 2009, future Airport Master Plans will be required to provide better transparency about future land use at airports, including for non-aeronautical purposes. The Government has already introduced regulations to ensure that certain categories of development on airports which are likely to be incompatible with airport operations, such as schools and residential developments, are subject to thorough community consultation and assessment. Master Plans are strategic documents which require the approval of the Minister. The preliminary draft Master Plan is circulated publicly for 60 days to allow interested parties to comment. This consultation period allows the airport the chance to incorporate comments and feedback from the local community and other interested parties before the draft documents are submitted for consideration. Under the Act, CAL is required to provide me with a copy of all public submissions and to demonstrate that it has given due regard to those comments in preparing the draft Master Plan. The Principal Petitioner, Ms Phoebe Atkinson, in her letter to me accompanying the petition, indicated that a copy had been sent to the Camden Airport Master Plan team. Therefore the petition will become part of the public submissions for which the airport must demonstrate that due regard has been given. The draft Master Plan for Camden Airport was for my consideration on 5 March 2010. In making my decision I will take into account the comments of interested parties that have been provided either to the Camden Airport via the Master Plan consultation process, or to me directly. Environmental and heritage issues will be considered, and I will be consulting with the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts as a matter of course. Thank you for raising this matter. from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese Human Rights: Falun Gong Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 11 February 2010 about a petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions on persecution of Falun Gong in China. In accordance with Standing Order 209(b), I make the following response to the Committee. The Australian Government has long held concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China. While the Government takes no position on Falun Gong beliefs, it considers that China's ban on Falun Gong and the treatment of its practitioners are in breach of international human rights standards. The Government has raised consistently these concerns with Chinese authorities. Senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have also raised Australia's concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners through diplomatic channels in Canberra and Beijing, and during the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, the most recent of which took place in Canberra on 9-10 February 2009. We expect the next round to take place in China in 2010. The Government is aware of Falun Gong-related claims of organ harvesting. If true, these reports would be very disturbing. China has denied the allegations and the information we have seen so far is inconclusive. The Government will continue to raise its concerns on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China with Chinese authorities. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith National Archives of Australia Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 11 February 2010 regarding a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions on the proposed closure of the National Archives of Australia offices in Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart. On 23 February 2010, the Australian Government responded to community concerns about the proposed closures and announced that the National Archives will maintain a local presence in each state and territory. Instead of closing the National Archives' smaller regional offices, the Government is pursuing a plan to join forces and colocate with local institutions. The stand-alone National Archives offices in Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart will remain open until a permanent solution involving co-location with a local organisation, or an alternative arrangement that meets the needs of local users, has been found. This solution aims to put the National Archives of Australia on a sustainable footing for the long term and enable it to continue to provide high quality services in each state and territory for Australians. You may be aware that I tabled a ministerial statement, Ensuring Access to Australia's National Archives, on 23 February 2010. The statement (attached) provides further information on the Government's position. Statement by the Special Minister of State and Cabinet Secretary, Senator the Hon Joe Ludwig Ensuring access to Australia's National Archives 23 February 2010 The Rudd Labor Government is committed to assisting individuals in their search for information about themselves, their families and their country. The vast holdings of the National Archives of Australia provide a rich resource for academics, researchers and other interested groups, whether they are searching for information on the dramatic events that shaped our nation's history, or the decisions that touched individual lives. Each family's history forms part of the fabric of our national story. That's why the National Archives is today hosting Shake Your Family Tree Day to encourage more Australians to see what information they can unearth about their own family. Today I can announce that the Government has responded to community concerns about the closure of the National Archives of Australia's Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart offices, and will guarantee that a physical National Archives presence will be maintained in every state and territory. The stand-alone National Archives offices in Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart will remain open in each instance until a permanent solution involving co-location with a local organisation has been found. This solution aims to remove the operational inefficiencies inherent in running stand-alone offices of the National Archives in each jurisdiction. It will also reflect the changing reality, which is that people overwhelmingly access records online today, while ensuring a National Archives presence in every jurisdiction and maintaining local access to the services provided by the National Archives. The November 2009 decision to close these Naall tional Archives offices was a fiscally responsible decision. The offices in Hobart, Adelaide and Darwin are the National Archives' smallest offices, with the lowest visitor numbers. Each of these offices costs over $800,000 per year to operate, with the Darwin office costing around $1 million. Yet visitor numbers to these offices are low: in 2008– 09 they totalled just 337 in Darwin, 720 in Adelaide and 635 in Hobart, compared with 22,290 nationally. This equates to an average cost to the Australian taxpayer of over one to three thousand dollars per visit a cost which is simply unsustainable in today's fiscal environment. I understand the importance of maintaining a National Archives presence at a state and territory level-after all, that's where Australia's history emerged. The Rudd Government has listened to the concerns of the local community, academics, researchers and other interested groups over the proposed closure of National Archives offices. I would like to acknowledge the work done by my colleagues including the Member for Solomon, Damian Hale, the Minister for Indigenous Health, Warren Snowden, Senator Trish Crossin, the Member for Lyons, Dick Adams, the Member for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas, the Member for Franklin, Julie Collins, the Member for Port Adelaide, Mark Butler, and the Minister for Sport and Youth, Kate Ellis, in representing constituents' concerns over the closures. I also acknowledge the work of all of the individuals and members of historians' and archivists' societies who have highlighted the significance of the local offices the National Archives, and I thank them for their contribution. I also recognise the petition on the office closures tabled in the House of Representatives earlier this month by Julia Irwin, the Member for Fowler. National Archives repositories around the country hold many records containing important information about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their history. I would like to particularly emphasise the fact that the Government will not change existing access arrangements for records relating to the separation policies imposed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; these access arrangements were strengthened in response to the landmark 1997 Bringing Them Home report on the separation of Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander children from their families. The reality is that fewer people are visiting the National Archives in person to access their records. Instead, the country has moved to an online environment: in 2008-09 more than 1.9 million records were accessed online compared to 57,000 records accessed in reading rooms nationally. Demand for online access to records is expected to continue to increase apace, and the National Archives is developing plans to provide digital access to ever more of its records, including those currently held by the National Archives in Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart. In today's society, we need to explore other ways of ensuring access to archives other than a fully functioning National Archives office at a cost to the taxpayer of up to $3,000 per visit. In what is a very successful partnership, the National Archives already co-locates with the state institution in Victoria. The National Archives will be required to work with local cultural heritage institutions and other organisations in pursuit of further colocated reading rooms and record storage facilities. In this way, the Government can ensure that the National Archives maintains face-to-face services in all jurisdictions, while shaping its operations in a way which will meet the needs of future generations. The Rudd Government is committed to ensuring continued public access to records documenting Australia's history. This is part of our broader aim of of restoring trust and integrity in the use of government information through improved transparency and accountability. The Rudd Government is committed to promoting a pro-disclosure culture across government, and ensuring that Australians can realise their right to access government information. from the Special Minister of State, Senator Ludwig Administration of Justice Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 18 March 2009 seeking a written response to a petition submitted to your Committee regarding a Section 72(ii) process under the Constitution. Section 72(ii) of the Constitution provides that the Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament shall not be removed except by the Governor General in Council, on an address from both Houses of Parliament in the same session, asking for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. The proceedings are exceptionally serious. No Commonwealth judicial officer has ever been dismissed under this provision. The basis on which this petition has been put forward is not clear. Taking into account the seriousness of the allegations made, considerably more information would need to be provided before the applicability of the provision could be considered. I trust this information is of assistance to the Committee. from the Attorney-General, MCClelland Administration of Justice Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 18 March 2009 seeking a written response to petitions submitted to your Committee regarding complaints of judicial conduct and difficulties faced by self-represented litigants. In relation to the petition concerning judicial conduct, I note that a working group established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is considering a range of options for implementing a national mechanism for handling complaints against judicial officers, including the adoption of a consistent set of rules, procedures and standards and an appropriate complaints handling body. The working group's recommendations will assist with the Government's consideration of these issues. In relation to the petitioner's allegation that is a lack of accountability for judicial officers, I note that important mechanisms for ensuring judicial accountability include the appeals process, open courts, procedural fairness, the provision by courts of reasons for decisions, the existence of publicly available complaints mechanisms within the courts and public and media scrutiny. In relation to the petition concerning selfrepresented litigants and MCKenzie friends, I note that courts have an inherent power to permit MCKenzie friends to appear. A MCKenzie friend is a person who assists a litigant during proceedings but is not legally qualified. Leave to permit appearance by MCKenzie friends is at the discretion of the individual Judge or Federal Magistrate, and will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. The reason for this is that courts should be assisted either by parties who are familiar with their own case or qualified legal practitioners who can make informed submissions to assist the court. In addition, legal practitioners have ethical duties both to their clients and to the court, while unqualified persons do not have these duties. Parties who may have difficulty affording legal representation may seek assistance from a Legal Aid Commission office in their State or Territory, which will, I understand, grant a first interview Mr regardless of means. Parties may also seek assistance from local Community Legal Services. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland Statements",135
156,Mrs IRWIN,AMENDMENT TO THE PETITION TO THE,"Fowler) (8.34 pm)Tonight, I am pleased to take the opportunity to report to the House about recent activities of the Standing Committee on Petitions as it followed up matters relating to petitions. The standing orders of the House enable our committee to receive and process petitions in readiness for presentation to the House. We can also consider matters relating to petitions and to the petitions system as a whole. Since its establishment in 2008, the committee has been following up petitions in a variety of there ways, not seeking to resolve issues itself but to air them. The first and usual response, once a petition is presented in the House, is for the committee to refer petitions to the minister in the relevant portfolio area for comment. Occasionally, the response is a success story in which the minister agrees to take the action that is sought. Much more often, though, its purpose is to explain a situation or matter that has been raised or complained about in the petition. Responses from ministers are published on the committee's webpage once the committee has had an opportunity to consider them. So the issues and the explanations by government are available not only to the committee and petitioners but to anyone who is interested in them. Several times each year the committee invites representatives of different Commonwealth Public Service departments to come to Parliament House to discuss matters raised in petitions that have been presented in the House and then referred by the committee to a minister for response. These hearings with public servants are useful ways for the committee to monitor what the government is doing in respect of issues raised by citizens in their petitions. The committee appreciates the way that ministers and their departmental staff have responded to the committee's requests for further information about the matters that concerned citizens have raised. As I have often said, the committee's power to seek a ministerial response, and the general cooperation of ministers in replying in a timely way, is one of the great successes of the new arrangements for petitions. Together with the responses, transcripts of hearkilled ings with public servants are published on the committee's webpage, making that interaction available to the public too. This brings me to recent hearings or round-table meetings the committee held with petitioners in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. The committee has taken the opportunity recently to follow up some of the matters raised by petitioners and to talk to them about their concerns and their views on ministers' responses. As a committee we see great variety in the subject matter of petitions. Unlike other parliamentary committees that usually look at one or two issues at a time, at any one time we are aware of a range of matters that Australians feel they must bring forward for debate and also for action. The matters occasionally are very particular but more often they are regional and sometimes they are national. At our recent hearings interstate we spoke to petitioners about many different concerns. Depending on the location and makeup of our electorates some issues were familiar to us. Some were new, and I acknowledge the value that is gained when petitioners have the energy and good faith to raise concerns that are new or are not understood widely because the people who experience them may not have been in a position to advocate for themselves. The committee held a round-table meeting in Sydney in April. It was an interesting day and the transcript is on the committee's webpage. There are two witnesses and issues I wish to mention tonight. The first of these is Sister Susan Connelly, who organised a petition that seeks to have the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste awarded an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia. The petition states such an award would be an official form of recognition and gratitude for the role of thousands of East Timorese civilians who assisted Australian soldiers in World War II with courage and compassion and who were as a result of that assistance once the Australian soldiers had withdrawn. I will not go into the issues of why this is such an unusual request, but I will put on record that Sister Susan Connelly is a powerful advocate for the Australian veterans, whose numbers are dwindling now, and for the East Timorese people. She was eloquent in discussing the gratitude and affection of the Australian soldiers for the East Timorese people who protected them and their wish to have this gift acknowledged in a very public way. Sister Connelly said: I know of no other country in the world that has lost 40,000 civilians as a direct result of protecting Australian soldiers. … It is unique, and because it is unique I believe Australia needs to give a unique response. In coming weeks I will outline some of the other issues that we delved into at these hearings. In the meantime I would like to mention again the committee's appreciation to those petitioners who came to speak to us. Some of them travelled for many hours or at quite some inconvenience. It was very clear to us that whatever the subject we were discussing-whether local, national or international, current or historic, popular or particular-the process itself was important. As the House's representatives we were following up on matters that members of the public felt sufficiently concerned about to bring directly to the attention of the House, and it was our pleasure to do so. NA Economics Committee Report",156
157,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Inquiry into raising the protralia ductivity growth rate in the Australian econlenges omy, together with the minutes of proceedings. Order that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",158
158,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"Over the past decade Australia's productivity growth has slowed considerably Average annual labour productivity growth fell from 2.1 per cent in the world. the 1990s to around 1.4 per cent in the 2000s. And even though Australia's average annual productivity growth has performed relatively well in OECD comparisons since 1985 approximating the OECD averageand ranking 12th, one below the US-the productivity growth rate has, however, been in decline since the 2003-04 productivity cycle with growth rates averaging negative 0.2 per cent per year. Put simply this is not good enough for an ageing population like ours in Australia. An increased productivity growth rate would mean a larger economy, higher living standards and a reduction of the fiscal sure created from ageing. If we were to boost productivity growth from an average of 1.6 per cent to two per cent per year and sustain this over 40 years real GDP per person would be around 15 per cent higher. That is equivalent to raising living standards by $16,000 a year in today's dollars by 2050 for every man, woman and child in Australia. This is an exciting prospect, especially when put in the perspective of how healthy producging tivity growth helped us previously. Productivity growth was responsible for 80 per cent of the increase in our incomes over the last 40 years. In tabling the report today of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, I look at some of the reasons why boosting productivity is the key to economic recovery and growth. As the Intergenerational report told us earlier this year, Ausfaces a complex mix of long-term chalof an ageing and growing population, escalating pressures on the health system and an environment vulnerable to climate change. These challenges will place substantial pressures on Australia's economy, living standards and government finances over the next 40 years. These are challenges affecting not just us but developed countries around Productivity enhancing reforms particularly through nation-building infrastructure and improving the skills base will grow the economy, improve living standards and partly offset the fiscal pressures of ageing. By growing the economy, we increase our capacity to meet the fiscal costs of ageing without increasing the overall tax burden on working Australians. The best way to grow the economy is to maintain our focus on productivity and on investing in skills and infrastructure such as nation building, the education revolution and regulatory and tax reform to underpin productivity growth in the decpresades to come. Building productivity, of course, is not just a challenge for government. Ultimately, it is Australian workers and businesses that will deliver the higher productivity by skilling themselves up, tooling up and working smarter. This report provides a high-level overview of the recent status of productivity growth in Australia and probable mechanisms that could be used to improve the current flaggrowth rate. During the course of the inquiry the committee received evidence on a range of issues including measurement of productivity, productivity growth trends in Australia, challenges associated with raising the rate of productivity growth and how governments can promote productivity growth in the economy. The committee has recommended: the government introduce a national aggregate productivity growth target for the medium term to 2030; a national productivity forum including governments, business, unions and non-government organisations be convened; the Council of Australian Governments adopt a specific national productivity agenda; the Productivity Commission undertake modelling on the effect of human capital investment on Australian productivity growth; the Australian Bureau of Statistics investigate alternate ways of measuring multifactor productivity in the services sector; cost-benefit analysis be mandatory for all policies aimed at increasing aggregate productivity growth and any national productivity agenda should include public sector service provision. In conclusion, it is fair to say that lia is without doubt off the pace when it comes to growth and productivity. We have been that way for some time now. Allowing such a slowdown in productivity growth, and even negative productivity growth, for much longer will cause our nation's standard of living to decline. We need to increase productivity growth to the levels that will bring Australia back to sustained economic growth. We need all levels of government and the community to work to achieve this. On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all of the organisations and individuals that participated in this inquiry, particularly those who made written submissions or gave evidence to the public hearing. I would also like to thank the secretary and the staff. Without their help this report would not have been able to be made. (Time expired)",158
159,Mr BRIGGS,COMMITTEES,"I rise in part to support the member for Dobell, the chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, who did a good job in managing this inquiry, as did Stephen Boyd and his assistants in the committee secretariat-Sharon Bryant, Chris Kane and Renee Burton-who helped enormously with what some might describe as a rather dry subject but a very important one nonetheless. It was a good inquiry and we had high-quality submissions. We took evidence from interesting and intelligent sources and quite a good report has been prepared by the committee. The report is entitled Inquiry into raising the productivity growth rate in the Australian economy. Those on the coalition side of this committee largely agreed with the report's recommendations. There were a couple of areas of dispute, but we were able to manage those reasonably amicably towards the end. We were concerned that the government was trying to create more talkfests. We wanted to Austrasee some more push for action out of the report, which contains some high-quality recommendations. We were concerned particularly with recommendation 3-that the government, as it has been known to do in its term, not create another talkfest and review in lieu of taking real action. But, in the end, for the purposes of getting the report done and tabled, we succumbed to the pressure of the chair. When the report was released some weeks ago, we made a point of highlighting recommendation 6, which talks about an evidence based approach to policy, which we absolutely agree with. We are surprised that the government have not taken their own advice. There was no productivity report associated with the Building the Education Revolution-the memorial school halls program, as some people call it-the laptops in schools program, which has unfortunately had a billion dollar blow-out, or indeed the cash splash. There has been no productivity benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network and they are planning to spend $43 billion there. We are disappointed that recommendation 6 has not been taken up by the government. Hopefully it will be taken up in the future. I am sure a future Abbott-led lition government will be keen to ensure that we have an evidence based policy regime rather than the cash splash, big spending ap- it. proach of this government. The shadow Treasurer made a very good and detailed speech about the economic challenges facing Australia and identified productivity as the No. 1 issue from the coalition's perceptive. He highlighted several areas where we need to particularly focus, and I think they are worthwhile noting in conjunction with this report. He made the point that we should ensure that community infrastructure, both privately and publicly owned, is adequate and efficient-roads, rail, ports, utilities, telecommunications, the legal system and so on. Government investment in infrastructure should be subject to cost benefit analysis-the same point as the report makes. The second way governments can improve productivity is to lower the cost of capital and maximise the availability tal for private business. Governments should not be competing with the private sector for scarce capital, especially once businesses have returned to the market. This is the issue of crowding out-government borrowing too much money. The third step is to minimise drag from the government-government regulations and taxation. We know about government regulations in this area. Competitive markets is the fourth area. The fifth area is concerned with skilling the workforce. The sixth area concerns encouraging innovation, which of course is very important and is dealt with in the report. I think the report adds very much to the economic debate in this country. It contains a great deal of very important and relevant information from a range of sources that appeared before the committee to give evidence. Submissions to the committee contain good suggestions and are well worthwhile. I coacommend the report to the House and recommend members read it from cover to cover.

165,Ms REA,COMMITTEES,"I am very proud to be before the House this evening to present this report. As I have only a short time to speak, I begin by thanking all those who were involved in the preparation of this report and in the inquiry which was undertaken. In particular I knowledge the deputy chair, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, who is in the House this evening, and all those on the committee who participated in the inquiries. I acknowledge the full committee who have also endorsed this report, in particular the chair, Senator Michael Forshaw, who participated in the inquiry on many occasions and was a good contributor. I particularly acknowledge Ms Samantha Mannette, the inquiry secretary, Paul Zinkel, who was the research officer and is now the new committee secretary, Mrs Donna Quintus-Bosz and the administrative officers Mrs Sonya Gaspar and Ms Gillian Drew. I wish to particularly acknowledge the secretariat because, being a subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, they do not have the full support of the committee secretariat. Obviously they have fewer staff and Samantha and her team did a tremendous job in putting together the inquiries, ensuring that submissions were included and, indeed, in putting this report together. I acknowledge the very hard work on their behalf. This inquiry and report provides a very detailed analysis of the challenges we face in our region when it comes to greater promotion and protection of individual human rights. Indeed, the Asia-Pacific is the only region on the globe which does not have some form of regional human rights mechanism or body. The report identifies quite clearly a very detailed analysis of why that the case and outlines in a very informative way the challenges we are faced with in this region. For a start you can appreciate that Asia-Pacific itself is a very diverse area and the committee really focused on two separate subregions-the Asian subregion and the Pacific Islander nations-which have different challenges and face different issues when it comes to human rights mechanisms and improving the protection of the human rights of their citizens. We received evidence from many organisations and individuals, quite a diverse range who presented some very interesting information. As a result, I think the recommendations reflect the complex nature of our region and the many challenges and opportunities which exist. The recommendations provide some very practical and achievable steps which can be undertaken by this government to support the improving of human rights protection in our area, whether acknowledging the role of individual bilateral dialogues that Australia holds with Asian countries, promoting them as a very effective tool of discussion and debate within our region, suggesting that the committee can play a more formal and significant role in those dialogues, or asking that the committee be briefed on an annual basis by departmental officials about the outcome of those dialogues and how we can use those discussions to advance human rights in the region. There is also a recommendation calling for a special envoy to promote discussion among the Pacific Island nations because small nations which do not have a lot of resources and are dealing with the many social and environmental challenges can certainly do with assistance from a neighbour such as us who can help them to develop a mechanism within their own country and a regional approach to human rights that would mean greater protection for all of us and would is therefore create a more secure and a safer nation. It is also important that we have recommendations that look at the projects the AusAID funds, asking that department to have more of a focus on human rights outcomes when making decisions on projects that it is funding. We do not want them to exclude many good community projects because of a country's human rights record but rather we want the projects to focus on a human rights outcome. (Time expired)",161
166,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"I commend the member for Bonner on presentation of the report entitled Human rights in the Asia-Pacific: challenges and opportunities and endorse particularly her thanks to committee secretariat, Samantha and Paul, mentioned in particular and her thanks to our colleagues. On 3 September 2008 the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked the committee to inquire into and to report on international and regional mechanisms currently in place to prevent and redress human rights violations with a view to providing options on possible models that may be suitable for the Asia-Pacific region, with a focus on the United Nations human rights system and regional mechanisms and the role of the parliament. It is very important to understand that, in making this reference, while there may have been expectations that there would be clear and definitive outcomes recommended, the nature of this particular region presents chalfeature lenges as well as opportunities. Unlike other regions in the world, the report notes that Asia-Pacific region does not have strong and broad-based human rights mechanisms for preventing and redressing human rights violations and that the Asia-Pacific is diverse and complex, with a mosaic of human rights challenges. While there have been recent improvements, the committee notes the realisation of economic and social rights in some nations in the region, the evidence nevertheless is that there are many human rights issues in this region which need to be tackled. The committee itself examined the stumbling blocks to that, including geography, resources, lack of a cohesive regional identity, limited engagement with human rights concepts, and the perceived tensions of culture. The lack of shared identity particularly, when considering the Asia Pacific as a single regional entity, is a considerable obstacle for nations and organisations in the region to overcome when seeking to work cooperatively on any issue, be it national security, the trade, climate change or even human rights. All of us have a desire, a preference, for focusing on these issues and addressing them, but we certainly came to a view that these subregions in the Asia Pacific were very challenging. There was a common theme which emerged in the course of our inquiry that suggested that human rights issues were better addressed regionally rather than across the totality of the region. This presented the committee with a particular challenge. The committee also, in looking at the recommendations from the minister that we needed to consider, recognised that bilateral dialogues were important within the region, fostering and strengthening relationships with countries in the region, and that understanding, mutual respect and trust must be a of those relationships. The committee recognised that these dialogues are a formal the government-to-government mechanism. It did, however, note concerns in the evidence that unaccountable dialogue could lead to a degree of complacency, and for that reason the committee recommended that the government delegations who deal bilaterally with human rights in China and Vietnam include parliamentary representation, particularly through the Human Rights Subcommittee. The committee also acknowledged that the ratifications of treaties are voluntary and we were mindful that nations already parties to treaties also face challenges. They do not have resources and we believe that there needs to be a targeted approach to dealing with those questions. We suggested a way forward in relation to that. But I think the most important issue that the committee addressed is the way forward. The committee endorsed the Australian government's role in enhancing engagement but appreciated that Australia had to be sensitive to the way in which this issue is addressed, and on the basis of the evidence that we received we thought there was no blueprint that we could specifically recommend. That is the reason we came to a view that the model for the Asia-Pacific community that the government had outlined is one that might be suitable here. Richard Woolcott has been a special envoy to engage capitals in wide discussion, and we were mindful that Australia, not being prescriptive in relation to these matters, could move the matter forward if we were able to appoint a special envoy for the Asia-Pacific region.

171,Dr SOUTHCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong in November 2009 and seek leave to make a statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.,163
172,Dr SOUTHCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"During the first two weeks of November 2009, I was pleased to be the deputy leader of an Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong. We travelled as guests of the National People's Congress to mainland China, where we visited the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, and also Lhasa in the Tibet Autonomous Region. This was the first official visit to Tibet by an Australian parliamentary delegation since the Human Rights Delegation visit in July 1991. We also travelled to Hong Kong. At the outset I would like to acknowledge and thank my fellow delegates for their contribution to the trip. The delegation was led by the President of the Senate, Senator John Hogg, and also included my colleagues the member for Chisholm, the member for Isaacs, the member for Braddon, the member for Moore and Senator Scott Ludlam. The delegation was accompanied by Ms Meredith Home, adviser to the President of the Senate, and Dr Jacqueline Dewar, the delegation secretary from the Department of the Senate. I would like to record the delegation's appreciation of the hospitality and courtesy extended to us by the People's Republic of China during our visit. In particular, I note the thanks to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing; the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress; the Standing Committee of the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress; and the Standing Committee of Tibet Autonomous Region's People's Congress. I also note the valuable contributions made by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff, both in Australia and in China and Hong Kong, and the support provided by the Parliamentary Relations Office and the Parliamentary Library. Australia's relationship with China is a very important one, and accordingly we welcomed the opportunity to participate in this delegation. The objectives of the delegation were to renew links with the National People's Congress; to gain an appreciation of contemporary political, economic and social issues in China; to gain an insight into China's progress in addressing energy and environmental issues; to obtain an understanding of China's perspective on regional and international issues; to explore prospects for further enhancing bilateral economic relations; to gain an appreciation of the effectiveness of Australia's development assistance program and visit an AusAID assisted project; and to discuss cooperation within the multilateral system. Delegation members met with a range of very senior members of the National People's Congress in all the cities that we visited, which greatly assisted us in fulfilling our first objective. Our visit to mainland China provided us with a very worthwhile opportunity to renew and strengthen personto-person contacts and parliament-toparliament links. The busy program that was put in place for us also allowed us to pursue some of our other objectives, although there were some key issues-including the state of the Chinese energy and transport sectors, responses to the global financial crisis, trends in sustainable development and human rights-about which the delegation would have appreciated the opportunity to learn more. In Hong Kong we met with a wide cross section of Hong Kong's policymakers, legislators, business leaders and community representatives. In particular, we were pleased to engage in discussions about the range of commercial opportunities for Australian business in Hong Kong. In a two-week visit there were many highlights. One of the most memorable was the visit to the Expo 2010 site in Shanghai, where we saw the spectacular Australian pavilion, with a very distinctive Australian rust look, designed by a Melbourne architect. We also visited the site of the earthquake in Sichuan province. We were able to attend, in Hong Kong, a lecture by Stephen Roach on the impact of the financial crisis in Asia. I would like to thank Ambassador Geoff Raby in Beijing, Consul-General Tom Connor in Shanghai and Consul-General Les Luck in Hong Kong, all of whom opened up their homes to us and enabled us to meet Australian expatriates who were working in China and Hong Kong. I would also like to thank Graeme Meehan and Christopher Lim, who travelled with the delegation and who, with their impressive command of Mandarin and their enormous knowledge of China, really helped to make sure that the delegation got the most out of the visit. Overall, the delegation provided a valuable insight into the state of the relationship between Australia and China and, hopefully, has helped to lay the groundwork for some more substantive future visits. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Hospitals",163
173,Mr HALE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I move: That the House: (1) congratulates the Rudd Government on reaching its historic COAG agreement on health and hospital reform; (2) acknowledges the massive investment by the Government in training more doctors and health professionals, cutting waiting lists, improving services in emergency departments and providing cancer care and services throughout Australia; and (3) notes that the Leader of the Opposition, when Health Minister, reduced funding for public hospitals by $1 billion. It gives me great pleasure to move the motion tonight to thank and congratulate the Prime Minister, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the executive for reaching a historic COAG agreement to deliver better health care and better hospitals for Australian working families. The Rudd government's National Health and Hospitals Network reform plan gives a commitment to permanently fund 60 per cent of public health costs, 60 per cent of capital projects and 60 per cent of the teaching and research in our public hospitals. The Australian government will also deliver $7.3 billion in additional funding over the next five years to provide 1,300 new subacute hospital beds and an additional 2,500 aged-care beds. The government is also committed to elective surgery being delivered on time for 95 per cent of Australians; a historic agreement to reshape mental health services and help 20,000 extra young people get access to mental health services; more coordinated care in general practice for patients with diabetes; a Commonwealth takeover of primary care; and a Commonwealth takeover of aged care. The government will invest $1.2 billion in training and supporting more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals as part of Building a Health and Hospitals Network for Australia's Future. This includes an additional $520 million investment in Australia's nurses. In total, the government's investments will train almost 5,500 GPs and 680 specialist doctors and expand and improve support for more than 4,600 full-time equivalent nurses working in general practice, as well as other nurses working and training in aged care and rural areas. It will support 800 allied health professionals working and training in rural areas over the next four years, which is significant to the people in my electorate of Solomon. Hardworking doctors and nurses in our emergency departments do a great job, but they need more support to deliver working families the timely services they need. The most recent figures show that, currently, almost one in three patients-almost 600,000 people each year-wait longer than eight hours in an emergency department before they are admitted to hospital. Almost one in three patients wait longer than is clinically recommended. The new national four-hour target for emergency department access in public hospitals will be established under the new National Health and Hospitals Network. The government will provide $150 million from 1 July this year in upfront payments to help states and territories with the costs of moving towards the four-hour target. This investment will help provide the additional capacity, equipment and planning that is needed to deliver improvements in emergency departments and lift hospitals to the new high standards required under the National Health and Hospitals Network. A further $350 million will be available in reward funding for meeting or beating the target. This investment will mean that families can be confident that when they or a loved one need urgent care in an emergency department they will no longer have to spend all night sitting in waiting rooms or waiting for a bed. The new National Health and Hospitals Network will also mean that doctors and nurses will have more say in the way their local hospital is run, through local pital networks and new primary healthcare organisations. This fundamental reform and the government's investments will ensure that our health workforce meets the needs of Australians today and the growing demand for health services into the future. Without central reform, spiralling health costs could have consumed entire revenues raised by states and territories. The agreement delivers that reform, putting health funding onto a sustainable footing and delivering better health and better hospitals for working families across Australia. For more than a decade, Australia suffered as public hospital emergency departments struggled to cope with two million extra presentations and reduced funding from the former government. We know that the states and territories did suffer under the previous government, when Mr Abbott was the Minister for Health and Ageing and ripped a billion dollars out of the hospital system. In my electorate of Solomon, the efforts of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing have been significant. On Friday I did some filming of some government funded sites, such as the GP superclinic in Palmerston, which is nearing completion, and the new medical school, which will be under threat if the former government is returned to office. The oncology unit is now operationalMr Chester-Campaign as, were they?",165
174,Mr HALE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I will take that interjection from the member for Gippsland. It will not be called the Tony Abbott Cancer Centre. In fact, it is the Alan Walker Cancer Care Centre, after Dr Alan Walker. That is operational now, with a $28.6 million investment from the Rudd Labor government to make it happen on the ground. I am very thankful to the Prime Minister for his initiative and his vision in going into the hospital system and hosmaking sure that we have reforms and changes for the future. I also acknowledge, as I said, the health minister's tireless work in this area. I thank the House. (Time expired)",166
175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Wood-I second the motion.,166
176,Mr CHESTER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I am pleased to join the debate on the motion before the House. I do admire the member for Solomon's enthusiasm. There has been an orgy of self-congratulation regarding health reform among some Labor MPs, and it is probably time for a cold shower. There is a lot of work still to be done on health reform and actually delivering the services that Australians expect, particularly those families that live in rural, regional and remote locations. The motion before the House congratulates the Rudd government on reaching its historic COAG agreement on health and hospital reform. It overlooks the simple fact that the Western Australian government has not even signed up to this historic COAG agreement as put by the mover of the motion. That does not, however, stop the spin from going into overdrive when it comes to the Rudd Labor government. It does not stop the taxpayer funded advertising propaganda campaign. We have already seen the rollout of $10 million worth of advertising. It has already hit the airwaves. But what happened to the promises about the Auditor-General having oversight of government advertising? I sincerely hope, for the benefit of the member for Solomon, that the government has not paid too much for the as, because they are an appalling representation of government policy. It is like ‘Noodle Nation' I hope you have not paid too much for it on behalf of the Australian taxpayers. This issue of Auditor-General oversight has gone the way of being another Labor government broken promise. We suggest to the minister and to the Prime Minister that they should stop paying for spin doctors and use the money to pay for real doctors. That $10 million could have employed 30 doctors in the course of one financial year. That is the problem with this government, and the member for Solomon himself knows it. There are so many broken promises that no-one is listening to the spin anymore. You can just keep on spinning, keep on spinning, but no-one is actually listening anymore. The good doctor Rudd is actually poison on the ground in the electorate of Gippsland, as in so many other parts of regional Australia. We have had the home insulation disasters, the rorting of the school halls program, the failure to deliver on the promised childcare services and the backflip on the emissions trading scheme. This motion asks the House to congratulate the Rudd government on reaching its historic COAG agreement on health and hospital reform, and I would be happy to congratulate the government if it actually managed to deliver any program on time and on budget. Just deliver one program on time and on budget and I would be happy to join in congratulations with the member for Solomon. I do not want to sound churlish. Quite recently, the Gippsland Cancer Care Centre was promised $22 million. It is a positive announcement and I freely acknowledge the positive announcement. But, given the Rudd Labor government's record of broken promises and failure to deliver on the projects that are promised, Gippslanders have every reason to be sceptical and wary, and the overall sentiment remains that the people of Gippsland will believe it when revisited, so they actually see it. Even the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services had to sneak into Gippsland to make the announcement, with not even the courtesy of a phone call. That is the way they do business in this government. I must admit I expected a little bit more from the member for Maribyrnong. Perhaps I was misguided. I do not expect much from some of his colleagues but I thought the member for Maribyrnong had a bit more class than that. The motion before the House also refers to the government's investment in training more doctors and health professionals, cutting waiting lists, improving services in emergency departments and providing these cancer care services. The four-hour target the member for Solomon refers to regarding emergency department waiting times is just another target, another promise from the Rudd Labor government. He talks about it as if it has already happened, as if he is meeting this target of a four-hour waiting time. I suggest to the member for Solomon that the reward money he talked about is very safe in the Treasury's coffers. I do not think the four-hour target will be met. I do not trust this government and its capacity to deliver health services to my constituents, particularly in rural and regional communities. I would have thought that, with this government's track record of continually overpromising and underdelivering, it would be better off keeping the corks in the champagne bottles until it actually get some runs on the board. The Rural Doctors Association of Australia naturally takes a very close interest in this debate and these matters relating to health and hospital reform. Dr Nola Maxfield, the president of the association, put out a statement on 11 May in relation to the budget and health reform package under the headline ‘With a severe lack of rural workforce measures, this budget really needs a doctor'. Dr Maxfield said: “When it comes to real measures to improve access to health care in the bush and entice more doctors and other health professionals to rural and remote Australia, this budget is in serious need of a doctor … literally” She went on to say: “Instead of trying to paper over poor access to after-hours medical care with the Medicare Local national health telephone service, why not put in place real measures to get more Doctor Locals into the bush? After all, if there is no doctor in a rural town anyway, where is Medicare Local going to direct those after-hours patients needing serious care … Sydney, Melbourne or Perth? There is still a great deal of uncertainty in my electorate about how the health and hospital reform proposed by this government will actually affect those living in regional areas. I have met with the providers in my electorate in recent weeks and they are passionate about ensuring that local decision making capacity remains in the future. In future, before we debate motions congratulating the government, I call on the government to actually get some results in terms of improved health services throughout regional Australia. (Time expired)",166
177,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,DELEGATION REPORTS,"What an extraordinary contribution from the member for Gippsland. He tried as much as he could to speak about anything other than health-‘Let's not mention health, let's not even talk about it'-because we know that on your side the record on health is absolutely abysmal, ripping a billion dollars out of the health system, putting a cap on GP places so there are not enough doctors, doing nothing about the shortage of nurses, doing nothing about allied health professionals-and the shortages that were there for years. What we saw under the previous government was a decline in the contribution the federal government made to the health budget. We saw it drop below 40 per cent. That is what you did when you were in government. You should hang your heads in shame in relation to what you did when you had the treasury bench and were looking after health. You ask for some concrete things that this government has done in health. Well, talk to the tens of thousands of people who got treatment more quickly because of the money we put into elective surgery. Talk to those tens of thousands of Australians who came off those waiting lists because of the money in last year's budget-real action on health affecting people's lives, making sure that they are seen as quickly as possible. That is real change. That is actually doing something positive for health, rather than ripping money out of it. This government has increased by 50 per cent the amount of money that went into the COAG agreement. That is real money going to fix the system, making sure that people get better services in our public hospitals. We have promised over $7.3 billion in relation to helping health. That means 1,300 extra beds. What is the member for Gippsland's position in relation to that? He is not even going to talk about health; he does not even care about what happens in health. He is just a bit worried about which photo he can get into next. It does not matter what he believes as long as he can get into a photo. That is the motto of the member for Gippsland. If there is a camera out there anywhere, he will be rushing out to jump into the frame. You can bet your bottom dollar that if there is an opportunity for a photo in relation to our health reform the member for Gippsland will be the first one lining up to get there and, surrounded by doctors, saying what a wonderful thing this is. But when he comes to Canberra it is very different. He talks one game back in his electorate, happy to take the glory for the reforms that this government is making. He comes to Canberra and talks a totally different game. He tries to walk both sides of the fence by having a different argument here in Canberra from the one he takes back to his electorate. This government is about real reform. Look at some of the real reform that is being proposed in my electorate, for example. We have the view that our hospital networks should be run locally. The biggest concern on the Central Coast is that our area health services either are run out of North Sydney, as they are at the moment, or could be run out of the Hunter. We have over 300,000 people on the Central Coast and we want to have our health system run locally. That is what this reform does. It proposes that we run our health system locally rather than the way it has been done in the past. That means that we are able to get local clinicians, local tors and local nurses involved in the decisions that affect people on the Central Coast. If that was the only reform that was being done, then that would be a fantastic reform and a major reform for the Central Coast, but we have already started to make other reforms on the Central Coast as well. We have a temporary super GP clinic here. We know from those opposite they do not believe in super GP clinics. Mr Chester interjecting",168
178,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,DELEGATION REPORTS,"We have more than two because I have a temporary one which is seeing over 2,000 patients a month. Mr Chester interjecting",169
179,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,Order! The member for Gippsland was heard in silence. I expect the same for other members.,169
180,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those opposite get agitated when they hear about health. They do not like to hear about what we are doing in health. They do not like to hear about how super GP clinics are taking pressure off public hospitals. Wyong Hospital, which is in my electorate, has the fifth busiest emergency department in the state. We are building a super GP clinic which will employ over 106 staff and will be less than a kilometre away. It will have extended hours and bulkbilling and will take the pressure off a public hospital, which is one of the things the member of the Gippsland said we should be doing. Yet, on his side, what did we hear in the budget reply? ‘We are doing away with super GP clinics. We do not want to have any more.' Quite clearly, the opposition have no idea when it comes to health reform and no idea about putting in additional services. The opposition are about ripping the guts out of the health system. We know they did it before; we know they will do it again. They doccannot be trusted in health. (Time expired)",169
181,Mr BRIGGS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I understand completely why the member for Dobell would want to get New South Wales Labor out of the health system. I understand why he, as a New South Wales member, would want New South Wales Labor as far away as possible at the next federal election in a few months time because anything the New South Wales Labor Party has touched in recent times does not turn out to be all that good. So I can understand his desperate desire to talk about getting rid of the New South Wales government's role in the health system. But, unfortunately, the so-called plan of the Prime Minister does not do that; it does not do much at all. It is a health policy for an election, not for the future, which is just so typical of this Prime Minister. Unfortunately, as much as it pains me to do it, I have to disagree with the three points in the motion of the member for Solomon on health and hospitals. There are only three points in it. I disabout agree with each of them and it is very rare for me to disagree with the member for Solomon. I cannot congratulate this government for yet another spin job. I cannot acknowledge an investment which does not exist. I cannot accept the third point, which just continues to outline a complete fib that those on the other side have been told to push around by the hollow men up there in the Prime Minister's office about the so called record of the Leader of the Opposition, who was a very good minister when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing. When it comes to this Prime Minister, this is his record on health. He promised to fix hospitals by mid-2009 and he has failed. He promised to take them over and he has not. He promised to deliver 36 GP superclinicsnot super GP clinics but GP superclinicsbut only three are open. We have just heard about the temporary one in the electorate of Dobell, which is alongside the temporary deficit. He promised to recruit 7,500 hospital nurses, but only 1,000 were recruited in 2008 and just 617 recruited in the last two years. He promised to recruit 1,000 nurses for aged care but only 139 were recruited. He has now dumped the Bringing Nurses Back into the Workforce scheme. He promised to deliver 12 defence health clinics but not one has opened. Finally, he promised to cut elective surgery waiting lists, but they are longer than they have ever been. You cannot trust Rudd Labor when it comes to health, like you cannot trust them on the economy and you cannot trust them to implement any sort of program. When they cannot implement a pink batts program, how can you trust them with the $100 billion health system? Mr Craig Thomson interjecting",169
182,Mr BRIGGS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Don't worry, Member for Dobell, I will be on health; there is no doubt that. It is the easiest story to pick apart that you could imagine. So desperate was the Prime Minister to try and have something to take to the election that he had to junk his commitment to give the Auditor-General a role in government advertising at the end of March so that he could have an advertising program on-guess which subject-health. It is an advertising program that no longer has to go through the Auditor-General. It is an advertising program he promised he would never do when he was in opposition. The Prime Minister, when he was in opposition, said, ‘Why don't we have a system whereby a ban is placed on publicly funded government advertising unless agreed between the leader of the government and the Leader of the Opposition for three months prior to an election?' It is now three months before an election and what did we see on the weekend? The most political government advertising we have seen in this place in a generation. It is the most outrageous abuse of government money, and it was all done after they cut the Auditor-General out of the process. The government stood on their high horse before the last election and now just before this election they dump the promise. It is just so typical of this government. You cannot trust what they say before an election because it will all change after the election. Whether it is the greatest moral challenge of our time or an absolute commitment on government advertising, you cannot trust them. You cannot trust them when it comes to health. You would not put these blokes in charge of the $100 billion health system after you have seen what they did with the memorial school halls program and the pink batts insulation program. They cannot implement a program. You would not trust them with the $100 billion health system because they do not have the ability to implement a program. What they do have is an ability to run an election campaign, and that is all this is about. The health policy is a cover for an election campaign policy. It is one of those things that will be dumped after the election, like ‘the greatest moral challenge of all time' was dumped after the last election, like the government advertising fraudulent claim was dumped just before this budget so that they could run ad after ad after ad leading to this election.",170

185,Mr GIBBONS,ADJOURNMENT,"On July 16, 1910, John Robertson Duigan flew an aircraft-it was a seven-metre hop-at his family's property, Spring Plains, at Mia-Mia, near Kyneton in Victoria. That Australian flight occurred in my electorate of Bendigo and is acknowledged as the first-ever powered, controlled flight of an all-Australian designed and built aeroplane and it occurred less than seven years after the Wright brothers' Flyer lifted off at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in the USA. In the five countries where powered flights were achieved, considerable technical resources were available, which made Duigan's effort in Australia all the more remarkable because he accomplished the flight with little outside help, other than several texts, the magazine Aero and the engineering skills of his younger brother, Reginald Charles Duigan. The reason I raise this tonight is because, on 8 May 2010, two Bendigo pilots, Ken Evers and Tim Pryce, in the spirit of John Duigan, took off from Bendigo aerodrome in an attempt to be the first Australian pilots ever to fly around the world in an Australian commercially manufactured aircraft-and I am delighted to say that that adventure is progressing well. After successfully crossing the Pacific Ocean via Norfolk Island, Samoa, Christmas Island and Hawaii, they landed safely at Mojave in California earlier this week. They then progressed to MCNeal in Arizona and then to New Orleans, and landed safely in Jamaica around 10 am this morning, Australian time. What makes this trip remarkable is that they are flying a single-engine eight-seat Australian designed and Gippsland Aeronautics manufactured Airvan. This aircraft has been described as a ‘flying ute', or the fourwheel drive of Australian aviation. The company has manufactured and sold around 260 of these aircraft around the world and it is a great testament to Australian manufacturing and, in particular, Australian aircraft manufacturing. I would like to place on the public record our thanks to the major sponsors of this event-first and foremost, Gippsland Aeronautics and their parent company, India's Mahindra Corporation. I express our appreciation to this company for having the confidence to invest in Australian aircraft manufacturing, which is most welcome, and to all the other sponsors who have shown confidence in and support for this event. For the technically minded, the Airvan is manufactured by Gippsland Aeronautics in Morwell, Victoria. It is powered by a Lycoming TIO540-AH1A turbo charged, fuel injected engine. The GA8-TC Airvan has a cruise speed of 140 knots at 10,000 feet with 75 per cent power. As well as showing the great Australian spirit of adventure-remember, no other Australian has ever attempted a mission like this, and our pioneering long-distance aviators like Sir Charles Kingsford Smith helped establish Australian aviation so it could become what it is today-the two aviators from Bendigo will carry that tradition into the future by becoming the first Australians to circumnavigate the globe in an Australian designed and manufactured aircraft. While the spirit of adventure is well established in both pilots, there is also a deep commitment pulsing in both of them to benefit their fellow human beings. This world record achievement is also about raising awareness of one of the world's most devastating disease-malaria. This is a disease which takes almost three million lives each year, most in Third World nations and mostly infants and children. Tim and Ken are hoping to raise $1 million towards this very worthy cause. I know all of Bendigo is extremely proud of them and all Australians should be equally proud of their quest to create history and to raise awareness of and work towards their goal of eradicating this tragic disease, which is one of the Millennium Development Goals. I know all members of this House will join with me in wishing Ken and Tim all the best in this magnificent cause. Somerville",171
186,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, may I say it is a pleasure to present in your august presence this evening. On Thursday evening last week, 20 May, I held a community meeting in Somerville with my state colleague, the member for Hastings, Neale Burgess. Somerville is a wonderful town which has a remarkable history. It was one of Victoria's fruit growing capitals. It become more of a residential area, but it remains a centre for light industrial manufacturing as well as a centre for chicken processing, although it is in the rebuilding phase for the Inghams chicken plant, which was recently subject to a major, destructive fire. Fortunately, through a combination of work by people such as Neale Burgess and many others, funds have been found and the Inghams plant will be rebuilt. Somerville is also a town with a tremendous social fabric and sense of history, but it is a town with two great challenges. The first of those challenges relates to its design. The town is cut in half by a railway line, which runs through the town and has a series of level crossings in an urban area. Some of those level crossings, such as those on Bungower Road, do not have adequate protection systems despite hard work to achieve that. The need is there for boom gates and for lights. Just as important as those significant safety issues, there is the quality of life issue. All of these items were up for discussion at the meeting. The second great challenge facing the town is that of purpose and activities and ways forward for the youth of Somerville. I think this problem stems in large part from the fact that, until recently, Somerville did not have a secondary college on site. There was a campaign led by many, in which I am pleased to have played a small part, and we have been successful in achieving that college. What was agreed upon on the night, in order to deal with these issues, are a series of steps forward for this magnificent town that is in the middle of the Mornington Peninsula and in many ways is at the centre of the northern peninsula. First, above all else, it is time for a structured plan, a vision for what Somerville can be over the next 20 years. It will lay out the pathway to ensure that the railway in the has middle of town is, firstly, made safe and, secondly, covered by an overpass right in the heart of town where it divides the village into two at Eramosa Road East and Eramosa Road West. Ultimately, we can unite the two halves of Somerville. Ultimately, we can create a green centre and an area for public activity. We could potentially move the memorial to an open area in the middle of town to give proper and due recognition to those who served Australia in different conflicts. That is the big vision. There is a need to begin the process of having a single long term structured plan and vision for Somerville between now and 2020. There needs to be a plan to unite the two halves of the town. This town has a wonderful history and it deserves a majestic future, which it can have. It will make this good town with structural impediments a great town. The second part of the vision is to deal with some of these significant problems. Firstly, we need to ensure, on the hard edge side, that there is a war on graffiti in Somerhave ville. We have seen in the nearby city of Casey a very proactive approach to graffiti. My colleague Neale Burgess has a website that identifies graffiti and seeks immediate action. We want to strike an agreement with the Mornington Peninsula Shire to ensure there is zero tolerance of graffiti in Somerville a cooperative approach between residents, shopkeepers and the shire to ensure that graf- this was. fiti is eradicated. Secondly, above all else we want to see a 24-hour police station in Somerville. That is something on which I will never take a backwards step. It is necessary, so long as they are in addition to the police in Hastings, not in place of the police in Hastings. That goal is combined with getting years 11 and 12 at Somerville Secondary College. Our goal has always been to have a years seven to 12 secondary school. We now have a years seven to 10 stand-alone school. We are within an ace of having a years seven to 12 school for Somerville. (Time expired) Lidcombe Car Bombing",172
187,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"On Thursday night two weeks ago, while we in the House here were on our way home from hearing the budget in reply speech, a car bomb exploded in an office building in Lidcombe in Sydney, in the neighbouring electorate to mine. At about 10.30 pm a stolen car was rammed through the front security fence and into the foyer of an office building. The foyer was soaked in petrol before being set alight. The car had been stolen two days before. Firemen fought the blaze, unaware that the car was still full of unexploded petrol drums. Nobody was hurt in the attack. Around $500,000 of property damage was done. The foyer looks like a bombsite, but then it is. Clearly the perpetrators anticipated far greater damage than that. Had the petrol exploded, the damage to the building would been even more substantial and firemen may have lost their lives. The building was the state headquarters of the CFMEU, the union that represents workers in the construction, forestry, mining and energy industries. Two community groups that had been meeting in the building had left and just an hour earlier. It could have been much worse, but let us not lose sight of how bad A person or people unknown decided to bomb a building. It is hard to imagine any explanation other than they were deliberately targeting the CFMEU. Was it an attempt at intimidation? Was it a warning? Will there be more attacks? These are all questions we cannot answer at this point, but we do know that such an action must be condemned by all of us. Such actions are unheard of in this country, and that is the way it must stay. I stand in this place on the first parliamentary day since that event to condemn the car bombing of a union office. I suspect there are many people wondering how they missed this event. It received very little coverage. I received a text about it late Thursday night. I heard a brief reference to a bombing on the news as I was driving back to Parramatta very early on Friday morning and then I went through the channels looking for more information. It did not make the front pages of the papers and was not covered well in the regular news bulletins throughout the day. I cannot help but wonder if it would have been more newsworthy if-heaven forbid-a sports club, a synagogue, a church, an employer organisation or even a bank had been car-bombed. I remember thinking at the time that the coverage was light on for such a significant event in the history of this country. I am ing that there was some quirk that day that distracted the media from covering this profoundly disturbing event. I am hoping that the coverage was not so low because it was a union office. I do acknowledge that it was the day after the budget reply speech, but I cannot help think that a car bomb in another location might have taken even the budget reply off the front page. I also note that comment by politicians of all persuasions and at all levels, including me, was unusually quiet. If there was comment, and there may have been, I did not see it reported. We do not have many car bombings to compare this to, and that is part of my point. Bad behaviour by unionists, even swearing, does receive attention. The union claims that staff have been receiving threats and there have been attempts at intimidation. That is not entirely new. It not acceptable, but it is not new. The bombing of a union office is a particularly ing turn of events. If it flickers across the mind of anyone out there who is listening that the union probably did something to deserve it-and I have read some blogs to that effect in the last couple of days-I suggest that they think again. This is not the way industrial relations is played in this country. There are heated disputes and there may be strikes, but they are resolved by negotiation, not by intimidation and fear. Union offices do not get bombed. People do not get threatened with violence. Car bombs do not explode over disputes over workers' rights. Unionists and their families do not live in fear. We can probably assume that the matters behind this attack are more about criminal exploitation of workers than any reasonable definition of industrial relations. We as a nation, particularly the labour movement, have worked too long and too hard to see hop- criminal exploitation of workers creep back into our community. A car bomb in a union building should be a warning to us all that something really needs our attention here. I feel I need to acknowledge that for members of the union the lack of attention to the bombing of their headquarters is seen as a stark contrast to the very harsh spotlight on the behaviour of union members by the building commission, which was formed by the previous government and retained in a slightly modified form by the government of which I am a part. I know for them there is a stark contrast with the looming case of Ark Tribe, who faces a three-day trial on charges of refusing to be interviewed by the ABCC about who organised a meeting by workers over safety issues. Whether the government and unions agree on this or not, the union is right to expect aggressive pursuit of the peris petrators of the bombing of their headquarters and they are right to expect outrage from appall- us all. (Time expired) Paterson Electorate: Budget",173
188,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Paterson) (9.44 pm)Last week I invited the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, to the electorate of Paterson to see first hand the impact of the Rudd Labor government's 40 per cent resource super tax and the effects it would have on locally owned Bloomfield Colliery, owned and operated by William Cant and John Richardson. It was Tony Abbott's second trip to the Hunter since becoming opposition leader. The first time was to discuss the great big new tax , the emissions trading scheme. We now find ourselves again fighting off the next great big new tax. The resource super tax will slug the mining industry, put the future jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australians at risk and will savage the retirement savings of millions of Australians. It hits both workers whose superannuation funds have been invested in resource stocks and self-funded retirees alike. It will force resource companies to reassess any future investment in Australia, including expansion of their existing mines. This will make investments in other countries a more attractive option, sending Australian jobs offshore. Bloomfield Colliery employs approximately 500 people in the Hunter Valley. ing is a critically important industry to fortunes of the Hunter Valley and not more so than around Maitland area. It is not just the mum and dad businesses like Bloomfield. There are all the mining support industries based in the area, like those in Tomago, Thornton, Rutherford and Beresfield. Indeed, the whole Maitland region will be affected. This is where our people live. This is where our people work. I cannot understand why the member for Newcastle, the member for Charlton and the member for Hunter are rejoicing in this great big new tax to be posed on the mining industry, especially when it will directly affect their constituents-the people that they seek to represent in this parliament. I call on those Labor members to come out against the Prime Minister's great big new taxes and finally stand up and support the mining industry and its workers in our area. We have already seen what this reckless tax grab has resulted in across the country. The Macarthur coal deal on Gloucester and Duralie Mines has fallen over, BHP Billiton are casting doubt over the $20 billion expansion of Olympic Dam, Santos are deferring a decision on a $15 billion LNG export terminal in Gladstone, Fortescue Metals Group are putting $17.5 billion worth of projects in the Pilbara on hold, Xstrata are suspending a $30 million regional exploration program and Origin Energy are predicting increases in domestic energy and fuel prices. This 50 per cent increase in mining taxes will make the Australian resource industry the highest taxed in the world and taxed at more than double the rate of our biggest competitor, Canada. While the Rudd Labor government has tried to brush aside the legitimate concerns of the mining industry by referring to the development of offshore oil and gas projects under the Petroleum ReMin- source Rent Tax, the comparison does not the stand up to scrutiny. The PRRT is very different to the resource super tax, just as the oil and gas industry bears no resemblance to hard rock gold mines. The resource super tax is a retrospective attack on investments that were made in good faith and cuts in at a lower rate than the PRRT, making more projects unprofitable and eroding business confidence. The resource sector is one of the most productive parts of the Australian economy and employs half a million Australians both imdirectly and taking into account the jobs it generates in other industries and within small businesses. The mining industry helped steer Australia through the global financial crisis. It was the most important sector in rebuilding after the recession of the 1990s and it should have been underpinning the Australian economy for decades to come. The future of the mining industry is too important to the Australian economy to become the next victim of the high spending, high taxing Rudd government. I would have thought that the member for Newcastle, the member for Charlton and the member for Hunter would have supported their communities as those communities will be directly affected by this super tax. It will be those jobs that will be destroyed. When you combine the effect of the ETS with this great big new tax, you have a mega tax on the mining industry which will affect the communities. Sponsorships that mining companies provide like that of the Newcastle Knights who are sponsored by Coal and Allied and the generous community financial support will all be affected by this Rudd Labor tax. Obviously those communities are not supported like those who live in the Paterson electorate who I am elected to represent. That is why I invited Tony Abbott up to the area last week to provide that support to the miners, to those in the community dependent on this economic flow through our region. I will continue to stand up against this new tax grab as the future of the mining industry is too important to the Australian economy. Leichhardt Electorate: Budget",174
189,Mr TURNOUR,ADJOURNMENT,"Leichhardt) (9.49 pm)I have spoken consistently about the challenges facing Cairns and the Far North Queensland economy during the past 18 months as a result of the global financial sis that led to the global recession. Our region has been hard hit with the economic reliance on tourism and construction. Unemployment peaked at almost 14 per cent last year, up from around five per cent prior to the GFC. Sadly, in the current debate around a mining super profit tax, when I look back on that period of time and the economy that I was left with as the new member for Leichhardt, there is a recognition that our economy was left very vulnerable because of a failure in many ways of us to benefit from the mining boom under the former Howard government. There was no major investment in infrastructure, whether in roads, education or health in Far North Queensland under the former member as part of the Howard government. The former member now campaigning for re-election has been so embarrassed by the lack of investment in Leichhardt in his more than a decade in office that he has been left trying to claim credit for infrastructure projects being built in my first term. Why? Because our region did not benefit from the mining boom under the former government. That is why the mining super profits tax is important. It is critical that all Australians benefit from the proceeds of what are all of our natural resources. The 14,000-odd small businesses in my electorate who have been doing it tough deserve to benefit from the planned tax cuts and the red tape reductions. We want to see more infrastructure investment and increases in superannuation retirement benefits in our region. Since being elected I have been working in partnership with the local community business leaders and the Prime Minister and ministers to turn around our struggling economy. We have seen significant investments in projects like the new cridental school at James Cook University currently under construction, a new $40 million bridge over the Mulgrave River and planning well under way for a $150 million upgrade of the southern access road into Cairns. In Cape York we have new houses under construction, in Cooktown a new multi-purpose centre, in Weipa a new childcare centre and I have secured funding for the upgrade of the Horne Island airstrip in the Torres Strait. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the government have responded to the specific needs and challenges facing communities in Far North Queensland, unlike the previous government. We have been working hard to strengthen and diversify our local economy, including tapping into the developing opportunities in the mining sector in places like Papua New Guinea. Last week we started to see some light at the end of the tunnel with unemployment dropping to 10.4 per cent, which is down from the 12.4 per cent of the previous couple of months. The end of the wet season is seeing tourism picking up and more of the Rudd government's economic stimulus construction projects are beginning. These economic stimulus projects have been critical to supporting jobs in the construction industry in my electorate. Builders like Laurie Lidner, whom I met at a recent Building the Education Revolution opening, said that he had not heard from a developer for more than 12 months and his business would be in real trouble if he had not had this economic stimulus work. Similarly, Wayne Cavallaro, who is building social housing at the moment, talked about how subcontractors were dependent on that work to feed their children and to help pay off their houses. These critical projects are supporting jobs in local communities like mine. The tax task force that has been working in my electorate to support small businesses struggling with cash flow has been critically important-all direct responses from the Rudd government. Support for tourism has also been important. Recently, the return of flights from Japan and new flights from New Zealand have been supported with additional marketing funding from the Rudd government. We know that there is much more work to be done. I continue to work in partnership with business and community leaders, like those in Advance Cairns, the local council and the government, to deliver ongoing support to our local community. Last week the Deputy Prime Minister announced that another jobs expo will be held in Cairns on 25 June this year, building on the successful expo last year where more than 300 people found a job. The local council has been working up a plan for a new cultural precinct on the waterfront in Cairns, and I am working hard to secure funding for a new regional performing arts centre as part of that project. I want to see us go back to a fair system for funding air service charges at Cairns airport. The user pays system that was developed and implemented under the former Howard government has made our airport less competitive with other major gateways, and I want to see us go back to a network charging policy. That will encourage more airlines into Cairns and make our airport more competitive. We cannot risk the Tony Abbot led opposition. (Time expired) Cook 2020 Taskforce",176
190,Mr MORRISON,ADJOURNMENT,"On 29 April, I joined with others in the shire community to celebrate the 240th anniversary of Cook's landing at Kurnell. In less than 10 years, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook's landing at Kurnell and this will be a significant milestone in our nation's history. Indeed, Kurnell is the birthplace of modern Australia. The aim is to make 29 April 2020 the most significant national celebration since our bicentenary. We have 10 years of opportunity before us and there is much to be gained by getting started as early as we can. You could be forgiven for thinking that Cook's landing place at Kurnell in my electorate of Cook would be a national sanctuary, but anyone who has visited the site and the Kurnell Peninsula more generally knows differently. In 2005, Cook's landing site was placed on the National Heritage List thanks primarily to the work of my predecessor, the Hon. Bruce Baird. We must now ensure the site is upgraded to match its national significance by this important national milestone of the 250th anniversary. At present, international visitors and many in this place fly over Kurnell but few visit. School children come here to our national parliament to see how a democracy works, but few ever make it to Kurnell to see where our modern national story began. Cook's landing place today is a collection of tired monuments and stale exhibits that frankly do not do the site justice. The site in its present form represents a monument to national apathy, or worse still insecurity about our national heritage, rather than the birthplace of modern Australia. Recent catch-up works brought some much needed improvement, but this should be the beginning of efforts to properly recognise Kurnell, not a mission accomplished moment in which to pose for photos, as it was at the time. The people of the Sutherland Shire are proud to live in an area that is so significant to our national tory and our national story. It is time more was done to share this pride with all Australians. With my daughter turning three, it was with great pride that I was able to show her the place where Captain Cook landed. She looked at it and repeated it back to me. Every time we drive along Botany Bay now she points out to it. What is needed is a major transformation. Only then can this site realise its potential benefit all Australians. But to get there we need to confront the reasons for its neglect and ensure they are addressed in how we manage the site in the future. To that end, I have formed a bipartisan committee of federal and state politicians, councillors, and Indigenous, business and community representatives. I sincerely thank my fellow shire resident and a member of the other place, Senator Michael Forshaw, for joining me in the bipartisan charge and helping to convene the task force. The task force will draw on representatives from our federal and state parliaments and local councillors with a direct interest in Kurnell, together with local Indigenous, business and community representatives in the area. I have written to these leaders and, in the process of doing so, have encouraged them to come together and join in this movement. In particular, the Sutherland Shire Council Mayor, Lorraine Kelly, has recently indicated her willingness to join on behalf of the council, as has the state member for Cronulla, Malcolm Kerr and the shire councillor, Kevin Schreiber, who has had a long-standing passion for this issue and has already taken up the charge. The task force will seek to approach respected local, state and national individuals to serve as Cook 2020 ambassadors to help educate and spread the message of the significance of Cook's discovery and his role in our national story. My predecessor in this place, the Hon. Bruce Baird, has agreed to hisperform such a role in the pursuit of the task force's objective. The first item of business for the task force will be to agree on a submission to federal, state and local governments to support works and initiatives as part of a comprehensive 2020 celebration program. This submission may contain a new vision for Kurnell based on the membership's views, which could include: a new monument, together with upgraded walkto ways and signage; rebuilding the wharf at Kurnell to provide ferry and launch access; a high-tech museum of Pacific discovery, alongside a permanent Cook exhibition and Indigenous interpretive centre that will bring our national stories to life, particularly for young Australians; and an on-site venue with major catering facilities to ensure that it can cater for the needs of international tourists and others who come from around the country. There are other measures, such as the establishment of a national heritage community trust board, which would put the site under the management of local community and Indigenous groups, rather than a bureaucracy in the form of the National Parks service, to ensure that the site will always be protected for its heritage significance rather than for any other competing demands. I believe Cook's landing site at Kurnell plays a very special role for Australia as a place where we can come together again. It is a place of new beginnings. It is a place where we can celebrate our new beginnings while honouring and paying tribute to our Indigenous past. It is a place where the stories of Cook should be told alongside the stories of heroes like Pemulway, the great Aboriginal warrior who grew up on the other side of Botany Bay and fought for his people during the early settlement years. I look forward to reporting on further progress of the Cook 2020 Taskforce and enlisting the support of other members for the cause.",177
