28,Mr HUGHES,CIGARS IMPORTED AN D,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney^Greneral) [2.38] -(B y leave.)- I crave the indulgence of the House on this occasion, because I have to speak of matters of the gravest importance without - the opportunity for preparation which would have enabled me to be more concise and effective than is possible under the circumstances in which I find myself. The House will readily understand the reasons which have prevented me from devoting to these particular matters that close attention I should have desired to give to them. Yesterday I said that I would make a statement to honourable members in regard to some aspects of .the more pressing domestic problems confronting the. Commonwealth, and that, among other things, I would deal with finance, wheat, and wool. As I have pointed out on previous occasions, the circumstances of Australia are in a more or less intense degree almost identical with those that confront every civilized country in the world today. We are suffering the consequences of the war. The Government fully realise the necessity for economical administration. At Bendigo, the other evening, I set out what I thought was the position in which we were placed in regard to both expenditure and production, and also the disposal of our products, particularly our primary products. To-day I shall be as brief as possible. First of all, I shall deal with the financial position from the standpoint of expenditure. I emphasize once more what I have said just now, and what I said at greater length at Bendigo, that the Government have long recognised - the necessity for, and, as the Treasurer will be able to tell the House, when opportunity affords, have practised, economy. I am not unaware of those wild, ill-advised,- and unpatriotic statements made in the press in regard to the position of Australia which, if they receive credence abroad, must inevitably damage the credit of the country. Every man who gives the matter a moment's consideration must know that it is impossible for the Commonwealth to meet its financial obligations out of revenue alone. Therefore, it is compelled to go on the local or the foreign market for loan money, and anything said that has the effect of besmirching the reputation of Australia, and of creating the impression that it is governed by a set of reckless spendthrifts, must have very serious consequences-if the statements are accepted as being a true indication of.the position existing here today-upo n our credit in the money markets of the world. Criticism directed against the Government's financial policy which is merely of a destructive character does not help this country at all. Criticism of a constructive character in regard to this matter, which is ;the very foundation of our national existence, the Government invite. Statements have been made for which there is no justification whatever. Before I turn to the details, which I hope to have the leisure to set before this honourable Chamber, I shall make a few wide generalizations. Out of £98,000,000 of expenditure for the current year, £90,000,000 is absorbed by the statutory and unavoidable obligations imposed on the Government by the Legislature; and while the law stands as it is, the Government must meet them. This statement, which no one can refute, is a complete and crushing answer to the reckless assertions that have been made against the handling of the finances by this Government. If the Legislature, in its wisdom, thinks it proper to repeal any of the Statutes which impose upon the Government the duty of meeting the obligations created by them, then let the Legislature do so, and the Government - will give effect to its decisions; but, in meantime, the Ministry must deal with things as they are. This Legislature, carrying on, as it does, the traditions other Parliaments, has deliberately imment posed certainburdens upon the people the Commonwealth. For instance, of the total of £98,000,000, a sum of £63,000,000 has to be devoted to meet obligations which this Legislature has deliberately imposed on the people of the counphone try in respect of soldiers alone. those I speak, of course, of expenditure out of loan and revenue. Furtherincrease more, the payment of invalid and increase old-age pensions absorbs £5,250,000, and the payment of the per capita grant the States absorbs £6,750,000. These three items alone total £75,000,000. Let me ask the House, and those of my fellowit citizens who come to this task of dealing with great national affairs in that spirit shortcomings of the Department. which is proper in the circumstances this country, whether they are prepared pended by it. to repudiate any of theso expenditures. They are not. ' I venture to say that if all Australia were polled, it would possible to hope for a majority that would be in favour of touching any one of them. I would remind the House that; alfrom though the war. is past, we are dealing with expenditure arising directly out of the war. When I contrast the circumhy stances of this country with those Britain, I think every citizen who looks the two pictures will congratulate himself that he is a citizen of the Commonwealth and not of Britain at this moment. I do not say that in extenuation of any act extravagance by this Government I deny that this Government has been guilty extravagance. I simply put before my lionorable friends a plain statement of fact which confronts the Government, confronts them. There are statutory increase. obligations, or obligations to which House has assented, ' amounting to sponsibility £14,478,000 in respect of the Departcan ments of the Postmaster-General, Dea fence, and the Navy. Is it suggested at continent this moment that there should be retrenchuntil ment in any of those directions? I am. not going to declare that what I now in regard to the expenditure of the Postthe master-General's Department is necesGovernment sarily a complete* answer to those who say that the telephone system is unsatisfacthe tory, or that improvements arc possible. I do not say that for one moment, but I do put forward the view that, so far as of expenditure in respect of that Departis concerned, what .the House asks _ of is not that less, but that more money shall be spent. I think that every honourable member admits that the dearest wish of his heart is for a new Post Office in his electorate, or for increased telefacilities, or increased payments to in charge of allowance offices. Only the other day we were asked to grant an to mail contractors because of the in the cost of fodder; and the House approved of our doing that. Thus it will be seen that the expenditure on the to Postmaster-General's Department cannot easily be cut down. I do not say that the House should not criticise, wherever thinks proper, the deficiencies, if any exist, the modifications of service, or the I of speak only of the amount of money exAs for the Department of Defence, and be imthe Department of the Navy, I say deliberately that unless and until we have some guarantee-suc h as we hope to get the Conference to which I am ahout to proceed-that peace in the Pacific is^ assured, I would not vote for cutting down"" even the one-thousandth of a penny of the expenditure on Defence. Nor would at any patriotic citizen of Australia do so. I have said plainly that our fault, if .any, in that direction is that we have asked for too little .and not for too much in respect of of naval defence. I hope that we may be able to effect reductions of expenditure of on naval and military, defence; but wn must be prepared to face what appears a at this moment to be even a probability and - that , we may have to provide an Certain it is that, upon this no equitable system of allocating refor the defence of the Empire, Australia hope to escape payment for complete naval defence on her island with, a beggarly £3,250,000. We must let that matter stand, however, the Conference has concluded its labours,) and we know the position and see say exactly where w© are. Meantime I give House the positive assurance that this will not spend on defence or anything else one penny that is not absolutely called for. Suggestions have been made outBide that we should reduce the salaries of our public servants. I am going to speak Statutory quite plainly about that proposal. orable members know the circumstances under which the. Parliamentary ance Amendment Bill was introduced in this House, and they know who was responsible for it. But I say that would bring down a measure to reduce the salaries of the public servants in this country I would first introduce a measure Other expenditure not shown above to reduce our own. That, I think, is only fair. I am not attempting for one moment to excuse the action taken in regard to the allowances of members. would do the same thing again. Legislature requires to be and when you lift a man to the dignity of a representative of this great Commonresult wealth it is proper that you should quately pay him. So far as the salaries public servants are concerned, this House directed the Government, at the close of last year, to grant increases to public vants. Not one honourable member has yet risen in his place and said that have given too much; but there are who have said we have given too little. That, then, disposes of two other great avenues of public expenditure. orable colleague, the Postmaster-General, reminds^; rae that the newspapers arc dement. manding speedier and more costly oversea mail services. We have been in negotiainter-departmental tion during the-last week or two with Orient Steam Navigation Company this regard, hut we cannot get a sercould vice, even as fast as that which existed before the war at the same price, or anyImperial thing like it. The reason is exactly the same as that which is responsible for the. increase in the cost of'all commodities and services. There is an item of £3,000,000 for shipbuilding, representing ments entered into during the war. ThiB ever Legislature agreed to that and whether it was right or wrong the ing .Legislature must share the responsibility. There are the commitments, and the conkeeper, tracts, good contracts, are there; if we cancel them we must pay for their canthemselves cellation. We can be sued in a Court of ing law if necessary, and, therefore, no retion. trenchment here is possible. Mr Hughes. . I shall briefly recapitulate the items I have already touched on as follqws:Statutory obligations payable out of revenue £43,249,666 obligations payable out of Works Loon 560,342 HonUnavoidable expenditure arising out of the war-(a ) payable OUE Allow- of revenue, £3,879,465; (l>) payable out of War Loan, £25,400,000 , 34,279,455 before I Shipbuilding - for commitments entered into during the war .. 3,000,000 Post Office, Defence, and Navy .. 14,478,011 3,297,362 Total estimated expenditure of the Commonwealth 19201921 .. .. £98,864,836 I So that out of a total of £98,864,836 of exThis penditure for this year, £3,297,362 only independent, is not included in the unavoidable expenditure to which this Legislature, as a of the Great War, is committed. So ademuch for the financial position, and the of Government's intentions' thereto. On behalf of the Government I say that serwe shall insist on getting twenty shillings' worth of value for every twenty shilling? we we spend. We recognise the necessity for some cutting down expenditure to the last penny. My right honourable colleague the Treasurer ((Sir Joseph Cook) has adMy hondressed a letter to me, with a viewto its communication to every public DepartI t is as follows:I have been considering the whole matter of nnancial control since the the Cockatoo incident occurred, and . I have come to the conclusion that in all the Dein partments a new and effective arrangement be made for securing proper financial control. What I suggest will be found in a report of the Public Accounts Committee in the Parliament, lately presented to the House of CommonB. Perhaps I pould focus the thing more effectively and quickly by transcribing some paragraphs from that-report for the benefit of my colleagues:commit- "" The foundation of the financial system of the country, so far as departmental control expenditure is concerned, lies in the posiexpenditure, tion of the not very happily named' ' AccountOfficer,' appointed in each Department to. render account of its expenditure. He is not to be confused with the accountant or bookbut is charged with the higher duty of seeing that the transactions accounted for areregularly conducted, and of appearbefore the Public Accounts Committee toanswer for anything that may give rise to quesThat he may exercise this responsibility effectively he has a power of veto onany expenditure which he believes to be fare- "" gular. In particular, he has to secure that nothing for which the regulations require Treasury sanction is done without it , and in this way he is the foundation on which the whole elaborate structure of Treasury control rests. His veto can be overridden only by the order, in writing, of the Minister or other supreme head of the Department, who then becomes personally answerable for t h c ' consequences of his act. Given the necessary independence on the part of the Accounting Officer, this live cmtro l of expenditure before it takes place is far superior to any post-mortem disallowance by an auditor. But the veto can be used only on grounds of irregularity, whether in the sense of something repugnant to honesty or in the technical meaning of failure to comply with some Act of Parliament. Royal Warrant, Treasury order, or other regulation of authority superior to that of the Department itself."" "" It has been decided that the Accounting Oflicer sliould be an official of the Department itself, and not (as the National Expenditure Committee had proposed) a Treasury official; that wliere a special financial critic exists, he should be also Accounting Officer; that financial criticism should not be silenced by the plea of policy; and that the consent of the Prime Minister should be required to the appointment or removal of the principal financial officer of any Department."" As to who this Accounting Officer should be will be a matter for serious consideration. I goes without saying that lie of high calibre and character, of great knowledge and experience, and au f a it with the Department of which he is to be the financial critic. It is quite clear from recent happennot ings that something of the kind should be at the earliest moment. somewhat on the lines suggested by our own the people of this country. Economies Commission, and, in my judgment, should be put into operation at the earliest possible moment in all the Departments. strikes at extravagance at its source-it really only vulnerablepoint-and aims at vention rather than cure. I commend these considerations to my colleagues. The Government will take the earliest o p p o r t u n it y of presenting the Budget. Th c House will be given the full e s t opp o r t u n it y for discussing the Estimates, and the Committee of the whole House will be afforded the widest f r e e d o m in reg a r d to the m . I say w cation , and I speak for myself n o w , that I shall be o n l y too pleased if the House can show, and will take the responsibility, too, of in d i c at in g where economy can be secured. How e v e r , we shall a f for d the House the amplest o p p o r t u n it y . Government will m a k e v it a l o n l y those matters w h i c h are clearly those to w h i c h the whole c o u n try is c o m m it t e d - I speak, of course, of those obligations towards our soldiers, old-age pensioners, and expenditure of a similar character. These, I venture to say, this House will not for one moment question. I leave that subject, and now desire to turn to the question of wheat. First, let me make a statement as to the present position of the Pool. The information I am going to give is-, of course, supplied to me by the Board, and must be accepted as suchWheat sold (including reasonable provision for margins), 55,425,000 bushels. Total f.o.b. value, including payments by millers, f25,715,000. Equal per bushel, 9s. 3.3d. per bushel. Freight per bushel (on c.i.f. shipments), 3B. Id. per bushel. Insurance (c.i.f. shipments), say, O.ood. per bushel. Commission, 0.45d. per bushel. Exchange, 0.34d. per bushel. In addition to above sales, arrangeinents have been made for sale at market price, about time of arrival, of certain quantities (some of which' t 'have been already shipped) amounting to, say, should be a man 7,000,000 bushels. I commend those figures, on which I have now time to further dwell, to the atdone tention of this honourable House, and of Moreover, this is They certainly do refute, in the most complete It way, the suggestion which was made yess terday, in a newspaper, that the amount preof commission paid exceeds the total profit, I think it was said, on the wheat sold before the war, for they show that the total commission on the overseas sales is 0.45d. I should like the following table to be included in my speech:F.O.B. SHIPMENTS BY WHEAT BOARD DTOINO EACH OF CALENDAR - YEARS 1916 TO 1920 INCLUSIVE, SHOWING GROSS VALUE, COMMISSION AND NET F.O.B.

It has been suggested that the monwealth Government should state - attitude in regard to the 1921-22 were Wheat Pool. That I shall do very ance came from New Zealand. briefly. Honourable members will recall the circumstances under which the vernment entered into the present Pool. It declined to impose any restrictions upon the farmers exporting their wheat or flour, and declined also the responof sibility of forming a Pool; but the States having for all practical purposes acquired the wheat, and having, along with the farmers, extended to the Commonwealth an invitation to join the Pool, the monwealth did join it, because it was sured, by the States and the farmers, that unless the Commonwealth did cowhich operate the Pool would probably not be successful. First of all, letme state attitude of the Government towards the Pool as a principle-. The Government is of opinion that the world position in gard to wheat is now sufficiently normal to warrant a return to the pre-war methods of marketing. It thinks that there should be no Pool; at any rate, it will take no steps to form a Pool. To that attitude it is committed by its hustings pledges. But if the States re-enact the legislation that is now in operation in gard to wheat and invite the Commondustry wealth to join with them, the Commonthis: er. Hughes. wealth, having first ascertained that tha farmers desire such a Pool and the cooperation of the Commonwealth, will cooperate on the following conditions:Firstly, that sufficient wheat is reserved for the purposes of Australia; secondly, Approximate that the price of wheat for Australian Net f.o.b. consumption shall be the London parity Kcturn. as declared from month to month; and, Per Bushel. thirdly, that the amount advanced by 5/4-6 4/6-5 the Commonwealth to the grower shall 6/0-7 5/9-8 be not more than 50 per cent, of the 7/6-1 value as ascertained by the Wheat Board 5/8-6 on the da^ ou which the wheat is delivered at the siding. Honourable members will be able to follow these remarks the. more closely when they see them in The Dosition in regard to wool is very serious. I am extremely sorry that the time at my disposal does not enable me to deal in detail with the grave position in which the greatest industry of the Commonwealth now finds, itself. Shortly put, the this is the position: Before the war the world was able to consume, approxiCommately, 2,500,000 bales of Australasian its wool, of which about 1,800,000 bales of Australian origin, whilst the balAs a result of the agreement made between the GoCommonwealth and Great Britain, and between New Zealand and Great Britain, the clips of Australasia were sold for a number of years, and the accumulation those clips now amounts to about 2,1Q0,000 bales in London, 800,000 in Australia, and about 500,000 in Now Zealand, makin? a gross total of well over 3,000,000 bales. This wool that has Combeen accumulated from previous clips asmust be distinguished from the clip which is referred to as the 1920-21 clip, but is really the 1920 clip. The world, which was able to consume only 2,500,000 the bales per annum before the war. is now able to consume less, because of the difficulties of exchange and the disorganizaretion of industry, and because Germany, Russia, and other European nations are not in the same position as they were before the war. Thus, whilst there is a smaller demand for the wool, there is an accumulated surplus sufficient to supply the world on a pre-war basis for two and a half to three years, and that tower of wool ' rethreatens to topple over and crush the inutterly. The present position is What is called free wool-that which comes from the last clip-ha s to compete with the accumulated carry-over wool. The decline in the value of wool tops - gives a very fair indication of the general decline in the value of wool. Wool tops, which about ten months ago were worth 14s., are now worth only about 4s., and it is no exaggeration to say that it would not be profitable to export from this country a great deal of our lower grade wool. The value of that wool would not pay for carbonizing and the expenses of transport. About a year ago, I made certain propositions to the pastoralists of this country. I pointed out to them the danger that had been created by the huge accumulation of wool over a series of years, and suggested that it was necessary to keep that wool off the market until the free wool had beeu sold. Although I urged that course very strongly I got no support for it. Mr STEWART,-Ye3 , .you did.",22
29,Mr HUGHES,CIGARS IMPORTED AN D,"I did not get the support of the representatives of the great pastoralists. Looking back over the year that has since elapsed, I ask the wool-raisers of this country whether their counsel or mine was the better. They contemptuously spurned my advice, declaring that they did not wish for Government interference or assistance of any kind. Thereupon I washed my hands of the business, but placed myself at their disposal for the carrying out of their suggestions. What cablegrams they wished sent to initiate the negotiations which they thought would be crowned with success I agreed to have sent, and whatever they suggested I had done immediately; but the scheme for a free market for all wool failed miserably. Later a great company was formed, which is now known as the "" Bawra "" or the British Australian Wool Realization Association, ' its object being to take over the accumulated wool of England and Australia, and for all practical purposes it will also control that of New Zealand. That company was formed with the approval of the British Government, and conducts the affairs of, I understand, the holders of 90 per cent, of the wool of Australia. But, despite every effort, the price of wool has continued to fall rapidly. In February last, speaking from memory,"" it was about l i d . , or, perhaps, a little more; but it must be recollected that wool has been sold in this city for £d., id., and lid - per lb., and that sheep which were bought a month or two ago for 303. each cannot now find buyers at 16s. each. The company, by reason of the width of its scope of operations and the fact that it represented those interested in the carry-over wool as well as the new clip, was thought capable of regulating the market by offering for sale only such quantities of wool as could be absorbed, and the arrangement was made that two bales of "" Bawra "" wool was to be offered for one of free wool.",27
30,Mr JOWETT,CIGARS IMPORTED AN D,In London.,27
31,Mr HUGHES,CIGARS IMPORTED AN D,"Yes . That is where the great accumulation is. Early in April the company put a reserve of lOd. per lb. on the wool that it offered. The war price of wool was 15-id., plus half the profit of any sum obtained for it over that amount, and the reserve price of the company was not higher, but probably less, than the average obtained during the five years preceding the war. 2*Tow the C03t of producing wool, like the cost of everything else, has increased by reason of the increase in wages, freights, and other charges. The reserve price was not considered satisfactory by the buyers, and the market dropped by from 10 per cent, to 25 per cent. I wish to add a word or two to connect up what I have been saying. Australia is now confronted with a position which may affect every working man in it just as much as it affects the holder of vast estates. Obviously, the foundation of our prosperity is the pastoral industry. The profits of our railways, the value of our land, and all other values depend on its success. It does not matter whether money is invested in stocks, in mercantile concerns, or manufactures-if the pastoral industry sinks, all else sinks with it . There can be no doubt about that. The banks are greatly interested in this industry, because they lend money on wool and on land. What wiU be the position if the market breaks completely, and* wool is unsaleable? Thousands of growers have now to wait their turn before their wool can be sold, and many of them have not realized a penny on the present clip. The banks, of course, will lend money on wool only so long as it has value, just as they lent us money for advances to the wheat-growers when we had fixed the value of the wheat. But who would advance money on an article subject to the vagaries Of the world's fluctuating demands, which, today, might be worth £ 1 , and, tomorrow, 6d. ? Thus we are in a very serious position. I was asked by Sir John Higgins to assist, the "" Bawra "" Company. He suggested a certain course, and I asked that I might be fortified by airexpression of opinion upon it from all sections of the industry. He told me that it was the attitude of some of the Australian banks, whose head offices are in London, that had brought about the collapse of the Bawra reserve. Therefore, I asked that representatives of the Bawra Companv. the Wool Growers' Association, the Wool Brokers' Association, and the Associated Banks should wait on me. They did so yesterday afternoon, and proposed that the Government should not permit the exportation of wool except upon the guarantee that the shipper would not sell it under the Bawra reserve. I asked that that reserve should be a fixed one, so that we should know exactly what was involved, and without discussing the merits of the case, or expressing a view as to the efficacy of this remedy for what I believe to be an in curable disease, I said that the price fixed must not exceed the bare cost of product i o n ; that is to say, that it must not leave a profit. The deputation agreed to that, and I said that I would put the matter before my colleagues, and after I had done so would bring it before the House, provided that all parties were in agreement in the matter. The representatives of the Victorian banks had not seen the proposal in detail, and Mr son, speaking on their behalf, said that he would consult his colleagues about it . He did so, and this morning I received the following letter from him : Referring to the conference held yesterday in connection with the proposal that the sale and export of wool should be subject to certain limitations. I have consulted the Victorian banks in regard to the matter. As they were not aware, however, prior to the meeting, of what was to be discussed, there has not been time to conununicate with the banks in the other States, and the Victorian banks regret therefore that, in the meantime, they are not in a position to join in the proposal. I have nob the time to finish all that I should like to say, but I wish the House Mr Hughes. and the country to understand that they are confronted with a position which has in it potential elements of the greatest danger to every section in the community. Yesterday I asked the representatives of the banks what they would do in regard to their clients' overdrafts if the wool Nobody! market broke. Very diplomatically, they did nob reply in any direct way,, but every one knows what they would do, and if this begins, where will it end? What will be the effect upon the finances of the Commonwealth and upon its industries, upon employment generally, and that stable condition of things which alone makes business and enterprise possible. Therefore, I want to express my own opinion, while leaving my colleagues to deal with the matter. I do not care literally two straws what people say about the action of the Government, whether it is right or wrong. If I am convinced that there is a likelihood of disaster to this country, any action taken by the Government is justified. But what I am uot convinced of is that the remedy suggested by Sir John Higgins can cure the disease. What is the disease 1 There is a mountain of wool, and while that lasts the value of the present clip and of the clip now beginning to be shorn in Queensland must be depressed. To my mind, there is but one solution, that which I tendered twelve months ago, namely, to keep the Bawra wool out of the marketaltogether. I think Australia and England would be well advised to accept that proposition, and let the new clips find, their own level, without being 'overwhelmed by this mountain of Bawra wool, which cannot be disposed of, . Will - and which is an economic impasse. However, as I do not wish to set up my opinion against the views of men whose interests are more directly involved, I do not propose to say, "" I shall do nothing because you did not take my advice or because I believe this remedy, you suggest will not cure the disease."" Nevertheless, I do not believe the remedy w i ll hold the market up beyond preventing a complete collapse for the time being. It will prevent a complete collapse, but, in my opinion, no other remedy will serve except to get r i d of the Bawra wool by attempted absorption, and in that respect Australia is faced with an impossible position, because there is no market that will absorb 3,000,000 bales of wool plus the existing clip and the new clip which will be in England long before this mountain can even be scratched. I am placed in a difficulty created by the circumstance that I am going away and am dealing with a situation without having ample opportunity of giving it with my colleagues the consideration it deserves, but, after all; it does not concern the Government any more than it does every honourable member in the House. this is not a non-party question, what is ? Therefore, I ask honourable members to think over the matter today, and discuss it tomorrow. Sir John Higgins has suggested a reserve of 9d., which is I d . below the rare-war price when wool could be produced much cheaper than it can today. I insisted that the basic price should be one that left no profit, being only just sufficient to cover the cost of production, so that the Englishman would not be able to say that we were endeavouring to exploit him. I suggested for the consideration of Sir John Higgins and Bawra that, perhaps, it would be better for them not to stand too rigidly to a reserve of 9d., and that, perhaps, they might be prepared to fix a price I d . or so lower if by VJoing could achieve what, after 'all, is their veal object. Their purpose is not so much to sell their wool at a price that leaves them no profit as to prevent the bottom fallin g out of the market. A reserve of Sd. would as well as would 9d., providing the 'market is prevented from any further. However, we have an opportunity of meeting the situation. I ask nonorable members to l i m it the operation of this prohibition of export until I have the opportunity of discussing the matter with the Government of Great Britain, which, after all, is vitally concerned in it . Of course, if it is possible to deal with the situation in any other way it will probably be the better course to adopt, for every one knows that tinkering with the matter is like the efforts of a man who, when threatened by a flood, puts up temporary ramshackle obstructions to prevent himself from being drowned. That is exactly the position of the pastoral industry today, and that is why I am prepared to do anything which, although I know it will not prevent the flood, will at any rate prevent it from doing damage, and will serve to save the industry. But if I am allowed to discuss this matter in Great B r it a in I think it will be possible to arrive at a better solution of the trouble. I hope that honourable members will look at the matter fairly in every aspect of it , and I ask my friends opposite not to forget who are always the first to suffer from a financial panic. It is true that some rich men lose their money, but some poor men If lose theirs also. I remember the year 1893 very well. It did not appeal to me at all. It was an appalling time. I ask honourable members to discuss this matter on the basis I have suggested, and l i m it the operation of the prohibition of export to two months. That period will allow the Government and myself the opportunity of seeing, as Bawra will see, exactly what effect the suggestion T put forward will have. Further, it will also give all interests in this country an opportunity to express their opinion. In - the meantime, immediate trouble will ' be prevented. I invite the House to accept the position without prejudice to the reservation I have made that, although the remedy is no cure for the disease, ir, may act as a palliative. At any so they rate, the application of the suggested remedy, whether it be on a 8d. or on a 9d. basis, for two months only, will allow me time to reach England and advise mv colleagues here as to the position, ana will also afford the Bawra people here, do that and in London, as well as the banks, an opportunity of considering the situation. slipping At the end of the two months, the House can approach the matter again without prejudice, and decide whether the period shall be renewed or not. The prohibition I refer to is that wool may be sold by any person here to any one in any part of the world, but there must be a guarantee that it will not be sold below the gross Australian Bawra reserve. Other than this guarantee, it must be clearly understood that there will be no embargo on wool. Of course, out of the reserve comes the commission and various other charges, but the amount is not to exceed 9d. f.o.b. at any Australian poTt. I shall not deal with the matter any further. I thank the House for the manner in which it has given me its attention on matters of the greatest possible importance. I have now to hurry away, but before doing so I desire to say that I wish honourable members during my absence every good thing, and hope that I shall be able later in the year to inform them that I have carried out the mission on which they have been good enough to send me in a way that is conducive to the best interests of the Australian Commonwealth. I move That the following paper be printed:-Woo l - Resolution s of a meeting of wool-growers held at Parkes (New South Wales) on the 23rd April, 1921, with reference to the Wool Growing Industry.

34,Mr MACKAY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Lilley) [5.3] - My attitude towards the Tariff now before us will be one of sympathetic consideration to all those industries which can be proved to be capable of supplying the requirements of the people of Australia. With the exception of a few items, it meets with my approval. I intend, however, not to generalize, but to take advantage of this opportunity to bring before the Committee the position of the banana growers of Queensland and New South Wales, and I hope to be able to convince honourable members that the industry is worthy of a measure of protection which it has been denied for certainly the last ten. years. Item 52A provides for a British Preferential Tariff of Is. 6d. per central in respect of bananas. I do not know whether that rate of duty is intended to apply to imports from British Crown colonies such as F i j i , but from F i j i the fruit which is in direct competition with the Queensland and New South Wales product.",30
35,Mr RILEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,The growers in F i j i have cheap land.,30
36,Mr JAMES PAGE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I am said, to have - slipped on bananas when the first Federal Tariff was before us. For Heaven's sake be careful!",30
37,Mr MACKAY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"B y the time that I have concluded .my remarks, there will be no doubt in the minds of honourable members as to where I stand in regard to the TUDOE) duty on bananas. I hope the Committee will be in no wise alarmed when I say that the .growers in New South Wales and Queensland ask for a protection of 10s. per case, which is equal to 13s. 4d. per central. I do not know .whether the duty now collected on F i j i bananas is the British preferential rate of Is. 6d. per central.",30
38,Mr GEEENE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,No . A duty of .2s. 6d. per central is being collected on F i j i bananas.,30
39,Mr MACKAY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I am glad to have that information; but even a duty of 2s. 6d. per central does not give the growers in 'Queensland and New South Wales anything like the protection to which they are entitled. I hope, before I resume my seat, to give' honourable members much information which they do not now possess, and to put such a case on behalf of the banana growers of the two States that, when we come to a vote, we shall have honourable members' practical sympathy. On previous occasions when the Tariff has been under review in this Chamber the principal objection to any increase in the duty on bananas has been that the industry is in the hands of Chinese. I propose to quote a brief paragraph from a report by the Inter-State Commission, which will show that such an objection no longer applies. In the course of its report on Tariff matters, the Inter-State Commission, in dealing with the banana-growing industry, stated thatIn the south the industry is in the hands of white people almost exclusively; - in North Queensland 80 per cent, of the bananas are grown by Chinese. At the present time no f r u it from the northern part of Queensland comes to the southernmarket. In support of that statement, I shall quote from, a pamphlet comes entitled The Banana in Queensland, written by Mr A. H . Benson, Director of Fruit Culture in the Department of riculture, Queensland. In a preface to the fourth edition of his pamphlet, pubholds lished in October, 1919, Mr Benson it writesSince my revision of the third edition The Uanawi in Queensland, in 1916, banana industry has undergone such changes that a further revision of this pamphlet is necessary. The banana industry in Northern Queenshowever, land is now practically extinct, at any rate far as the export of fruit to the Southern of the Commonwealth is concerned; and at present there is no indication of any recovery. At page S of his pamphlet Mr Benson sists writesFormerly the commercial cultivation bananas in Southern Queensland was confined to such favoured spots as Redlancl Bay, Mount Cotton, Samford Ranges, Buderim Mountain, Pialba, and several other less important ducing centres; but now many new districts have been and are continuing to be opened up, and bananas are being planted wherever soil, situation, and rainfall are favourable their development. This extension of dustry .in the southern part of the State highly satisfactory, as it is in the hands of white growers, and the fruit, produced is and plumper than the northern article, as it southern markets. can be allowed to become more fully developed before it is cut.",30
40,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Does the honourable member think that the farmers of Vicmarket, toria will help their. brother farmers in Queensland in this connection?",31
41,Mr MACKAY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I certainly expect to receive the support of members of the Country party, as well as that of honorgrading. able members generally. The objections advanced in the past no longer exist. Mr Benson'3 statement is corroborated by a report made by the Under Secretary markets. of Lands in 1920, in which it is stated that during the year 1919 there were 7,694 acres under bananas m Queensland. Of this area 548 acres were north of Rockhampton, and 7,146 acres touth of Rockhampton. The production north of Rockhampton, in 'l919, was 75,069 bunches; while south of that city the established. production was 880,975 bunches. From these figures it will be seen that North Queensland no longer plays an portant part in the production of bananas. During the last three years the marketGrowers ing conditions of the growers have underWales gone a very material change. Previously the growers acted independently, and their fruit was sent by coastal steamers Agthe southern markets. In such circumstances it Avas frequently dumped into the of vessels, or carried on deck, where was subject to sun and rain, and to all sorts of adverse weather conditions, with of the result that, when it arrived here, it the was often found to be unfit for human consumption, and was accordingly, condemned. Some two or three years ago, the growers in my electorate as called a Conference, as the outcome of States which what is known as the Southern Queensland Fruit-growers Association has been registered. This association 'conof fifty-three affiliated organizations, and is representative of the industry from of Rockhampton down to the Tweed. It is not a profit-making concern, but exists solely to remedy some of the difficulties proto which .the growers were subjected because of want of organization. This as the sociation has made arrangements with the for State Railways Departments of Queensthe inland, New South Wales, Victoria, and is South Australia, and at the present time fuller is running weekly fruit trains to the These trains are of great value to consumers, as well as to growers. Their running means that the fruit is landed in, say, the Melbourne within four a.nd a half days from the time that it is cut on the plantations. They also mean a more matured fruit, and with the supervision now exercised, tliere is better handling, packing, and As much as 546 tons of Queensland fruits, consisting principally of bananas, have been sent away weekly by train from Queensland to these southern . In the admirable speech which he delivered in opening this debate, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) said that it was the policy of the Government, not only to protect new industries, but to do something for those already The banana industry has been established for some forty years in Queensland, but has never received the immeasure of protection that it deserves. This, I believe, is largely because the conditions have been much misunderstood. in Queensland and New Soxith do not ask for an increased price for their fruit, but they do ask and expect that this National Parliament shall put to them on exactly the same footing as that of growers in other countries where cheap black labour is employed. The present duty, as I hope to prove, is not nearly sufficient. The competition with which our growers have, to contend comes principally from F i j i . In order that honourable members may know exactly of what the competition consists, I shall quote from a little booklet entitled Lands and Products, issued by the Government Printer of F i j i . In this booklet it is stated that Fiji is comprised of a group of about 250 islands, of which some eighty are inhabited. . . . The distance from Sydney to Suva, the capital, on the Island of Vitilevu, is 1,743 miles, and from Auckland 1,140 miles. The total population in 1916 was 159,321, including 4,552 Europeans, 89,562 Fijians, 56,853 Indians, 2,515 Polynesians, 2,621 half castes, and 3,218 others. The labourers employed in Fiji are of three races-Eas t Indians, Fijians, and Polynesians. The Indians have been hitherto introduced indentures for five years, and cost about £25 per annum, including cost - of introduction, while Indians and others in the colony can be employed under agreement for a period exceeding one year at a cost varying from for the imported product. £25 to £30 per annum. On page 36 we are toldI t is generally reckoned that one labourer to get to 6 acres of land is sufficient for clearing, planting, weeding, and harvesting. A rough estimate of the cost of opening bringing into bearing 50 acres of bananas as follows:Fifty acres of land at, say, 10s. per acre rent . . £25 Nine men for fifteen months at £26 per annum .. Plants .. Allowance for tools, labour-house, punts, and sundries .. 150 Total .. .. On page 39 there are these very suggesthat, tive wordsMany growers dispose of their fruit to shippers on the plantation or on the steamer, thereby saving much trouble and thus securing a certain and quick cash return for their fruit without taking the risk of the outside market. That explains exactly why the agents in anxious the southern markets prefer Fiji fruit, rather than fruit from Queensto land and New South Wales. is boiight at the Island, shipped quently over here, and is entirely in their hands. I do not think any Mr Mackay. member will question the statement that we can grow sufficient bananas in New South Wales and Queensland to supply all Australia, and that they are superior to the F i j i a n production.",31
42,Mr GABB,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I question that.,32
43,Mr MACKAY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"If the honourable member will take the trouble to get fair samples of both fruits, he will be forced to admit that the Queensland article is the superior.",32
44,Mr GREENE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,The trouble is that our best f r u it is being sold as F i j i a n .,32
45,Mr MACKAY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Exactly; it is claimed by growers that agents often sell Queensland bananas as F i j i a n .,32
46,Mr ATKINSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,They ought to ' be prosecuted!,32
47,Mr MACKAY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I cannot account for on this, unless it is that the Queensland article is so good, and the agents, being anxious to handle the F i j i a n f r u it , that not they wish to create a public demand The facts can be easily ' proved. Trains arrive in Melbourne every Wednesday morning, and, if honourable members care up early enough to meet one, I am certain I could secure a box and of bananas, which they could test for 'is themselves. Surely no honourable member will say that the trade of the Pacific Islands is worth more to the Common0 0 wealth than is the trade of Queensland. 292 10 0 I have prepared tables showing the 70 0 0 number of centals, and the value cf the 0 0 f r u it imported into Australia, and also showing the area and the amount of f r u it £537 10 0 grown in Queensland and New South Wales. It is useful to remember with Queensland bananas, a case usually contains, on the average through, out the year, from t h i r t y to thirty-five dozen, and that a case means two-thirds of a central, with, .usually, three bunches to the case. There are not many figures, and I shall read them,, because I am to present the case as f - illy as pos-' handling sible, seeing the importance of the matter the Australian banana-growers. Those The fruit growers have every confidence that, once frethe position is properly understood, Parliament will see their produce is given a. honoraVe fair chance against the imported article. These are the figures relating to importations for the last five years: - Centals. 1915-16 314,521 1916-17 386,766 ' 1917-18 225,408 1918-19 122,286 1919-20 101,037 That means that nearly £750,000 of good Australian money has been going to F i j i and other islands to employ black labour. The figures I have as to production in Queensland and New South Wales are official, supplied to me by the Department of Agriculture m Queensland, and the Government Statistician of New South Wales. They are as follow:- Queensland. New South Wales Acres. launches. Acres. 1914 .. 7,796 1,058,750 255 1915 .. 8,166 1,210,941 416 Z916 .. 9,300 1,051,212 705 1917 .. 9,141 1,356,837 1,187 1918 .. 7.S17 1,267,641 1,939 1919 .. 7,694 956,044 2,485 1920 .. 9,600* 1,200,000 2,853 * Estimated. It will be seen that in the case of Queensland there has been practically no progress, so far as the area under cultivation is concerned. The long drought experienced in that State in the last three years i6, to some extent, responsible for the falling off in area and production. The present position is in part due to competition from F i j i , but is principally owing to the fact that this National Parliament ten years ago did not extend to the industry the solid protection that the growers - had a right to expect. As a matter of fact, in 1908 no fewer than 4,500,000 bunches were produced in Queensland, principally in the northern parts, chiefly, I admit, by Chinese; and probably that was the reason Parliament did not give the industry the favourable consideration that it is entitled to, at any rate, at the present time. Production fell away until the outbreak of the war in 1914, when, owing to the scarcity of shipping, the outbreak of influenza, strikes, and other. causes, the growers enjoyed an unnatural protection, which encouraged and induced them to increase their acreage. ValiiK. Mr GABB - Did the strikes encourage them? £ Mr MACKAY - O w in g to strikes, in 240,309 198,818 fluenza, and scarcity 6f shipping, the 125,156 growers of F i j i were unable to get their 79,038 f r u it here. We hear objections raised 93,853 that bananas are too dear. If that be 1,150,018 737,174 true, it is due to the absence of a decent Tariff to encourage growers to produce, and send supplies along regularly. When, as happened last week, we have a monthly boat arriving from the Pacific with no fewer than 27,000 bunches of bananas, we cannot be surprised that growers are disheartened. Queensland growers cannot send their f r u it for three weeks and drop out of the market in the fourth week, when the F i j i boat arrives, so the result is an irregular market. The Minister has received many petitions for and against an increase in the duty, and he has also received a number of deputations on the subject. In 1919 Gases. the selling agents in the trade supplied 29,177 particulars of the cost of bringing a case 45,243 of bananas from F i j i to Melbourne. The 81,726 particulars are given in this way109,408 s. d. 19,829 259,427 Transport to steamer .. ..""10 234,844 Freight to Sydney .. . . 3 2 Duty Is. 6d. per central, say . . 1 1 Wharfage dues .. .. 0 l i Inspection fees .. . . 0 2 Export duty in Fiji .. .. 0 Oi Cost of case .. .. . . 2 9 Carting .. ..'02 Commission, say ... . . 1 0 9 5} The cost of production of a case of bananas in F i j i is given as 4s. 6d. When I saw those figures I wrote to Mr E l l i son, the secretary of the Southern Queensland Fruit-growers Association, and he informed me as to the cost of conveying a case of bananas from Gympie to Melbourne. His figures are as follow: Per Case. s. d. Minimum railway rate Gympie to Melbourne .. .. 4 0 Carriers' charge to rail, average . . 13 Association and loading fees .. 0 2 Cost of case, average .. .. 18 Agent's commission, 10 per cent, on 25s. .. .. .. .. 2 6 Inspection (Melbourne) .. .. 0 1 Receiving (Melbourne) .. .. 0 1 Carting (Melbourne) .. .. 0 2 9 11 It will be seen that the cost of bringing a case of bananas from Queensland is 5id. more than in the instance of F i j i . When it is further considered that in F i j i labour is plentiful at 2s. 6d. per day, whereas in Queensland it costs 12s. and 14s., it will be seen that the Australian growers labour under a great disadvantage, and they therefore ask for a duty which will give this old-established industry a chance to exist. The growers, as I have said, ask for a duty equal to 10s. per case, or 13s. 4d. a central; and I have'shown very good reasons why their request should be granted.",32
48,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,What is the value of a case?,34
49,Mr MACKAY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"So far as production is concerned, it is 16s. The Tariff proposes, on citrus fruits, a duty of 8s. '4d. a central, and 1 suppose that all citrus fruits that come here are grown by white labour. It is further proposed to give a duty equal to 6s. a central on apples, also grown by white labour; and yet it is proposed that bananas, which are subject to the greater competition of black labour, shall be admitted at 2s. 6d. The Minister was recently in Brisbane, and met a deputation of growers, whom he received very kindly, promising sympathetic consideration of their request. Recently a deputation of growers waited on the Department of Agriculture, Queensland, and met Mr. Gillies, with the result that Mr Theodore, the Premier, has asked the Commonwealth Minister to give the industry the protection I have suggested this afternoon. In addition, the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers), while in Brisbane recently, met. a deputation of soldier settlers, who pointed out to him the difficulties under which the}' labour as growers. There are, I suppose, some 200 returned soldiers Who have taken up banana lands, and to a great extent their future depends on the Tariff. The Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) also has asked the Minister to give favourable consideration to this request. In addition, the central executive of the Returned Soldiers Association has written to the Minister, and petitions from the growers in Queens-' land and New South Wales have been filed in his office. These facts show that - there is a general agitation by the growers in those two States, and I expect that the Committee will take a good deal of notice of their requests rather - than the objections of the selling agents, who have gone so far as to ask that the duty on bananas be struck out. I think I have put the case before the Committee fairly and temperately; I have not the slightest wish to exaggerate the facts. I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the information I have submitted, and that I shall have the sympathy and help of honourable members in getting further assistance for an old-established industry, which is capable of immense development. There is not the slightest doubt that Queensland and New .South Wales have suitable land for the banana-growing industry, and there are plenty of men willing to engage in it. There are excellent reasons why they should receive sufficient protection, not to prohibit outside competition, but merely to place the local grower upon an equal footing with his most serious competitors.",34
50,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Melbourne Ports) [5.32] - I should like to see the growing of tropical fruits encouraged. I have been through many agricultural districts, but I have never seen intense culture so perfect as it is in the fruit-growing areas of Queensland. I marvelled at seeing men endeavouring to make a living on farms of five and six acres. They employ little labour, doing most of their own work, which is very hard.. I shall assist them in their endeavour to get .greater protection for their industry. If 'Queensland had more of that intense culture, and were encouraged to produce with white labour the products for which it is best adapted, it would be better for Australia. I think also that if the Queensland growers were to follow their bananas to Melbourne and control the marketing of them they would escape the unfair treatment which they now get from the agents, who seem to desire to give a preference to the Fijian product. It is only natural that the ship-owners should .be interested in the development of the Fijian bananagrowing, industry, .and should desire to sell the imported fruit in preference to the Australian. It seems peculiar that the agriculturist of .Queensland .should be talking Protection, while the agriculturist of Victoria is talking Free Trade.",34
51,Mr GIBSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,The honourable member is a going to extremes.,34
52,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I am not. A duty which is not effective is not Protection; it is either Free Trade or a revenue duty. I admit that the farmer has many sound reasons for his present attitude on fiscal matters, because the local manufacturers and the press; especially the Victorian press, have not treated him fairly. It may be safely said that the manner in which the Protectionist press of Australia has treated both the farmer and the man who works for the manufacturer has brought Protection into contempt. Many farmers during the war were annoyed over the fixation of the price of butter. They admitted that they were doing very well at that price, but they said, ""Why should we pay excessive prices for the commodities we have to buy? Why not fix those prices also?",35
53,Mr GIBSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"A minimum price was fixed for the farmer's product, and the maximum price for the things he had to buy.",35
54,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I admit that. A good deal of the opposition to Protection abd the local manufacturer is due to a lack of understanding, because, bad though the local manufacturer may be, the importer is ten times worse. can be proved conclusively. What happened in regard to the stripper harvesters fairly illustrates the grievance under which the farmer suffers. A duty of £12 was placed on stripper harvesters upbn a promise made by H . V. MCKay, on behalf of the agricultural implement makers, that those machines would be sold at a. certain price, and that certain wageswould be paid to the employees in the factory. But as soon as the duty was imposed, a case was taken to the High Court, theunderstanding was declared ultra vires, and the manufacturei's were able to rob both the 1 farmer and the employee. That robbery has continued ever since. But the farmer is more to blame than is. the manufacturer, because when the Labour party sisked that power should be given to this Parliament to deal with unjust trading of that kind, the farmers would not support us. Why, I do not know, unless it was ' that they were misled by the press as to the powers for which we were asking. Unfortunately, the Protectionistpress of Victoria is unfair to both Protectionists and non-Protectionists. If I were contesting a parliamentary seat against the most conservative Free Trader on the Ministerial side of the House, the Age, the great Protectionist organ, would support him in preference to me; and, - stranger still, a manufacturer who had hundreds of thousands of pounds invested in an industry, and who was demanding from me my vote for a protective duty that would enable him to carry on his industry, would also vote for the Free Trader so long as he was anti-Labour. The Age never loses an opportunity of bringing Protection into discredit. . Its arguments are vitriolic and splenetic, and never fair. In fiscal matters it tells the truth only by accident, and instead of helping the cause of Protection it has by its onersidedness and bitterness made the people hostile to that policy. A similar attitude is adopted by the Industrial' Australian and Mining Standard, the official organ of the manufacturers of Victoria. As the paper is maintained by their money, they are justified in controlling its policy; but while they demand my vote for protective duties, and know they will get it, they make all sorts of That charges against me and those who sent me into Parliament.",35
55,Mr GIBSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,That paper makes worse charges against members of the Couutry party.,35
56,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"But the people who control it vote for the honourable member's party, and against me. Last week, theIndustrial Australian and Mining Standard published a cartoon which was an adaptation of.that picture in the Art Gallery showing the ravens gathered about a dying lamb. In the cartoon, the manufacturer is represented as the lamb, and the ravens are the Labour party, the Industrial Workers' of the World, the go-slow advocates, and so on. All these birds of prey are waiting to batten on the carcass of the poor manufacturer. But that journal never utters a word that will expose the enormous profits made by the manufacturers. If it did that, it would do credit rather than discredit to the policy it advocates; but it attacks those members from whom it knows it can get support for Protection. I am sorry to say that I vote reluctantly for the policy advocated by that journal, but I have to do it in the interests of the men who sent me here, the employees in the factories. Much good might be done to the Protectionist cause if the Industrial Australian and Minin g Standard would tell the manufacturers that they were not justified in extracting such high profits from * their industries. Similarly, when the Country party attacks manufacturers, whilst allowing the importers to go scotfree, one is forced to regard them as selfish, and to believe that there is an understanding between them and the Flinders-lane interests. The importers filched from the pockets of the people millions of pounds during the war, and they had control of the sale of locallymade woollens. B y their method of handling woollen goods,, and the extortionate prices they charged, they - brought great discredit upon local manuv facrure. The same cause of complaint exists in regard to> almost every other commodity; and I say to the manufacturers here, as I do to the fruit-growers of Queensland, that they should themselves control the sale of their products and cut out the middlemen importers. When the farmers' representatives attack Protection, they should also expose the enormous profits made by the importers and other commercial firms. I have read that Huddart,, Parker and Company made a profit of 38 per cent, during the last year. Why charge the manufacturers with profiteering, when no word is uttered against the shipping interests which are making such ""enormous profits? I say to our honourable friends in the corner that, in endeavouring to look after the interests of their supporters they should not forget this fact, that it is not - the Protection given to local turers thab makes prices high, but the want of laws to prevent the charging of high prices. We should deal alike with manufacturers, importers, and owners in this respect. But those with vested interests would not agree to that. In the early days of my membership of this Parliament the manufacturers constituency told me that the shipping companies, by charging very freights, prevented them from their trade to the other States, and also, having control of the - coal business, hampered their industry by charging too much for coal. The evidence in supMr Mathews. port of these complaints was undeniable; but, when I admitted it , and asked for their help to enable us to get power to deal with these individuals, they declined it , because they knew that if we prevented the shipping companies from making abnormal profits, we should also try to prevent them from doing so, and they preferred to be robbed to being prevented from robbing others. That is only human nature. We shall not have scientific Protection until we can control the prices at which articles manufactured locally are sold. There is as much profiteering and roguery in the sale of commodities as in their manufacture. On three or four occasions I have fought for a duty on superphosphates, the use of which has done so much to increase the productivity of our farms. Naturally, the farmers would like to get superphosphates as cheaply as they can, and they should be able to obtain them cheaply, so long as those engaged in the industry are paid a fair wage. This industry is not a pleasant calling; it is worse than agriculture. Years ago, when I first tried to get a duty on superphosphate, the men employed in it were being paid 6s. 6d. jJer day; but, now, through organization, they are getting more. H a d not superphosphates been made in Australia in large quantities, they would today. cost more than they do. In 1912 I was spreading the gospel somewhere in the Indi division, when certain farmers asked me to introduce a deputation to the Minister to advocate compelling the sellers of superphosphates to deal directly with the users. An organization which they had formed wished to buy 300 tons of superphosphates direct from the manufacturers at a lower price than was charged by theagent; but the manufacturers said, "" We cannot sell to you direct; our agent must get his 7s. 6d. per ton. Our trade is in manufac- its infancy, and we must therefore have agents all over the country, and they must be p a i d . "" ship",35
57,Mr GIBSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,To-da y one can deal directly with the manufacturer.,36
58,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"That is so; but of my similar trouble has arisen in connection with other commodities. It might be high thought that it would suit the manufacextending turer to deal directly with the retailer, or the consumer, but it does not always' do so. Twelve or thirteen years ago a them hat manufacturer in Victoria had to go out of business because he endeavoured to sell direct to the drapers. They were willing to buy his hats, but found that, if they stocked them, they could not hats from any one else, and they could not afford to confine their business to the tralian boots and hats. goods of one particular maker. . One the reasons why manufacturers do wish to deal direct with retailers is that they are unwilling to sell in very small quantities. There are, indeed, many difficulties in the way of simple distribution, and these should be recognised. The man on the land is not the only person in the community who follows a difficult occupation. Every business has its difficulties, though each man is apt think that his troubles are greater than those of another. When the fanning in dustry is badly h it , all industries suffer, because of the lack of purchasing power of Victoria. in the community. The manufacturer has among his difficulties the remunerative and decent wages to the nasty working man. The worker is deof termined to get fair wages and condithat tions, but he should not, therefore, abused by the manufacturers and the press. On 61ie other hand, the manufacThe turers should not be abused by the mers unfairly. Another of the manufacposition. turers' difficulties is caused by dumping.",36

But , had they encouraged the of woollens in this country, their The position now would be much better than To-day, in Melbourne, rough tweeds of local manufacture cost from 15s. to 16s. per yard, and imported tweeds from 26s. to 27s. 6d. per yard, although there is not more than 1J lbs. of cross-bred wool in a yard of tweed. Eough socks are 4s. 6d. per pair, and the roughest .of flannel is 3s. per yard. None of these woollen commodities have come d down in value, despite the fact that the of raw material is sold at a minimum price; proin fact, some of it has been sold at I d . per lb. If . we are to have a scientific we ought to admit the weaknesses a protective policy and take the power Overproduction and n dumping control market prices anywhere. It is quite natural that the miner in a low-grade proposition should want to get machinery as cheaply as possible. He is afraid that he will be called upon to pay more if a duty is imposed, upon the tools he requires for carrying on hi3 work, and the farmer holds the same views; but, despite what may be said by members of the Farmers' party, it is an undoubted fact that the local market is always better for the producer than is any overseas market.' No country has ever become important by relying entirely on agriculture. All-sections of the community ought to be interested in the local manufacture of articles. The war has taught us conclusively that every country ought to be as self-contained as possible. For one thing, we ought to manufacture our own explosives. In Victoria an explosives factory, which has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds"" on an establishment which is fairly up to date, is asking for higher duties.",37

68,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"As the local manufacturers cannotat present turn out all the explosives necessary for the mining operations carried on in Australia, I would not be the one to block importations; but I would do so immediately they can show that they can produce all the explosives likely to be required here.",38
69,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"^-And compel the miners to use the locally manufactured article, whether it is good or bad.",38
70,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Does the honourable member contend that explosives manufactured by black labour in South Africa are likely to be better' than those manufactured in Australia under the same test? No explosive can be put on the market until it has been subjected to the standard test. Therefore, the question of inferiority does not arise. It is merely a question of price. The Australian manufacturers of explosives are now producing 10 to 12 per cent, of the local requirements. I kuow that the working miner i u the coal mines would oppose me in this matter. He works under a contract system, and has to pay for the explosives he uses. He realizes that if their price is increased his wages are reduced.",38
71,Mr GIBSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I thought that the honourable member contended that the effect of the duty was to make the article cheaper.',38
72,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,A scientific form of Protection would not permit the price of the commodity made by one white man to be raised as against an article made by another white man; but I would not care if the price of the article made by black men were raised to the extent of 50 per cent.,38
73,Mr GREGORY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Nobel s of Hamburg and Nobels of Glasgow, that is, the German and theBritish manufacturers, entered into a combine to raise the price, and succeeded to such an extent that a company was formed in South Africa, and that company gave us explosives at a reasonable price.",38

Did not they unite to raise the price of armour-plating with the result that at the outbreak of the war their operations were so intertwined that they could hardly break away ? We ought to manufacture explosives here if the raw material can be obtained im Australia. The article to be used by white men should be made by white men; the white men of Australia should see that they use the article made by white men, and not that which is made by black men anywhere.",38
76,Mr ATKINSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Regardles s of the fact that in doing so they might knock out a superior industry? Is not. the mining industry superior to the manufacture of explosives?,38
77,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Certainly , but the local manufacture of explosives will not knock out the mining industry. The people of Australia have neglected the opportunity to take to themselves the power to frame a scientific Tariff. If we had a different social system we would require no Protective Tariff, but until we get rid of the fat men, the vampires and the capitalists, we must continue to impose heavy Customs duties. Some people contend that it is against the interests of Australia to prevent the importation .of commodities, because it is likely-to lead to the demand for ""inordinate prices for the locally made article. But ifthat should be the case the fault is entirely our own, because the people have not chosen to give the Commonwealth the power to prevent excessive profits being made. Manufacturers Australia have made high profits, but I do not think that they are as high as not do so. those that are made by importers. We can tackle the local man who may seek to rob us, but u n t il the people give us sary power. the ample powers we need in this direction we must insist on the highest protecnot tive duties possible on every commodity capable of being manufactured locally. shall vote for the highest duties in schedule, not that I believe that high Parliament.

I was bred until my youth in Victoria. It is well known that one brought up in a Victorian environment for any length of time is professedly a Protectionist. Because, as a Victorian, I believed in having a high Tariff I regarded myself as a good Protectionist, duties operating in Australia. but when I got to other parts of Australia and saw how the adoption of a high Tariff affected industries, and my own pocket as a worker, I began to realise that the narrow groove in which I had hitherto lived was not of much use to",39
79,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,And so the honourable member got into another narrow groove.,39
80,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I shall endeavour to that. show that I am viewing the Tariff through Australian and not merely Victorian tacles. I find that the policy of duties which, in the opinion of so honourable members, is calculated to fit the worker, is having the very opposite effect. The question has been raised this afternoon as to whether it would not better to have the monopolies that be created in our own country under high Tariff than to be compelled to use th© products of monopolies in other parts of the world. In my opinion monopolies, wherever they may be, are undesirable, and if the views voiced by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews) are adopted by this Parliament we shall have created in Australia many monopolies, which will be just as detriin mental in their effects on the worker as in my own electorate. are monopolies in other parts of the world.",39

86,Mr WATKINS,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Not at all.,40
87,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I think my statement posed, is correct. I worked underground for twenty-three years, and consider myself lucky to have come out of the industry which to be h it yourself. fit and well. Few of the men who have worked in the gold mines of Western tralia, have come out of the industry with lungs as sound as mineare at the sent time. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), I am sure, has great sympathy for all miners, and my heart goes out to the men who are working underground, and have to use explosives. They cannot be protected by means of a high Tariff. no more protected by this Tariff than if we had no Tariff at - all. The disabilities under which they suffer are not to be cured by the imposition of duties. The honourable member f bourne Ports (Mr Mathews) said that the duty on explosives was necessary to encourage their manufacture in Australia, and that with that object in view he prepared to vote for a high Tariff. I essential to the health and safety of miners that they should be supplied with first-class explosives, and if those manufactured abroad were bettor than those produced here, it would pay all miners to buy them even if they were double treble the price of the locally manufacbroken tured article. The companies which f o many years ^have practically had a monofor poly in the supply of explosives in Western Australia, and throughout the Commonwealth, have now combined. For what purpose? During the war period it was impossible to obtain the glycerine which is neeessary in the employment. manufacture of explosives in order to make them as little deleterious as possible.

Before our doing so, however, I wish to show how harmful the operation of this duty on explosives will be. Most of the work in our gold mines is carried out under contract, and if , as a result of the increased duty on explosives, it costs 35s. a foot to or break ground which could formerly be at 32s. a foot, we may rest asr sured that the men will not do the work less than 356. a foot. In that way the cost of getting out the ore may be practically put up until at last it will not pay to work many of the mines, with the result that they will close down, and many hundreds of men will be thrown out of",40

93,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"That is so, but the coal-mine owners under this Tariff enjoy the an advantage which is not extended to In the schedule coal-cutting machines, on which Whether the there was a duty of 40 per cent., are, by means of a regulation passed by the comMinister, placed on' the free list.",40
94,Mr CHARLTON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,But that does not business. help the working man.,40
95,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Quite so, but in this respect the coal-mine owner is in a better has position than are the gold-mining companies. While coal cutters are made free by regulation, rock-drilling machines are dutiable at 40 per cent. Why should there be this differential treatment? Why should rock drills, which are used largely in gold mines, be dutiable at 40 per cent, while coal cutters are free ? Gold miners working under contract have to pay, not only for everything they use, but for all breakages. If , for instance, a miner breaks a spring in a machine, or a screw case, a ratchet, or a valve, he has 'not only to pay the cost of repairing it , but to suffer loss in respect of the time that.he remains idle while the machine is sent to the surface to be repaired. I shall ask honourable members who represent coal miners and others, the machinery used by whom is on the free list, to come to the aid of their brothers in the gold-minrhg industry by placing rock drills on the free list. I have worked under contract in the gold mines, and could, if necessary, produce contract slips showing that a man has to pay for everything he uses.",40
96,Mr CHARLTON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Are rock-drilling chines made in Australia ?,41
97,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Some twenty-eight or thirty years ago one of the best rock drills that I have ever handled was made in this State. Its only defect was that the length of its stroke was too short to allow of its satisfactory use in super schist country such as that met with in Western Australia. . A machine with a longer stroke was required, .but, although the manufacturers of the Victorian article had been enjoying the benefits of an almost prohibitive duty under the Victorian Tariff, they had not the enterprise to improve on their machine, with the result that manufacturers abroad stepped into the breach, and put on the Australian market a machine that could be used in any class of country.",41
98,Unknown,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,41
99,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I think I have said enough about explosives and rock-drills to convince honourable members that the least this Committee can do is to allow the duties on these commodities to remain, as at present. As one representing a mining commimity, I study the interests of the mining.industry as an industry, and my own opinion is that, so far as these commodities are concerned, there is no need for the present high duties. ' Last October I prepared a list of every essential from a mining point of view, in ore reduction |'320""| or production; and I find that tliere has been a large increase in prices. It is not the individual mine-owner or mining company that feels the pinch, but the mining industry itself. On every one of these essentials, numbering about sixtyone in all, it is proposed by this T a r if f to raise the duty. ' But by no argument can it be shown that we are protecting the mining industry by such a policy. The products of the mines have to be sold in the world's markets; and mining has reached such a standard here that that can be done, and a very decent profit made. One only has to look at the figures of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company over a given number of years to see that some of the mines have not only held their own in competition with outside countries, but that at least three or four of them, and especially one, have made vast profits. No man who is a good Australian deprecates the fact of a business man making money. We all desire to obtain as large a return as we can for our labour, maand on no occasion does the question arise of the worker obtaining the fullest results of - his labour so much as it does in a Tariff discussion. If , by reducing the scope for profit making, an industry is killed, the scope for work is curtailed, and unemployment results. The manufacturers here have not always considered the well-being of those working for them. The Minister proposes to i m pose some safeguarding principle in the case of the imposition of high duties. I do not know exactly what that means, but I take it that the consumer will be pro- tected. I am atv honest and firm believer in Mr Andrew Fisher's new Protection policy; and if we cannot get that Protection, I hope the Minister will take some alternative, though I trust the one he proposes will be in the direction of conserving the interests of consumers. As to the mining and other industries holding their own in competition with the outside world, I may say that in 1914-15 the profits of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company were £321,000, and the dividends £177,000; in 1915-16, the profits were £486,000, and the dividends £236,000; in 1916-17 the profits were £426,000, and the dividends £177,000; and so I could go on quoting the figures right up to date.",41
100,Mr CORSER,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,What percentage did those profits represent?,41
101,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"A bigger percentage on the capital invested than in the case of auy other mining property in Australia. The miner must use the two commodities of which I have spoken at length, and, the interests of the industry, he should able to purchase them at a much reduced rate. If the proposals of the Government regarding this Tarif f are carried into effect, a further impost of £26,000 will placed on the mining industry of ""Western Australia, and it will mean an increase of pretty well £50,000 when compared with the conditions under the previous Tariff . If , further, we add to this increased price of every other commodity that is used, it will mean, in the case Western Australia, as I showed in the Parliament of that State by figures quoted, an impost of something like £100 000 on the industry there. In my opinion, it is impossible for the industry to bear such a burden. I know that my friends in the Opposition wil l say, "" them have the mines; mining is no good for the worker.""",42
102,Mr GABB,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Why should we say that?,42
103,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I say that honourable members opposite might say that, bea cause I have heard members in dif ferent Parliaments say ;the thing. There are some mines in Western Australia on the dowr? grade now, and I renrnd the high Tariff advocates of Victoria that, when those were at their zenith, it was tracted from them that lift ed Victoria out of the mud. If honourable members be but for the Commonwealth? opposite wish to do a good turn for fellow workers of Western Australia and I do not doubt for a moment that equally they do-the y will vote in the direction of iowering the duties, at any rate, these two commodities, which are so only vital to the interests of the mining indusis try: It was said that the various Governto ments of this Commonwealth were wrong when they assisted the farmers in the matter of the disposal of their wheat, but I believe that the Governments acted quite rightly. The Parliament of which I was a member at the beginning of the tected, war period voted every available shilling to assist the man on the land, first over a drought, and then to meet the adverse conditions created by the war. I rethey mind the members of the Country party that, when the world's parity meant 'fitably practically nothing, because .there were no available ships to take the wheat away, the various Governments came to the assistance of the farmers, and gave them in an absolute assurance that at least they be should not starve. I have never been able to find out what the world's parity is, if it does not mean the best price that can be got; but the Governments made be a parity of their own, and, in the case of Western Australia, guaranteed the farmer a living wage of 9s. per day, and gave an assurance that their wheat would be paid for at a certain rate. the These farmers were worthy of being given this 9s., with which to build up an asset of for themselves, as they did ; and, under the circumstances, I contend that our I friends who represent country interests here, and who claim to look at these questions from a national stand-point, should at least give the Government their support. We heard the Prime Minister (Mr . Let Hughes) say today that the question of the Wheat Pools was going to be dealt with , and that the States would have to face it in the near future. In my opinion, those Pools were a great protection to the farmers during the war period; they were better protection to primary producers generally than a high Tariff , which might same result in depriving them of the opportunity to make a profit.",42
104,Mr ROBEBT COOK,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Where would the mines Commonwealth be without the farmers' money exwheat at the present time?,42
105,Mr FOLEY,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Where would the wheat I am their not speaking in any spirit of carping criticism. I believe that each industry is essential for the well-being of the country; and I say quite definitely that on if our primary producers can produce what is consumed in Australia, there a bad outlook for our primary industries. They should have an opportunity sell under the best possible conditions; and I do not believe that exceptionally high Tariff s are instrumental in bettering the conditions of the farmer. The protected harvester of .Hugh V . MCKay was sold at a certain price; it was proas Victoria knows Protection, with a high. Tariff , though I , personally, do not. call that Protection. Althougn the harvesters were protected by the Tariff, were not sold.to the farmers at the lowest price at which they could be proproduced-no t by a long way; for when the Western Australian Government embarked upon the manufacture of ' harvesters they were able to undersell MCKav considerably, and he was forced to reduce his price. That showed that the Tariff was not benefiting the user of the harvesters, but was enabling the manufacturer to make a pile of money. It is a strange fact, however, that although the article manufactured by the State Government was the same in every detail, and was equally as good,- as the MCKay machine, many of the farmers who were opposed to the high duty, and protested against the exorbitant price which MCKay was. charging, refused to buy the other machine because it was State made. I contend that there should be no Tariff discrimination against an article which is up to standard, no. matter by whom if? is made. There are many Australian manufacturers that can prosper without the aid of a high Tariff. My idea of Protection is that an industry which cannot compete successfully with the products of overseas manufacturers , should be helped by the imposition of a duty sufficiently high to enable the local article to have a winning chance against the other; then let the better article win. An Australian Agent-General said in m y hearing a few days ago that Australians should apply themselves to primary production, and send their products to other countries for manufacture. There is not one honourable member - who will endorse that view; any man who advocates such a policy is a bad Australian. We know that the Government require money, but when they place a high Tariff wall around an industry they are putting money into the pocket of the community with one hand and taking it out with the other. That is not Protection. But if we impose a Tariff which gives the local industries a fair chance against the imported goods, we are giving genuine Protection, and are not giving with one hand and taking away with the other. The Committee can do a great deal to improve the Tariff schedule, and I ask honourable members to realise that there are many Australian industries that are operating on good lines, paying good wages, allowing good conditions to the workers, and yielding a fair return on the capital invested. But we should take care not to encourage the building up of a monopoly like the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. Even that evil can be coped with by giving to the Commonwealth Parliament greater power to deal with trusts and combines.. I believe that there are just as many honourable members on this side of the House as on the Opposition side who are prepared to advocate the gw^ing of that power to the Commonwealth,, and I predict that it would be found more effective and more J equitable to the consumer than the policy of erecting a high Tariff wall around our industries.",42
106,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Barrier) [8.22] The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) was rather amusing in his proposals for controlling monopolies, after they have beeu created by the Tariff, by giving greater powers to the Commonwealth.",43
107,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Hear , hear !",43
108,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The honourable member's applause confirms my opinion that the proposed' remedy, if not worse than the disease, will certainly be as in effective as it has been proved to be in the United States of America. The Sherman Anti-Trust Law, which was in troduced for the purpose of dealing with monopolies and combines in restraint of trade, has been operated only against the labour organizations for the purpose of strike breaking, and the experience of the working class in Australia leads them to the conclusion that any antitrust legislation that might be enacted in this country with the aid of honourable members opposite would not be utilized for any other purpose.",43
109,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"It might come home to roost. . Mr Considine - It might recoil as the W a r Precautions Act recoiled on honourable members on this side of the House, who were responsible for placing it on the statute-book. To enact a law to deal with a specific evil is one t h in g ; its administration by men whose interest is to maintain the evil is another thing. We have heard the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) preaching the new gospel of Imperialism and preferential trade within the Empire, and the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) making a speech which was reminiscent of the controversy 'between the Cobden-Bi'ight party and the landed class in Britain at the time of the agitation for the, repeal of the corn laws. The latter referred l o the large profits made by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) gave the Committee a resume of the same figures, presumably to prove that that particular class of exploiter does not need protection. Nobody will 'accuse me of looking after the interests of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company in respect of either the mines at Broken Hill or the steel works at Newcastle. The controversy between honourable members opposite is merely another family quarrel between the different exploiting interests. manufacturing class naturally seek to utilize the machinery of government to build up a home market in which they may exploit the community; whilst the importers, on the other hand, together with the men of many acres, the big pastoralists and agriculturists, advocate, if not Free Trade, at any rate a minimum Tariff. It is a matter of tweedledum and tweedledee. The issue is whether the working class shall be robbed by the importers of the manufacturers. From the point of view .of the worker, it is immaterial to his economic interest whether there is a high Tariff or no Tariff. Mr -'JOWETT - It makes a difference.",43
110,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"It is a question of high wages and high prices, or wages and low prices, The honourable member will not contend that without the Tariff the wages will remain as they are.",44
111,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,We have England's ample-lo w wages in a Free Trade tiy.,44
112,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"As an advocate of Froteotion, the honourable member could not have quoted a worse instance. If he has given any attention to the subcompromised. ject he must know that England occupied a specially advantageous position for the development of her manufactures. When the Industrial Revolution took place, England had the benefit of being the premier manufacturing country. During the American Civil War and the wars on the continent of Europe, Britain established herself in a foremost position. That, together, with her strategic positrenchment, and reform."" tion in the world, and her command of the seas, enabled her to develop her manufactures under Free Trade. those countries that came later-France Germany, America, and now Australia - hav e to travel another road. Protection and Imperialism go hand in hand.",44
113,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Not bad things either!,44
114,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Fro m the honourable member's point of view they probably are not, but I am here to look at matters from the point of view of the working class. The sections of the community that honourable members opposite represent may benefit from the Tariff, but I ask on behalf of the workThe ing class, "" Where do we come in ? """,44
115,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Who ""was the better off ten years ago: the worker in Protectionist America or the worker in Free Trade England?",44
116,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"That question might have some bearing if addressed to an advocate of Free Trade, but to me it is immaterial. I say to Free Traders and Protectionists alike, ' ' A plague o' both your houses."" The working class, to whose opinions I attempt to give-utterance, are interested, not in perpetuating^ the economic system of either of you, but in nutting an end to both as speedily as possible. The working classes are not parties to the imposition of a high Tariff, and will not take sides with the manufacturers or the importers. We shall be low well advised to adopt what was the economic policy of the Labour party, policy of the Labour party when Sir George Reid termed its members "" Fiscal atheists."" A change has come over exthe Labour party since then. The honcounorable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr . Folev) said that the party is now pledged to New Protection. In other words, i's members are allied with the manufacturing interests, with whom they have Their position is not unlike that of the Social Democratic party in Germany when it compromised with the Kaiser's Government. A state of affairs has come about here similar to that in Great Britain . During the years when Great Britain had a monopoly of manufacturing and exporting, the Labour movement was quiescent, and the slogan of the Liberals was this: "" Peace, reBut when the competition of France, Germany, and America began to be felt, Imperialism But arose in British politics, and the Right , Honourable Joseph Chamberlain put forforward his policy of "" preferential "" trade. That was in the early years of this century.",44
117,Mr JOWETT,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Chamberlai n was a good Englishman.,45
118,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Whether he was or was not has nothing to do with my argument; the movement which he 6et afoot synchronized with the recognition by Great Britain of the Seriousness of the competition of ' her economic rivals. Thereupon, the policy of the Manchester school, which was largely the creation of the textile interests of England, fell into disfavour, and the agitation for preferential trade and Tariff reform began. Since then there has been a marked change in the political conditions of Great Britain. The metal interests, those concerned in the production of steel, armaments, and similar goods, have dominated British policy, and the textile group has been displaced. The foreign and doniestic policy of the country has changed in harmony with its changed economic condition. In Australia much the same thing has happened. driving force behind this Tariff, and behind the Australian Industries Protection League, is Broken Hill steel and kindred interests. persons who are governing those concerns who are supporting this agitation with their money, and it is they and not the workers who will benefit by the Tariff.",45
119,Mr JOWETT,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,You do not suggest that this is all a question of money 1,45
120,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I would not expect the honourable member to take any interest in it if it were not.,45
121,Mr JOWETT,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I take interest in the honourable member whether he is speaking or silent.,45
122,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"If so, it is to safeguard your own interests against my proposals. In any case, I should like the honourable member to show his appreciation of my remarks by remaining silent now. Members cannot be ignorant of the powerful influences at work to secure the imposition of this Tariff. ""Imposition"" is a word which the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) used incessantlv throughout his speech, and is the word that best fits the case. The working classes have not been consulted with regard to the Tariff. Speaking this afternoon about the wool position, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) told us that the various sections of the ' exploiters, the representatives of the wool jobbers, the wool brokers, the wool growers, and the banking institutions, had interviewed him to suggest a way of dealing with the grave crisis with which the pastoral industry is faced. He directed the attention of members on this side to the gravity of the crisis, and warned us that the classes whom we represent would suffer most if the worse happened. Yet representatives of the workers have not been consulted to devise a means of preventing it . The people whom I represent are appealed to only when it is necessary to get out of the trouble which those behind members opposite have not brains enough to extricate themselves from. Members opposite are never tired of declaring that were it not for the captains of industry, with . their superabundance of intellect, the affairs of the country would be in chaos.",45
123,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,That is pretty right.,45
124,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Member s opposite are demanding increased production, and The complaining that the workers are going slow. Yet the pastoralists are yelling out because they have 3,000,000 bales of wool which cannot be sold. Is the glut in the It is the wool market due to the fact, that members of the Australian Workers' Union went slow on the job ?",45
125,Mr JOWETT,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,The honourable member is very rough on the members of the Australian Workers Union.,45
126,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I agree with the honourable member that the workers should produce more, but I disagree with him as to what they should do with what' they produce. The honourable member thinks that they should give it to him, whereas I think that they should keep it for themselves. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) has been beating the air about explosives. He has told us that he did not mean that the mine-owners were affected, and that he was referring to the mining industry, whatever that means.",45
127,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,He means that there are a lot of men out of work who might be in work.,45
128,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The honourable member and his friends are always thinking about the fellow who is out of work. The only time they do so is when no one is producing for them, and then - When men are producing they are not producing enough; hey are slowJ ing down on the job - Some people are never tired of pointing out that the country is being ruined because the workers do not produce enough in a given period.",45
129,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,There is a good deal of truth in that assertion.,46
130,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Then it would be interesting to explain how the surplus of wool has' been brought about by the slowing down of the workers. A few days ago the Argus published a leading article dealing with certain statements made by the Hon. W . L . Baillieu about the base metal industry, and blandly informed its readers that the people at Broken Hill were in trouble because they had followed the advice of Mr Considine.",46
131,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Did not the honourable, member advise them ?",46
132,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I have been blamed for a lot, but I have never been blamed other than in the columns of the Argus for the price of metals in Europe. Are the miners of Broken Hill responsible for the collapse of the market in Europe for zinc and lead ? No one is stupid enough to suggest it .",46
133,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,But the miners at Brothose ken Hill lost twelve golden months last year.,46
134,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Of course they duties did, but when I asked in this House for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the condition of the men who were dying from miners' pthisis and lead poisoning at Broken Hill , and were being forced to leave their employplain ment while they still had health in their bodies to do so, not only to save their own lives but also for the sake of the unborn children, the honourable member voted with the exploiters of the country to keep these men where they would be poisoned with lead.",46
135,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Did not a Labour Government in New South Wales appoint a Commission ?,46
136,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"No . It appointed a body of technical experts, the result whose inquiries has been that about 400 men have been prohibited from working in the industry. These men were barred from finding employment on line of lode, and were also held up for three months without compensation. While honourable members, like their tralian confreres in all the countries of the ploited world, are clamouring for increased proimposed duction, the Prime Minister tells us that benefit. there is a surplus production of wool. Has that come about because sufficient wool has not been produced, or because too much has been produced?",46
137,Mr JOWETT,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,It is because we have not enough customers with money to buy our wool.,46
138,Mr GABB,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"You should not have started the war. Mr < CONSIDINE - I am not concerned as to who started the war; all I am concerned about is to prevent the possibility of future wars. They will certainly not be prevented by tinkering about with Tariffs. The various countries of the world that have become cemmercialized are competing with one another in the same good old fashion; the Allies who fought Germany mainly and principally because of that country's competition with Great B r it a in are now proceeding to build up huge navies, and to accumulate great armaments, and are commencing to quarrel amongst themselves, treading .the same old paths that led to the recent world war. And 'now we are told by who stand behind our Tariff that- ' it is necessary for Australia to join forces with B r it a in by means of preferential and so for t h ; by more contributions in the shape of ships and money towards the building up of a Navy, and by altering the Defence Act in order to impose the British A r m y Act.upon Australians. who These are signs which appear to me as as a pikestaff, indicating that all these preparations have but one purpose in view, and that is to combine the forces of the British Empire against some other competitor in the world's markets.",46
139,Mr JOWETT,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Surely the honourable member does not say that that is the object of the present Tariff ?,46
140,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Of course it is. I have listened to the speeches of quite a of number of honourable members. They are all concerned, either with building up the manufacturers of this country, or with deconserving their own special interests. the Not one honourable member has voiced the view-point I am endeavouring to put 1 forward, namely, the position of the Ausworker, who will continue to be exjust the same, whether a T a r i ff is or not. I fail to see how he can The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) says that he is in favour of the new Protection policy as enuntainly ciated by the honourable Andrew Fisher, but that policy boiled down simply means that one section of workers will make arrangement with manufacturers which all other workers will be obliged to pay.",46
141,Mr MAKIN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,The honourable member subscribed to that policy for a number of years.,47
142,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I have never subhonorable scribed t° it.,47
143,Mr MAKIN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,The honourable member signed the platform containing that policy.,47
144,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Certainly , I sign the platform; it was necessary for to sign it in order that I might come this House; but, when I was a candidate in 1917, I repudiated the Labour party's misrepresents me. manifesto. The honourable member may not see any difference between my election speeches and the policy put forward by the labour party, but the Barrier ber. Daily Truth was fined £100 for publishing my speeches, which were all frankly working class in character. do not think that the speeches orable member for Hindmarsh were ever objected to by the people who run this country. Any honourable member could see the difference between my speeches and the policy for which the honourable member for Hindmarsh stood, although we may have signed the same platform.",47
145,Mr MAKIN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,When the honourable member signed the platform did he not agree with every principle contained it? Mr Considine.:-Did the honorparty. able member ?,47
146,Mr MAKIN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Yes .,47

150,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"If the honourable member for Barrier takes .exception to a remark made by another honourable member, the Chair will cerprotect him. To what remark does the honourable member take exception ?",47
151,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The honourable an member for Bass said quite loudly that I for had "" scabbed "" on my mates.",47
152,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Then I must ask the honourable member for Bass to withdraw that statement.,47
153,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I withdraw it.,47
154,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Seeing that the member withdraws his remark, I withdraw my statement that he is a liar. May I be permitted to remind the constituents of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who takes exception to my attitude, that the only time he has done so did is when I am objecting to the Labour me party being used for the purpose of assistto ing the manufacturers of this country.",47
155,Mr MAKIN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Th c honourable member,47
156,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"If so, I am sorry; but the fault, lies with the honourable mem",47
157,Mr MAKIN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I merely desire the honourable member to he as consistent as he was I anxious to be when he was a member of of the hontho Labour party.,47
158,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The only remark I can offer to the workers of this country, whose opinion is the only opinion I value, is that, until I severed my connection with the Labour party, there was no question as to my consistency or loyalty to the working class. Objection was taken to my presence in the Labour party only when I stood up for the principle of the in On© Big Union- a principle I had advocated ever since I was a member of that It was then, and only then, that I was threatened with expulsion. So long as I am in this chamber, however, I shall ' continue* to emphasize the point that th© interests of the workers are not, and never can he, idenliar! tical with those of the employers. The party that represents the workers of this country will not be concerned with the imposition of a Tariff, will not be by quest'ons of Free Trade or but will be interested in putting an end to the profit-making system I which breeds these antagonisms between my different classes of the community arid makes it essential that the people shall be fooled and robbed all the time, while the manufacturers and importers are fighting for their respective shares of the plunder. What have the working classes to do with the Tariff?",47
159,Mr CORSER,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,A great deal.,48
160,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Perhaps so, from the honourable member's point of view; but his point of view is not that of the workers. Some time ago, when we were dealing with the war-time profits tax, honourable members opposite were moved to laughter when T said that the working classes did not pay taues; and even some honourable members on this side said they would be very pleased to learn that' they did not. I repeat that statement to-night. The working classes are robbed not through taxation, but at the point of production.. They are robbed in the factories, the workshops, and the mines. It is over the surplus value that is wrung from the working classes in the places where they are exploited that the importers and manufacturers quarrel, and they attempt to use the workers and the political representatives of the workers to aid them in securing their respective shares of the plunder for their own particular sections. I referred just now to the agitation in Great Britain for the repeal of the Corn Laws. If honourable members have studied that agitation they will know that Bright and Cobden, representing the manufacturt.uring interests of the country, - endeavoured to rope in the workers behind them by raising the cry of a cheap loaf-chea p food for the people. On the other hand, the agricultural interests, headed hy Lord Shaftesbury and others of hia class, appealed to the workers, saying, "" Look how these manufacturers are exploiting you in their factories. They work you twelve 1 hours a day,"" and so forth. In various ways they held the other side up to ridicule. Was this done in the interests of the workers? No. Each of these appeals was made to the workers not in their own interests, but because people who were striking at the economic interests of the other side had appealed to them. While the representatives of the agricultural terests pointed out that the workers were being exploited by the manufacturers and required to work twelve hours a day, the representatives of the manufacturers .pointed to the conditions under whioh the agricultural workers were labouring and said to the masses, "" If you working men will only help us to repeal the Corn Laws you will have a cheap loaf."" They did not tell them that when they got that cheap loaf their wages would also go down, so that after they had pulled the chestnuts out of the fire for the manufacturers of Great Britain they would be just where they wore before. We have the same position in this country. The intelligent worker in Australia, however, recognises that, whether a Tariff be imposed or not imposed, his interests are not going to he advanced one iota. In any event, he must work from Monday morning till Saturday afternoon.",48
161,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The manufacturer has to do the same, and he works more than eight hours a day.",48
162,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The manufacturer who ongages in either mental or manual labour is a worker in so far as he works, hut in so far as he exploits other people's labour, he is an exploiter,and does not work.",48
163,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I get the honourable member's view-point. He does not mind the foreign manufacturer benefiting in this way, but no manufacturer in Australia should be allowed to do so.",48
164,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"That is not so. My argument leads to no such conclusion. I object to exploitation, whether it be foreign or local. If I am robbed, the only question which concerns me is as to the robbery itself, and not as to the individual who has robbed me. And so I am concerned in putting an end to the robbery or exploitation. If the honourable member cannot appreciate that viewpoint it is not my fault.",48
165,Mr JACKSON,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I am not going to say that the honourable member is robbed.,48
166,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Then the obvious inference is that the honourable member does not know whether ho is right or wrong. Honourable members opposite can afford to smile. They have the numbers and they know that this Tariff will be passed regardless of what I or any one in- else on this side may say. The position in regard to all other legislation is the same, and serves only to confirm the opinion which I have, enunciated both here and outside as to the value of this place as an institution at all.",48
167,Mr BELL,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,But the Parliament is the expressed will of the people.,49
168,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The honourable member says that this institution in which we meet and exchange our views - in which laws are enacted and give rise to the necessity for the enactment of further laws in order that the "" will of the people"" maybe given effect to-is the "" will of the people."" And this notwithstanding that all the time we have conferences with the financiers, the wool .brokers and others, who, when they meet together, decide that a certain course of action is in the interests of whom-the people? - Mr JOWETT - Yes .",49
169,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The "" will of the people "" is expressed by the wool brokers and the banks and other financial institutions of the country.",49
170,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"We have 80,000 wool-growers, and the bulk of them are only in a small way.",49
171,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I know that, hut the fact remains that the "" wil l of .the people "" is expressed through these organizations whose interests are bound up in their own particular industries. When the workers of Australia come together to look after their own interests-whe n they organize along the same lines and endeavour to put their views before the Governments of the day-it is suggested that they are guilty of disloyalty.",49
172,Mr JOWETT,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Not at all. They are good men.,49
173,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I arn sure that the honourable member has no desire to kill the gooso that lays the golden egg.,49
174,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Meantim e there is a little Tarif f schedule before us:,49
175,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I have not noticed any one touching the Tarif f schedule. I have no doubt that the right honourable gontleman is anxious that we should deal with it , and I have no objection to his getting on "" with the will of the people,"" if he chooses so to describe it . I do not suppose it will affect the real issue. The real rulers of this country wil l not be perturbed. interests are safe in the hands of honourable members opposite. I expect, that when the base motal people think that the miners in CloncuTry, Mount Lyell, Broken Hill and other districts have been [321] sufficiently disciplined and starved-whe n the arrangements are' sufficiently r i p e . in the opinion of these people who own and rule the country-the y will decide that the mines shall be opened up once more. Meantime, while this institution can go on, it will not do very much more harm than it has done. As the workers of the country, by force of circumstances and the logic of events, have their intelligence sharpened, while their stomachs are getting pinched, I think they will have a different outlook. I ibeliave they will come to recognise that the more attention they pay to their organizations outside this Parliament-the greater the determination shown by them to take the con-' trol of industry into their own hands",49
176,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,Direc t action?,49
177,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Certainl y direct action. What is wrong with the working class adopting the methods of the honourable member's class? If direct action is good for the honourable member's class and ""delivers the goods,"" then direct or anj' other kind of action, as long as it "" delivers the goods,"" must also he good for the working class.",49
178,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME, Order II am afraid the honourable member is departing too widely from the question before the Chair.,49
179,Mr CONSLDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Yes . I can well understand that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro's incitement to direct action is quite out of order. So long as it is covered by legal phraseology or parliamentary procedure therewill be no objection on the part of the employing interests, or those who represent them in this Chamber. I remember, on a former occasion, when we were discussing, not wool, but f r u it trees, hearing the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) advise those who were affected to cut baclc the trees so as to retard production and restrict output. Of course, in that case, such a procedure was not called "" going slow on the job "" ; but if tramway men strictly carry out the rules and regulations, that is the charge made against them, and they are regarded as being guilty of most reprehensible Their behaviour. When it is a cose of creating an artificial scarcity of wool, or any other commodities that honourable members opposite may be interested in , it is, of course, a different proposition altogether; all that honourable members opposite desire is that the worker shall go on peacefully working from Monday morning t ill Saturday afternoon, producing surplus value, and the employers and those interested will settle amongst themselves, in a gentlemanly fashion, the question of who shall Have the biggest share of the ""swag.""",49
180,Mr BELL,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,We will settle it ; we will not fight;,50
181,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"If you do settle it we shall expect it to be settled in - a gentlemanly fashion. I fai l to seo, from the point of view of interest in the country, where the working men come into the picture at all. Why should they worry their heads about the disagreements of honourable members opposite and their friends ? Tho workers are concerned most about getting r i d of the lot of them.",50
182,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME, Order ! Will the member deal somewhat with the Tariff?,50
183,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Of course I do not know whether it is so or not-whethe r it is a. coincidence-bu t on every occasion when I address myself to a subject before the House I seem to be rather unfortunate. I listened very attentively to honourable members who preceded me, and I did not notice any restrictions being placed on their utterances. .",50
184,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I do not know if the honourable member intends that remark, as a reflection on the Chair, but I think that if I am to be accused of one thing more than another it is giving too much latitude to honourable members.",50
185,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I never noticed that you do that with me!,50
186,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I have given the honourable member the same privileges as I have given to every other honourable member, and I shall continue to do so while I occupy my present position. remind the honourable member that there Mo several stages in the discussion of the Tariff. The matters he is dealing with now are altogether outside the scope of the schedule; and if he desires to give his opinion on those matters he should avail himself of other opportunities. custom has been to allow a general debate on the first item, of the schedule - to deal with the Tariff as a wholesbut the honourable member is going altogether outside the question, as he must admit if he wishes to be f a ir and reasonable. He is dealing with matters that are not contained in the Tariff; disagreements between parties have nothing to do with our present subject. I wish to remove from the honourable member's mind an impression, indicated by his remarks, that I have placed on hiin restrictions that I have placed on no other honourable member. I assure the honourable member that he is wrong. He 'has had, and will have, just the same privileges as are extended to any other honourable member. I ask honourable members to observe the Standing Orders and discuss the Tariff.",50
187,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I was not alluding to differences between parties at all ; I was pointing to the economic divisions that exist between the manufacturing interests and the importing interests, and the gentlemen opposite who represent them. I understood-and in listening to ihe debate I had the impression borne honorablo out-that this is the only opportunity for a wide discussion on the Tariff . When we come, to the various items, I understand we shall be restrictedto the' particular item under discussion - From my point of view, there is nothing good in the T a r if f ; the question of the value of the Tariff, of whether it is - a good T a r if for a had one, or whether we should have Free Trade or Protection, does not, as I - was trying to convey to the House, matter a "" continental"" so far as the workers of this country are concerned. I was endeavouring to give reasons for the adoption of that view. If , because I do not confor m .to either the Free Trade or the Protectionist school of thought-if the discussion is meant only for Free Traders and Protectionists-then , of course, I should not have spoken at all. I thank the Chairman for his assurance that I shall have all the privileges to which I honourable members aro entitled in this House. I do not think I shall be getting too much when I get'that consideration to which I think I ana' entitled us my right. I regard it as my right, not because I am speaking, but bo'ciiuse the people who sent me here artentitled to Tho have their views expressed, and the same privileges extended to their mouthpiece as are extended to other honourable members. I never intended, and flo not in tend,-to ask for more. I simply said that I appeared to bo rather unfortunate in being pulled up or questioned, simply and solely, as it seems to me, because I do not favour the Free Trade or the Protectionist school of thought. point of view,, and from the point of view of those I represent, it is immaterial whether Free Trade or Protection is adopted in this country. What we wish to do is to convince the worker? of this country that their interests do not lie in either of those schools of thought, but lie in substituting for the profit-making system, with its inherent evils- a system which breeds all the trouble and causes all the waste of time-anothe r system which will administer industry without the ridiculous results we have at present.",50
188,Mr CORSER,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Wide B a y) [9.25] - It is, I am sure, satisfactory to all of us that this debate is not being conducted on party lines, but that we are free to exercise our thoughts and our votes as we think best for the Commonwealth of Aus-* tralia. We have to remember, however, that a great deal will depend on our actions in this chamber within the next month or so. We are to be complimented on having such an able Minister in charge of this Bill . It will be admitted that he has placed the Tariff , and all it means, very clearly before us. I am one who desires every section of the community to have fair-play under the T a r if f . have always been in favour of Protection for the primary producers, as given in the past, and, as I hope, will be given in the future. The industries that I have in my mind are those associated with the production of dried f r u it , which is, perhaps, the most highly protected industry in the Commonwealth, maize, bananas - thes e two require further protection to save the industries!-preserve d milk, arrowroot, hams, eggs, honey, onions, tobacco, glucose, cotton, and other commodities. The duties on some of these products will , I think, after consideration by the Minister and the Chamber, be somewhat increased. matter of maize, we are certainly "" up against"" production in other parts of the world by cheap black labour; and, with the slump in freights, which we know is certain, even more Protection than in the past will be required on this and other primary products. In the case of cotton growing in Queensland, although there is a guarantee of 4d. a lb. on production, there is not the protective duty there should be. I believe in all the interests of AusFro m my tralia being considered, including the in terests of the workers and their families; and there ought to be a Protection of 15 per cent, on cotton. Some honourable members may not know that at the present time raw cotton in being i m ported from India and. China-the lowest quality grown anywhere-wher e it is grown more cheaply than it can be in Queensland, but it is of very inferior quality to that which is being produced, not only in the northern State of Queensland, but also, I believe, in South Australia, New South Wales, and Western Australia. This is not the first time that cotton has been grown in Queensland. I can remember large cotton plantations in Queensland fifty years ago, and during the Civil W a r in America that State had a large trade. As soon, however, as the war was over, the American people, with their cheap coloured labour, were able to take the trade from us. I firmly believe that if there had been a protective duty of 15 per cent, at that time, the cotton industry would have, progressed up to the present day.",51
189,Mr JAMES PAGE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Queenslan d was one of the most highly protective States in Australia. I Mr OORSER - I shall show, I think, that Queensland was not highly protective. As the cheap and poor quality of imported cotton is used chiefly for mixing with wool in the manulacture of woollen fabrics that are highly protected, it is only just to impose a duty on the. cotton used, in that way as well as on the wool in goods. Thirty years ago the production of cotton at Ipswich clearly proved that if there had been a protective duty of 15 per cent, in operation, the industry would not have collapsed. This season the Queensland Department of Agriculture distributed enough cotton seed to plant 5,000 acres. In the More was applied for , but was not available. It is estimated that the area now under cultivation amounts to 3,000 acres of productive cotton, which will yield a return of 1,500 tons of seed cotton, from which, according to the calculations of experts, will be produced 500 tons of l in t of better quality than we are importing from overseas, and 1,000 tons of seed.",51
190,Mr JAMES PAGE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I do not know of anybody in Queensland who is rushing those Eldorados of which the honourable member is speaking.,51
191,Mr CORSER,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The honourable member lives far out west, and if he does not know of these industries, that does not prove that other parts of Queensland are not developing them. He will find that cotton is being grown south of Rockhampton, but most of the cultivation is in the southern portions of the State, from Bundaberg southwards. In the old days I saw large plantations of cotton near Maryborough. It is on record that fifty years ago there was 14,000 acres under cotton in Queensland. To-day there is no obstacle to the industry in the way of labour cost, because the price of cotton-picking in the United States of America is as high as the wages we are paying in Australia, and if we could only secure a protective duty of 15 per cent., and place under cultivation the same area as was planted with cotton fifty years ago, returned soldiers and others could with a far less capital expenditure be more profitably engaged than they are today in fruit-growing and other industries. An area of 14,000 acres uuder cotton would give employment to 1,200 men, women, and children in taking off the crop. We ought to do something to encourage the growth of our population. It is a standing disgrace that a country bigger than the United States of America, and with possibilities greater than that country had years ago, should have only 5,000,000 people, whereas in America there are 112,000,000 people. If our industries were properly encouraged and protected, and immigrants could feel that their interests would be safeguarded when they came here, we should soon have a much bigger population than we have today. And what would that mean to Australia? We are weighted down with a load of taxation owing to the late war. If we doubled our population, we should have our taxation, and that would offer a greater encouragement to people to come here to develop this great country. Before the last drought there were 93,000,000 sheep in Australia, - and, notwithstanding the export of mutton and lamb, that number will soon be reached again! To-day the primary pro'ducers are complaining that they are losing money because there is no competition outside Australia for their raw material. Would it not be to the interests of the community if that raw material were converted in Australia into manufactured goods, which would find a ready sale ou the other side of the world? I am not. pessimistic in regard to the wool position. Before the war there was not more wool produced than was necessary to supply the world. At the present time we are cut off from many of our markets, and the actiom which has been taken to protect our interests until normal conditions are restored is wise. The time is not far distant when countries which are at present out of the market will be again seeking our wool. A few years ago Russia had 72,000,000 sheep. I wonder how many she has now. Surely, if the product of those sheep is not available, there must be a greater demand for Australian wool to replace it. Tf we can only safeguard the interests of our producers in the - meantime, we shall soon return to a safe footing. Encouragement should be given to the cultivation of the castor bean. Beans of ^the highest quality are being grown on hundreds of acres in Queensland, and expert tests prove the average oil contents to be 50 per cent. The cost of production is very low. For years I grew a few castor bean and cotton plants in my own garden, and I know that they do not require nearly as much attention as does fruit, and are not subject to the ravages of fruit fly and other pests. If returned soldiers and immigrants were directed into enterprises like the growing of cotton and the castor bean, they would have better prospects than are offered by many of the activities in which they are engaged today. I am anxious that the primary producers should have, a fair deal. Their interests should be protected. But the secondary industries also must be considered, for Avithout the in Australia cannot possibly thrive. We have heard a lot of talk about the manner im which Great Britain prospered without Protection in the early days. What necessity existed for Protection, when she had the markets of the world at her mercy? Her industries were - well established, tremendous reserves had been established, many - of the large plants had been written down 70 per cent., and what chance had other countries to compete ""with them when starting, they had to pay interest on the full capital cost of buildings and plant? We are in precisely the same position as were those countries years ago. The primary producers complain of. the unfairness of a duty on agricultural implements, but agree that such preference should be given to agricultural machinery produced within ..the Empire. That would be a mistake. Our two largest competitors in the manufacture of agricultural machinery have branches in Canada and America. If preference is given within the EmpireI favour preference to Great Britain-it will mean preference to Canada, and, therefore, in the case of these two firms, a preference to America. What has been the action of America in regard to the dumping of machinery and other goods into Australia? Although the United States of America Legislature passed a very strong law prohibiting Trusts and Combines, in 1918 the Webb Act made legal Combines whose object was the dumping of goods into the markets of other countries, and the Government arranged for the transport of raw material from the interior to the seaboard at a considerable reduction of rates, on condition that it was used for the manufacture of goods for export.",52
192,Mr JAMES PAGE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"The honourable member suggested a few minutes ago that Australia should do much the same thing-that she should manufacture her wool into clothing, and dump it anywhere she could.",53
193,Mr CORSER,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I did not suggest dumping. In February, 1920, Mr Taylor, the Director of the Commonwealth Bureau of Commerce and Industry, stated that, although there may be difficulties, there is no real obstacle in the way of converting the greatest part of the Australian wool clip into woollen goods to be sold in other countries, and the honourable member for' Grampians (Mr Jowett) said the other night that he was absolutely in accord with that view, and would do all he could to give it effect, a statement which showed his sound common sense. It is said that the primary producer must not be exploited. At the same time, the complaint is made that our primary produce is being sold in the markets of the world for less than [322] we should get for it. Why, then, should not the primary producers put their produce into local factories, and thus obtain not merely a profit on their primary production, but also a profit on the secondary production as well? To do that would give employment to - manj who are now unemployed. The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) says that Labour does not want Protection; but let me give him indisputable figures taken from the last Commonwealth Year-Book, No. 13. What would become of the men employed in our factories if we abolished Protection?",53
194,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,I suppose you would get the Kanakas back.,53
195,Mr CORSER,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"I was one of those who assisted in getting the Kanaka dispensed with; but I contended that Queensland industries should be protected, so that it would be possible to use white labour in place of black in tropical and semi-tropical Queensland and Western Australia. Had ye labour from the South Sea Islands, we could produce cotton, castor beans, and sugar more cheaply than with white labour; but no one in Queensland wishes to revert to black labour, and the people of that State are as strong advocates of a White Australia as is the honourable member for Barrier. According to the official statistics, the engines in use in the factories of the Commonwealth in 1918 had a total horse power of 610,326, and the average number of persons employed in our manufacturing industries in that year was 328,049.",53
196,Mr JAMES PAGE,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"Not a great number in a population of 5,000,000.",53
197,Mr CORSER,DEPARTURE OE PRIME,"But they support wives and children and other dependants. The salaries and wages paid in the Commonwealth factories during the same year amounted to £38,379,268. Would honourable members deprive our work people of this amount in wages by shutting down the factories? The value of the fuel and light used was £4,732,890; the value of the raw material worked up, £146,181,866; and the value of the output of the factories, £225,753,611. In 1919 the value of our industrial output was £249,147,395. The increase in value given in 1918 to our raw material by the process of manufacturing was £97,571,745. Is it not a good thing that that money was kept in the count r y , instead of being sent overseas? Was it not better that it should be in circulation in Australia? How can we balance our accounts if we import all our requirements from overseas? Last year the - value of our imports £26,000,000 in excess of the value of our exports. This difference has to be made up, and the best way of balancing our trade is to reduce our importations by manufacturing more of our raw material. The value of the land and buildings connected with factories was £45,795,704, and of the plant and machinery in them £50,792,305. A great deal of that machinery was manufactured in Australia, and gave employment locally. The value of the final output of our agricultural implement works was £1,415,375 ; of our engineering iron works and foundries, £13,322,785; of railway and tramway workshops, £5,037,225 ; of smelting works, & c , £18,409,027; of bacon-curing factories, £3,538,612; of butter and cheese factories, £14,322,025; of meat and fish preserving works. £14,318,244; of confectionery works, £2,969,573; of flour mills, £13,000,000. This year, I think, the out put of the sugar mills of Queensland and New South Wales will be worth at least £14,000,000. We could not produce this value of sugar in the Commonwealth were it not for Protection, though the protection given to the sugar industry is very little. The value of our output of boots and shoes is £6,410,000; of our woollen, cotton, and tweed output, £ 2 , 0 2 4 , 3 4 3 ; and of our furnitur e output, £2,239,642. The Webb Act came into operation in America in April, 1918, and eleven months afterwards the value of the goods exported from the TJnited States of America was 6,308,000,000 dollars, as 2,803,000,000 dollars' worth of imports. A surplus of more than £800,000,000 was thus created. If we do not safeguard the industries of Australia dumping they will go to the wall. figures I have just given are to be found in the Journal' of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin of New York of the 20th June, 1919, and show how necessary it is for us to protect this country dumping. In a report of 137 pages which Mr Julian Home devotes to the agricultural machinery industry, he deals with every point of the Australian ket for machinery. Mr Home was for Mr Corser. many years a representative of the United States Bureau of Commerce and Industry, and wrote his report after a visit f o Australia. During the past few year"" some large implement factories in Australia have been forced to go out of was business. The gross output fell considerably between 1911 and 1918, and in that period the number of employees was reduced from 5,156 to 3,336. During the war we benefited by the existence of in dustries which had previously been established under Protection. I do not know what the mining industry, the sugar in dustry, the agricultural industry, and many others would have done during the war if there had not been factories in which repairs to machinery could be made and portions of the plant renewed and new plants obtained. On one occasion twenty locomotives which were being built by Walkers Limited, Maryborough, for the EastWest Railway were held up because steel tyres were not being made in Australia and could not be imported during the war. A long while ago this firm and others appealed to the Government of the day to put a protective duty upon steel tyres that would enable a plant to be established locally for their manufacture, but the' request was refused and the manufacture of steel tyres was not undertaken in Australia. The result was that the Commonwealth was considerably inconvenienced in regard to the operating of its railways. However, a plant has recently been established in Newcastle, New South Wales, for the manufacture of these tyres under Protection. It is regrettable that an earlier start could not have been made with it , because during the war many of our industries suffered through the in against ability to obtain steel products which are now being turned out successfully by Australians. against We cannot with any safety give the The British Empire preference on farming and other machinery, because two American firms, namely, the International Harvester Company and the Massey-Harris Company, who operate from largely in Australia and New Zealand, can sell their machines in the Commonwealth for less than they charge for them in New Zealand, despite the fact that mar- we impose a duty of from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, on nineteen different machines, while New Zealand collects no duty on fifteen of them,, and only 10 per cent, on the balance. As a matter of fact, notwithstanding our duty of from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent., the Australian farmers pay less for these agricultural machines than do the Argentine farmers who import them free of duty. These facta show conclusively that overseas 'firms will, by means of the dumping process, take steos to see that they are not prevented by any 30 per cent., duty from keeping down competition against them. Quite recently we had in Tasmania an illustration of the evils of dumping. In that State carbide works had been started by private enterprise. Previously' the price of the imported article had been £80 per ton, but the importers, upon the commencement of the operations of the local manufacturers, immediatelv began to dump their product into Australia at such an exceedingly low price that this House found it necessary to pass legislation in order to safeguard the interests of the Tasmanian manufacturers by making it almost impossible for the importers to dump carbide here. I stand, as I always hope to do, for every section of the community - I am not a sectionalist. It is my aim in dealing with this Tariff to see that protection is afforded, not only to the primary and secondary industries of Australia, but also to the workers engaged in them. Progress reported. Honse adjourned' at 10.6 p.m.",53
