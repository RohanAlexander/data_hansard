0,NA,Unknown,"?Qouse of firpresrntatibFs. Friday, zg October, 1900. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 10.30 a.m:, and read prayers. RATES OF WAGES. Mr TUDOR:-Has the Postmaster General yet received information from the officers of his Department regarding the rates of pay for skilled labour? Does he know whether the rates fixed by him about a month ago are less than those awarded by Mr Justice Cussen and representatives of the employers and employees ?",14
1,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Some time ago a scale of rates was fixed by me after a consultation with the officers of the Department, and information had been obtained from the municipal authorities. I have since received a communication from representatives of the trades concerned, intimating that in certain particulars these rales are lower than those fixed by Mr Justice Cussen. I agreed to receive a deputation on the subject last Thursday, but those concerned were not' then ready to proceed with their complaint, so I have promised to receive a deputation next Thursday.",14
2,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I wish to know if the Minister of Home Affairs will, from time to time, compare the schedule of wages paid by his Department with that of the Works Departments of the State Governments, and with the rates ruling outside the Public Service, in order that all employees of the Commonwealth may receive the highest rate of pay fixed for their particular kind of employment.",15
3,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I shall be glad to look into the matter from time to time. I understand that the ruling rates are paid for all work carried out by my Department. DISPLAY OF MAPS.,15
4,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Since we adjourned last night, the walls of the chamber have been decorated by the display of lurid works of art. I ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether these huge patches of brilliant carmine and vermillion are intended to suggest the excessive heat of. part of the Northern Territory?",15
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is scarcely in order for honourable members to cluster round the plans which have been hung on the walls-withou t my knowledge; I do not know whether the Clerk was consulted in the matter. I ask honourable members to pay attention, not so much to them as to the business before the Chamber. PUBLIC TELEPHONES IN HOTELS.",15
6,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Was the Postmaster General correctly reported in last night's Melbourne Herald as having stated that he has suspended a regulation passed by me, prohibiting publicans and hotel keepers from advertising outside their premises that thero are public telephones inside?",15
7,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"In reviewing the history of the regulations, I informed a deputation which waited upon me yesterday that the honourable member, in arranging for the general imposition of toll rates, and increasing those rates, had provided that any subscriber to a telephone exchange who paid the rate prescribed by Regulation 7A in his list, might place his telephone at the service of the public. Regulation 57 - that complained of by the deputationsays that a subscriber may provide and exhibit a plain and legible notice in a prominent position on his premises, indicating that a telephone is there available for public use, but no such notice or sign is to be exhibited on or about thepremises of any hotel, or other place licensed for the sale of intoxicating beverages. I informed the deputation that when I came into office I had occasion to review the honourable member's proposal to increase the telephone rates, and to make the toll system universal, and advised that the regulations which he had framed should be suspended pending the final determination of the matter. The suspension of those regulations included the suspension of tha*. referred to by him irj his question. DRESS GOODS-DUMPING JAPANESE IN AUSTRALIA.",15
8,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister a question, without notice.",15
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Clerk has read out the business for the day, so that the time far questions without notice has passed. I called on the honourable member to ask the question standing in his name on the notice-paper.",15
10,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"1 rose directly the Postmaster-General sat down, with a view to asking a question, without notice. If I cannot deal with this matter now, I shall have to deal with it on the motion for the adjournment of the House. In accordance with the notice I have given I ask the Prime Minister If , in view of his promise re Tariff anomalies, he will name an approximate date when the anomalies re women's and children's dress goods, and the dumping of end of season's made-up garments for women, will be dealt with?",15
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The two matters referred to are quite distinct. The duties on dress goods were deliberately fixed by this Parliament. The allegation is that they are too high, though the protection to the' manufacturer remains as fixed by the preceding Tariff. As to alleged dumping of goods, any case brought under notice which infringes existing laws will be promptly dealt with. The probable time for dealing with actual anomalies cannot be fixed. These cannot be dealt with singly. They are now being collected for Ministerial consideration. I should like to add that the honourable member, before rising, drew my attention to a statement which has been made as to the Japanese now in Australia, ittoeingalleged that they number 73,000. Inasmuch as we had only 47,000 coloured aliens at the taking of the last census, of whom a large part were Chinese, while returns compiled since show that the number is gradually decreasing, it would be impossible to sustain the estimate referred to.",15
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would point out that the matter upon which the Prime Minister is now speaking has nothing to do with the question on the business paper, which he was called upon to answer. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. V ISIT TO OODNADATTA : MELBOURNE CUP.",16
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minislisten ter) [10,39] - I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next, at half-past 4 o'clock p.m., or such time thereafter as Mr Speaker may take the chair.",16
14,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Why is this arrangement being made for Tuesday's meeting?,16
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"A number of honourable members will be away this week-end on a visit to South Australia, and it is necessary to provide against the possible absence of a quorum at the usual hour of meeting on Tuesday next. The last condition has been adopted every year of late.",16
16,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I could understand the proposal if it affected Wednesday's meeting.,16
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,My desire is to meet the convenience of absent members. hope that the House will unanimously agree to the motion.,16
18,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [10.45]- I shall certainly oppose the motion which has been submitted by the Prime Minister. The reason underlying it is, I take it, that the Melbourne Cup will be run on Tuesday next.",16
19,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No . Because the Parliamentary party which is visiting Oodnadatta will not return in time to enable us to meet at half-past 2 o'clock on that day for certain.,16
20,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The Parliamentary party which is visiting Oodnadatta will not return until Wednesday next. Had it not been for the circumstance that the Melbourne Cup will be run on Tuesday,16
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is because of the two events happening together that the motion-, is submitted.",16
22,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"In his speech, the Prime Minister did not make any reference to the Melbourne Cup meeting.",16
23,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"He did not wish to advertise it, because he thought that the honourable member might attend it.",16
24,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I do not think it is right that the National Parliament should adjourn, even for an hour, because the Melbourne Cup is being run.",16
25,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Will the honourable member guarantee a quorum if we meet at the ordinary hour on Tuesday?,16
26,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"No . This morning I had left at my house a copy of the Spectator, which, as honourable members are aware, is the Methodist journal; and I should like the Minister of Defence to to what it says on this subjectRaces are mere instruments of gambling. All the sunshine of an Australian November day,, all the sheen upon the green sward, all the glitter of vice-regal presence, and the display of dresses by fair women-ofte n at the expenseof men who cannot afford it-and all. the superbgrace of horses that are fit for nothing else, like some of the patrons of the course, are but toolsthat serve the gambling instincts and interests, of a set of social parasites. There can be no> denial of the fact that the Melbourne Cup is. only the occasion for gambling, and that, apart from the gambling which it serves it would not: be held. If that extract expresses the truth-and I think there is a good deal to be said in favour of the view that' it does-ther e would be practically no races if there wereno gambling.",16
27,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Is it compulsory for a. man to gamble when he visits the FlemingI ton race-course?,16
28,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If there were nr> gambling, there would be no races. I hold that view, and I believe that it is shared alike by the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Defence. I do not think it is right that the National Parliament should adjourn simply because the Melbourne Cup is to be run. If any honourable members desire to attend the gathering at Flemington, they have a perfect right to do so.",16
29,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,How about the officers; or Parliament?,16
30,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I will deal with them in a moment or two. If any honourable member, in his private capacity, desiresto attend the Melbourne Cup meeting, her is quite at liberty to do so. But I say that the National Parliament ought not to have anything to do with a racing carnival. The honourable member for Melbourne has asked, "" What about the officers of Parliament?"" I have been informed by a friend who will attend the Melbourne Cup race meeting that it would be a very difficult thing to see that race run, and to reach the House by half-past 4 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon. If that be so, the officers of the House, about whom the honourable member for Melbourne is so anxious, could not possibly attend that gathering.",16
31,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Le t us save the officers at any cost to ourselves.,17
32,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I repeat that we ought not to adjourn merely because the Melbourne Cup is to be run. I wish also to enter my protest against that portion of the motion submitted by the Prime Minister which affirms that Mr Speaker may take the chair at any time after half-past 4 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon that a quorum may be present.,17
33,Dr WILSON,Unknown,That practice has always heen followed upon Cup day.,17
34,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"It is never too late to mend. The fact that we have adopted that practice in the past is no reason why we should follow it in the future. If the Minister of Defence were Leader of the Opposition, I am satisfied that he would be found objecting to the motion. If niy health permits me, I shall be present on Tuesday afternoon if the House meets at 3 o'clock.",17
35,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,Will the honourable member answer for the attendance of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie?,17
36,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I can only answer for myself. To carry my own sins is quite a - sufficient burden. ' If the motion be carried, I shall be present at half-past 4 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, but after that hour I shall not enter the chamber at any time to form a quorum. I do not think it is fair to those honourable members who are prepared to attend at that hour that Mr SPEAKER - shoul d a quorum not then be present-shoul d be empowered to take the chair at any time that a quorum may put in: an appearance. Neither is it fair to the officers of the House. . If we do not meet at 3 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, the hour of meeting should be definitely fixed for half-past 4 o'clock and Mr Speaker should not be authorized to take the chair at any time that a quorum may be present. If the motion be not carried, I take it that the House will meet as usual at 3 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon. I repeat that it is not right that the National Parliament should adjourn because a racing carnival is in progress.",17
37,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,Will the honourable member answer for the attendance of the members of his party?,17
38,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I will answer for myself. If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Melbourne differ from me upon this question, they have a perfect right to do so. I know that in England it is customary for the House of Commons to adjourn when the Derby is being run.",17
39,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The honourable member is quite wrong.,17
40,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The House of Commons used to adjourn upon the occasion in question, because I recollect that. Sir Wilfred Lawson always objected to the adoption of that course, but the motion was always carried against him. It is a disgrace that the National Parliament should adjourn on Tuesday merely because a racing carnival is being held.",17
41,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [10.50] - I did not hear the Prime Minister make reference, when moving the motion, to any racing carnival. He simply explained - that a certain number of honourable members were away at Oodnadatta, and that there might possibly be a difficulty in securing a quorum at 3 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon. The honourable member for Barrier opposes the motion on the ground that its object is to enable certain honourable members fo attend a race meeting. I do not know whether that is so or not. I do not pretend to be an authority on those matters, but I am prepared to be here at 3 o'clock on Tuesday. When the honourable member was asked by interjection if he would be present to help to form a quorum at that hour, he replied "" No, certainly not, it was not his business to assist the Government to form a quorum."" I was glad to notice that he afterwards repented of that statement, and said he would be here - If he and other members of his party are present, it will be a new experience both for him and them to be bere when the House meets. Our experience, day after day, has been that the Opposition have been conspicuous by their, absence at the ordinary meeting time. The honourable member, and a number of other honourable members on the same side,. are scarcely ever present when prayers are being read. I do not know whether that is because there is anything in the prayers to which they object, but with the exception of one or two who stroll in just to save their face, the Opposition, including the honourable member for Barrier, absent themselves in a body while they are being read. In the face of that fact, the new born zeal which the honourable member has pretended to display today, for the House to meet at the usual time on Tuesday, and for punctuality in the attendance of other honourable members, is very refreshing. Will the honourable member undertake to be here at 3 o'clock on Tuesday, and also to secure the attendance of other honourable members on that side?",17
42,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"No , certainly not.",18
43,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Then his insincerity is at once apparent. If he will do that, I undertake to say that there will be a quorum present at 3 o'clock. The matter rests entirely with those honourable members themselves. If they are willing to attend, business can be proceeded with. The object of the motion is as much as anything to meet their convenience, because it is known that some of them will be the principal offenders in not being present at 3 o'clock on Tuesday. I object to the honourable member for Barrier attempting to make a little political capital for himself and his party out of the motion, at the expense of those on this side of the chamber. Several honourable members interjecting,",18
44,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I must again appeal to honourable members to preserve order. I am endeavouring to conduct the proceedings with as much patience as possible, but it is exceedingly distressing to have to continually call honourable members to order. Every honourable member knows that an honourable member who is addressing the House is entitled, so long as he is in order, to be heard without interruption. .1 trust that I shall not be compelled to exercise powers which are inherent in the Chair in order to secure a hearing to any honourable member. I hope honourable members will assist me to insure that this question shall be debated quietly and calmly.",18
45,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"May I ask the honourable member for Barrier, and some of his colleagues, a pertinent question? Where was he, and where were they, when prayers were being read today? The honourable member was outside. His place is not outside, but inside, the chamber.",18
46,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I rise to order. I submit that the honourable member for Lang is out of order in asking another honourable member a question when making a speech, seeing that under the Standing Orders, the honourable member referred to is not allowed to reply.",18
47,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The interrogative form, although I do not agree with it, is often used in debate; but I ask the honourable member for Lang not to use it if it distresses another honourable member.",18
48,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"If you, sir, say that the interrogative form is not to be used, I shall not use it, but it is commonly employed in this and other Parliaments, and by no one more frequently than the honourable member who raised the point of order. A rhetorical question of that sort is not expected to elicit a direct reply, but any honourable member who desires to do so can rise later and give an answer. It is fair to ask honourable members opposite, as they are so punctilious about the meeting of the House on Tuesday, how it is . that, day after day, they make a regular practice of not attending the House at the usual time of meeting. They slip in one after the other after prayers have been read, and fire a lot of questions off at Ministers. If they are so particular about honourable members being present at 3 o'clock on Tuesday, it is only reasonable to ask them to assist the Government to make a House on that day for the purpose of carrying on the business of the National Parliament. Let the honourable member for Barrier show his sincerity in this regard by not only putting in an appearance himself at 3 o'clock, but also seeing that his colleagues, who arepaid to do this work, attend to do the business of the House, instead of going to the Melbourne Cup. If he will undertake to assist the Government in that way, I think I can fairly promise that the Government can meet the House at 3 o'clock on Tuesday,and that there will be a sufficient number of honourable members on this side, with the assistance of honourable members opposite, to form a quorum.",18
49,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [10.58] It is a pleasant interlude in our debates to see so much good humour displayed. I shall support the motion, regretting only that the hour for the meeting is not fixed for half-past 7 p.m. instead of half-past 4/ J have no decided intention of going to the Cup meeting, but members of my family, no doubt, will be there, and I may join them. 1 was astonished to hear the honourable member for Barrier quote the Spectator. I am afraid that there would be a marked absence of Labour members from this Parliament if that newspaper had its way. The honourable member for Barrier's constituents, who comprise some of the finest fellows I have even seen, would attend the Melbourne Cup meeting to a man if it was held near where they live, and still vote for the honourable member afterwards.",18
50,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,-And yet the honourable member for Lang says I am trying to make political capital out of the question ! I quoted the Spectator for the benefit of the Minister of Defence.,19
51,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I am glad the honourable member did not quote it for my benefit, because, it it had its way, I should not be here today. This matter is involved in one of our Standing OrCers. You, sir, are blind, and unable to see for yourself whether there is a quorum present. The omcers of Parliament are not permitted to draw your attention to it.",19
52,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,That is not fair to the Speaker.,19
53,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"If , sir, there is anything objectionable to you in that remark, I am prepared to withdraw it with a heart and a half, but the honourable member for Lang is misconstruing it. Unfortunately, according to our Standing Orders, even if there vvere only three members present, as happened in the House of Lords on one occasion, you could not become officially cognisant of the fact unless your attentibn was drawn to it by a member of the House. I am going to throw out a challenge to the honourable member for Barrier. If the honourable member is really in earnest in regard to the course that he intends pursue,- then it will be his duty, if there not a quorum present on Tuesday afterway noon, to call attention to the fact. Some remarks made by the honourable member for Lang in reference to the prayers were not justifiable. I confess that in my school days them. I used to dodge prayers, but I was younger then : and the observations of the honorton able member for Lang were not quite fair to a man like the honourable membev for there. Barrier, whose sincerity in his religious beliefs no one doubts. In London alone there are 450 registered religions, and adherents of each think that the remaining 449 are wrong, in some way or other. would be better for honourable members to show a little more humanity in pointing their arguments. Those who are at all familial with horse-racing know that many men, including some owners of race-horses, who attend race meetings, never make a bet. I have seen races run, not for any prize, but for sheer love ot the sport, and I do not think that racing necessarily depends upon betting. The totalizator reduces betting, but it has not had the effect of reducing horse-racing. I do not wish to move an amendment, but I should like the Prime Minister to agree to the adjournment of the House until 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday next. That would give perfect freedom for the day to the officers of the House, and there would be no doubt as to their attendance here being required during the afternoon. I should like to go to Flemington, but it is very improbable that I shall be there. Let us display some common-sense in dealing with a matter of this kind. A number of honourable members, the majority of whom a members of the Labour party, left yestekday to inspect the railway to Oodnadatta, which is to link the north with the south; and, after all, what will be the loss of one afternoon in a session of so many days ? If the Prime Minister. would amend his motion in the way I have suggested he would remove a difficulty. We should have a common-sense adjournment, not for an hour and a half, but until 7.30 p.m. At that hour there would be a good attendance, and we should be able to take up and push on with our work. ' Mr AGAR WYNNE (Balaclava) [11.3]. - The suggestion just made by the honourable member for Melbourne is a very good one. If some honourable members, like the honourable member for Barrier and a few others who pose as being particularly good, were to to attend Flemington on the occasion of a is race meeting, and see for themselves the in which the proceedings are conducted, they would be agreeably surprised. The behaviour of the people on the course would be in the nature of a revelation to On Cup Day there are from 100,000 to 120,000 people on the Flemingrace-course, and during the whole day not one intoxicated man is to be found That in itself speaks well for the orderly conduct of the people of Australia. It shows that at a gathering which the is considered by many to have a bad influence on the community, the people can It enjoy themselves rationally.",19
54,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Then the honourable member says that we should adjourn for the dav.,20
55,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"No ; I simply support the suggestion made by the honourable member for Melbourne, that we should adjourn until 7.30 on Tuesday evening. Great culty will be experienced in obtaining a quorum at 4.30 p.m., and if the Prime Minister's proposal is carried, the officers of the House will be obliged to remain in attendance here"" during the whole day, when other members of the Public Service will be enjoying a holiday, whether they go to the races or not. How would the honourable member for Barrier feel if he were an officer of this House, and knew that while he had to remain on duty every public officer outside the House staff had a holiday, and was free to go down the Bay or to Flemington, or anywhere that he pleased ?",20
56,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Then an adjournment until 4.30 p.m. is no good?',20
57,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"No ; but if we adjourned until 7.30 p.m., the officers the House would have the day to themhorse-racing, selves. If the honourable member Barrier does not raise any serious objection to that suggestion, I am sure that the Prime Minister will adopt it.",20
58,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I do not care whether the House adjourns for a week or more.,20
59,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [11.6]. - I did not hear the arguments advanced posite, by the Prime Minister, nor the major tion of the reply made by the honourable the member for Barrier. I understand, ever, that in the face of a business paper phenomenally long, comprising matters fundamental importance, it is proposed to waste several very valuable hours in order that honourable members may see a horse-race. We are on the eve of a. general election, the honourable member for Lang, who is bebe ing pursued by a Presbyterian clergyman, finds himself in a very awkward position. He wants to have a holiday-althoug h do not suppose he knows a horse from camel-bu the does not like to run the risk of losing any votes in his electorate by patronizing a race meeting.",20
60,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I have never been to a race meeting in my life. - Mr HUGHES - I have never had to concern myself as to whether I ought to go to this' place or that. I go where please. As a matter of fact, I do not know the name of a horse entered for the Melbourne Cup, but I think that the proposal that we should adjourn on Cup Day until 4.30 p.m. is sheer lunacy. It is an attempt at that sort of compromise with evil of which men of weak characters are guilty. What is the use of adjourning until 4.30 p.m. ? diffi- Dr WILSON' - Le t us make it 7.30 p.m.",20
61,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"There would be some sense in a proposition of that kind. Either we are coming here on Tuesday afternoon to do what we are paid for, or we are not. If we are not, why all this pretence? I shall be here as usual at 3 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, and if the House does not meet at that hour, I shall not be back again until 7.45 p.m - I am not going to apply to my soul such a wretched ointment as the Government offer. Every honourable member who votes for the adjournment of the House until 4.3b p.m. on Tuesday will pray to his particular God that no one will be here at that hour to carry out the business of the House. The Prime Minister stands midway between the sinners and the saints. of He does not bother yery much about but he is surrounded by a for number of honourable members who think of nothing else. They are unable at this season of'the year to speak rationally on any subject bar horses and horse-racing. When one is in the lift, one hears them asking, "" What do you think of so and so?"" I heard an honourable member opwhile in the lift last pornight, talking to another member of Ministry about horses. One howwould imagine that nothing in this wide world mattered save which horse was of going to win the Melbourne Cup. I do not take any exception to that, but if that is the temper of honourable members, we might as well adjourn until a quarter to and 8 o'clock, because those members will not here at half-past 4 o'clock. Once a man goes io the Flemington race-course, he will not tear himself away from what is going I on there to get back here at half-past a 4 o'clock. A. man like the Prime Minister, who lives a detached life, and does not bother about horses, might do so; but the average member of Parliament would be unable to do so. I shall be here at 3 o'clock, and the honourable member for Barrier savs that he will be here also, though I do not answer for the honourable I member. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie takes a view of this question which differs from that of the honourable member for Earrier, and he probably will not be here. I shall be prepared, in the honourable member's absence, to do what I can to present his views to the House, and may, if necessary, prolong my remarks until the honourable member can get here and speak for himself. I shall vote against an adjournment until half-past 4 o'clock. I am in favour of meeting at 3 o'clock, in the usual way, but I shall be prepared to consider very favourably a proposal that we should not meet on Tuesdav until a quarter to 8 o'clock in the evening.",20
62,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson; [11.14] - I believe that the motion submitted by the Prime Minister should be accepted. If there is a quorum present at half-past 4 o'clock on Tuesday, we can go 011 with the business of the country, and if there is not a quorum present at that hour, Mr Speaker can delay taking the chair until there is a quorum. I think the motion proposes a great improvement upon previous, arrangements made for the meeting of the House on Cup Day. I have known the House, on former occasions, to meet at the ordinary time, and I have also known its meeting, though fixed for the ordinary time, should a quorum be present, to be delayed until a quorum arrived. Honourable members opposite did not appear very anxious fo form a quorum for the meeting of the House today, and it is for themselves to determine whether they will be present at half-past 4 o'clock on Tuesday next. The Prime Minister has adopted the right course. The honourable gentleman knows, as does every other member of the House, that Cup Day in Melbourne is regarded as a national holiday. No fewer than 120,000 people may be seen on the Flemington race-course on Cup Day, and the sight is a magnificent one. My children are not yet. old enough to go to the race-course, but as soon as they are I shall be glad to take them to see the great concourse of human beings who assemble there on. Cup Day. I have been there frequently myself. I have no intention at present to go to the course next week. I do not appear to have the betting instinct, but I do admire magnificent horses; and the race meetings held throughout Australia, and especially that held in connection with the Melbourne Cup, have done much to encourage the breeding of high-class blood stock. As a result, Australia stands head and shoulders over the great South American Republic of the Argentine in the raising of fine horses, and over' the Republic of Chili, from which country we imported horses in the earlydays, and in so doing almost ruined our stock. The Melbourne Cup race is a great carnival, and is the means of bringing together the finest blood stock in the world. I am given to understand that even betting men get a fair run for their money in the Melbourne Cup. It is a fair race, in which every horse runs to win, and every man who takes an interest in fair horse-racing should make it his business to witness it . I did not hear the honourable member for Barrier say anything against going to races. Many thousands go who do not believe in horse-racing. Cup Day is acknowledged as a great carnival day, and I know that twenty years ago the Young Men's Christian Association held a great picnic on that day. Young men were attracted from all parts of Australia by the knowledge that it was gala time in Melbourne. I do not know that they went to the race-course, but man; people who are religiously inclined, and are against betting, hold their picnics on the Flemington ground, on a place which, I believe, is known as the "" flat. "" I have been upon the flat myself, where all sorts and conditions of men are to be found, and I shall have no objection to going there on some future occasion. I am not aware whether it is necessary to pay a shilling to go on the flat, or whether one can go there for nothing.",21
63,Mr REID,Unknown,The frequenters of the flat are on the free list.,21
64,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Then probably that is where I shall be. This goes to show that I have no prejudice. En passant, I may say that I lived for five years next to the Randwick race-course, and did not attend the races held there once during that time. I had opportunities of seeing the horses when they were being trained and exercised. A person who lives at Randwick does not require to go on to the race-course to see the best stock in the world. I may mention that for some vears I represented the municipality of Randwjck in its Council. In this House the locality is known as Wentworth. The honourable member for Wentworth is merely my successor. Needless to say, I retired, and the honourable member had an open field. I have no prejudice against hdrse-.racing, and think that the Prime Minister has done the right thing in submitting his motion in the form in which it is before us. For my own part, I shall be here at ha If-past 4 o'clock on Tuesday. I do not sav that I shall not he at the race meeting, though I have made no arrangements to go.

65,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [11.21] - l t may be a misfortune for me, but still it is a fact that I take the duties of a member of Parliament seriously. I am here as a trustee for the people. I contend that it 1 is our duty, as members of Parliament, to pay you, Mr Speaker, at least as much respect as we expect children to pay to us as their seniors. We should also set an example to the people of Australia in regard to the dignity of ""our proceedings, and our respect and courtesy towards one another. When I first came here, I was imbued with a sense of responsibility, realizing that I belonged to the National Parliament. Holding such views, I am rather surprised that such a motion as this should have been submitted. Private members' b""siness has been set on one side in order to enable public business to be despatched. 1I have nothing to say as to what is to take place in the city of Melbourne next week, but we have the business of the peopleof Australia to transact. There are twenty items of business upon the notice-paper, irrespective of the questions standing in the names of private members. We should endeavour to utilize every hour that is available in giving to that business the consideration that it deserves, until the end of the session. my opinion, to adjourn for an hour, or an hour and a half, on account of a race meeting should be beneath the dignity of the National Parliament of Australia.",22

71,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"An honourable member whose home is hundreds of miles away from Melbourne might prefer to spend a holiday there to going to a race meeting. I am not now complaining about the desire of honourable members to have a day's holiday; but if some wish to have a holiday for such a purpose, why should not other honourable members have a similar opportunity to take their pleasure in another direction ? If the motion be agreed to, it means that I , with others, shall have to come from New South Wales in time to do business when the House meets on Tuesday. If there is not a quorum present, we shall have to mope about in idleness. I claim no special virtue because I do not like horse-racing.",22

It is very seldom that I am able to get home at the week-ends, and an extra day to enable me to do so would be very welcome. The honourable member for Lang had the audacity to say that he did not know this motion was for the express purpose of allowing certain honourable members to see the Melbourne Cup; and the Prime Minister told iis that the special adjournment is proposed because a visit of inspection is being paid to Oodnadatta.",22
79,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Hear , hear; that is quite true.",22
80,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It is not quite true, and' it is not honest to give that as the reason. It is well known that the honourable members who are visiting Oodnadatta cannot return to Melbourne until Wednesday ; and why humbug the people by arranging for a meeting on Tuesday? I suppose the picture on the Flemington lawn would not be quite complete without the Treasurer, in all his pomp and glory. change in the attitude of the honourable member for Robertson. Yesterday he was a severe critic of the Government, but, after the threat this morning by the Age that he shall have opposition at the polls, he is quite a friend of the present Administration. . Mr HENRY WILLIS - I have not read the Age, and did not know of the article until this moment.",23

The honourable member for Lang made some reference to the non-attendance honourable members on this side at prayers; but we know that when the honourable memister, ber himself sat in Opposition, he, time after time, deliberately stayed outside the door until prayers were read. The honourable member desires to convey the impresmeet sion to the public that the absence or prechoose sence of members indicates that they favourable or otherwise to the reading prayers; but such an impression would be day afternoon. absolutely incorrect, and the suggestipn the honourable member is a contemptible one. Now that the general election is at hand, the honourable member for Lang and others Minister has taken up. like himself are attitudinizing; and that is not surprising, considering that they not come here because of any political gramme, but are elected on the sectarian centage of the electors vote. issue. As a matter of fact, this is another attempt to raise that miserable issue, which has really nothing to do Federal politics. I have no doubt the honourable member will shortly come to the conclusion that all who absent selves from prayers are absolute and, therefore, object to the Lord's Prayer being read. I am sorry that the Standing Orders will not permit me to apply the - most appropriate term to the attitude the honourable member.",23
82,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The man is mad !,23
83,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I think that the constituency of Lang is fast awakening to the fact that it has a representative who simply attudinizes in a theatrical fashion, and that there is absolutely no sincerity behind his cant, humbug, and sectarianism. I assert most emphatically that he knows that the reason for the submission of this motion is that the Melbourne Cup race I notice the is to be run on Tuesdav afternoon. It has been stated that if certain honourable members were not absent on a visit to Oodnadatta it would not have-been moved. Why was not a similar motion submitted yesterday when it was known that they would be absent today?",23

Certain honourable members left Melbourne afternoon for Oodnadatta, and will yet the House met at half-past 10 o'clock Surely that is a complete answer to the attitude of the honourable Cup member for Lang and the Prime Minister.

The interjection goes into Hansard, and their constituents think that they have made quite a serious observation, but "" Wednesday."" instead of that, they were merely grinning all over their faces. The interjections reported, but the grinning is not. Mr TpDOR - Hansar d should be illushere trated.",24

If there is to be a holiday to enable certain honourable members to attend ParFlemington race-course, the House ought be honest and adjourn until Wednesda'y,. so as to convenience those who derive pleasure from an extra day at home.

I have the occupants of the Treasury bench pulling at my coat tails, and asking me not to say anything to delay the business of the House, but that will not prevent rne from saying what I have to say. I am not deceived by the cheers which come from those who sit on the other side. I have their measure; .1 know exactly who and what they are. What I object to is this cant and humbug. I have represented to the best of my ability men whom I am proud to represent. 1 feel sure that if I required a holiday, none of them would offer an objection, and, what is more, very few of them would object to me going to see the Melbourne Cup race run. Why? If we wish to help the pooi and the suffering in my electorate, if we wish to help the class which the so-called Labour men in the House are supposed to represent, what do we do? We get up a race meeting.",25

Is it not ridiculous and Pecksniffian for this House to sit all through a bright summer's day and when the Melbourne Cup is being run? It is rather fortunate that the debate is taking place at this moment, because it furnishes a grand argument in favour of our establishing, as soon as we can, a city of our own, where we shall be able to regulate such things as we desire. But for a man like the honourable member for Barrier to take advantage of this question to elevate himself in the eyes of his electorate is not right. He quoted from a religious newspaper, the Spectator, to show what a good, honest, and upright man he is. I cannot believe that he is genuine. I always endeavour to get here to hear prayers read at the beginning of the sitting, but this morning I saw the honourable member for Barrier walk in after prayers had been read. Is that propei conduct for a member of a religious sect? Certainly not. I express my utmost contempt for men such as he. I am glad of the opportunity to say this : Should Cup Day be fine, and I feel that I need a holiday, I shall not hesitate to go to the races.",25

180,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is the invariable practice that only the point of order taken need - be stated, and that any debate on a point of order takes place only because the Chair desires to hear further arguments relating to some abstruse matter, so that it may be settied. The honourable member has stated his point of order, and I am now prepared to rule with regard to it. If , however, the honourable member has not completed the statement of his point of order, and desires to do so, but does not wish to debate it, I am prepared to hear him.

181,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I desire to complete my statement of the point of order. I think that the standing order will justify the view which I have expressed to you.

It is quite common for an honourable member in this House to rise as I did, and to say "" I have a suggestion to make.""

209,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"In my opinion, the proper course, under the Standing Orders, is that immediately it is resolved "" That the question be now put"" the question then before the Chair is dealt with. The House having dealt with the question, I rose in my place to make a speech.",30
210,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I have already ruled in the matter.,31
211,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I am telling you, sir, what I did. I do not know what may be in your mind, but I am simply relating facts. I rose immediately the question was put, and, without any point of order being raised, you called upon me as the honourable member for Kennedy, and I began to address myself to the motion. It is true that I said that I had a suggestion to make, but no words are more commonly used in this House. Honourable members frequently make use of such a phrase in submitting all kinds of motions. I got up deliberately to move an amendment, which I did move, and it was after I had sat down that the Prime Minister moved "" That the question be now put."" I merely wish to say that when I rose I did so deliberately, knowing that I had a right to do so at that particular stage of the proceedings, and I made my speech in the ordinary way, and not as a point of order, and moved an amendment in the ordinary way, which this House has declined to have anything to do with.",31
212,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I wish, sir, to direct your attention to the fact that, while the bells were ringing for the last division, the honourable member for Lang came into the chamber and went out again. I ask whether the honourable member was in order in doing so. His name is not recorded in the division.",31
213,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member was quite in order. Later,",31
214,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It may have appeared inconsistent that I , being entirely in favour of an adjournment over Tuesday next, should have voted against any adjournment. What I did vote for was to create a blank in the motion, so that some other time might be filled in.",31
215,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I have been informed that immediately after the vote' was taken on the motion for adjournment, the honourable member for. Cook rose and pointedly drew attention to the fact that I walked out of the chamber when the vote was about to be taken. It is quite true that I did so, but I was paired with the honourable member for Corio, who was not able to be present until half-past 12 o'clock. As the honourable member for Cook has drawn attention to the matter merely for political purposes, and to try to discredit me in the eyes of my constituents, I take this opportunity of making an explanation and at the same time to suggest that as he has been one of the worse offenders in absenting himself at prayer time, he should be here on Tuesday.",31
216,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - It may look strange that I , like the - honourable member for Herbert, voted against an adjournment.. The reason why I voted as I did was to protest against what I consider to be the hypocritical section of the people of this country.",31

221,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra-Minister of Home Affairs) [12.35] - I beg to move That this Bill he now read a second time. I have now an opportunity to invite the attention of honourable members to a great national question. The object of this Bill, ' which has come to us from another place, is to fix the territory in which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be established. It is with feelings of very great pleasure that, as Minister of Home Affairs, I submit the Bill to the consideration of the House. I do not propose to refer to anything that 'took place in connection with this question prior to the passage, at the close of last session, of the Bill, which was introduced by the Administration led by the honourable member for Wide Bay. In this matter the present Government are following the example of the Reid-MCLean Administration in submitting a Bill in connection with the acceptance of Dalgety, and the example of the Fisher Administration in submitting the measure which was passed at the close of last session. action taken by the Fisher Government called for the hearty approval of the people, not only of New South Wales, but of all parts of the Commonwealth. The Jate Prime Minister and his Minister of 'Home Affairs showed a proper appreciation of the position, and, as appears from the correspondence, an earnest desire to have this matter settled in the interests the Commonwealth generally. They have already been accorded a meed of praise for what they did in connection with this question while in office. I feel sure that the desire which actuated them at that time still actuates them, and that they will give the present Government all the assistance they can to have this important matter definitely and finally settled. think I am right in saying that the great majority of the members of this House desire that the question, which has caused so much friction in the past, shall now be finally disposed of. T hope to be able to - show that the Yass-Canberra district, selected by this Parliament as the district in which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth should be located, possesses all the requisites for the establishment of a great city, including great natural advantages, easy communication from all parts of Australia, and a magnificent water supply. . Mr MATHEWS - How can the honourable gentleman say that it possesses a magnificent water supply?",31
222,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I hope to have the earnest attention of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and other honourable members who, like him, have some doubt as to the adequacy of the water supply available in this district. I think I shall be able to satisfy even the most critical member of the House that there is in this territory an ample supply of water available for domestic and civic purposes for the Federal Capital, and that, under the agreement entered into with the Premier of New 'South Wales on behalf of that State, we shall have the right to obtain from the Snowy River, and any other stream we may think it desirable to use, a sufficient supply for the development of electric power for lighting purposes, the running of trams, and any other purpose necessary to the complete equipment of the capital. I said in opening that I did not wish to take honourable members back to anything The prior to the passage of the Bill of 1908 by the Fisher Administration. On the passage of that Bill, the late Minister of Home Affairs, on the 21st December, 1908, gave certain instructions to Mr District Surveyor Scrivener. Honourable members will agree that those instructions were very carefully framed to cover all the requirements which of the Minister thought necessary for the Capital, and in the subsequent report from Mr Scrivener, and from the Advisory Board, the matters referred to in those instructions' were fully inquired into, and the district found to be equal to all the requirements. It may be a little tiresome to recount them, but I think it is necessary that honourable members, and all I interested in this question, should know the various steps which have brought us to the present stage. The honourable member for Coolgardie, as Minister of Home Affairs, on the 21st December, 1908, gave the following instructions to Mr. ScrivenerTo make a thorough topographical investigation of the Yass-Canberra district, with the object of placing such facts before the Minister as will enable Parliament to decide on the most suitable territory for the purposes of the Seat of Government within the district referred to, and that the work should be divided into three phases:(«) Preliminary reconnaissance, covering the whole of the district, and embracing the catchment area of the water supply governing the same. (£) Topographical investigation of that portion or portions of the district which, during the reconnaissance, are shown to possess the requisite characteristics for the Commonwealth territory. (c) Contour survey of the suggested site or sites for the Federal Capital City. The Minister then summarized the essentials of the Territory in the following manner:(a) That it includes a site or sites possessing the necessary topographical characteristics for the Federal Capital. (£) That it includes the catchment area of the water supply for the Capital-suc h water supply must be of sufficient magnitude to place the question of volume at all seasons, and purity, beyond doubt. A note was attached to that statement to the following effect:It is desirable that the catchment area shall be in the proximity of the Capital site, but should the topographical examination of the district disclose the fact that such a condition is not practicable, then the catchment area must be connected with the Territory, including the site for the Capital-that is to say, severance must be avoided Honourable members who have followed the reports in this connection, and who have taken advantage of the opportunity to examine the maps, will find that the instructions of the Minister have been carried out. It has been found that the district selected for the Federal Capital will embrace the catchment of the Cotter and other rivers which are considered to be suitable, and which will provide an ample, water supply for the city. The next essential pointed out by the Minister was in regard to sanitation, as to which he saidSanitation - That the site provides for a perfect system of sanitation, not only so far as the city itself is concerned, but generally. The next heading related to accessibilityIt is requisite that the site be easy of access from Sydney and Melbourne, and, through them, from the other capital cities; also with a suitable harbour on the coast. I shall be able to point out to honourable members later that the requirement thus referred to distinctly by the Minister has also been carried out. The Surveyor was likewise instructed that he should bear in mind that the Federal Capital must be a beautiful city, occupying a commanding position, with extensive views and embracing distinctive features, lending themselves to the evolution of a design worthy of the object and suitable, not only for the present, but for all time. Consequently, the potentialities of the site demand most careful consideration from a hygienic stand-point, with a view to securing picturesqueness, and also with the object of beautification and expansion. The Surveyor, at the instance of the then Minister of Home Affairs, having received those instructions, proceeded to make his inquiries, and, on the 25fh February, 1909, he reported thatHe had made an inspection of the area embraced by Yass-Canberra, inspected all the sites within that area, and that the Canberra site approaches nearer to what is required than any other which he Iiad inspected in the district. The general level of the country about Canberra lies between 1,900 and 2,000 feet, while some of the higher hills reach an altitude of nearly 2,800 feet above sea level. is intersected by the Molonglo River, a stream with a catchment area of about 700 square miles. It was recommended that the area through which the Molonglo and the Queanbeyan Rivers flow should be reserved as a water catchment area, not for the purposes of a domestic supply, pr for civic purposes, but rather for the beautification of the Federal City. This area, it was recommended, should be under ihe control of the Federation, in order to prevent pollution of the water, and to enable the water to be stored for ornamental purposes. Mr. Scrivener went on to sayA city located at Canberra would be visible on approach for many miles-street s with easy gradients would be readily designed-whil e prominent hills of moderate altitude present, suitable sites for the principal public buildings. The Capital would probably lie in an amphitheatre of hills, with an outlook towards the north and north-east, well sheltered from both southerly and westerly winds, and in the immediate vicinity of the Capital there are large areas of gently undulating country that would be suitable for evolutions of large bodies of troops. Generally speaking, he regarded Canberra as the best site which could be obtained, beingProminently situated, and yet sheltered, while facilities are afforded for storing water for ornamental purposes at a reasonable cost. Dealing with water supply, Mr Scrivener pointed out thatThe Cotter River will provide a supply of perennially clear and pure water, sufficient for the domestic and civic requirements of a population up to 200,000, and with a f e r cafita consumption of not less than 100 gallons per day.",32
223,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think we should have more honourable members present to hear this speech. [Quorum formed.'],33
224,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I would point out that will the water supply provided for is considerably larger than the daily allowance made for the residents of Melbourne or Sydney. In Melbourne the provision made is for about 59 gallons per day, and in Sydney the supply amounts to 40 gallons per inhabitant per day. So that our dailv allowance of water for the residents of the Federal Capital is much more liberal. Mr. Scrivener also reported thatFirst, it is essential that the whole of the catchment area of the Cotter River should be acquired, in order that a pure water supply may be placed beyond doubt, and, seeing that the Molonglo River traverses the Capital site, and should become a distinguished feature in the future, it is equally necessary that the catchment of that river and of the Queanbeyan The site should be included If the Federal Capital is to be a model city, then it is essential that the Territory should embrace such an area, that all streams flowing through the city site, or near it, should be controlled by the Commonwealth Government. Both of these things have been done in regard to the Cotter River, sovereign rights over which have been secured to the Commonwealth. In regard to the Molonglo and Queanbeyan areas, we shall have complete rights so far as water is concerned. Regarding the railway, Mr Scrivener reported- The Canberra site is already accessible from the Cooma railway; but, in order that the length of journey might be reduced, a connecting line should be run from about Yass to Queanbeyan-the length of this line would be about 50 miles, measured from the main southern railway, and no engineering difficulties would be encountered. This line would at once pay interest, and would ultimately yield a considerable profit. The route the line would take can only be determined after the exact site for the Capital is fixed. A precis of the Board's action statesThis report was referred by the Minister of Home Affairs, on the 2nd March last, to an Advisory Board comprising-Secretar y for Home Affairs, Chairman; Commonwealth D i rector-General of Works, Government Architect for New South Wales, Mr District-Surveyor Scrivener, Members, for consideration and report as to the positions of the district demanding closer investigation and survey generally. The Advisory Board, on the 8th March, informed the Minister that they concurred generally with the conclusion arrived at by Mr. ' Scrivener, and were of opinion that the most suitable sites are about Canberra, on lands comprised in Duntroon and adjoining holdings where the physical and scenic qualifications required for the Capital site of the Commonwealth are best met. The Board recommended, with a view to placing them in a position to advise as to the exact locality of the city site, that the essential features should be tested by actual survey, and the more prominent of them covered by a contour survey of the locality indicated on the map accompanying their report. That recommendation of the Board was subsequently carried out. The Board further agreed with Mr Scrivener in his recommendation respecting the Territory to be acquired by the Commonwealthj because it includes the site for the Capital site, and the catchment area required for the water supply of the city, and the catchment areas of the streams passing through the city, all of which will be required in its development. This recommendation embraced an area of, approximately, 1,000 square miles. The Board at the same time asked for further information respecting the possibilities ot the Molonglo and Queanbeyan Rivers, and the practicability of a scheme for the generation of power from the Cotter River; also, they recommended a further investigation as to irrigation areas in connection with the disposal of the effluent resulting from sewage purification. Mr Fuller. In connection with' the sewage, an investigation was made by Mr L . A. B. Wade, a well-known engineering expert, of Sydney.",33
225,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I think there ought to be a quorum present. [Quorum formed.""]",34
226,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Mr Wade reported that the Yass-Canberra site was well suited to the carrying out of modern sewage works, equal to the necessities of the anticipated population.",34
227,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"What system did he recommend ? M,r. FULLER - He recommended no 'particular system, but reported that the lay of the land lent itself to the adoption of several systems, any one of which would be equal to the requirements.",34
228,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Surely he indicated a practical system, because sanitation is a very important question ?",34
229,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"It is one of the most important questions, and I shall refer to it more fully later.",34
230,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,34
231,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"On the n t h . March the Minister of Home Affairs instructed Mr District Surveyor Scrivener to proceed with the contour survey recommended by the Advisory Board, and an investigation of the country between Canberra and the sea, with a view to ascertaining whether anv practicable railway routes could be found between the proposed site and the seaboard. The Prime Minister also asked the Premier of New South Wales to furnish the Commonwealth Government with all information from the State Departments respecting, first, the Molonglo River; secondly, the Queanbeyan River;. thirdly, the Cotter River, more particularly in connection with the report of the electrical engineer of the Public Works Department; and, fourthly, a railway route from Jervis Bay to the Goulburn-Cooir.a railway line. On the 26th May Mr Scrivener ""sent in his final report to myself as Minister of Home Affairs in relation fo the instructions issued to him on the n t h March. He reported that he had .made a contour survey ; that he had run the survey at various levels, ranging from 1,825 to 2,000 feet above the sea; the datum being the Cooma railway survey, and that the intermediate levels had been taken. He also reported that he had covered the greater part of the contoured area with a triangulation survey, and that the running of the contours had all been checked and found correct. He added that he had made an inspection of the country between Canberra and Jervis Bay, and discovered a very practicable railway route running from a point on the fioulburn-Cooma line, about 26 miles from Queanbeyan, to Jervis Bay, and with a ruling gradient of not more than 1 in 40, probably r in 50.",34
232,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"For - what distance? - Mr FULLER - The total distance from the actual site to Jervis Bay via Queanbeyan is 130 miles, but that includes 26 miles of the Goulburn-Cooma line from Queanbeyan north. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Will the Commonwealth own the territory extending from the site to Jervis Bay?",35
233,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"No . The Commonwealth will have the right to run a railway line from the site to Jervis Bay, and an area at the Bay for Federal purposes. Mr Scrivener also recommended that an area comprising 1,280 acres, that is, two square miles, should be set aside at the Bav for Commonwealth purposes. He pointed cut - it has since been confirmed, if confirmation was necessary-that in the Bay there is a splendid anchorage from three to five fathoms deep, very close to the shore, and that the part selected for the Commonwealth port is well sheltered from the south-easterly and easterly gales that raise the heavy sea from which shipping suffers on that coast from time to time. Mr. Scrivener^s report' was referred by me to the Advisory Board, who, on the 16th June, reported thatThe site most suitable for the purposes of the Federal City may be briefly described as a rectangular area, the eastern and western boundaries of the northern part resting on the slopes of Mount Ainslie and the Black Mountain, the southern boundary being intersected by the Narrabundah Range, running from Mugga Mugga Mountain towards"" the Molonglo River. This river, which flows through the area in a westerly direction, affords facilities for the vation of water for ornamental purposes. I may mention, in passing, that the water proposed to be used for ornamental purposes in the city wil] be obtained from the catchments of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo rivers, which are depicted on the right-hand side of the map in the chamber. It is proposed by the utilization of these waters to form a large lake for ornamental and aquatic purposes. It is estimated that it will be 4 miles long, and about forty feet deep, with a varying depth. Honourable members will see that a very large sheet of water will be made available, not only as an ornament to the city, but also as a place where its inhabitantswill be.able to enjoy themselves in boating and other ways. Respecting the sewerage of the city, the Advisory Board reported that no engineering difficulties would be encountered in a satisfactory disposal of the sewage and the effluent from treatment works. As regards water, the Board advised that there is a supply of perennial clear and pure water in the Cotter River. The Board practically endorsed everything which Mr Scrivener had said in his re- 4 port, to which I have alreadv referred honourable members, and which I do not propose, to reiterate in quoting from their report. They made special references to the Canberra water supply and to the railway to the port. They endorsed the opinion of Mr Scrivener that a practicable route could be found for communication between the site of the city and Jervis Bay. They also considered that before the location was finally decided upon an extensive examination of the intervening country should be made, so that all requirements might be met. A survey was accordingly carried out by Mr Kennedy, an officer in the Public Service of New South Wales. He recommended a route which is practically the same as that suggested by Mr Scrivener, and agreed in virtually all particulars with the report made by the latter as the result of his preliminary investigation. The Board thereupon further reported that it was of opinion that Jervis Bay would meet the requirements of the Commonwealth with respect to a port for the Capital, and that the area situated at the southern extremity of the bay, suggested by Mr Scrivener in his report, is the most suitable. Jervis Bay is an extensive sheet of water, and for years past has been used by the vessels of the Australian Squadron as a manoeuvring area. It is undoubtedly equal to all conserthe requirements of the Commonwealth as a port. Some years back, a number of honourable members had an opportunity to visit it, and I feel sure that all who saw it agree with Mr Scrivener and the Board that it will meet all future needs. On the 20th July last, the Prime Minister forwarded to the Premier of New South Wales various sets of papers connected with this matter, and drew his attention to several legal and constitutional questions. He asked that, to meet possible future requirements, the State should agree to give the Commonwealth the right to use the waters of the Snowy River for power purposes. That was agreed to by the Premier on behalf of the State.",35
234,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Does the agreement give the Commonwealth the right to carry wires through the territory of the State?,36
235,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Commonwealth has been given the right to construct whatever works may be necessary for the development of electric power, and its transmission to Federal Territory, not only from the Snowy, but from any other stream from which we may think it desirable to take it. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Will it be posmended by the Advisory Board. * sible to get to the Federal Territory out crossing New South Wales?",36
236,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Yes , from the port Jervis Bay. The Commonwealth has full quoted. He saidand complete power to construct a railway from Jervis Bay through the Territory. with Should the honourable member regard New South Wales as an. hostile country, he may be satisfied with that assurance. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We must not forit, get the attitude of Maryland in the war of i860.",36
237,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister also indicated to the Premier of New South Wales that he would be glad to receive an intimation that no objection would be offered to the construction of the line between the Territory and Jervis Bay. That also has been agreed to, and embodied in the agreement signed on behalf of the Commonwealth and the State. 16th September, the Premier submitted a series of motions to the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, of which the first reads(1.) That this State should surrender to the Commonwealth, territory containing an area of, approximately, 800 square miles, made up as follows :-(a ) All that area of about 435 miles shown on Mr Scrivener's plan,- which lies to the west of the Goulburn to Cooma railway, and includes the city site recommended by the Advisory Board, together with the catchment area of the Cotter River. As an area of 800 square miles would not meet the requirements of the Act of 1908, that was pointed out to the Premier, and he at once, without hesitation, added another 100 square miles to make up the 900 square miles which are required. The alternative area suggested by the Premier was submitted in the best of'faith. New South Wales has not attempted to dictate in any way to the Commonwealth in this matter. As a Commonwealth Minister, I was opposed to any alteration of the area recommended by the Advisory Board, but, after fully investigating the alternative suggested by the Premier, I came 10 the conclusion that it should be adopted. I hope that honourable members will agree with me in that. If they look at the map, they will see that the alternative area is more compact than that recommended by the Advisory Board, that it embraces the whole of the Cotter catchment-the stream chiefly relied on to supply the Federal ""Capital with water-and , in addition, water rights in respect to the catchment of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. Altogether, it is a better area than that recomLet me withnow read what was said by the Premier in submitting to the Legislative Assembly of at New South Wales the motion which I have We have recognised at all stages in connection, the discussion of this matter, that no sound objection can be raised to the Commonwealth having supreme control over the whole of the catchment area, because on the purity of the water and the control of the streams supplying is dependent the health and happiness of the people themselves. There is no reason why they should not have the same jurisdiction for protective purposes over the supply of water for domestic use, as they have over the city itself. At the beginning of his speech, he statedOur desire at this stage is to put before the Commonwealth Parliament, by way of suggestion, certain propositions which we hope will be the foundation of an agreement, upon which will be based the final formal act of surrender On the of territory, and acceptance by the Commonwealth for the seat of Government. In the first place we recognise that the final determination of the question under the Constitution rests in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. We can only claim to intervene in this question rather by way of suggestion of a helpful character than by way of square laying down a proposition for the Commonwealth's acceptance or rejection. We realise that although we have some re. sponsibility in this matter, it scarcely lies in the hands of the Government to do anything which has the appearance of intrusion into the peculiar sphere of the Commonwealth wilh regard to the final determination cf this question. Honourable members will therefore see thnt the alternative area was suggested with a view to assisting the Commonwealth. The next resolution affirmed by the New South Wales Parliament reads(2) That the right of the State to the use and control of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers and their tributaries, which are indicated on Mr."" Scrivener's plan, and lie to the east of the Goulburn to Cooma railway, should be subject to the requirements of the Commonwealth. That resolution has been embodied in the agreement with New South Wales, which' forms the schedule t/f the Bill, so that for water purposes the Commonwealth will - exercise full control over the catchment areas of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers, New South Wales undertaking on its part to keep those streams free from pollution. That State reserves the Crown lands within those areas from sale or lease, and undertakes to adopt all necessary precautions with a view to safeguarding the waters of those streams from being polluted in their passage to the Federal Territory.",36

239,Mr FULLER,Unknown,No . The waters of those streams are not intended for domestic purposes.,37
240,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,It is not possible drink from either of those straems and to live.,37
241,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I do not know about that. A good many persons have been drinking from them for a number of years, and are still alive. At the same time we terjection. know that those streams do become turbid readafter heavy rains, and that they are not so good for drinking purposes as are the monwealth Cotter, Gudgenby, Naas, and Paddv's territory Rivers.",37
242,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The Cotter will afford State an ideal supply of water for domestic purto poses if it possesses sufficient volume.,37
243,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I will give the honour the able member the figures relating to its volume presently. The other resolutions adopted by the New South Wales Parliathrough ment are as follow :(3) That this State is prepared, if so desired by the Commonwealth Parliament, to reserve from sale or lease all Crown lands within catchment area of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. (4) That this State should protect from tion the waters of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. (5) That this State should surrender to Commonwealth an area of about 2 square miles at Jervis Bay. (6) That for the purpose of providing access to the sea, the State should grant to the monwealth(a) the right to construct and maintain railway or other means of communiter. cation from the Seat of Government to territory which shall have been surrendered by the State to the monwealth at Jervis Bay; (i) the right, on terms to be agreed upon, to cross over or under any State railway, to connect with and run trains over any portion of a State railway. (7) That the Commonwealth should grant to the State, on terms to be agreed upon, the right to cross over or under, or to connect with and run trains over the railway constructed by the Commonwealth, which establishes communication between the Seat of Government and Jervis Bay.",37
244,Mr MAHON,Unknown,What about communication with Yass?,37
245,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Ne w South Wales is prepared to meet the Commonwealth in that matter. Should the Commonwealth construct a railway to the border of the Federal Territory, the State is prepared to link it up with Yass.",37
246,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,Is that part of the,37
247,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Yes . Resolution No. 8 reads(8) That in the event of the Commonwealth constructing a railway within Federal Territory to the northern boundary thereof, the State shall construct a railway from a point near Yass, on the Great Southern Railway, to join with the said railway. That resolution should dispel the doubt which the honourable member for Balaclava apparently entertained, judging by his inThe remaining resolutions (9) That this State should grant to the Comthe right to conduct through State to the Seat of Government electrical power from any place to be agreed upon. (10) That the surrender of territory by the should not be deemed a grant of the right interfere with the reasonable use of the waters of the Murrumbidgee River by the State, or citizens of the State of New South Wales. If honourable members will .look at the map they will see that the Murrumbidgee passes a portion of the proposed Federal Territory, and it is only proper-seein g that it is one of the largest rivers in New South Wales, and that its waters are not the required for Commonwealth purposesthat the State should have its rights preserved in that connection, especially as she polluis at present constructing the huge Barren Jack dam-upo n which about ,£3,000,000 the is being expended-for the purpose of irrigating a large area of country immediately below the Federal Territory. Resolution ComNo. 10 has therefore been inserted in the proposed agreement, in order to preserve a the rights of New South Wales in this matAfter these resolutions had been affirmed by both Houses of the New South ComWales Parliament, I submitted them to the Advisory Board. The Board, in their report of the 22nd September, re-affirmed their reasons for recommending the Terriportion tory to be acquired by the Commonwealth, including - the catchment areas of the longlo and the Queanbeyan Rivers, and stated that the adoption of the resolutions by the State Parliament will have the effect of curtailing the area of the Commonwealth Territory as recommended by the Advisory Board, by the withdrawal therefrom of the miles. catchment areas of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers lying to the south and east of the Goulburn-Cooma railway, containing an area of approximately square miles, the State proposing in lieu to enter into an agreement with the Coman monwealth, under which the right of the State to the use and control of the Queanimmediately beyan and the Molonglo Rivers and their tributaries-indicated on Mr Scrivener's plan and lying to the south and east of Goulburn-Cooma railway-shall be subject to the requirements of the Commonwealth. The Board regarded it as essential that the area under consideration should be vested in the Commonwealth, with a view to securing absolute control over the catchand ment of the rivers contained therein, the following reasons:-(a) to regulate the flow of the Molonglo River at the City when I was there. site-; (b) to prevent pollution within the area; (e) to adopt measures for minimizing are Mr. turbidity; (d) to regulate flood waters; and (e) to provide an auxiliary source water power. On the other hand, the there Board considered that the alternative conrivers. veyed in Resolution (2) may be accepted in lieu of their recommendation that the monwealth should-acquire the subject area I was there. under certain conditions, vi?., that in so doing the terms of the agreement to be entered into by the CommonAvealth and the State shall cover the essentials laid down, and empower the Commonwealth to perform such acts and to carry out such works at times as may by the Commonwealth be considered necessary; also, that the State undertakes to exercise such control over the area and to carry out such works as are as may be considered necessary to prevent pollution, including the sanitation of Queanbeyan; also, to reserve and dedicate all Crown lands within the catchment area, and to restrain the use of the waters within the catchment areas of the Molonglo and the Queanbeyan Rivers - either by the State, or others uncier State control-in manner inimical to the works referred to. The Board therefore advised that they could not but consider it-an advantage Ur. Fuller. include within the Federal Territory that of the catchment area of the Gudgenby River embracing an area of about Mo114 square miles above its effluence with the Orroral River, but that no benefit will be derived from the inclusion within the Federal Territory of the catchment areas of either Naas Creek or of Paddy's River, comprising, approximately, 251 square The position is that there are the two schemes before - Parliament, and on behalf of the Government, I take the responsibility of recommending the alterna580 tive scheme as submitted by New South Wales. Honourable members will see that area embracing 205 square miles, and comprising the Federal City and the area around it, is common to both schemes, and that the Cotter River catchment, which is the principal source of the water supply for domestic and civic purposes, is also common to .both schemes. In addition to the area originally recommended by the Advisory Board, there is included in the alternative scheme between the Cotter catchment and the Queanbeyan Molonglo catchment, the catchment of for the Gudgenby, Naas, and Paddy's Rivers.",37
248,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Paddy' s River was dry FULLER - Statement s of that sort of no use when we have before us the of absolute records taken by engineers sent specifically to test the value of these,38
249,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Seeing is believing, and Comthat river was dry at the junction when",38
250,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"That may, or may not, be correct, so far as Paddy's River is concerned, but let me tell the honourable member that I have seen the river which supplies the Prospect dam, and therefore the all city of Sydney, with its 600,000 inhabitants, cease running. Therefore, the fact that a river ceases running is no indication of the quantity of water available. I for you based the supply of the City of Sydney on the flow, at a particular time, of the river which supplies the Prospect darn, you could say that there would be no'water there at all, but the fact remains that from that catchment area, and from that river, there is derived an ample supply for over 600,000 people in Sydney and any its suburbs. The area of the Gudgenby, Naas, and Paddy's Rivers, is included in the alternative scheme submitted by Mr. to Wade An area of 580 square miles, ineluding the catchment of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers, was included in the Advisory Board's report and by Mr Scrivener for water, not for domestic or civic purposes, but merely for ornamental purposes in the city. In the scheme which I characterize as alternative, that catchment area is still included, although we have not sovereign rights over it, as we should have had under the Advisory Board's scheme. Still, we have in the agreement with New South Wales full rights over it with regard to the use of the water, secured by the reservation of land, the right to construct works, and in other ways, every precaution being taken to insure the water being kept as pure as possible. The total area in the original plan suggested by the Advisory Board was 1,015 square miles. In the alternative scheme, we have 900 square miles over which we have absolute sovereign rights, and, in addition, 580 square miles over which we have full water rights. So that, in the latter, we have practically 1,480 square miles of country, as against 1,015 square miles recommended by the Board. In the alternative scheme, the township of Queanbeyan is cut out.bf the area over which we have sovereign rights. Some honourable members in another place were deceived to a certain extent by the white line which appears on the map between the portion over which we have sovereign rights and the portion over which we have water rights. That line is merely put into indicate the boundary between those two areas. It does not in any way represent a thin strip of country belonging to New South Wales, as some honourable senators appeared to think.",38
251,Mr MAHON,Unknown,But according to the map we apparently take in part of the town of Queanbeyan.,39
252,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable member that if any portion of that township appears in the portion marked red-the portion over which we have sovereign rights-it is a mistake. The whole of that township is within the catchment area of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers, over which the CommonAvealth will have full water rights only.",39
253,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Upon one side of the line.,39
254,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Yes , upon the eastern side of the line.",39
255,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The railway really divides it. ['86],39
256,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The railway really divides the two portions of the Territory. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is anxious to learn, and I am willing to give, full particulars in regard to the quantity of water available for the Federal City. The first river to which I shallrefer is the Cotter, which is generally conceded to be the source of a magnificent water supply. When I read these figures,' I hope honourable members will bear in mind that they are calculated on the basis-of allowing each individual inhabitant .of the Federal Capital 100 gallons of water per head per day. The average for Sydney is 39-59 gallons, while for Melbourne it is close on 60 gallons, but even that is very much below the quantity allowed in all the calculations for the Federal Capital.",39
257,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,For purely domestic purposes ?,39
258,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Yes . The average daily consumption per head of population, of Sydney and suburbs is. 39.59' .gallons, the total average daily consumption of that city is 24,567,492 gallons, while the population of Sydney is 620,415 'persons. The population of Melbourne is 533,000 persons, the consumption per head per day is 595 gallons, and the daily consumption 2 is 31,582,000 gallons. The 'volumeof water discharged by the Cotter River from the 6th February, 1908, to the 5th February, 1909 - and I would remind honourable members that that was one of the driest years on recordwas 13,752,000,000 gallons. The 'mean daily discharge by the Cotter river in that year was 37,677,205 gallons. ' :Thnr is : : to say, the discharge by the Cotter River in one of the worse years on record would have sufficed for the supply of either Melbourne or Svdney and suburbs,. and left a large margin in reserve.",39
259,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Has the honourable member the monthly gaugings of tha'triver ? ;,39
260,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I have .not; but if honourable members wish to have .them. I can obtain them. During the month of August last, the flow of the Cotter River amounted to' 8,228,ooo,ooo''gallons; or an average of 265,140,000 gallons per day. The average consumption of 620^000 inhabitants of Sydney last year was 24,600,000 gallons per day, so that' sufficient water flowed down the CotterRiver during August last to ' supply Sydney and suburbs for '333*' days. The report with regard to the' Gudgenby, wbicb is included in this area, is that it gives a supply of perennially clear and pure water similar to that of the Cotter. The catchment area above the proposed site for a dam, at the 2,750-ft. level, is 114 square miles, and the estimated mean flow at the dam site is 14,874,000,000 gallons per annum. With a 25-in. rainfall, which the Government Meteorologist assures me would be a very small rainfall for that part of the country, it would be 10,050,000,000. There are two other rivers included within this catchment area. The first of these, the Naas, is a tributary' of the Gudgenby, and has an estimated mean run-off at the dam site of 5,989,000,000 gallons per annum. With a 25-in. rainfall its estimated mean runoff would be 4,047,000,000 gallons. Then we have Paddy's River, which has a catchment area of 88 square miles, and an estimated mean flow of 6,609,000,000 gallons per annum, or, with a 25-in. rainfall, 4,465,000,000 gallons per annum. Honourable members will recognise from these figures that a magnificent supply of absolutely pure, clear water is obtainable from these sources. A further report on the Cotter River was made by Mr E. M. De Burgh, Chief Engineer for Harbors and Water Supply, and was ordered to be printed by the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales on 21st July last. This report, from the highest official source, is dated 14th July, 1909, and reads as follows :I have the honour to report that the measurequirements ments of the flow of the Cotter River from ist January to 7th instant are now available. During that time 9,919,000,000, or an average of 52,753,400, gallons of water per day flowed down the river. During the same period 2,240,000,000 gallons flowed off the Sydney catchment into Cataract and Prospect; so that more than f o u i times as much water flowed down the Cotter as flowed into the Sydney storages. In the same period 650,000 people were supplied in the city of Sydney and suburbs with a' total quantity of 4,972,474,416 gallons, or an average of 26,449,322, gallons per day. So the unstored flow of the Cotter was twice as much as the consumption of 650,000 people for all needs. In view of all these facts, no reasonable man could have any doubt as to the water supply included within the catchment area being far more than is necessary to meet any demand that may be made upon it by the Federal Capital. As to the port which honourable members decided it was necessary that the Capital should have, a map exhibited in the chamber shows that Mr Fuller. portion of the south-eastern side of Jervis Bay to which I have already referred as having been reserved for this purpose. The sections coloured blue are part of New South Wales territory, which were reserved for defence purposes, but were never dedicated for those purposes, as it was thought that it would be unnecessary to do so. However, since the Federaf Capital will no doubt be connected by rail with Jervis Bay, the Government thought it desirable that every precaution should be taken to secure the land as necessary for the proper protection of the port, and it has, accordingly, been handed over to the Commonwealth. A ll these concessions have been granted willingly by New South Wales to the Federation in response to requests made from time to time by the late, as well as by the present, Ministry. They are all embodied in the agreement which forms the first . schedule to the Bill. I do not propose to refer at length to the Bill which I am asking the House to pass, because it is practically the same as the Act of 1904. It contains the provisions necessary in connection with a territory such as that to be acquired. It provides for the appointment of magistrates and deals with the jurisdiction of the High Court and.other matters for which it is necessary to provide, pending, I presume, the creation of a Constitution for the government of the Federal Territory. I respectfully' submit that we have in the site proposed to be taken over all the refor the establishment of a great city. Many honourable members have seen it, and must agree that its configuration and natural beauty fit in with the instruction given by my predecessor that such a site should be chosen as would permit of the creation of a beautiful city. The reports go to show that the requirements in respect of water supply and other essentials will be amply met by the selecr tion of the territory that I now recommend to the House. We shall also have the right to construct a railway from the Capital to Jervis Bay, so that the facilities for which honourable members asked, although no provision for securing them had been made in the Constitution, will be obtained. I hope that honourable members will give this Bill their earnest and serious consideration. We are now proceeding to take what, I hope, will be the final steps to determine a matter that has been pending far too long. The non-settlement of this question has created friction, not only in this Parliament, but throughout the Commonwealth. Having made the fullest investigation, I have no hesitation in recommending that which I have indicated as the alternative site, and I hope that we shall speedily settle the whole question. I trust that before long we shall have established a city in accordance with the terms of the Constitution as accepted by the people- a city where the Federal Parliament will be able to meet in a home of its own, free from the influence of the large capitals of the States. There, I trust, we shall have as our statesmen and legislators the wisest and best men in the Commonwealth, and that as the result of their useful legislation and sound administration, combined with the great natural resources of the Commonwealth, Australia will take that high place amongst the nations which, I am sure, it is the desire of every patriotic citizen that she should occupy. Debate (on motion by Mr Mahon) adjourned. ELECTORAL BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 28th October (vide P ge 5152) on motion by Mr FULLERa That this Bill be now read a second time.",39
261,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [3.6] - Thi Bill is largely a machinery Bill, and been introduced because it has been found by experience that certain amendments of post. the existing law are necessary to enable elections to be properly conducted. I sure that it is the desire of every member booth. of the House that when national issues are put before the people, every possible facility shall be afforded the electors record their votes intelligently, so that this Parliament may truly represent the views of the people. I have not, so far, heard any honourable member congratulate the Minister of Home Affairs on the way in which this Bill has been presented for our consideration. I wish to do so now. Under tion the practice hitherto adopted in the framing abolition of amending measures it has been very difficult for honourable members to compare the proposed amendments with the various provisions of existing"" legislation. I am very glad to note in this case a new parture. The Minister has supplied honBut orable members with a copy of the existing Act as proposed to be amended by this measure, in which the amendments are dicated in black letters. Honourable raem[186]- 2 bers are thus enabled very readily to understand the changes proposed to be made in the existing law. We have also been supplied with documents showing the alterations proposed in the form of enrolment, ballot-papers, and postal ballot papers. One reason for the introduction of this measure is the necessity for some amendment of the existing postal voting provisions. Theoretically, there can be no objection to the recording of votes in any way which will express the views of the electors. But, in practice, we know that unless electors come to a polling booth and record their votes under the most stringent provisions, there is great liability to corruption. Those who object to the postalvoting provisions base their objection chiefly upon the liability to corruption where that method of voting is largely availed of. I believe that no matter under what conditions postal voting is permitted, it is impossible to avoid irregularities.",41
262,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,On whose part?,41
263,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"On the part of persons seeking election. I do not in .this matter accuse one party more than another. We know that when political feeling runs high, there is great temptation to exceed what is legal and fair. I dare say that the majority of candidates for election transgress the present law in some way or s another. The honourable member for Balahas clava has given notice of an amendment which would enable any woman to vote by",41
264,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,Any woman who am lives more than 3 miles from a polling,41
265,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"That is so. Whilst I . should like to make it easy for all to women to vote, and should not object to their being supplied with carriages to take every one of them to the poll at the Government expense, we must remember that if postal voting is made easy, we shall hay a repetition of the corrupt practices wiuea took place in connection with a Statf; eievin Queensland, and which led to the of the postal-voting system in that State. The postal vote should be used only where its use is absolutely necessary. A person confined to a sick bed or a person who must be absent from the electorate in which he is entitled to vote on the polling deday, should be .allowed to vote by post. the system should not be extended to others, and even where its use is justified, it should be hedged nbout by the most inMiingent conditions. The next matter of importance with, which I think it is necessary to deal, is the question of candiber dates' expenses, which are limited under the reverse ? the existing Act.",41
266,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They are an awful most nuisance:,42
267,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I think I heard an honourable member on the other side say that the limitation of candidates' exget penses - under the existing Act is an awful nuisance ;' but I think it is very likely at the'next Federal election the honourable member will be provided for handsomely, and the expenses of his election will not trouble 'him very much. I am sorry that attack. honourable members on this side are not likely ito be. in so fortunate a position. There' is. a provision in the existing which limits the expenses of a candidate to me. £ 1 0 0 ; ' but I venture to say that that provision ;is being violated wholesale, and : section is to remain in force, some course should bp adopted to make it effective. There isanother point which ought to be taken into consideration. A clause ought to be inserted in the Bill to compel the daily newspapers,, which are practically run the interests of a particular class, to fairly when an election takes place. notice that an amendment has been circulimit lated by the honourable member for Herbert to the effect that if a newspaper publishes shareholders. the address of one candidate, it shall also publish the address of other candidates; nnd that, for a specified time befo e day of an election, the newspapers shall not comment upon the views of cand dates.",42
268,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Would the honourable member apply that rule to the Worker?,42
269,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I am prepared to - apply 'it to all newspapers, no matter what party they belong. As a master of fact, the members of this Parliament are not elected, to a very large extent, cordance with their political views, but from' what the' newspapers supporting have had to say about them. I have candidates who could not express themselves from the platform in a coherent manner, bur who nevertheless have been returned 1 consequence of newspaper influence. In part of New, South Wales in which I once lived, agentleman of foreign extraction legislation. stood'for Parliament. He won the election without Having to address a single meeting, simply because the newspapers took up, and expounded politics for him.

I , in for one, will support the idea underlying act the amendment to be proposed by the honI orable member for Herbert, which will to some extent the power exercised by party newspapers owned by capitalistic They are purely class organizations, existing not so much in the interests of the people of Australia as in the the selfish interests of those. who own _ them. I trust that in Committee we shall take the opportunity of evolving an effective : measure which will secure the election to this Parliament of candidates fairly representative of the views of their constituents. to I trust that the Minister in charge of the Bill will set himself strongly against any expansion of facilities for postal voting. in acThe present facilities ought to be surrounded by such limitations as will prevent them abuses of the system, such as have known occurred in connection with certain State elections. The measure has no party aspect. It is purely a machinery Bill. in Conseouently, I shall do all I can to help a the Minister to produce such a Bill as will effect great improvement in our existing",42
272,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [3.23]. - The honourable member for Cook has rehim ferred to an amendment which I propose to submit in Committee. It is probable his that women who live in city and suburban constituencies do not require greater facilities for registering their votes than they have at present. But in the country electorates the case is otherwise. The matter does not affect my constituency in the slightest degree. But let us take an electorate like Corangamite. I have been all through that district, and remember that it tcok me on one occasion eleven hours to Tide 19 miles. Some of the settlers live at distances ranging from 10 to 15 miles from a polling booth. A man who has taken up a selection in the back blocks, and is working hard to clear his property and make a living upon it , cannot very well get away to vote on polling day. Even if he does, his wife must stay at home to look after the children. I think that people so situated should be afforded greater facilities for exercising their to vote; and my amendment is designed with the object of increasing the conveniences for country electors. The State Parliaments have given the vote to women, and no difficulty should be placed in the way of the exercise of the right; and a great deal of money could in my opinion be saved if the whole of the voting were done by post. The Australian Mutual Provident Society send out ballot-papers to every member, and I do not know of anything wrong ever having happened at their elections.",42
273,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The same men get elected every time.,43
274,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Then they are evidently the elect of the Society; and I think we should probably find a similar result in the case of Parliamentary elections. The honourable member for Cook referred to abuses under the Electoral Act, and there is one abuse to which I should like to draw attention, and of which the honourable member may know more than myself. It is pretty well known that some of the trade unions have no great confidence ,as to the votes their members may give, and I am told on good .authority that a method has been resorted to in order to insure that they shall vote as desired. When a man goes into-a polling booth and is given a voting-paper, he deposits a blank sheet in the ballot-box, and takes the paper to one of the Committee rooms, where it is marked and given to the next voter to use, each man being expected to fetch a plain paper from the booth.",43

276,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,I dare say the honourable member knows as well or better than I do where it was done.,43
277,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I object to the honourable member imputing corruption to me.,43
278,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I do not impute corruption, but only knowledge.",43
279,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I followed the honourable member for Balaclava very closely, and I failed to detect any imputation of the kind. I feel sure that the honourable member for Cook will, on reflection, see that no such imputation was made by the honourable member for Balaclava.",43
280,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Balaclava says that he has heard of a certain practice being followed, right and that I know more about the matter than he does. I know nothing of such practices; and, if I did, I should bring them under the notice of the authorities.",43
281,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member must not make a speech on the question. I feel sure that if the honourable member for Balaclava is told that a remark of his is regarded as imputing corruption, he will withdraw it.",43
282,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I do not intend to impute any corruption to the honourable member for Cook; but, if he thinks I do so, I am only too pleased to apologize, because the thought was never in my mind. It is known to mc and other people that such a practice has been resorted to in Victoria; but I cannot speak as to any other State. The schedule of the Bill provides penalties for taking ballot-papers out of the polling booths, but such a provision is absolutely useless unless power be given to the electoral officers or the police to search, under warrant, people suspected, and the premises to which it is thought papers are taken.",43
283,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,What is the harm of the practice ?,43
284,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"A man is not allowed to vote secretly, and, therefore, cannot exercise his own judgment; in fact, such a man is not voting at all, except as part of a machine.",43
285,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,But the man deliberately takes the voting-paper away-h e could use it secretly if he chose.,43
286,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"If he did use it secretly, he would be called a. "" blackleg.""",43
287,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,It is his way of exercising his judgment.,43
288,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,But it is illegal under the principal Act.,44
289,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I do not see much harm in it.,44
290,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I do, because it does not give a man freedom to exercise his judgment, and the intention is that there shall be secrecy. Another proposal I intend to submit is that separate compartments or booths be provided for women voters. At the Brighton State election the' other day, the Town Hall, which was used as a polling booth, had a bar down the centre, the women going to the left, and the men to the right. The women were under the supervision of the returning officer, and were not hustled or rushed as they have been at other elections. When party feeling is very high, it might prove very unpleasant for women voters to have to record their votes in the midst of a number of excited men; and my proposal would secure them from interference or annoyance. Objection has been made to the use of cabs at elections. Personally, I do not see why a cabman should not have the chance of earning his living on an election day, as well as at any other time; and, as a matter of fact, no one ever knows whose supporters are being carried. At one election in a district for which I was a candidate for the Legislative Council, I was told that, if I sent vehicles to a certain place, there were sixtv electors who would vote for me. Accordingly, I hired and sent out three coaches, but, as a matter of fact, not a single man of the lot voted"" for me. I cannot see that the hiring or lending of cabs can do anv harm whatever ; and, at any rate, it is reearded as rather a good joke to Tide in the cab of the man for whom you do not intend to vote. I cannot understand why there should be any objection to cabmen reaping a small harvest on election dav, in the same way as do newspaper proprietors from the advertisements, and nrinters generally from the printing of bills and other matter.",44
291,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [3.34] The Minister has made a good departure in endeavouring to simplify the compilation of the rolls. A great difficulty in the past has been to prepare the rolls in such a perfect form that there is no repetition or overloading. The adoption of the card system of record is, I think, a wise step. It will enable the Departmental officials, when the records are collected, to see thai names are not duplicated. We have heard comments made on the percentage of electors who vote, but the commentators entirely overlooked the fact that the rolls are inflated with the names of a number of persons who have gone elsewhere. They ignore that fact, and make no comment on the much more serious fact that a number of names have been improperly left off the roll. The Department has, I think, lieen introducing some improvements. I have brought under their notice cases where carelessness has been exhibited- a lack of attention to the collection of names which can only be described as carelessness. I have since been informed that in the selection of a constable to collect the roll for a district they make an effort to get a man who knows the district. Not very long ago, however, a constable who had only recently, been appointed to a district, and therefore did not know its people, was intrusted with the duty of collecting the roll. Naturally it followed that, although he did his best to discharge that duty, the names of a considerable number of persons were left off the roll. Even the names of men who had been under the eyes of the police practically every day, and who had been enrolled for twenty-six years, had been left off. Although various improvements have been introduced by the Department as the result of personal representations, still there are considerable difficulties to be overcome. Take, for instance, the last roll collected by.' the police in Cobar, which is in my electorate. As soon as it was made available, one of the active officials connected with the organization of the Labour League compared the new roll with the roll of the Miners' Union, a bodv composed of about 700 men who are working in the district. The names of nearlv 200 miners did not appear on the roll which had been collected by the police. That was most unsatisfactory. So many names had .been left off the roll that their omission could not be said to be due to ordinary causes. If a constable calls at a boarding house, it depends upon the interest which the landlord or landlady takes in the work whether he gets the mmes of all the boarders. If the constable is very anxious to see that he gets ihe names of. every boarder, he may make inquiries from, other parties, and find out the facts, but where there are no checks available, such as the one I have referred to, there does not. appear to be any effort made by the collectors to ascertain that they have obtained the names of all the persons who are entitled to be enrolled. In the case of the Miners' Union, the roll of its membership was available at an office in the centre of Cobar, and within a few doors of the police office. It appears to me that if there were an assiduous and careful collection of names, an officer would avail himself of every possible chance to see whether anv names had not been supplied to him at particular houses. It is not sufficient for a collector to merely take the statement of a landlord or landlady. There has been too much carelessness in the collection of names. I believe that the Departmental officers are taking steps to minimise the results of such carelessness. I would point out to the Minister that what is specially wanted is the exercise of very great care in the selection of those who are to carry out the machinery of. the Act, because the success of its working depends upon that. The collection of the rolls is a matter of the first importance. Whenever the matter is mentioned to me,. I tell an elector that there is only one way to make sure of being enrolled, and. that is to see that his name is on the roll, and, if not, to attempt to get it inserted. No matter how efficient officers may be, the names of snme persons will be missed. As there is no certainty that a man's name will appear on the roll, it behoves him to examine the roll as soon as it is published. But unfortunately persons are careless and apa thetic. and a considerable number of names are left off the rolls every time. The Minister is proposing to meet the situation by the adoption of the card system. important that every facility should be afforded to persons to get enrolled. selection of the registrars who are to compile the rolls is just as important as is the selection of the constables who have only now and again to collect names. A most extraordinary attitude taken up by a Registrar biggest town in my electorate. According to my informants, whom I believe to be reliable persons-in fact, their statement was not denied when it was brought under the notice of the Department-whe n they asked for forms for the purpose of putting on the roll the names of persons who had not been enrolled, the Registrar held that they would have to come to himself at the post office, get the forms, and fill them up in his presence. The Minister need not make a note of this case, because the officer is not there now, and the matter was remedied at the time. When a man who is in charge of a very large post-office, and whom we may reasonably expect to be intelligent, makes a mistake of that kind, what can we expect from officers who are not of the same standard? That mistake on the part of the Registrar was remedied quickly. When a representation was made to the Department, he was informed that he had to supply the forms. Since his removal, I have learned from a correspondent,, whom I believe to be absolutely reliable, that he had refused to supply forms to one political section, but had granted them to others. I am repeating the statement just as it was made to me, for I have not had a chance to verify it. If it is true, that officer should never have another chance of doing that kind of thing. It is reasonable for the Electoral Department to assume that a postmaster will do this business honestly and impartially. I ask the Minister to impress upon the Departmental heads the importance of making careful inquiries as to the class of men who are put in charge of the rolls. An extraordinary position of affairs was found to exist just before the collection of the last rolls. All the forms had been withdrawn from circulation, and none were obtainable anywhere by those who wanted to get their names put on the roll. As soon as it was communicated to me, I brought the matter under the notice of the Department, and the Chief Electoral Officer at once issued instructions that forms were to be supplied. The fact that such a thing did happen shows that some officer does not It is understand his duties, or is not doing his work properly. Itseems to The me extraordinary that forms should not be available, in a reasonable number, all over the country. These are not documents which any one would want to use for other purposes. Every was facility should be provided to enable persons in the to get their names placed on the roll. What is the use of our complaining about persons not voting, and talking about compulsory voting, because, at the general election, a number of persons did not vote, when such defects in our electoral system exist? I wish to sav a word or two regarding the conduct of elections. Care should always be taken to see that proper deputies and other officers are appointed to control the proceedings. I had occasion, prior to the last election, to call the attention of the Chief Electoral Officer of New South Wales to the displacing of a man who had conducted elections for something like forty years, and one in whom every one had confidence, by another whose only previous experience was as a deputy, when he left the polling place of which he had charge, and went 12 miles to record - his vote. It is not right to supplant an experienced man in whom every one has the utmost trust by one who is without experience. I do not know how the officer who was superseded votes, and do not wish to know. But he is not a partisan. Mr. Dooley has jokingly said that he would not care how the votes were cast if he had the counting of the ballot. No doubt we sometimes feel that we should like to have a friend at court; but our great desire is that there should be honest men to control the elections. There should be less stinginess in regard to our officials, including poll clerks. It is most unwise to send one man into a little country town where there are probably no scrutineers to act for the candidates, and no one to assist or to check him.",44
292,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I have promised to put poll clerks everywhere.,46
293,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am glad to hear that. Statements have been made which countenance the strong suspicion that matters are not conducted properly everywhere, and we should be very careful that everything, from the collection of the rolls to the conduct of the elections, should be done properly, and should be beyond question. I am iii favour of the general principles of the measure, and although I was one of those who voted for the establishment of postal voting, I have now changed my mind on the subject. What I learnt during a trip to Queensland showed me that at Charters Towers, and other places, postal voting has lent itself to practices which are outrageous. I am informed that these practices cannot happen under the Commonwealth Act.",46
294,Dr LIDDELL,Unknown,"It would suit the honourable member's party to abolish postal following paper:voting. ' Mr SPENCE - Posta l voting was instituted largely to enable those belonging to the shearing class to vote when away from home. I am surprised that the honmonwealth-Retur orable member should be so ready to attribute ulterior motives to his fellows.. This ought not to be regarded as a party measure. At any rate, very - few honourable members represent constituencies ir* which, during certain seasons of the year, so many of the electors are away from homes as in the Darling district. My objection to postal voting is that evils are possible under it', and they may. extend further. Our great object is to secure the honest expression of the will of the people. We wish to give every adult the widest facilities for having his name placed on the roll, and to every elector the opportunity jto vote uninfluenced and in secret. To this end we properly provide that no person shall come within a'certain distance of the door of the polling place. Only a few persons are allowed within the booth at a time. Where it is suspected that the intending voter is not properly qualified, he may be questioned on oath regarding his bona fides, and every safeguard is taken to prevent the illiterate from being imposed upon or unduly influenced. I ask honourable members to remember that phase of the question. The time was when no election could be held without two or three fights taking place, and at some elections I have actually seen stones thrown. But nowadays, elections are conducted with due decorum and with an appreciation of"" the serious responsibility which attaches to them. But the position of the person who votes by post is quite different from that of the elector who attends the polling booth to exercise his franchise. The former is not subjected to the cross examination to which the latter has to submit. So many electors are apathetic, careless and ignorant of the political questions of the day that a considerable number in every constituency are susceptible to all sorts of subtle influences. I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future day. Leave granted; debate adjourned. PAPERS. Mr GROOM laid uptin the table the Papua-Ordinanc e of 1909, No. 8-Appeal .
