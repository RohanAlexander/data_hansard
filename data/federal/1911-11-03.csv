1,Mr BAMFORD,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"I ask you, Mr. Speaker, what is the position regarding the parliamentary refreshment bar. Yesterday afternoon the House resolved that intoxicating liquor shall no longer be supplied within its precincts, but about a fortnight ago the Senate negatived a similar resolution. Must honourable members who occasionally desire alcoholic refreshment be invited to the bar by honourable senators ? Is a notice to be put up in the bar "" for honourable senators only, and will members of this House be expected to go elsewhere when they wish a little wine for their "" stomach's sake,"" as I occasionally do. If members of this House are not to be permitted to obtain liquors within the precincts, the bar should be removed to another position, because it is aggravating to have to pass a place where another member is getting a drink when one is not allowed, to get one there himsel f.",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"I am not prepared to make a definite statement at 'present, but under the circumstances, if the honourable member wishes to go to the bar he had better get a senator to take him there. WHARF LABOURERS STRIKE.",13
3,Mr MASSYGREENE,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"I wish to know .from the Prime Minister whether he is aware the state of things prevailing in the eastern parts of New South Wales, as revealed by the following telegramChamber of Commerce, Lismore. Food supplies running short, heavy losses, local producers' trade dislocated through strike. MCLean, President. Has he read what has been said by the Premier of the State, as reported in this morning's Age', to the effect that the work of the port must be carried on, and that the Government will take all steps necessary to prevent the trade of the port from being suspended ? Will the right honourable gentleman tell the - House what steps he has taken to co-operate with the Premier of New South Wales to keep the Inter-State trade of the port of Sydney going during the strike? If no steps have been taken, will he tell the House how he proposes to assist the Premier of New South Wales?",13
4,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,The only question that 10.30 need be answered is the last one. The others mean nothing but a placard. Mr JosErn COOK - Is it in order to describe a respectfully-framed question as BAR. a placard?,13
5,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"The Prime Minister will withdraw the word, if it is offensive.",13
6,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"I cheerfully do so, if the use of the word is regarded as offensive.",13
7,Mr MASSYGREENE,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"It was certainly offensive, and under the circumstances uncalled for.",13
8,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"Not only am I aware of the trouble in Sydney, but I take my share of the responsibility for localizing it and bringing it to an end. The Government will do. everything in its power as in duty bound, to see that the law is obeyed. Ministers are.sworn to do that. I read the newspapers as a matter of duty, to make myself acquainted with the facts. Every strike causes loss, but a declaration in Parliament in anticipation of action is likely to be mischievous rather than",13
9,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"Hav e the Prime Minister and Attorney-General ta.ken into consideration the power in the Arbitration Act to have members of an organization who are recalcitrant, or not controlled, or not controllable by it, removed from.it? I do not ask for an immediate answer, but I understand that the Ministers really and anxiously desire to localize this dispute.",13
10,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"I have said so. Why . does the honourable member use the word ""really""?",13
11,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"I had no intenof tion of saying anything that would annoy norththe Prime Minister. I draw his attention to section 70 of the Arbitration Act, which readsThe Court may, on the application of any organization, made in the manner prescribed by the rules of the Court, order that any member of an organization shall cease to be a member thereof from a date and for a period to be named in the order. I ask the Prime Minister whether it may not be wise ""to consider that provision, which gives ample power to the Court to act on the application of an organization, and to bring it under the notice of the organization with which I understand he and the Attorney-General are not unconnected. It is within their power to apply to the Court to remove from the organization the persons who have actually struck.",13
12,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"That organization includes all the persons employed in the industry throughout Australia, and we are doing everything that can be done to obtain the resumption of' work. The honourable member suggests certain action in regard to recalcitrant members, and directs attention to section 70, but those who have had experience of unions know that the suggested remedy would be worse than useless at this juncture.",14
13,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,Why ?.,14
14,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"Coul d we put 5,000 men out of a union?",14
15,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,Yes . That is the only way to deal with them. Otherwise the organization is a farce.,14
16,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,They icould not be put out without being heard separately.,14
17,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,The branch to which they belong could be heard.,14
18,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,The Court does not know branches; it deals with the organization. The members of the organization would have to be dealt with'as individuals.,14
19,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,The certificate of registration of the organization is a tificate of the registration of branches.,14
20,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,I should like to point out for the public information that our positions in connection with the Waterside Workers Union are purely honorary. That should be made known.,14
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"I assure Ministers and honourable members opposite that I wish to do nothing to hinder the peaceful settlement of this dispute. I ask the Attorney-General if his attention has been drawn to the following statement in this morning's paper, made by the Premier of New South Wales, who says The Inter-State wharf labourers are bound by an agreement which covers the whole of Australia. Without any notice to their colleagues in other States, without any notice to the Government, they suddenly leave work in violation of that agreement. No definite grievance was stated to anybody in authority in order that some efforts at conciliation might be made,, but cessation of work was suddenly brought about by a section of the Sydney branch. Mr MCGowen then goes on to state his ; own attitude. I will appoint an arbitration tribunal to immediately consider the issue The work of the port must be carried on, and the Government will take all necessary steps to prevent the trade of the port being suspended. Whatever the consequences may be to the Government, they will discharge their duties to the community. Under the circumstances, it is the fairest of fair things that the Attorney-General should tell the House and the country what he is doing to co-operate with Mr. MCGowen to remove these blocks to Inter-State trade, which it is the special function of the Government to safeguard. That is my question to the Attorney-General, and I now desire to say generally",14
22,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,The honourable member must not go on to speak in general terms.,14
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,I merely desire to say in another form what I have alreadly said.,14
24,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,The honourable member has already asked a question.,14
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"I know that; but I ask the leave of the House to say generally two or three words bearing on a very important matter. I take it that we are all anxious to see this trouble settled. I , for one, at any rate, have given evidence of my desire not to embarrass the Government in the slightest degree.",14
26,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"The honourable memcer-* ber is now going beyond the question. He will understand that if I allow him to proceed I . cannot reasonably refuse to permit other honourable members to discuss the matter, and a difficulty may, therefore, arise.",14
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"I ask the leave of the House; and if I am refused leave, of course I cannot help it.",14
28,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,I shall put the request to the House if the honourable member desires.,14
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,I desire to say one sentence only.,14
30,Mr FOWLER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,Why does the honourable member not move the adjournment of the House ?,14
31,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"My attention was called to the statement made by Mr. MCGowen; and the facts, as stated by him, and read by the honourable member for Parramatta, are, to the best of my knowledge and belief, absolutely correct. That is to say, an agreement did and does exist, and it covers members of the union who work in Sydney as well as those who work in every other port of the Commonwealth. It is a fact that, without any notice at all to their organization, or to any of the branches, the men in Sydney ceased work and broke the agreement. It is a of .course, as I have said here previously, that on their doing so, the Council was immediately called together, and the men were asked to resume work, and declined. The honourable member for Parramatta went on to point out what Mr. MCGowen had declared his intention to do. As for Mr MCGowen's offer to appoint arbitrators, I say that there is nothing to arbitrate about. There is the agreement which, the Federation has entered into, and the men must keep it-the y must abide by the conditions, and there is nothing to arbitrate about. So far as the deep-sea men are concerned, I know nothing of the terms of the agreement, if any, existing between them and the deep-sea stevedores. As regards this Government, the position appears to be this: Under the agreement there is a provision made for a penalty, which is, after all, nothing but liquidated damages, for the recovery of which the Attorney-General cannot proceed.",15
32,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,Can the Registrar of the Industrial Court proceed?,15
33,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"No , he cannot. asked the Registrar to supply me with a report as to what he conceives to be necessary and proper under the circumstances, and the following are extracts from that document-On reference to clause 13 of the agreement between the members of the union and the steam-ship owners which was filed with me on the 33rd ultimo, it will be apparent that the amount referred to for breach of the agreement is not a "" penalty"" within the meaning of section 78 of the Act, but "" liquidated damages,"" and therefore the proper person to sue for the recovery of the amount is the Commonwealth Steam-ship Owners' Association (sec. 44*), or one of its component companies (sec. 44*). If it is a penalty in the proper sense and not' damages, the agreement itself seems not to be an industrial agreement under the Act, for it relates to industrial disputes in the State of New South Wales only, and not to industrial disputes extending beyong the limits of a State (sec. 4). If it is not an industrial agreement the Commonwealth Steam-ship Owners' Association can. sue for it also, and the chances of success are therefore much greater than if the Registrar sued for the recovery of the penalty. The foregoing is clearly an answer to any question as to why the Registrar has not sued under, sec. 44 (2) (a). If proceedings are taken by either the Commonwealth Steam-ship Owners' Association or by one of its component companies, or by the Registrar, they would seem to have to be taken,, not against the Wharf Labourers' - Union or Waterside Workers' Federation, or the officials thereof, who are apparently innocent, but fact, against some one or more workmen who have actually struck work (sec. 44 (1). As regards the Commonwealth Court of Arbitration, it would be well to understand clearly that it has no jurisdiction to deal with thisNew South Wales dispute by way of arbitration ; but as there was for some time danger of the dispute extending to the other States the President exercised his jurisdiction under section i6« to call the parties together to prevent the extension of the dispute to some other State. That appears to be the position, and nothing, therefore, can be done by the Government until, if such a contingency should unfortunately arise, the dispute extends to other States, when, of course, quite apart from the agreement, there would be an Inter-State dispute, over which the Court has jurisdiction. There remains,, then, nothing for the Government to do, and everything that can be done By the organization, as such, has been done. I very much regret the position individually I am perfectly confident in my own mind that the overwhelming majority of the men now on .strike do not desire, and never did' desire, for one solitary half-minute, toI strike.  ment of the Attorney-General that the vast .majority of the men now on strike did not desire to strike, who is responsible for the strike taking place ?",15
34,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"Thos e honourable members who have had any experience of unions will understand perfectly the position which I put. According to the statement made to me by the Registrar, there were 170 or 180 men present at the meeting which originally decided to strike. There may have been a few more or less at the meeting- I am not quite sure-bu t there are 4,700 men, to my certain knowledge, in the union. If that meeting had not carried a resolution to strike, there would have been no strike. That is what I meant; and I am going by what I know of the unionno man knows it better-and I say deliberately now that, if a ballot were taken in the union, there wOuld be an overwhelming majority for a return to work.",15
35,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"In regard to the - question asked by the honourable member for Richmond relating to the duty of the 'Government to enforce and maintain the principle of Inter-State Free Trade, will the Prime Minister explicitly state that the Covernment does recognise its duty to remove anv obstruction or interference with the free flow of trade between the States ?",16
36,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"This Government, whatever may be said about other Governments, have no need to express the fact that they intend to carry out the duties of a Government according to law.",16
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"In view of the Attorney-General's statement, I desire to ask the honourable gentleman if there' are any means by which a vote of 4,700 men of the union can be taken?",16
38,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"There are no means at the disposal of the Government. As for the rest, I may inform the House, as already stated in the press, that there is to be another meeting of the men tomorrow morning, and it is to be hoped that from that meeting a different result will follow. If that, unfortunately, should not prove to be the case, a recommendation will be made by the Council of the Waterside Workers' Federation that a ballot shall be forthwith taken. GENERAL ELECTION : POLLING a",16
39,Dr MALONEY,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"In view of the fact that Saturday is chosen as the polling day for general elections many members of the Jewish persuasion have waited on me with a suggestion that some other day should be choserT. One Jewish minister pointed out that if Saturday were now fixed, it might be proposed to have the election on Sunday on the next occasion. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I - will have the matter carefully considered. A great race of people, who have played a most important part in the history of the world, should have arrangements, which they consider prejudicial to their interests, carefully weighed. » PERSONAL EXPLANATION.  sonal explanation. Last night I so far forgot myself as to say to the honourable member for Wentworth something for which I am truly sorry. That honourable member was man enough to come and tell me that he did not intend to insult me, and I , of course, accepted his statement. That the honourable member had no such intention is borne out by' what appeared in the newspapers of this morning. I mistook the meaning of the words he used, and I apologise, not only to the honourable member, but to the House.",16
40,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTAR Y REFRESHMENT,"Perhaps I may be permitted to express my deepest regret that I should, even momentarily, have inadvertently offended the honourable member for Maranoa. My regret now is that for one brief moment he should have thought me prig enough not to feel a deep respect for the ability and grit which have enabled him to graduate with honours in the university of life's experience. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr FISHER) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until half-past 7 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday next. NA V BAR : SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS.",16
41,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"the Prime Minister, ufon notice I. Is not the vote given in the House of Representatives yesterday that the Parliamentary refreshment bar be closed a breach of the agreement entered into between the State and Federal authorities under which this Parliament occupies the building? DAY. 2. The honourable member for Brisbane having stated he had received a letter from the Premier of Victoria in which Mr Murray said he had no objection to the refreshment bar being closed-is the Prime Minister aware whether that was Mr Murray's consent, or that of a majority of the Victorian Parliament? 3. Can effect be given to the resolution carried yesterday without the concurrence of the Senate? 4. Has not the Senate during the present session declined to give its concurrence to a similar motion ? 5. Does he know of any Parliament in the British Empire that has not a refreshment bar for the private use of its members? 6. Does he consider that the want of sobriety or good orderly conduct on the part of the members of this Parliament has made it neces- sary or desirable that its refreshment bar should be closed i",16
42,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. I am unable to say, and have not had time to make inquiries. 2. I understand it is a personal letter. 3. I do not think so. 4. Yes. 5. I have no information on the subject. 6. People with greater experience declare it to be a model of sobriety. TRADE AGREEMENT : VICTORIAN MILLERS' ASSOCIATION.",16
43,Mr MCDOUGALL,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"the Attorney General, wboii - notice I. Whether his attention has been drawn to the printed trade agreement of the Victorian Mill-owners' Association, which fixes the price and general selling conditions of flour, bran, and pollard, and particularly lo Rule 47, which reads"" The Committee may offer and pay a reward not exceeding Fifty pounds person (including a traveller, but not being a member) giving such information with respect to a breach of this Agreement as shall lead to a member being proved to have committed such breach, and the Committee may also pay to such informer (including a traveller, not being a member) the whole or any part of any fine paid by a member committing a breach "" ? 3. Has he noticed that the flour prices quoted in the Victorian daily papers are supplied by the Victorian Mill-owners' Association? 3. Does he consider that the trade practices of the Victorian Mill-owners' Association in the matter of fixing prices and regulating market conditions are conducive to fair trading?",17
44,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 3. I am not aware whether this is so. 3. No. ESTIMATES. ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS AND BUILDINGS. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 2nd November, vide page 2219): Divisions 1 to 5 {Home Affairs), £824,915.",17
45,Mr JOHN THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Cowper) [11.3] - We should have some statement from the Minister of Home Affairs regarding the item, "" Timber storage shed, £ 1 4 6 . "" I presume that if this item be agreed to if will be followed by a proposal to expend a certain sum on the purchase of timber to be stored and seasoned.",17
46,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,We are doing that now.,17
47,Mr JOHN THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"The experiment, I believe, will be found to be impracticable, and neither advantageous nor economical. It is absurd to think of storing in one centre timber for distribution all over the Commonwealth when local requirements can be supplied on the spot. I doubt very much whether there is as much in this idea as some people believe, but even if the Government specified that contractors for Government buildings should use only seasoned timber supplied by the State, I tliink that the scheme would be found unworkable. I am afraid that there is something in the nature of a fad about this proposal, and, as the representative of a district where hard woods are largely produced, I think the experiment should not be proceeded with. If the Government specify that only seasoned timber should be used on a Government work, why should not the contractor for that work be permitted to purchase that timber wherever he desires to do so? There to any are in the trade people who make a point of storing millions of feet of timber, so that it may be properly seasoned. Seasonedtimber can be purchased in Sydney or Melbourne today by any one who requires it. I am not so hide-bound as to be unable to appreciate any innovation, but I am afraid that this experiment is due to the fact that the Minister, who has no personal experience, has been led away by the recommendations of others who are also without experience, and that it will result in loss to the Government. The experience of all men engaged in the building trade is that seasoned timber can be purchased, in the sizes specified, in almost any part of the State of New South Wales. If the tf intention of the Government is merely to erect sheds in Melbourne or Sydney, and store timber there, I fail to see how they are going to compel contractors for the erection of public buildings in, say, my own electorate, to carry timber from' the Sydney shed to the district where, peihaps, it was produced. I am willing to giye fair consideration to any innovation that may be proposed, but I hold the view that this experiment should not be taken up, and I hope the Government will not proceed with it. Mr Riley .(South Sydney) [11.7] I trust that the Minister will stand by the item. I have been in the building trade all my life, and am satisfied that the Government are w ell advised in taking steps r to secure a supply of seasoned timber. Nothing depreciates the value of a building to a greater extent than does the use of unseasoned timber in its construction, for green timber causes the walls to crack in every direction. Since the Government propose to erect large buildings in the Federal Capital and other parts of the Commomvealth, they are acting wisely in taking time by the forelock and providing for supplies of seasoned timber.  propose to drag timber from one district another and back again.",17
48,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,No . I think that the honourable member for Cowper is mistaken in the belief that seasoned timber can be purchased in any part of the Commonwealth today. The demand is so great that it is mills to almost impossible to secure it in certain had parts of New South Wales.,18
49,Mr ARCHIBALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,O r anywhere in Austo tralia.,18
50,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,I believe the position the same in other States.,18
51,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,Nonsense . If a reasonable order is given and reasonable time allowed millions of feet of seasoned can be obtained.,18
52,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"I know men in the buildthe ing trade who have had to wait weeks get.even green timber. The price of timhis ber is gradually increasing, and there everv reason to believe that that which buy today and store for seasoning purtions poses will be far more valuable later on. The Government cannot go wrong in storing and seasoning timber. Their proposal not to compete with timber merchants. This is simply an attempt to provide for our requirements. The honourable member for - Cowper spoke of the Government specifying in their contracts that only certain timber should be used. That is quite a common practice. The Government of New South Wales for example in inviting tenders for the building of an iron bridge specify that the iron shall have been made in the Commonwealth. We have a right to prorequires tect ourselves, and I hope that the mittee will not quibble over this item. men in a large way of business try to by them a stock of seasoned timber for building, furniture-making, and other poses, so that this is really not an experirisk ment. I commend the action of the The-Minister Minister.",18
53,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Franklin) [11.11]. - We ought to have some information from the Minister regarding the item. I have - obiection to the Government making experiin ments in regard to the seasoning but the question raised by the honourable member for Cowper is a very important one. Surely it would be unwise to centralize the timber seasoning process in Melbourne or Sydney and to send timber from one those centres to Queensland or Western tralia, where material equally good could be obtained on the spot. I do not hesitate to say that if a reasonable order be given and to reasonable tame allowed any man can secure all the seasoned timber he requires at an exceedingly reasonable price. Instead of there being a dearth of timber, the position until quite recently has been the reverse. For four years and until quite recently the timber had an exceedingly bad time, and export timber at prices which, in some cases, scarcely paid for cutting. I hope that the Minister will be careful not attempt to localize in any one State, or in the hands of a few people, the storing is and seasoning of the timber required for Commonwealth purposes.",18
54,Mr ARCHIBALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,It would be all right timber if the store was to be in Tasmania !,18
55,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"My experience of honourable member is that he judges to every one by the unfortunate standard of own particular proclivities. I suggest is to the Minister that it would be better to we have a number of small experimental staor stores in the different States. A process that might be suitable for the seasoning of the pines of Queensland or the is jarrah Of Western Australia might be totally unsuitable in the case of the stringy own bark and blue gums of Tasmama and Victoria. It is well that these experiments should be made, but the Minister, instead of having one large station in Victoria, should distribute his stores over the various States. If the Minister contemplates storing a large amount of timber, cut green, and stacked in sheds without any preparation at all he will find by the time he to use it that some of it is turning Comround and looking at him. I hope the MinAll ister will go a good deal further than he keep now proposes, and take in hand some of the many preparations now known by which purtimber can be dried and seasoned without of curling, twisting, and splitting. should also have these stations distributed all over Australia so that all the timbers of the different States will get a fair deal, because it would be positively no absurd to attempt to use timber seasoned Victoria for public works in Western of timber, Australia or Queensland.",18
56,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Maribyrnong) [11.17]. - I agree with'""the honourable member for South Sydney in commending the Minister for taking this very desirable step. I can. of assure the honourable member for Franklin, Auswho says there is plenty of timber for all purposes' in Australia, that there is great difficulty,' for example, in getting timber, especially Queensland pine, for butter boxes. There should be no need for the Department to rent premises for storing purposes. The back yards of the post offices in various centres can be made use of for storing timber to be used from time to time in the surrounding districts. I am not enamoured of the idea of patent or hurried seasoning. I question whether it gives the same good results as are obtained from sun-dried or air-seasoned timber. If the Minister proposes to extend his operations iri that direction he will require far more money than he asks for in this item. If he wants to go even further than he now proposes, I will lend him every help, because a good supply of seasoned timber will mean that the erection of our public buildings will not be retarded by a shortage of timber supplies.",18
57,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Fremantle) [11.20] - If the Government are serious in wishing to season a lot of timber for use in public buildings they can hardly expect to do it by the methods proposed within the time required. There are a number of well known systems for seasoning timber, and if any of them are to be adopted provision will have to be made on the Estimates for the. necessary machinery and kilns. Storing in sheds is not always the most desirable wav of seasoning. It takes a long time. In England it has been found that the best way with certain timbers is. to leave the logs lying in the water until the natural sap is leached out Then the water which has taken the place of the sap is evaporated, and the timber is found to be better seasoned than if the sap had been left in it. As to the statement that timber is not procurable for public purposes in Australia, honourable members can find an object lesson in this building, containing as it does perhaps the finest piece of work that has ever been put up in the way of timbering and joining. If has stood here for twenty or thirty years to my knowledge, and I defy any one to say it was not built 'with seasoned timber. There is nothing wrong with it after all that time.",19
58,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,Seasone d timber cannot be got in Australia.,19
59,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Any one who has the money can get whatever he wants in Australia. Storing a. 'lot of timber in a shed will never meet the requirements of the Department.' They must go a little deeper into the matter. Whatever timber is required can be obtained in the log or the plank fjromthe different States, brought to one centre, and there put through theprocess best suitable for each class. Timber is brought to Melbourne in the log. from all parts of the world today. I passed a trolley load of oak logs only the day before yesterday in Collins-street. They had come from Japan, and would beseasoned here by 'whatever process was most suitable. The system of seasoning, which is suitable for hard wood is not suitable for soft wood. If the Department stacks a lot of timber in twenty Or thirty sheds, and tries to treat it all by the same process, no good result will be arrived at. The best and most scientific methods known to the world must be adopted. A great deal has been said of the process of Powellising timber by putting it through boiling water or steam, and then treating it with arsenic and sugar,, but I think the boiling or ""steaming has as much to do with the result as the stuff which is put into it afterwards. Someyears ago a vacuum system by which the natural sap was drawn from the timber, was established at Port Adelaide, in South Australia, but so far as I know no process has been so successful as that which I have described as adopted in England. Whoever took on the business of furnishing this House knew more about the processes of seasoning timber than we do here today.",19
60,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"They did not do thingsso much in a hurrv in those days. Mr HEDGES.'- I doubt if the building of the Federal Capital will be done in a hurry. I believe there will be plenty of time to adopt any system known to the world for seasoning the timber that will be required to furnish the new ParliamentHouse there. It would be hardly advisable to use the hardwoods of Australia irr all work. Before money is spend on shedsthe Minister should get the"" best advice obtainable as to the systems of seasoning, most suitable for the woods which he proposes to use.",19
61,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Hunter) [11.26] I agree with a good deal that has been said, but I believe the Minister's actionis in the right direction. The question seems to be whether he should adopt somerecognised artificial system of seasoning timbers, or whether he should erect sheds as proposed."" It is in the best interests of the Commonwealth, from the point of view of economy, to have all the timber it requires seasoned, and the question of whether Powellising or any other system should be adopted is a matter for future consideration, which will take a considerable time.",19
62,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,It is quicker than the shed business.,20
63,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"It may be, but whilst the Government are obtaining information with regard to the different processes some time must elapse, and when the information is obtained a considerable sum of money will be necessary in order to bring the system which is adopted into operation. Our position is that we require timber immediately. Consequently it is necessary to procure it at once, and allow 'it to season by exposing .it to the open air, perhaps under cover of sheds. - Our experience has been that timber is now bought direct from the mills and put down before it is properly seasoned, with the result that the floors shrink, and have to be taken up and relaid.",20
64,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,That is mostly the case with hard woods.,20
65,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"rlt applies to any timber, but to hardwoods particularly. In one case I put the timber aside for four .months to season, and as a result I had .no trouble with the floor. The Powellising system which is used by a certain firm in Sydney is chiefly intended to prevent the ravages of white ants. The Minister has acted properly in providing sheds so that timber may be obtained from the - different mills within the Commonwealth, .and not imported. If we have"" timber of - our own, we should obtain it and allow it - to season until it is wanted. I can assure the honourable member for Franklin that 'timber is scarce in Australia. present a timber-growing constituency-as I did in the State Parliament-and know - that timber supplies are rapidly being exhausted, and that as a result the price of timber has increased by 5s. or 6s. per 100 feet during the last few years.",20
66,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,The price has increased 25 per cent.,20

Timber should be obtained at least five or six months before it is needed.",20
70,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,As many years.,20
71,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,The Commonwealth and State Departments now buy their timber as they require it.,20
72,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,All our Government services live from hand to mouth.,20
73,Mr CHARLTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"That is so. Timber supplies, however, should be bought a long time ahead, and allowed to season. The Commonwealth would save considerably by adopting that policy.",20
74,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Wimmera) [11.38] As the honourable member for Hunter has pointed out, storage for timber should be provided in all the States.",20
75,Mr WISE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,The sum of .£700 is to be voted to provide for storage in Victoria.,20
76,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"I hope that we shall have an explanation from the Minister of what is intended. The need for storing timber has been emphasized by honourable members. I am sorry that the Minister, who prides himself on his progressiveness, has not commenced to grow timber for the Commonwealth. We are asked to vote and re-vote sums for expenditure on the Federal Capital amounting to j£ioo,ooo, and if the whole amount were expended in planting timber in the Federal area, it would make provision for the future which would be very valuable, and prevent expenditure in directions in which it is not yet necessary. We have, too, enormous areas which might profitably be devoted to the planting of timber. Re-afforestation is one of the most important problems that the ComI remonwealth and the States have to face. The States might have done more, and we might have done more. In other countries timber reserves are a most valuable asset. The German Government looks after its forests in accordance with the most scientific and best technical principles, and benefits therefrom to the extent of several millions a year. Most of the Federal area, not being suit-able for cultivation, should be fit for the growing of timber, it having been proved all over the world that where there is a sufficient rainfall timber can be grown satisfactorily on poor country. On the European Alps, land which was previously valueless has been planted with Timber trees, and now produces good returns. Mr KING O'MALLEY - An amount for afforestation appears on the"" Estimates.",20
77,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"No policy has been announced. We should make plantations which will be of value in the future. I hope that the Ministerwill tell us what he proposes to do in regard to the reafforestation of the Federal Capital Site. I hope that on revising his estimates he will apply a large part of the sum for which he asks for the Federal Capital, to the planting of the Territory with trees.",21
78,Mr ATKINSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Is he not going to plant 1,000,000 trees there?",21
79,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"We have not been told what he is going to do, but if his explanation is not more lucid than that of the other night, we shall not learn much from him. It is a step in the right direction to provide store houses for timber, it being a weakness in our departmental administration that the timber reserves are altogether too small.",21
80,Mr ATKINSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,Wilmot) [11.39] - It seems to me that the Minister means no more than the construction of sheds in Melbourne and Sydney for the seasoning of timber - project? Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is all.,21
81,Mr ATKINSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"A great deal has been said about afforestation, and we should be told whether it is the intention of the Department to assist the State in that matter. The timber stored in the sheds which are to be erected will not be available for all the works which the Home Affairs Department will have to carry out; it would not pay to send it from the proposed storehouses to distant' States. should like the Minister to say what is proposed in regard to the Commonwealth generally, apart from New South Wales and Victoria. Mr KING O'MALLEY (DarwinMinister of Home Affairs) [n.43] - The Department has had a good deal of trouble at times in obtaining seasoned timber, and complaints have been made by honourable members about the difficulty of getting work done Owing to the difficulty in obtaining assistance from New South Wales and Victorian officials, who have had an immense amount of work to do themselves, although they have done what they could for us, we have decided, in the interests of expedition, to look after our own works in the two States named, and are, therefore, providing timber stores in them, so that if we cannot get what we need from the mills we can draw on our own supplies. On the Federal area we had a great deal of trouble in getting timber, and had to send all through the electorate of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for it, buying it green. In some of my own houses I find the verandahs looking at me when I go for the rents, showing that the timber has not been properly seasoned.",21
82,Mr MASSYGREENE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"What kinds of timber are to be stored? Mr KING O'MALLEY - All kinds necessary for the works we have in hand. Honourable members opposite appear to be afraid that we are going to establish a great branch or department for the sale of timber. There is, however, no such intention underlying this modest vote of £700.",21
83,Mr WISE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,The Department spent .£500 last year. Mr ICING O'MALLEY - What is £50 0 ? A decent kitchen could not be put up in some houses for such a sum. One of the projects in the Federal territory is afforestation. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro says that I never do anything without letting the world know; but did I let the world know as to the afforestation,21
84,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,Yes . Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then why worry me about it today?,21
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"We only desire to know whether the Minister is redeeming his promises. Mr KING O'MALLEY - A Labour Minister must always do that, because his promises are his capital. I agree with the I honourable member for Wimmera that there are several processes used; for instance, the one in operation in Sydney has cost the present Mayor of that city ^25,000. Possibly later we may have to adopt some process of the kind, which, I understand, has been successful in Western America for over thirty years. They will be required, perhaps, in the building of the transcontinental railway, when there must be timber to resist the white ants. At present, however, we only ask for £700, with a view later to having a shed in each State where timber can be stored and ready for use without delay. We are going to run great industries and have mighty activities in contemplation ; and, we must make preparation, especially in a territory like this, where there is little or no settlement, and everything is in a state of nebulosity. Under the circumstances we cannot put down the exact sumfor every complete work.",21
86,Mr MASSYGREENE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Richmond) [11.50] - The Minister of Home Affairs has talked about everything and anything but the particular item under discussion. What kind of timPossessions, ber is it proposed to store? The Minister the taxpayer. tells us that in the Federal area all sorts of timber has to be used in a green state; but a great deal of our timber cannot used in any other form. Honourable bers who have had any experience of buildlaunches, ing with seasoned ironbark will know what I mean.",21
87,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,There are very few buildings of ironbark.,22
88,Mr MASSYGREENE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"But my remarks apply to all our hardwoods, which it is impossible to use in a seasoned state. On the other hand, all the joinery woods, such as cedar, rosewood, beech, silky oak, and Queensland maple, may be stored and seaThis soned as much as we like, and are improved thereby, provided they are kept free ants.",22

91,Mr OZANNE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Corio) [11.54] - I also am of opinion that the Minister is wasting the"" country's money in providing £ 7 0 0 the seasoning of this timber. No doubt it is difficult to season hardwood, but it can be done with proper attention in case of many varieties. When I was in the Public Works Department we found that if we did not season the hardwood we had a tough job in getting the buildings proper line. Why I say the Minister wasting the public money is that in Northern Territory, and in Papua, we have Possessions from which very valuable timber could be obtained, and where we could establish our own saw-mills.",22

Instead, therefore, of building the proposed sheds, we should erect sawmills, and do the seasoning at the places practically where the timber is grown.  concerned, not so much with the amount of this vote, as with the principle it involves. appears to me to be another step in the direction of socializing the enterprises of from the Commonwealth; and that view is strengthened by the speeches of the Minisand of the honourable membei for Corio. seaBoth of these gentlemen showed us clearly that this proposal is only the straw which the flow of the stream, and that it is intended, ultimately, to establish great be and important Commonwealth work's in regard to the growing and storage.of timber. no The success of public enterprises of this kind, up to the present, does not justify us in increasing them, for they are not carried by the State anything like so satisfactorily as they are by private enterprise. It would seem as if this Parliament has conceived the idea of a socialistic condition for of things which. I am quite sure, is not shared by the great bulk of the public. AVhat use can these sheds serve unless they the are to be stacked with timber, and how large a sum of money is likely to be involved in filling them with timber if we are tc carry a stock sufficient to supply the in needs which the Minister has mentioned? is I do not think the great bulk of honourable the members have seriously considered this question. The erection of the sheds is a comparatively trivial matter, but the storage of timber will involve us in an expenditure that is of the utmost importance. The will be absolutely useless unless a very large sum is spent in storing timber",22
94,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Perhaps the Minister will Pertell the Committee what he is going to _  tention; if he has the figures he has not given them to us. The honourable member for Corio has objected that this item does not go far enough. He says that we ought to have our own saw-mills. If the Ministry submitted such a proposition to the people it would probably be rejected, because the country is not yet ripe for Socialism. By passing such items as these honourable members opposite are gradually undermining existing conditions in favour of a state of affairs under which the number of Commonwealth employees will be increased, and those engaged in private enterprise will have to compete with those employed by the State. Such a thing ought not to be encouraged, and I think, therefore, that we ought to reject this item. Representing, as I do, a large and important constituency, comprising the Goulburn .Valley and Echuca districts, I shall raise a vigorous protest against every item of the kind in these Estimates. This is simply the initial movement towards establishing that which the people whom I represent strongly object to.",22

I believe that it will be simply enormous. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The member will have a chance of stopping anything of the kind by his vote in this House.  but, unfortunately, that will not put a stop to the proposal. It is just as well that the public should know that the Opposition are in an absolutely helpless position, so far as the protection of their interests is concerned, since the Government have behind them a majority that is prepared to support them, willv nfTly, right or wrong. This is simply another socialistic move, calculated to be . for the advancement of a party, and not for the well-being of the country.",23
97,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,East Sydney) [12.7] I should not have risen but for the stupid and uncalled-for remarks made by a number of honourable members regarding this question.,23
98,The CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,23
99,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"I withdraw it. Those who have opposed this item have shown that they have no knowledge of the matter. Users of timber will admit that the Minister has been well advised, for in no part of the Commonwealth can dry timber be purchased today.",23
100,Mr MASSYGREENE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,Peopl e can purcliase it if they like to pay the price.,23
101,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"I think not. I know contractors in Sydney who are prepared to give 2s. and 3s. per tnousand feet more for dry timber than they are giving for that which is now available; but they cannot get it. Green timber is more costly to work than is dry timber. A joiner cannot use green timber and give satisfaction to the person for whom he is working, and the same may be said with regard to the use of unseasoned timber in the building trade generally. Every system of drying timber tried up to the present time has been purely experimental. Timber can be made fit for use only by atmospheric drying, and honourable members opposite, instead of condemning the Minister, should give him credit for taking action to ensure a supply of dry timber for use in our public buildings. Timber for furniture and fixtures must have been stored for at least four or five years. That which has been put .away for fifteen years is better still, and will pay for the cost of storing. Timber used in the manufacture of pianos is sometimes stored for twenty years. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin that the timber-getters have honourable not been receiving a fair price; but that has not led to any reduction in prices to the consumers. The middleman has been reaping the advantage. Our timber supplies are controlled by a combine, which, either on the ist October or the first of the present month, put up prices by 10 per cent. Our referenda proposals having been rejected, we cannotdeal with such com- < bines, and it is therefore more than ever necessary that this action should be taken. I trust that a much larger sum will be asked for to provide for the storing of timber, because seasoned timber must be an invaluable asset to the Commonwealth.",23
102,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Fawkner) [12.12] Although these are rather small items, a big principle is at stake, and I hope that the Minister will look carefully into them. The Minister appears to be introducing the thin edge of the wedge. I suppose that when the store is erected we shall be asked to provide for a storeman, who in turn will want an assistant storeman, and thereafter, perhaps, an inspector will be required to see that those men are not overworked.

If we are to season timber for years, it means the expenditure of - hundreds of thousands of pounds, and if all these big projects are to be hung up pending the seasoning of our own timber, I am afraid my good friends, the Victorians, will be perfectly happy, for instance, about the Federal Capital.

Out of that total of £50,000 he expended only £ 1 6 , 0 4 3 . We want to know from the Minister how much of those works have year. been carried out. How much of that money was spent upon surveys ? Has he started the large nursery for the planting of trees, which I quite agree is a very necessary'and urgent undertaking if the Federal City to be a beautiful one ? How much has been spent on the acquisition of land ? These are matters which I presume the Minister has at his fingers' ends under his new form system, and so he will be able to give us the information without any trouble. With regard to the expenditure for this year the matter is much more serious. The Minister stated that the contingent liability which we would incur by expending a sum of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 on certain works would amount to .£250,000. What is that sum for? The Committee ought to know that, by voting the additional amount in these Estimates, they will commit themselves to an expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds. We should be clearly told by the Minister the particular items which are to involve us in o r that ultimate liability. I am not raising question hi any carping spirit, because, f in from what I know of the advisers who are the behind the Minister in this matter, I believe they would advise him to take only sound courses of action.

Last night I said that some scheme ought to be laid before the House so that we mav know how much we are called upon to spend over a certain number of years ; and the importance of some statement on the subject is made more manifest by what we have heard from the Minister today.

Is the Committee going to blindly vote, year after year, immense sums to expended in any way the Minister may think fit, or are we going to insist proper scheme for the government of the Territory, with the necessary policy ment placed before us and approved before the money is spent? We must not forget that last year strong objection was raised to the expenditure of £ 5 0 , the beginning of this reckless expenditure; and I have no hesitation in saying that we are acting recklessly when we vote large sums in the absence of any binding details. We were asked last year, without any ing, to vote £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 ; and we were here until the next morning before it was turn laid on the table? voted. Many members who voted for the expenditure on that occasion justified Government; but they did not anticipate that a lump sum would be asked for again this year. The Minister tells £[24,000 has already been spent of the £[33,957 ; and I take it that that has been spent since the 1st July, or otherwise it would have been added to the £[.16,000. I have good reason to know that the expenditure on the Territory was stopped about a couple of months ago, owing to the difficulty of dealing with the lands; and I should like to know the details of the expenditure of £[24,000 after the ist July. We are asked to vote in this sum £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 towards the expenditure on a. power plant, the establishment of brick-works, and a weir; without being told where these are to be established. The weir involves the question of whether we are to have a pumping scheme of water supply, or, as the honourable member for Swan suggested the other day, a gravitation scheme. Is that question to be decided by the Minister at his own sweet will, or are we to have a say? It seems to me that we have reached a stage when we must insist on some scheme being submitted before we vote further money. There are other unsatisfactory aspects of the question. I have a recollection of hearing the Minister, within the last twelve months, state that the Government were still negotiating with New South Wales for the handing over of some further territory in connection with the waterworks.",28

Does the Minister know what the Governus that ment have decided on? . Mr KING O'MALLEY - Certainly .",28
163,Mr WISE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Then why was the Minister taken by surprise ? Why did he think it necessary to send two of his officers on Monday to furnish us with information, when the item was being debated? The Minister either knew nothing of the Government being determined to go on with the Estimates this week, or he simply sent those officers away on a fool's errand. If he considered it was necessary to get the information, he certainly ought to consent - to postpone this itemuntil it is obtained. Singularly enough, he tells us today that.a report is to be issued to members showing what has been done up to date; but what is the use of giving us that information tomorrow when we are dealing with the item today ? In order to test the sincerity of the Committee, and taking it that the Minister has spent .£24,000 out of the £33,ooo, I move That the item "" Federal Capital at Canberra, towards cost of establishment, ,£100,000,"" be reduced by ^66,000.",29
164,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Wimmera) [12.55] The amendment is a very timely one; and I hope it will be carried by the Committee. At this critical moment, we ought to have regard to the expenditure that must take place if this vote be passed. A warning was given last year when £[50,000 was asked for purely preliminary work; and we had no idea that the Minister would this - year submit votes involving an expenditure of between £[300,000 and £[400,000. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Onl y a few thousands are to be spent this year.",29

166,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,The whole Commonwealth committed itself - to this expenditure by adopting the Constitution.,29
167,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"It is true that, having made a bad bargain, we should carry it out faithfully; and I have never lieard any desire expressed by any honourable member to repudiate the contract entered into. But, having selected a site in good faith, it seems to me unseemly to attempt to force an expenditure of millions; all we should be called upon to do at present is to carry out works of a preparatory or preliminary character. I have in my mind more particularly the planting of trees.",29
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Are we to stay here until the trees grow ? Mr SAMPSON. - That is not necessary. We all realise that New South Wales, as the largest State, may desire to have the Federal Seat of Government within its territory. Personally, I should be prepared to allow the Parliament to sit in Melbourne for twenty years; then in Sydney for twenty years; and then, if practicable, in one of the other States for a similar term.",29

172,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"The question can be dealt with on purely national lines without our spending more money for' some considerable time on the Capital site. I do not think that the honourable member for South Sydney,, nor any other honourable member, can complain that any desire to repudiate the bargain entered into with New South Wales at the inception of Federation has ever been manifested in this House. Some honourable members think that the Capital site having been selected, we should have proceeded at once to erect there necessary public buildings.",29
173,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Hear , hear.",29
174,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"That may be all very well from the stand-point of the life of one individual, but we are intrusted with the destinies of Australia as a whole, and our first duty is to encourage people to come here, and to assist in developing the resources of the country as speedily as possible. Our public moneys should be expended in that direction before we proceed to a large outlay on ornamental buildings for which there is no crying necessity. If any of our early pioneers who struck out on the land, either as farmers, graziers, or cultivators, had expended the whole of tlieir capital in building elaborate homesteads, instead of fencing in their ground, excavating dams, and otherwise improving the productivity of the soil, they would have found themselves in the Insolvency Court before they had made a fair start in the development of their holdings. But what position are we taking up? We are but a small scattered community controlling an enormous territory comprising 3,000,000 square miles, and there can be no doubt that it is the unmistakable duty bf this Parliament to push on with the 'development of the continent. No one can say there is any pressing necessity to proceed at once to expend millions in building the Federal Capital in orrjer that our work of legislation, may be carried on. There is no desire on the part of representatives of Victoria to keep the Federal Parliament in Melbourne for any length of time. would willingly vote for any other capital city in the Commonwealth being made the Seat of Government in order that we might escape for some years, at least, the enormous expenditure of which this item on the Estimates is but a preliminary. We have to take up a new position in the light of the statement made today by the Minister of Home Affairs. Last year we were told that the item of £50,000 which we were asked to vote towards the establishment of die Federal Capital at Canberra was merely designed to meet preliminary expenses. To-day, however, we are asked to agree to an additional vote of £66,000, and we have forecasted by the Minister an immediate expenditure of £[313,000. This sum of £66,000 is to be expended on preliminary work, the total cost of which will amount to £[313,000, and we have the Minister's own statement that that work is to be the basis of a further outlay of £3,500,000. This is a very serious matter, having regard to the fact that the present Government has already heaped up the debt of the Commonwealth to the extent of £[14,500,000. not the occasion on which to discuss the whole of the finances of the Commonwealth, but we cannot view this proposed expenditure of something like £[3,500,000 on a Federal Capital without glancing at the growing general expenditure of the Commonwealth.",29
175,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Does the honourable member wish the public to believe that this Government has incurred a debt of £14,500,000?",30
176,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,I do.,30
177,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,Then the honourable member has no reasonable conscience.,30
178,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,The right honourable gentleman might well have waited until I had finished my statement before making such an uncalled for interjection.,30
179,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"The honourable member said that this Government had piled up a debt of £[14,500,000.",30
180,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"It has landed the Commonwealth in a liability of about £14,500,000.",30
181,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,Nonsens e !,30
182,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Then I will explain the items. In connection with the Northern Territory, we have taken over a debt ol £3,500,000; the construction of the railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie will involve an expenditure of anything up to I £[5,000,000; the liability taken over in connection with the Oodnadatta railway amounts to another £2,000,000; and our Defence expenditure has been increased by about £4,000,000. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Did not every Government for about ten years pledge themselves to that expenditure?",30
183,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"If the Minister will restrain himself for a liftle while, I shall proceed to tell the Committee that I believe the expenditure to which I have just referred is necessary. I have no complaint to make regarding the way in which our liabilities have been increased to this extent. We shall be able to deal with all those matters when the Budget is before us; but I may say that I agree with the principle that, for the development of this great continent, these enormous works must be undertaken. That in itself is the best justification we could have for our objection to an expenditure of £3,500,000 on works at the Federal Capital, which cannot be reproductive, are not necessary, This is and, in time of drought and scarcity, must seriously detract from our ability to enter upon great undertakings that are essential to the development of the country. It is because we have incurred this great liability that I say we should hesitate to enter upon an expenditure with respect to the Federal Capital, for which there can be no justification at this early stage in our history. In view of the enormous debt we have incurred, we must also remember that our taxation has been substantially increased. The revenue from Customs and Excise last financial year is nearly £[3,500.000 in excess of that of previous years, and we have also collected something like £1.500,000 in respect of the land tax. I am not prepared to say now whether or not there is any justification for the largely augmented revenue which the Treasury is enjoying, and to which our wonderful and beneficent seasons have materially contributed; bin, in the light of this enormously increased revenue, and the substantial instalment of direct taxation that has been imposed, and in the light of the liabilities already incurred-amounting , as I have said, to nearly £[14,500,000-it must be admitted that there is no justification for the proposed heavy, expenditure in ornamenting what is now an unpopulated expanse of country. This is not a battle between toria and New South Wales; no question of provincialism is involved. An important national issue is at stake, and it ought appeal to every honourable member. ought, first of all, to do our duty to people of Australia by developing the terior in a way that will induce people come here in large numbers, and thus vide, in the best of all ways, for our safety. pleasure and comfort. I am not criticising the expenditure on Federal Capital in any captious spirit. it could be shown that we could remove Yass-Canberra with a minimum of expendiinformation ture, and be able there to carry out more . efficiently the work intrusted to us, I should say by all means let us go there - once. Let us establish the Seat of GovernHouse ment in Sydney, or any other State capital, for fifteen years; let us do anything that is reasonable, in order that we may escape this immediate expenditure of £3,500,000 It is time for us to seriously consider the volve that expenditure. whole financial position of the Commonwealth. We must look into the future - decide whether, in any circumstances, should be justified in plunging at once this reckless and wasteful expenditure of public money. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsmonths' land, and regret that the Parliament not had an opportunity to review the whole - financial situation before being called to deal with the Works and Buildings Estimates.",30
184,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"The same principle was.involved last year when we voted £ 5 0 , 0 towards the construction of the Federal - Capital.",31
185,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Certainly; but the position has become more acute. We can avoid the whole of this proposed expendiwill ture without repudiating the bargain with New South Wales. The cry of "" diating the compact"" is always raised - order to strangle the national consideration of this question; but I have never heard any talk of repudiation, except on the part hundred years. of some honourable members directly interested in New South Wales. tatives of the other States do .not wish to repudiate the bargain.

I think that there is no hurry, the Minister will not lose kudos by delay. Although times are good now, they may bad in the near future. Tbere are large - developmental works which we must underment take, and unnecessary works can wait. More gooil could be done by spending this proposed sum of £[313,000 in imfor - proving our telephone system, and extendbusiness-like conveniences to the country districts than by carrying out works at YassThe contract with New South embodied in the Constitution cannot be set aside, but I hope that the carrying of it out will be deferred for some years.",33
198,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Franklin) [2.55Jon --The Minister has Fold us that in votfor the item under discussion we shall be committing ourselves to an expenditure He enumerated a of number of proposals,- but gave no information as to the need for them, nor did he tell us whether plans and specifications have been prepared. I think Parliament should consider immediately the advisability of , creating a Public Works Committee such as the they have in New South Wales and Victo which large proposals of this kind would be referred. While surpluses were returned to the States, there was a is check on our public works expenditure, . by and there was not so much need for the a investigation of Ministerial proposals by a conCommittee. But the public works expenditure of the Commonwealth is now attaining such proportions that it is our bounden duty to prepare for its careful scrutiny. In New South Wales every work estimated cost £[20,000 or more, must be inquired be into and reported on by the Public Works MinCommittee, and the report of the Comourmittee must be considered by Parliament. The works referred to by the Minister of Home Affairs would, under the New South t Wales law, nearly all have to go before we the Public Works Committee, and it is not exfair to ask us to commit ourselves to them the without giving us any information regardI opposed the building of a Federal Capital at the present time, thinking it twenty or tweny-five years too soon. We might very well have put up a buildin the National Park, at Sydney, and sat in Melbourne and Sydney for alterSydney renate 1 o-year periods. Mr KING O'MALLEY - On e has to pay The elecby the inch for land in Sydney. de- ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - The National is public property, and I am sure that at the citizens of New South Wales would be and glad to give us the necessary land. This House has, unfortunately,, by a large mabe jority, decided that the Federal Capital shall be established ; and, as the Governhave a majority behind them, it is only ""shadow sparring ""° to offer any opposition. However, I urge the necessity dealing with our public works in the way adopted by the States. If a proposal such as this had been made in any State Parliament, it would have received very short shrift. By this vote of £[66,000 we are committing ourselves to an expenditure of nearly £400,000. I desire to know, Mr Chairman, whether I should be in order in moving an addition to the amendment providing that the money be not voted until the matter has been referred to a public works committee.",33
199,The CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"The honourable member would not be in order in moving such a condition, because it would apply a condition to the vote, which is distinctly against what is laid down in May.",34
200,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Then , I feel so strongly that I shall take the course of submitting a motion in the House affirming that a Public Works Committee should be appointed. We are faced with enormous expenditure in the case of the overland railway and the Northern Territory, if the latter is to cease to be a mill-stone round our necks, and become reproductive. It is too much to ask any Minister or Department to deal with large expenditure of the kind without the assistance of some such body as I suggest, and such as can be found in operation in some of the States. We are asked to vote lump sums without any official reports or other mation as to details; and I am sure there is not a business man in the community who would permit such a method in his own affairs. The sooner we realise the seriousness of the position, and_appoint a Public Works Committee, the better it will be for Australia.",34
201,Mr OZANNE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Corio) [3.5] - I intend to support the amendment. I looked on the Minister of Home Affairs as a business man; but the manner in which he placed the Estimates before us the other night clines me to waver in my loyalty to that ideal. I have had some experience 'in drawing up estimates; and I know that it is necessary, not only to show all the tails, but to give reasons for the details. Here we are simply asked to vote ,£100,000 in order to build a city in the bush. Last ""year, when we voted the £[50,000, some details were given. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We can do nowhen thing unless we buy the land.",34
202,Mr OZANNE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Then the Minister should not ask for further money until the land is secured, because we may be in the same position next year. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then we shall spend no money.",34
203,Mr OZANNE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Ha d details been given the other night, a great deal of time would have been saved. It is only when the Minister finds himself, as it were, in a hole, that he lays before us information which shows an expenditure, not of £[100,000, but of £313,000. It is false economy to ask for only £[100,000 if a larger sum be necessary, because to fall short of funds at a particular period of construction might largely increase the ultimate cost. It is stated that the Federal Capital will cost £3,000,000, but I think the figure will prove to be much higher. When, a little time ago, we asked for some consideration to be shown to the members of our Military Forces, we were told that the finances would not permit of it ; and yet we are asked to vote this large sum for the purposes of a Federal Capital. I feel quite sure that if the question were submitted to the country, every State but that of New South Wales would vote against the establishment of this city. The population of Australia is only a little over 4,000,000; and yet it is proposed to have another capital. It is true that in the United States there is a Federal Capital, but it is purely a political city-prac tically dead commercially-and there are 103,000,000 people to share the cost. As inforpointed out by the honourable member for Wimmera, we are faced witli expenditure in other directions amounting to £[14,000,000; and yet the handful of people here are to be asked to provide another £[3,000,000 for this unnecessary undertaking. It seems strange that the Labour party, which aims at high ideals, cannot see its way clear to pay the individuals who are the producing workers of the country sufficient to bring their families up in comfort, and that the Governin- ment, at the same time, should ask us to pass the vote under discussion. The whole position is absurd. I understand that there are Public Works Committees in some of the de- States which do very valuable work, and the creation of such a body for the Commonwealth would relieve Ministers of great responsibility. With a Public Works Committee to inform and advise him, the Minister of Home Affairs would not find himself in the predicament of the other night, he was absolutely unable to reply to the criticism levelled at him.  gard it as irrevocably settled that we shall have a Federal Capital, but I submit that the proposed expenditure is absolutely in defiance of the desire of the important constituency I represent. It is, therefore, my intention to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland, and I , perhaps, should do all that is necessary if I said "" d it to "" to what has already beeri advanced in favour of that proposal. There is, however, one aspect that has not yet been dealt with. It is the determination, I understand, that this city shall be a model one in every respect, and to that end competitive designs have been invited. We are now asked, however, to vote money for certain works, and we are not told whether these will dovetail in with the plans as ultimately adopted. It appears to rae that, in carrying out works at this stage, we run the risk of having to undo them when the plans for the city are adopted. That is not a fair position in which to place the country and Parliament. Before a penny is spent in any permanent work, the whole scheme and design should have been settled. I , for one, have not that faith in the Minister of Home Affairs that he has in himself. Perhaps that is only reasonable. Certainly, even if he be the only banker in Australia, I do not think he can claim to be the only architect in the Commonwealth.",34
204,Mr RILEY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,Did not the honourable member's vote determine the selection of sury. Vass-Canberra ?  that I consider that the question of site irrevocably settled. We are now dealing with the question of the money to be exber pended upon it .,35

I may say, in passing, that I doubt whether the honourable member himself is a competent authority in this regard. Let the designs be finally submitted for adoption by this Parliament, and that having been done, let every expenditure incurred be an expenditure towards carrying out the accepted designs. If that course be followed, the country will be benefited, and a great deal of heavy expenditure will be put off, as it should be, for a term of years, in accordance with the needs of the Commonwealth, and until our population is considerably augmented. If the Minister and the honourable member for Parramatta could be induced to view this matter in a proper light, I am sure that they would vote for the amendment. Having entered my protest, I hope that we shaiT proceed to a division, and I am confident that, if honourable members vote in accordance with their convictions and with due regard to the desires of the people, the result of the division will be such as will prevent this threatened outrage, and ward off the heavy demand that is being made under this heading upon the public Trea",35

We need somewhat to husband our resources, but if we are going to spend wasteful schemes a hundred thousand pounds here and another hundred thousand pounds there, the national exchequer"" suffer seriously. I agree with the honortwenty-four hours. able member for Franklin that the profigures posals, as outlined by the Minister of Affairs, in regard to the Capital site solutely alarming. The Minister pleads that portion of the ,£100,000 which we asked to vote is a re-vote, but we have to remember that that expenditure is to go developing, according to the honourable gentleman, until it reaches £[31.3,000, which, in turn, will develop into an expenthere diture of £3,000,000.",36

214,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"£800,000 . If we are I going to enter the Federal Capital, doubt there must be an immense expenregret diture, but the honourable member for Cook will agree with me that the selected site lamentably deficient of those materials essential to the building of a-city.",36
215,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"The honourable member objects, not to this expenditure, but to the site itself.",36
216,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"I object to the expenpurposes. diture of money on what I regard as an undesirable site. The honourable member for Wimmera, and one or two others, accused this Government of having enormously increased the expenditure of the Commonwe wealth, but I would remind them that that purposes. expenditure relates chiefly to work sanctioned by previous Governments and ParNew liaments. The Minister of Home Affairs watersSouth has told us that the erection of a power only for ordinary plant and necessarybuildings at the Federal Capital will cost £20,000. To what plant does he refer?  pumping water. . Mr Fenton - As was pointed out when the Estimates were before us year, a. pumping scheme means a constant expenditure, and the result obtained from it is not nearly so satisfactory as that secured from a gravitation scheme. In company with a number of honourable members, I paid a visit to Yass-Canberra some little time the ago, and we were fortunate in experiencing a couple of those delightful Australian days will which make a man feel glad that he belongs to Australia, and not to. the misty where the sun is rarely seen, and the of the people are not often illumined by a smile. Our visit was preceded by an extensive rainfall, and I noticed that on the volume of water passing down the Cotter River, from which the water supply for the Federal Capital is to be drawn, will amounted to 160,0061,000 gallons for On analyzing the before leaving camp, however, I Home found that the volume of water passing are abdown the river on some days during the preceding twelve months had been as low as are 4,000,000 gallons for twenty-four hours. There is a remarkable variation in the flow, on and if that part of New South Wales has had recently an experience similar to that which has befallen other parts of the State, is probably very little water running down the stream today. I object to the site because of the enormous expenditure that will be necessary to provide there what we know as the ordinary modern conveniences. have no desire, to deal with this question no from a parochial stand-point. My only is that a better site has not been selected within that magnificent portion of is Australia known as New South Wales. I so understand that we shall not be allowed to draw any water from the Murrumbidgee. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We can draw water from that source, but not for special Mr FFJSTT0N - What does the Minister mean by '' special purposes '' ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do not think could use it, for instance, for irrigation",36
217,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,The Government of of Wales have stipulated that the the Murrumbidgee shall be used domestic purposes? Mr KING O'MALLEY - They could not prevent us putting up a weir on the Murfor rumbidgee if we desired to do so.,36
218,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,Why erect a weir on the. Murrumbidgee if our water supply last is to be drawn . from the Cotter ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Murrumbidgee is not a river from which drinking water could be drawn ?,36
219,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"A good water supply can be got from it, if it is tapped high up. I objected last year, and object again now, to the pumping scheme. It is not right to put the country to that great expenditure simply for water-supply purposes. have first to dam back the Cotter, and then from that dam to pump the water up to the top of a hill 800 feet higher, and carry it from the reservoir there across the Murrumbidgee river in pipes; and thence into the Capital. The scheme, now that I have seen it, strikes me as even more '' wild-cat'' than I thought it before. I admit that it is beautiful water. I understand that when Victoria comes into her own, the country south of the Murrumbidgee will pass into her possession, and then the water supply of the Federal Capital will come within her territory. Unfortunately, it appears that we are to be committed to a great expenditure on the Capital site; and I believe as the years go by, and increasing amounts are asked for to carry out this great scheme, Parliament will become more and more doubtful of its wisdom, until, probably, it will refuse to vote further money for the purpose. If we happen to strike a few bad seasons, any Government that goes on expending money on this site will be doing what, to my mind, will be criminal. It must be remembered, in regard to the water-supply scheme, that when a stream like the Cotter is dammed back, and millions of gallons of water are stored in the dam, underneath the surface of that water, as a rule, a large amount of vegetable matter accumulates. That is sure to happen in this case, and considerable trouble will be caused by it. Instead of having a live running stream, the water coming in will just flow over the surface, and over the top of the weir, while the water underneath, which will be taken to supply the city, will be almost dead water, adversely affected by a great deal of vegetable and, perhaps, not conducive to public health. Instead of having a real live gravitation stream from a pure source into a dam immediately outside the Federal Capital, we shall be, unfortunately, 'troubled with a bad water supply. Firstly, therefore, we shall have a somewhat deficient supply of water as compared with what we might have had at other sites ; and secondly, we shall be put to a great amount of expense in order to get the water to the city. I hope that the bridge which is to carry the water across the Murrumbidgee will be used for general traffic also. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It will be for general traffic on the one side, and the water pipes on the other.",37
220,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"That will make the expenditure on the bridge a little more We justifiable. The works proposed involve an exceptionally big expenditure. The weir is to cost £30,000; the mains and pipe head, & c , will run into £[140,000; the bridge over the Murrumbidgee will cost .£40,000; the temporary railway from Queanbeyan to the Capital site will cost £[25,000; road-making and deviations, £10,000; offices at Acton and afforestation, £[13,000; and joinery timber, £[5,000. With regard to the latter items, I expected, after hearing the delightful picture presented to the House by the Minister on the last occasion, to see a number of trees fairly well advanced at Yass-Canberra. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have not got that, possession of the land yet.",37
221,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"I think there will be some difficulty about obtaining the land; and if it is true that its value is only £[2 per acre on the average, as the honourable member for Wimmera said",37
222,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,That is the freehold.,37
223,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"The other land could be given away. On seeing that country, I thought that the words used in the New South Wales Legislative Council, to the effect that the Federation could have this territory, as it was of no good to the State, were very true. What timber is growing diere is very .stunted. When there, I saw a. bridge being built across the so-called Molonglo river, which we called a creek. I learnt from the men engaged on the work that the timber they were using did not come from the neighbourhood, but was brought from a place a long way outside the confines of the Territory. It was not timber of extra size, and there were no difficulties about the work. It matter, was simply an ordinary bridge to span a mere creek. That incident proved conclusively to me that there was in the Territory a dearth of the materials necessary for building even an 'ordinary town. The Minister is also going to spend a considerable sum on brick-making. If the Government cannot make better bricks there when their machinery is erected than those which, I saw being used in erecting what I understood were to be permanent buildings on the Acton Estate, I am sorry for the buildings that will be put up there. I do not think I ever handled worse bricks in my life. Those were newly-made bricks when I was there two or three months ago. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have not made any bricks there yet.",37
224,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Thos e bricks were made upon the ground. Were they fair specimens of the bricks likely to be made there in the future? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We brought the clay to Hoffman's in Melbourne, and they made bricks as fine as the world ever saw.",38
225,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"In the case of the bricks I saw and handled at the Federal Capital site, one could take off the corners with finger and thumb. I had made complaints before in regard to the deficiencies of the selected Capital site, and so I wanted, by my own personal observation, to rectify any mistakes I had made or to justify my statements. I admit* that I saw the Cotter river under cliarming conditions, which left an impression which is hard to remove; but, at the same time, I find from the figures that the flow of 160,000,000 gallons a day is often reduced to 4,000,000 gallons. In the Sydney Bulletin of this week appears the following little poem, which puts the case very much better than I could :Rock, and gorge, and dust; . Scrub and falren treeKerosene tin-bust ; Lizards running free. Here and there a tent, Shows a dingy peak, Where the dwellers went 'Hunting for the creek. Hungry is the land- "" Stony, brown and bare; Thirsty is the band Stuck forlornly there ! Desolate and dry, 0 Round and round aboutWinds that whistle by, Speak of Coming Drought. Should it strike next week On the Site of Fools, With Molonglo Creek Just a chain of pools. What, oh, what the tale < That we shall be told? "" Rivers never fail . . . ° Mountains full of gold'. . . . Scenery suferb! . . . Cataracts and lakes . . . Pools no winds disturb . . . Not a sign of snakes. . . . Thus-and thus-and thusThrough the Press that rules, Comes the tale to us, From the Site of Fools! It would appear that even the Department of Home Affairs is much in doubt as to the desirability of the site that has been chosen for the Federal Capital, judging by the following circular issued by the Minister for the information of persons, undertaking work thereThe greater part of the city area lies on the Molonglo River, and during periods of prolonged dry weather the river ceases to run. It is readily fordable at short intervals during the greater part of the year, though subject to sudden alterations in volume. In 1891 the highest recorded flood took place, when the waters overflowed the steeled site for the Federal Capital. The maximum record summer temperature is 104 .deg. During winter the temperature frequently falfe below freezing point. I have been informed, too, by residents that the statements are borne out by facts, and that the city will be on practically the lowest part of the site. Round about are some stone-covered hills, but in winter the place is fog bound. We know the Minister's famous utterance about being fogbound on a shoreless sea, which would be a terrible predicament, but it is not comfortable to be enveloped in fog anywhere.",38
226,Mr CANN,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,We get heavy fogs in Melbourne.,38
227,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT,"Yes , but there must be places in New South Wales free from fogs such as are prevalent during the winter at Canberra. When I was there I hardly slept for the cold, although well covered with blankets. This is a very serious question, because we are embarking on an expenditure of many millions. While the revenue is what it is, the expenditure may not be much felt, but the day will come when it will cause great inconvenience. I do not know whether I shall again raise my voice against this project. Hope deferred maketh the heart sick, and the hope of the reversal of the decision regarding the Capital has made my heart very sick indeed. Were the composition .of this Parliament the same as that of earlier Parv liaments, we should not now be voting money for expenditure at Yass-Canberra. There is no reason why we should not make a change of site even now. It is always best to turn back when warned of certain evil. I hope that in the interests of Australia the reduction proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland will be carried as an intimation, to the Minister not to proceed further with this expenditure.
