2,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) is on government business assessing the damage in North Queensland as a result of the cyclone and will be late to question time. In his absence any questions normally directed to him should be directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). NA Superannuation,13
3,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has it been brought to the Treasurer's attention this morning that there is a further major problem with his 15 per cent superannuation tax package, caused in this instance by a botching of the amendment which was rammed through yesterday to correct a constitutional problem which he said did not exist? Has he been told that, in relation to a number of long established schemes, as the legislation now stands the burden of the new tax will not be borne by the high income earners themselves as intended but by the funds' trustees who can only recoup by reducing the earnings of all fund members, the vast majority of whom earn less than $70,000 or, alternatively, in some cases that that burden will have to be borne by the employers? Will he now acknowledge that he has made a comprehensive mess of the implementation of this legislation, and will he agree to withdraw and completely redraft it?",13
4,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The quick answer is no. But, of course, the government's position and the amendments which were moved to put the matters beyond doubt were done so on good legal advice from good lawyers-and good lawyers don't normally have to appoint themselves QCs. Small Business: Coalition Commitments",13
5,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In my electorate of Lilley the landmark statement on small business by the Prime Minister yesterday was seen as a positive commitment by the government to small business and was very warmly received by small business in my electorate. Can the Prime Minister outline to the House what has been the reaction by small business at a national level to the raft of initiatives contained in the More Time for Business statement and can he indicate whether this package means that the task is now completed?,13
6,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly can inform the member for Lilley, as I can inform all members of the parliament, that overwhelmingly the reaction of men and women speaking on behalf of small business to the government's package has been very positive. For example, Allan Handberg of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures said: The Statement will certainly have a very positive effect on small business growth and job creation in the medium term. Mark Paterson of ACCI said the reform plan would: ... significantly reduce the compliance [costs] in small business and boost confidence . . . Ron Tomlinson of the Retail Traders Association of Victoria said: The package would provide a substantial boost for employment. Dr Ron Silberberg of the housing industry said: Initiatives in the Prime Minister's statement would significantly reduce the paper work and compliance burden for small business through liberalisation of FBT and unfair dismissal requirements. The government's response shows sensitivity to pressures facing small business. It will assist to strengthen small business activity and reduce regulatory costs. Mr Rob Bastian from the Council of Small Business Organisations, who on occasions in the past has not always led the chorus of praise for the parties of the coalition-in fact on odd occasions he has been found to say something mildly critical of the coalitionhad this to say about the unfair dismissals: That's obviously the jewel in the crown. That is one that will actually create jobs-and I am certain of it. The important thing to understand about the unfair dismissal reform is that something like 80 per cent of all businesses in Australia that employ people will have the benefit of this new unfair dismissal proviso. The new proviso will give new hope for the employment of young Australians by 80 per cent of all businesses in Australia. Those who are against this measure are against employing young Australians. That is what they are. Those who oppose it want to keep the kids on the unemployment list. If you think for a moment that that is a sinister, cynical and savage coalition attitudeOpposition Members-Yes!",13
7,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They say yes. Do I hear yes? Can I say that the only one amongst you who holds elected office at the moment, Bob Carr, agrees with me on this. The New South Wales Labor Premier gave you a big send-off on this about 12 months ago. It is very plain that this package has gone to the heart of many of the concerns of the small business community. This package has more than delivered on our commitment. We have overdelivered on capital gains tax. We have overdelivered on unfair dismissal reform. We have delivered investment opportunities in small technology companies. We are well on the path to achieving our goal of reducing 50 per cent of the paperwork in our first years of office. Once again, the Australian Labor Party is going around with a collective long face. They always look unhappy when there is good news for the Australian economy can bet on it. If you want to know how the Australian economy is doing, look at the glum for Hotham. faces opposite and you know it is doing pretty well. You are out of touch on this, as you have been out of touch on so many other issues. Small Business: Red Tape",14
8,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. It relates to another quote in relation to his document of yesterday. Prime Minister, I draw your attention to today's editorial in the Financial Review, which states: The Howard government's small business package will go nowhere near the coalition's election promise to cut the burden of red tape in half. Prime Minister, have you walked away from your election promise, and do you stand by your commitment to have small business red tape to an average two hours per week by the end of the term of your government?",14
9,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it will not surpriseMr Crean-Just answer yes or no.",14
10,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have asked your question.,14
11,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Oh! Mr Crean-Do you stand by it?,14
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it will not surprise the House for me to say that I take editorials in the Financial Review as they come. Some of them. I agree with; a lot of them. I do not agree with. Occasionally they're right; frequently they're wrong. Can I say that all of the commitments that we made to the small business community in areas of capital gains tax, in areas of industrial relations reform, have been more than delivered. I remind those who sit opposite that the commitment in relation to the paperwork burden was a commitment that we are well on the road to achieving.",14
13,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplethree mentary question. Prime Minister, is the answer no?",14
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! That is not within the umbrella of the original question. Mr Crean-You won't commit to the . You target. You are a fraud.,14
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member Small Business: Industrial Relations,14
16,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the advantages to small business of the proposed exemption from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996? What has been the response to this proposal?,14
17,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I mentioned in the answer to the question asked of me by the member for Lilley that one of the significant features of the new unfair dismissal proposal of the government was that it would benefit about 80 per cent-I repeat: 80 per cent-of all the firms in Australia that actually employ people. That is a very high percentage of all the firms that employ people in Australia. The honourable member for Dickson has asked me: what has been the reaction to the unfair dismissal provision? The reaction of small business has been very positive. The reaction of the opposition so far is a bit hard to work out. Perhaps, if we have a look at the reaction of the President of the ACTV, we might then be able to deduce what the reaction of the opposition is going to be. This makes very interesting reading. Last night, in an interview on the PM program, Jennie George, the President of the ACTV, said: I am assuming that the Labor Party will do the right thing and do what we're doing-opposing the extension of these unfair dismissal exemptions. She went on to say: A Labor Party senator was heard to say that the Labor Party would not be opposing the expansion in this exemption. I'd find that an amazing proposibe tion for the Labor Party to be putting. So there you have the riding instructions for the Leader of the Opposition. What everybody on this side of the House would like to know is: is the Leader of the Opposition going to oppose the unfair dismissal exemption or is he going to support it? Is he going to be told by Jennie George that he supports it? Is he going to stand shoulder to shoulder on a platform with Jennie George in opposing the unfair dismissal laws, like he stood shoulder to shoulder on 19 August last? You remember that very well. I think many Australians remember that. We would like to know from the Leader of the Opposition: are you going to do what Jennie tells you on this or are you going to have the guts to form your own view? Where do you stand? Yes or no? Are you for or against a measure that will help young Australians get work? Small Business: Employment",15
18,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall saying, 'I'm going to make it a real target of my first three years in office to create the circumstances where tens of thousands of new jobs have been created through the liberation and encouragement of small business'? If the Prime Minister's small business statement is supposed to make it easier for small business to employ people, will he guarantee to create more than the 110,000 jobs per year created by Labor in the last decade?",15
19,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A Labor member talking about job creation ! You had 13 years and you left us with 8Y2 per cent unemployed. You drove it to 11 Y2 per cent during the depths of the recession. Can I say to the honourable member opposite: the answer is yes, I do remember making that statement. The second part of the answer is that, if you really want to share that aspiration with us, you will support this package-including the new unfair dismissal provision. But I do not think you will. You know why? Because Jennie George has told you you're not allowed to. Jennie George has decided that you have to oppose this. It will fascinating to watch the Labor Party writhe and wriggle and squirm on this issue. It will be fascinating to watch them. I will bet that at the end of the day you end up doing exactly what Jennie has told you to do-that is, oppose this measure. If you oppose it, you will be condemned again by the young people of Australia for denying them job opportunities. Small Business: Building Approvals",15
20,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. In my electorate of Parramatta, small businesses have reacted very favourably to a number of initiatives in the More Time for Business package announced by the Prime Minister yesterday, especially businesses in the building and construction sector. Can the minister please inform the House as to the likely impact of the introduction of private certification of all building approvals and what this will mean for the all-important bottom line for small businesses?  Parramatta for his question. In fact, the government's response to recommendation No. 27 for private certification of building approvals includes the inspection of the construction, self-certification and occupancy. I am sure that many members would know, and I am sure my colleague the member for La Trobe would know, that, in the building industry, delays in getting approvals, getting the certificates and even the certificate for occupation causes great delays and enormous costs to the industry. In responding in today's press on the Small Business Deregulation Task Force response, the Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Association said that, for the building industry, the move has the potential of achieving savings of around $1 billion. The article states: It is a very significant savings potential. The Building Codes Board, along with state and territory representatives, has made considerable progress in this area already under the existing arrangements in some of the state and territory jurisdictions. Different stages of building works, including the foundation approvals, can take up to four weeks. With these changes, it can take three to seven days. Mr Beddall-The shonkies are having a great time.  member for Rankin is very interesting. I have been looking through a report prepared by the previous government by the 'Hon. David Beddall, Chairman'. Mr Costello-I remember the Beddall committee. I've read it. I was about the only one who read it.  the only one to read it. I had to find a copy and dust it off. That is what happened-it gathered dust. Let us look at recommendation No. 34 from January 1990. Prime Minister, you will be very interested in this. Recommendation No. 34 says: The Committee recommends, given the existing capital gains tax regime, capital gains tax be deferred on capital gains realised in the sale of a Craney. trading business which is rolled over into another trading business. That was in 1990. Who delivered? We delivered on this initiative. What did you do? You did not even know it was still in there. We set out to correct an initiative that you put in place on 19 September 1985. You made the recommendation; you did not deliver. We delivered capital gains tax rollover, fringe benefits, industrial relations reform, reform for small business and a cut of 50 per cent in deregulation together with positive initiatives in the building industry which will be a major boost to the building industry. We have cut costs and delivered better benefits. We have delivered for small business. Our report is not gathering dust. We are actioning the recommendations. NA",15
21,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the next question, I advise the House that we have in the gallery this afternoon the Secretary-General of the Australian Red Cross and a former distinguished member of this place, the Hon. Jim Carlton. Lovely to see you, Jim. NA Small Business: Better Practice Legislation",16
22,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the member for Brand. I refer the member to his notice of motion concerning the reintroduction of his Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill. I ask: why is it essential that that bill be brought on for immediate introduction and debate?,16
23,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very delighted to answer that question to rain on this very small parade that the government has put in place for small business. Not one small business person has been named in any of the questions. So now let me name one. The Sydney Morning Herald says: The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was not greeted by the resounding acclamation he was hoping for when he gave a helping hand to his favoured smallbusiness constituency yesterday. 'There's nothing very juicy here. It's certainly not a very exciting package,' said Mr Merik Mr Craney, who runs a Mascot-based export manufacturer of resin-spray equipment called Hermex Corporation, said that small businesses most needed an injection of investment capital. He went on to say: 'I agree with Mr Beazley. The banks' support is sadly lacking at the moment.' We now have for the first time in this question time, either yesterday or today, a small businessman actually named. If there had been a bit of courage in the government, and it was not simply a government of the big end of town-I made my contribution, which is good news for small business, by putting it back on the Notice Paper yesterday-then, 12 months on, they might have done something in response to the Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill. That actually gets to where small business is really at. What about the situation in which the franchisees find themselves? That is the fastest growing area of small business. They are growing by some 14 per cent per annum. They contribute $42 billion worth of business to the nation each year. What has been the government's solution to them? Their code of conduct is out the door. Their franchisors are put in charge of the administration of that code of conduct. They go down the gurgler as far as this government is concerned. What about all those small businesses in the shopping centres complaining about what happens to them in relation to oppressive conduct?",16
24,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,17
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will not tolerate the beating of hands across the desks. 1 reiterate it. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, you will not be surprised by me rising to a point of order. The question, 1 think, is fairly is also a fact that, whilst a member is entitled to a fair go, if you refer to the House of Representatives Practice, he is not entitled to anticipate debate. Most members of the House would also appreciate that Labor had 13 years to do this and did nothing, absolutely nothing. He ought to, therefore, be required to meet the standing orders.",17
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the House. There is no point of order. The question is within order, although it is eliciting information and not anticipating debate.",17
27,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But 1 will talk about its urgency, Mr Speaker.",17
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Urgency is one matter but 1 do not want the issue debated.,17
29,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, absolutely not, Mr Speaker. We will talk about its urgency all right, the urgency that is felt by small businesses around the shopping centres being rack-rented, the urgency felt by small businesses who find themselves in competition with vertically integrated big businesses-those small businesses, for example, who run petrol stations, all those small fabrication plants that occasionally compete with the big fellas. That is out there where the real business of this nation is being done by real small business people",17
30,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. 1 refer you to standing order 143, which is the standing order on which this question has been asked. 1 think the first thing to note is that we are reminded of years when you were in government",17
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Move quickly to your point of order or resume your seat.,17
32,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, sir. All the conventions applicable under 143 limit the person asking this question to referring specifically to when their legislation is to be debated. In very simple terms, they are not able to debate it.",17
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,17
34,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But he has been talking for 10 minutes.,17
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Brand will draw his answer to a rapid in order, but it conclusion.",17
36,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will draw it to a conclusion, Mr Speaker, but I am going to be making a few points, as I think I am entitled to, given the performance that we are subjected to here day after day, whilst staying within standing orders.",17
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Address the question.,17
38,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Which I realise I must do, Mr Speaker, and that is to go to the urgency of why this bill should be debated in this place and considered after it was allowed to lapse from the Notice Paper, despite my requesting the government a few weeks ago to bring it on for debate-a real test of whether or not they regarded small businesses as serious in this regard. I remind them, in advocating the urgency, of those comments by Mr Bastian, who was the one person associated with small business here who has actually been quoted on what small business believed was the most significant thing that they could have. When interviewed, Bastian said, 'Well, they want a tighter Trade Practices Act, and that is why we strongly support the harsh and oppressive conduct approach' - as indeed they do, because what we are talking about here is huge numbers of small businesses. When you are talking about, for example, those potential beneficiaries of changes on fringe benefits tax you are talking about something like six per cent of small business, not 94 per cent of them. There are a heck of a lot more, though, who find themselves franchisees and in any other situations where they are likely to be subject to oppressive conduct. But can the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs get this bill on here for debate? No, he cannot, because every time he does for the big end of town the Treasurer comes in over the top of him. With a great deal of energy he comes in over the top of him. The one item that this government has actually managed to get a front page headline out of, as opposed to everything else they are doing, is their ability to sack people-not to create jobs but to sack people. The one front page they got today in an otherwise completely desultory result was their opportunity to sack people. Instead of finding opportunities to make Australians more insecure, what they ought to be doing is getting big business off .' e backs of small business. ",17
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has concluded his answer.,18
40,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The House will come to order. This is a general warning. I reserve right to take whatever action I deem appropriate to restore the House to order. Wallis Report,18
42,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House as to when the financial system inquiry will formally hand its report to the government? How will the government respond to the recommendations contained in the inquiry's report?,18
43,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. The financial system inquiry report, commonly known as the Wallis report, was commissioned some nine months ago and was asked to report by 31 March of this year. I expect that I will be in a position to receive the report and brief the government on the conthe tents of it in the week commencing 7 April. I expect that therefore the report will be able to be released some time during that week. The government will of course announce its attitude towards the report at the time of release. There may be some things that the government responds to straight away; there will unquestionably be a number of things that it will take some time for the government to develop a position on and announce a response. It should be made clear to all parties who conduct their commercial conduct that until the government announces a change of policy the current policy stands. Any person that takes a commercial decision in the interim does so at their own risk, and should do so taking into account the fact that it is the government's policy that is the critical thing, not the recommendations contained in the report. I do believe that the financial system inquiry gives the government and the nation an opportunity to look carefully at the financial system to ensure that it is modem and efficient, that it caters for needs which are varied in a complex society and that it sets up a financial system which can be competitive and delivered to consumers for decades to come. That is certainly the way in which the inquiry has been approached. I see this as an the enormous opportunity for the nation and the government, and the government will be glad to take its part in ensuring outcomes which are beneficial to all Australians. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission: Travel Expenses and Allowances",18
44,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, given the current investigations into parliamentarians' travel allowances, in fairness to the Australian taxpayer and in light of a report in yesterday's Courier-Mail of wrong figures being submitted, will you support an inquiry into the travel expenses and allowances of ATSIC commissioners?",19
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Oxley for her question. I am aware of some of the travel expense details of that particular organisation. I am aware of those figures. Let me say that I think all travel allowance expenses which come out of the Commonwealth purse ought to be the subject of appropriate scrutiny, whether they apply to public office holders, such as the people you have referred to, or whether they apply to members of parliament. I think the honourable member's question gives me the opportunity to say something about the debate that has gone on in the other place, although interestingly enough the Leader of the Opposition has left all the running on this to a couple of people in the Senate. It is very interesting that at no stage has the Leader of the Opposition had the intestinal fortitude to stand up and ask me or anybody else a question. He might next one around. I hope he does. But let me simply say that it is my view that the overwhelming majority of members of parliament and the overwhelming majority of public servants who are entitled to travel allowances exercise those privileges with complete honesty and complete propriety. I think it is very important that that be said and I think it is extremely important that that be said in defence of members on both sides of this House. I think all members of the House condemn abuse of privileges and all members of the House condemn anybody on the public payroll who takes advantage of a privileged position. If there is any rorting of any expenses by anybody, that rorting will be investigated. We will not display any favours towards anybody, nor will we allow the vengeance of the Australian Labor Party to deny members of this House or another place the natural justice available to all members and senators. Employment: Work for the Dole Scheme",19
46,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In light of the continuing numbers of enthusiastic inquiries, expressions of interest and actual submissions to be part of the work for the dole scheme from across the nation, like the request I recently received from the Kinglake District Neighbourhood House, I ask the Minister whether he has seen media reports about consultation the government has had with community groups about the work for the dole scheme.",19
47,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: this matter is on the Notice Paper for debate.",19
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not seeking to debate the issue; it is seeking to elicit information.,19
49,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But it is in relation to a matter on the Notice Paper.,19
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,19
51,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCEwen for her question and I acknowledge the significant contribution that she is making to the government's consultations on the work for the dole initiative. I am pleased to be able to report that there has been continuing enthusiastic support for the government's initiative and, of course, amongst. the most enthusiastic supporters have been young people themselves. The government has already received numerous expressions of interest. Indeed, the number of expressions of interest we have already received in establishing pilot projects exceeds the number of pilot projects we intend to establish. We have not even called for submissions at the moment. So there is a great deal of interest out there in the community. Given the high level of community interest in this initiative, the government is consulting widely with community groups and on 27 February, as part of this consultation, I met with 12 community groups. This was a very productive and constructive consultation and the government appreciates the input from all of those who attended. In answer to the member for MCEwen's question, I did see a newspaper article yesterday which appears to have been based on the notes of one of the participants at that meeting. I must inform the House that the tenor of those notes does not actually reflect the consultation and, indeed, they show some misunderstanding of the nature of the scheme. Work for the dole is not a short-term training program of the kind on which the previous government squandered so much of taxpayers' money. Let me illustrate the problems that arise when a journalist relies on one set of notes. I just quote one example of this. The Australian Council for Volunteering, which was incorrectly identified in that article as the 'Volunteers Association', was described in the article as 'one of the equivocators about the work for the dole scheme'. Let me quote for the information of the House from a letter I have received since that consultation from Mrs Margaret BeU, the President of the Australian Council for Volunteering, about the consultation: The Australian Council for Volunteering would like to thank you for your involvement of the community in the discussions and to congratulate the government on these initiatives. This was described as 'equivocal' in that newspaper article. Mrs Bell went on: It is with pleasure that we submit to you the outline of what we believe would be an exciting and worthwhile option for young unemployed people to engage in. Some equivocation. Indeed, the only equivocators on this issue have in fact been the Labor Party, the opposition, who first of all opposed the scheme, then told us that they were going to amend it to blazes",19
52,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I appreciate that you have indicated that you understood the question not to be anticipating debate, but the minister is plainly doing so. To the extent that the minister is moving beyond the proper remit of this question he is out of order.",20
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is not debating the legislation. The question was designed to elicit information and the information is being provided. There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,20
54,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is debating the worth or otherwise of the measure.,20
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat!,20
56,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The only equivocation that we see is from the Labor Party which first of aU opposed the scheme, then said it would amend it to blazes, then said it would support it and then discovered that it had one of them all the time while it was in government which nobody noticed. It is pretty clear why this equivocation is taking place on the other side of the House. The Labor Party is under enormous pressure, and none more so than the Leader of the Opposition. We have just seen that they are equivocating for the moment on the unfair dismissal provisions in the small business package that the government announced yesterday. They are equivocating because they are under pressure from Jennie George and the ACTU. They are equivocating on their economic policies because they are getting pressure presumably from people like Gough Whitlam who says, 'This is not the time to back away from Labor's traditional support for an open economy.' The reason for this is that they are not getting leadership and direction from the Leader of the Opposition. We recall the comments of former Labor senator and minister Jim MCCleUand in the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 March. He made the point that 'Kim Beazley does not seem to have the fire in his belly to lead his languishing party out of the wilderness'. That is where the equivocation is taking place. That is why this party is unable to have any sensible sense of direction. That is why this government is listening to the community and is leading this country towards providing proper opportunities for young unemployed people in quality training and opportunities so that they can make a contribution to their communities. Colston, Senator M.",20
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"More blah! My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. We have to completion. now seen the person whose position was upgraded by yourself at a cost to the Australhonourable Ian taxpayer of some $70,000 take the blame for Senator Colston's false travel claims. Having previously failed to answer questions regarding your role in that upgrade, will you now explain to the House the nature of all arrangements and inducements which you, your staff and your agents, Senator Alston and Senator Hill, entered into with Senator Colston to secure his vote?",21
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There were no inducedid ments. Defence Projects,21
59,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. I refer the minister to recent media reports of serious problems identified with certain major defence projects. As the minister would be aware, projects mentioned include lORN, the over the-horizon radar project; the new Collins order? class submarine; and the helicopter landing ships purchased from overseas in which rust has greatly added to their cost. Will the minister inform the House as to whether these claims are correct?",21
60,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Longman for his question. It is perfectly obvious, as he says and as pointed out to the House last night, that some of these things have gone amiss. One of the examples of that is the lindalee over-thewas horizon radar project which is an expensive example of how the previous government got it wrong and failed to take sufficient care to monitor these large projects. As we all know now, the Auditor-General's report on lORN indicates that the previous government allowed payments excess of work done and in excess of the value of work delivered. In fact, it got so bad that the prime contractor has had to be changed and that prime contractor has had to make provisions in his books for some hunfew dreds of millions of dollars of losses. On 12 February, I announced in agreement to make a change to that Telstra prime contractor with Transfield Defence Systems and LockheedMartin to manage the lORN project through As to the second matter mentioned by the member, that is the rusty helicopter landing ships, also organised by the previous government, the project could have been far more carefully assessed before the previous government agreed to their purchase. The original purchase price was $23 million, the landed price delivered here was $61 million, the rust that was not catered for cost $25 million; and this project will now cost us well over $200 million-something that you not cater for. Labor also developed, as we all know, two inshore minehunters that are so restricted in their operations that they are mainly useful for",21
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minehunter program to which he referred, which I agree was a complete failure, was signed, negotiated and put in the place by the previous Liberal government.",21

64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that I will not tolerate frivolous points of order.,21
65,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We will be taking a he much closer role in overseeing the proper progress of all of these projects. The fact of the matter is that the previous government profligate in these matters. It was budgetary profligate. It was commercially profligate. Mr Bevis interjecting,21

Remove yourself from the service of the to be made in House for one hour. The honourable member for Brisbane thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,21
67,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That will get rid of a decibels. If you want to look at a few more of these matters, the Leader of the Opposition could have been involved in some of this profligacy himself. If you don't believe me, have a look at the VIP flights in the last half of 1995. We could not work out how the Leader of the Opposition spent so much money. We thought the member for Lyons must have been taken along for ballast and they were being charged by the kilogram. Mr Tanner-Playing golf?",21

You were commercially and nationally profligate when you were in government. The people know it, and that is why you are sitting over there. Employment: Shipbuilding Bounty",22
71,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will endeavour to put a bit of weight into question time. My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen comments by Bob Clifford, Managing Director of Hobart shipbuilder Incat, that 'Every order that we miss because the bounty was taken away equates to 200 jobs' and by Mr John Rothwell, Managing Director of Fremantle shipbuilder Austal Ships, that 'Austal ships was faced with shedding 300 of their 800-strong work force'? Prime Minister, is it not the case that those jobs were lost because the government reneged on a promise to align Australia's shipbuilding bounty with overseas bounties? Why won't you, Prime Minister, honour your promise and secure the jobs of those Australians still working in this industry?",22
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say to the honourable member for Lyons, who I know asked that question very sincerely, that my understanding is-and I will check with my colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism-that as a result of a change that was announced towards the end of last year the budget decision was varied to the extentMrs Crosio-Wrong.",22
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hang on. That the subsidy was to continue until the end of this calendar year, and that that brought it in line with the OECD provision. Mrs Crosio-Wrong.",22
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I prefaced my answer by giving that response. It was to continue until the end of this year, and it was also my understanding-which I will check when I have the opportunity of doing so-that he indicated at the time that if some further extension were needed to keep pace with the OECD practice then we would do so. Cyclone Justin",22
75,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Given that the Deputy Prime Minister has just returned from cyclone affected Far North Queensland, can the Deputy Prime Minister detail the extent of the damage in Far North Queensland and what is being done by local authorities and others to repair the damage?",22
76,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Early this morning I travelled to Townsville, and later on to Ingham, to survey the damage in the aftermath of Cyclone Justin and to meet with mayors, with the state emergency services, the army, the air force, the Department of Primary Industry in Queensland and other interlocutors to see first-hand the outcome of the horrific cyclone which saw a large number of people killed in Papua New Guinea, two on the mainland of Australia and a number of others in the Coral Sea. I was joined on the visit by Senator MACGIBBON and Senator Macdonald and the members for Dawson, Herbert and Kennedy, who are still making their way back here from Fairbairn airport. It was a very worthwhile visit. Unfortunately, the news is not good with regard to the damage to tourism infrastructure and to a number of primary industry crops, particularly bananas, with many banana plantations being wiped out completely. There is damage to sugar crops, damage to pawpaw crops, damage to macadamia plantations and many others. I am pleased to follow on the advice the Minister for Finance gave yesterday to the House and confirm that the federal governIngham-will ment stands ready to supply $3 for every out laid by the Queensland government for ery. infrastructure repair and recovery with regard to certain low interest loans and grants in the circumstances applicable. That is the highest amount and ratio granted in the life of government of Prime Minister John Howard as a consequence of the horrific disasters that have hit Queensland over the most recent riod. I was able to deliver a greeting and letter from the Prime Minister at Townsville and Ingham in respect of the great community effort that have been forthcoming, and I met and had discussions by telephone with operation tors from the electorate of the member for Leichhardt as well. Let me just say two critical things. Firstly, I am satisfied that there will be a bounce nouncement? back. There is a huge clean-up operation going on. The primary industries affected and the tourism industry are moving very quickly to recover as the remnants of the cyclone drift that further south and out to sea. to reform. Secondly, I say in absolutely loud and clear terms to the nation, particularly southerners, that tropical North Queensland open for tourism business again right now, for Easter and for beyond, and that the Cairns and Townsville are fully operational again. The Bruce Highway is reopening and the rail links are reopening. The best thing people who want to make a contribution to the recovery can do is to recommit to their plans to visit tropical North Queensland, sooner rather than later. Mr Martin Ferguson-Drop the reef tax.",22
77,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I must say that the Labor Party carry on in typical terms in face of what was an horrific circumstance thousands of Australians in tropical North Queensland. They deserve more careful limit comment from you than the interjections are mounting across the chamber. I want to assure the member for Leichhardt that the federal government, in conjunction with the Queensland government, in conjuncminister tion with the relevant authorities, including local government-and I met specifically with the mayors of Townsville, Thuringowa and do all it can to minimise the $1 losses and help build confidence and recovEmployment: Shipbuilding Bounty",23
78,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the the Prime Minister and is further to the answer that you gave to the member for Lyons.

80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Leave is not granted. Immigration,23
81,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multiculand tural Affairs. Last week you announced changes to the merits assessment and review system of immigration decisions. However, beyond this, I understand that immigration the cases make up a disproportionately high for number of matters before the Federal Court. What is the government planning to do to this expensive litigation of refugee and you immigration decisions?",23
82,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The standing orders do provide that a questioner is not entitled to question a as to an announcement of government policy. Plainly, this is that.",23
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question does not anticipate government policy, otherwise the mlOlster would be making a ministerial statement. And it is not on the Notice Paper?",23
84,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Mr SPEAKER ,24
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,24
86,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. The honourable member is correct in saying that my portfolio is disproportionately represented in litigation before the Federal Court of Australia. This is despite the fact that immigration and refugee applicants have access to a thorough merits review of their cases by my department. If they are unhappy with that outcome, they are able to seek independent merits review before a tribunal, so they have every chance to put their case. In addition, they can also access the Federal and High Courts of Australia, giving them up to three levels of judicial review. The issue of refugee determination is a matter of very considerable importance to me, as I have emphasised before. I want to make it clear that I expect that any person with well-founded claims would have them accepted by my department at first instance. The United Nations Convention on Refugees requires us to provide asylum seekers with a full opportunity to present their claims and to have those claims assessed. Many countries have accepted that this should include an opportunity for merits review. However, there is no requirement to provide this at both the administrative level, as we do, and at the judicial level, which we also provide. Some 60 per cent of administrative law cases before the Federal Court are immigration matters. In the 1995-96 budget, there were litigation costs, involving my department, of $7.4 million, and that did not include the cost of legal aid, nor did it include the costs of running the courts or keeping people in detention while matters are resolved. There are currently 623 active cases involving the immigration portfolio before the Federal Court, the Full Court of the Federal Court and the High Court of Australia. We know that a substantial proportion of these cases will be withdrawn prior to a hearing. Of those cases that do go to court-that is, that have substantive hearings-my department currently wins 89 per cent. Of interest to members might be cases where people test and retest the system in order to obtain benefits. We have seen people delay their departure while seeking work rights and access to Medicare. We know that some people are now using litigation to add to those delays. My colleague the Attorney-General referred to a case recently involving illegal immigrants who came here on a boat codenamed the 'Albatross'. They used legal aid to pursue the case through the Federal Court, the Full Court of the Federal Court and the High Court without success at any instance. The honourable member asks me what we are going to do about it. Let me say this practice has added to delays in the courts and costs the taxpayers many millions of dollars. Too many people are using court action to delay departure, and this is an urgent matter requiring redress. The government believes the solution to this problem is to limit judicial review. Wherever a decision maker makes a decision outside their jurisdiction or without the power to make it-in technical terms, that is called a privative clause-the government has received advice from several leading Queen's Counsel that this is an effective way to address this problem. Applicants will still be able to access full and fair merits assessment and review of their claims, but we cannot stand by and allow this situation to remain out of control. I know this is a matter of interest and concern to members on both sides of this House. I look forward to cooperation from the opposition and others to implement this very sensible and important measure to help restore integrity and public confidence in the system. Employment: Electorate of Newcastle",24
87,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Has his attention been drawn, firstly, to the remarks of John Prescott of BHP concerning the 'unviability' of the Newcastle steelworks, threatening over 2V2 thousand jobs, and, secondly, to the probability that 20,000 to 30,000 jobs would be threatened in the banking and finance sectors if the six pillars policy is abandoned? What assurances can the Prime Minister give these workers about the security of their jobs?",24
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My attention has been  would be common knowledge on both sides of this House that for some time-stretching back to the period when the former government was in office-the future of the BHP steelworks at Newcastle has been under discussion. It would be my hope that BHP could maintain for as long as possible a steel making capacity in as many industrial areas of Australia as possible, and I know the concern of the member about the future of the industry. It is fair to say that Newcastle is a very different community-and the Hunter Valley is a very different economic region-of Australia now from that which it was 20 years ago. Newcastle has taken strides to diversify. It is no longer as dependent on the steel industry. Although it is very proud of its tradition as one of the great steel cities of Australia, it has nonetheless been embarked for some years on a process of economic diversification. And the general optimism of the people of the Hunter Valley is much greater now than it was. I remember going to Newcastle a few months ago to launch the locomotives at Goninans with my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, and it was very obvious that the people of the Newcastle district-including people in the unions, people in the local chamber of commerce, the civic leaders and the business leaders-were looking positively to Newcastle and were preparing Newcastle for a different future than the sort of city it was during the years immediately after World War Two. Let me say to the honourable member that we are concerned, as I know he is, about the future of employment in the Hunter Valley and in the Newcastle area. We will certainly follow policies which are designed to improve the competitive position of BHP and which are disposed to improve the viability and competitiveness of all Australian industries. One of the great things about BHP in recent years has been the way in which it has been able to increase-and maintain at an increased level-a magnificent export performance. The company deserves credit for that, the unions that have participated deserve credit for that, and I will not be stingy about giving some credit to Senator Button for what he was able to do in relation to that. In those early years the former government did set about putting down some reasonable policies in some of those areas. But that was a long time ago. It was over the last four or five years that you really lost your way, and you lost it very badly, but we now have a situation where what we as a nation have to do is take every opportunity to improve the competitiveness of our industries. Let me say to the honourable member that when you have an inflation rate as low as the one we have now, when you have got interest rates which are falling and when you have got an industrial relations regime which is moving towards full-blooded enterprise bargainingand I note in that connection that, whereas you lot opposite flirted with enterprise bargaining, you are now walking away from it and from the more competitive thing-you cannot have it both ways. You cannot claim that the industry policy you espoused when in government was a good policy. You then repudiated the underpinning of that policy and you are now pretending that what you are doing is absolutely right and absolutely consistent. Can I say to the honourable member that we will continue to pursue policies which are designed to maximise employment in Australian manufacturing industry. I knowlhe member for Newcastle asks the question out of a deep concern for the people that he represents, but I would counsel those opposite who think that just by making a couple of statements on the floor of a motor manufacturing outfit in Adelaide they have in some way won back the affection of the working men and women of Australia. This is what Mr John Sutton of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union had to say: Labor is still to realise that Paul Keating's big picture policies are what forced 700,000 workers to switch their votes at the last election. He went on to say: They want economic nationalism, they want to know what is good for Australian workers and they do not want the economic policies and the rubbish that they were force-fed with for the last 15 So do not imagine for a moment that you have won back the support of all of those people. Can I tell the member for Newcastle that we will be following policies to protect Australian manufacturing industry. So far as the six pillars policy is concerned, I would not be surprised if that were the subject of comment by the Wallis report. As the Treasurer said, the Wallis report is going to be published in a couple of weeks time. Until a government decision is announced on that, the present policy of observing the six pillars is maintained, and I endorse the warning delivered by the Treasurer that players in the financial community should await government decisions and not committee recommendations before they take decisions. Small Business: Service Charters",25
89,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Members of the House would be aware the government has committed itself to major reform of service delivery in the public sector. This reform agenda includes changes to management and work practices in the Australian Public Service, regulatory reform and the development of one-stop services for government information and licensing. Minister, can you explain to the House the government's plans for introducing service charters as part of its response to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force?  Cowan for his question. The government has promised to introduce service charters to all government agencies delivering services to the public. Regulators will be expected to develop charters. Mr Beddall-Table the speech.  interjects once again. I had the chance to flip through the report that he brought down that he did not deliver on. Reading that report further, they in fact had a figure of only $1 million on the rollover cap. What did we deliver? It was $5 million. So our commitment to small business in that area is far greater. If I were the member for Rankin, I years. would not talk too much because that report of his delivered nothing-I 3 years of pain for small business. We delivered. Charters will guarantee customers high quality services and a say in the development and delivery of government services. Our aim is to focus the Public Service on meeting customer demands. Service charters are part of a wider government agenda to open up the Public Service to greater accountability and to make the public sector more responsible to community needs. Tomorrow I will be launching the government's framework for service charters. The principles for developing a service charter will ensure that agencies develop effective charters which reflect what their customers expect and need. I expect to be able to advise the House later this year about the timetable for the introduction of a charter at the agency level. In the long term, service charters will change the culture of government away from a focus on process to the pursuit of real benefits for all Australians. Medicare Offices",26
90,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister confirm that last night the government's Expenditure Review Committee considered the closure of 64 Medicare offices around Australia? Was any decision made last night about closing Medicare offices, or is the government following BH's advice and waiting for polling results to tell it which ones to close? Mr Costello interjecting",26
91,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer would be interested in this. Finally, has the decision been referred to cabinet's employment committee to determine and to assess the impact of this decision on jobs in regions and the availability of services to people living in regional Australia? Mr Downer-Ask him what he was doing last night.",26
92,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The ERC did not meet last night. Tariffs,27
93,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. The minister would be aware of the enormous growth potential of the economies of the Indian subcontinent-India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Can the minister detail any measures proposed by the Indian government to reduce tariffs? Does he envisage Australian exporters increasing their market share as a result of recent changes?",27
94,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question, and I am happy to advise that the Indian government, in the context of the 1997-98 budget, has decided to reduce tariffs on a wide range of imported products with a special breakthrough for Australia in respect of coal and wool tariffs. This action follows representations which have been made directly by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, me and others, and I acknowledge the Leader of the Opposition made a visit to India last year. Pity the Prime Minister of the previous government never found the time to go to India. We said when we gained government that we would put a focus on the bilaterals in addition to the regional and multilateral activity. We have done that and it is now reaping a good harvest. In respect of the tariff on coking coal with an ash content below 12 per cent, that will be reduced from five per cent to three per cent, while the tariff on noncoking coal will be halved to 10 per cent. At the same time, the tariff on imports of raw apparel wool will be cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent and tariffs on wool tops from 50 per cent to 40 per cent. Coal is Australia's principal export modity to India, valued at some $710 million for this year. We now expect a substantial increase with the expansion in India's steel making capacity over the next few years and the current level of around 11 million tonnes will rise to between 19 million and 20 million tonnes. In answer to the member's question, I would add that the breakthrough on wool parallels the opening up of an extra wool pipeline through Mexico, with their decision to reduce tariffs to zero, India and Chinaand I know the Prime Minister will follow lip trade matters in China, the wool industry and the WTO, when he visits in a few days time. I will add just one other thing. In getting on with the full recognition of the import of the South Asia region and those economies, I will be launching the Year of South Asia in a tightened up, but very important, visit I will make to Pakistan and Bangladesh in a few days time. It is essential that we promote directly, that we negotiate directly, and on that basis we are making more progress than the Labor Party could have ever dreamed of when they had the carriage of the trade policy of this country.",27
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA NA",27
96,Mr HOWARD,MINISTER FOR TRADE,"I take the opportunity, I am sure with the approval of the House, to congratulate the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) for conveying the concerns of the House to the people of Far North Queensland. I know I speak for all members of the House in saying that. Also, might I congratulate him on the superb job he is doing as trade minister. NA",27
97,Mr REITH,BUSINESS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I advise members of the likely progress of matters in the House for the balance - of today and tomorrow. I have spoken with comthe Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean), and our intention today is to conclude the Aged Care Income Testing Bill which is currently before the House and make a start on the following matter, which is the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill. If we are able to do that, we would be able to finish at 10.30 and then have the usual adjournment. We believe that to achieve that it might be appropriate for us tonight to sit through dinner. I think that is a good idea so that we do not have an extended evening tonight. We have had initial discussions on the basis of having no quorums and no divisions during the dinner so we can achieve a reasonable amount of work. We are just waiting to see how matters pan out this afternoon, but members are on notice that we expect that to be how things will be handled for the balance of today. In respect of tomorrow, the expectation is that we will sit very late tomorrow night and into the early hours of Thursday morning. The Senate whips and leaders are meeting this afternoon, and we will then have a better idea of progress of matters in the Senate. But our expectation is that, as we go into the wee hours of Thursday morning, we will have a series of matters coming across to us from the Senate, as usual. As soon as we have a more detailed understanding of the handling of business in the Senate, the Manager of Opposition Business and I will discuss the matter further to ensure the arrangements are as convenient as we can make them. One last matter, which I have not had a chance to discuss with the Manager of Opposition Business, is that last time we had one of these late night sittings we did have an arrangement for extended adjournments. You might remember we had 10 minutes and I think this time we might take the same course for adjournments. Five-minute adjournment speeches is what we thought last time. That is what we are attempting to do. There is constant discussion between me and the Manager of Opposition Business. As the schedule pans out, we will keep members as fully advised as we can.",27
98,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I just confirm that it is the intenlong tion to at least complete the Aged Care Income Testing Bill tonight by whatever mechanism that requires. As for tomorrow, I have asked the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to ascertain as quickly as possible what the government's priority is for legislation from the Senate coming back by way of message to us. As I understand it, the schedule from the Senate is unrealistic because it limits time for debate and is not capable of being delivered because there is no gag capacity in the Senate. The reality is that, even on that limited timetable, they would be sitting through till 6 a.m. Thursday. Given the fact that there is no expedition between finalisation of messages from the Senate into here, that would mean we would probably be sitting around until 8 or 9 o'clock Thursday morning if we were to sit through all night. The point I want to make and impress upon members of the government is that it is in your interests to urge the Leader of the House to actually get some priority in what comes from the Senate so we can have some sensible discussions about how the proceedings after tonight are handled. It is the intention on our side not to require us to sit on Thursday because people have made arrangements to get home. If it requires us to sit late on Wednesday, that we will cooperate with, but we do need to have some indication and direction as to precisely what it is the government wants back here. At this stage, there has been no indication forthcoming. I would urge the Leader of the House to get that urgency across to us so that we can manage the affairs and the timetable tomorrow as expeditiously as we have dealt with the cut-off to the Senate, with the proceedings on super last night and the proceedings on aged care tonight-both important issues to get to the Senate so they can come back here.",28
99,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Just to make it clear, obviously we do not want to sit on Thursday, and we are working on a cooperative basis to ensure that we do not sit on Thursday. As everybody is also aware, the Senate has a list of priority legislation and they are working through that. We will have a better idea following the discussions between the relevant parties in the Senate this afternoon. As I said, as soon as I know I will let others know. NA",28

102,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do claim to have been misrepresented by the Treasurer (Mr Costello).,29
103,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Proceed. Mr GARETH EV ANS-In question time at the outset today, the Treasurer made a statement conveying the clear implication I had appointed myself Queen's Counsel, the further inference being that the quality of legal judgment was to be assessed accordingly.",29
104,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Move quickly to the point. Mr GARETH EV ANS-I will indeed, I am just conveying",29
105,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Without debate. Mr GARETH EV ANS-There is no truth whatsoever in the Treasurer's allegation. When I first took silk in 1983, it was as one of Her Majesty's counsel for the state of Victoria, for the Supreme Court of Victoria. I made application in the normal way to the Chief Justice of Victoria, Sir John Young, not a man having any compelling sense of obligation toward a Commonwealth Labor Attorney General, as even a neophyte like the Treasurer should be aware. I was appointed on the Chief Justice's advice and recommendation by the government of Victoria, of which I was not then nor ever have been a member. I am happy to have my qualifications, record and reputation matched against the Treasurer's any not need snide and erroneous innuendo to advance my case. NA Parliamentary Administration Mr LEO MCLEA Y- Mr Speaker, yesterday you tabled a report by a working group to the heads of the parliamentary departments on the proposed changes to the parliamentary administration. Page 1 of that report says that you and the President sought responses from the heads of the parliamentary departments and those papers were subsequently reviewed by Mr Noel Tanzer. Mr Speaker, would you be willing to make available to members those papers from the heads of departments and Mr Tanzer's review of them so that we can more properly understand what has brought you and the President to this position?",29
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Watson for his question. We have been deliberating over a large array of papers that for many months. The Tanzer paper is but one. What you have before you is the report my that has come to us subsequent to our making progress on the issue and deciding on what organisational format we need. I will review your question, but at the moment I am not disposed towards making that information generally available. Mr LEO MCLEA Y- Mr Speaker, I think that all members would find great difficulty in understanding the decisions that you and the President have come to without knowing the background to it, and indeed",29
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I said I would review the situation and make a decision. I said I am not disposed to it. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-You said you are not disposed to it.,29

118,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"By 14 April, which is before this House comes back. We get up tomorrow and we will not be able to come back before we have to respond to you. Members will not be in a position to be able to properly respond to you unless we know what these matters are. In paragraph 1.1.3 of this document you say: The Presiding Officers considered the suggestions of the heads of the parliamentary departments in the light of the consultative analysis and decided to implement a management structure based on the two chamber departments. Mr Speaker, I put it to you that in this report, which is only some 17 pages, there is no indication of why you came to that decision; there is no understanding, from members' points of view, of how we can respond to you with another view, if we have another view, without all the relevant papers. If it was important enough for you and the President to ask Mr Tanzer to review these papers, surely if members are going to properly respond to you they should be able to see these papers or at least the important ones, and one would think that certainly Mr Tanzer's was an important one. Therefore, my supplementary question to you would be: will you review this and respond to it before we get up tomorrow.",30

I will review your request in the light of the circumstances prevailing in the run-up to the organisational proposals which we have agreed. I am not convinced at this moment that either Tanzer's paper or any of the other papers that we have deliberated upon need to be generally made available. There are many issues involved. Frequently management consultants are called in. This is a wide-ranging process. We have already moved way beyond the thrust of many of those papers. It would add extraneous information and debating points that would not necessarily resolve the issue the way it needs to be resolved-and that is quickly and intelligently-to provide a better streamlined and more efficient organisation to deliver better services to both members and senators. I thank the honourable member for Watson for his question. Mr LEO MCLEA Y- Mr Speaker, I have a further question to you which is: if these",30
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I am not proposing to debate this issue, as I indicated yesterday. You have until 14 April if you wish to put in a written submission. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-I have a further question to you.",30
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,On this point? Mr LEO MCLEA Y-On this report.,30
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Proceed.,30
127,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My further question is: if these documents are not available to members, will you undertake to extend the time for consideration of submissions until they are, because we cannot properly get a view of it?",30
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I said I will review the thrust of your question. I am not going to debate it any further. Mr Leo MCLeay-You are making a joke of the whole process.,30
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I am not making a joke of the whole process. Mr Leo MCLeay-It's a fait accompli.,30

133,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I refer to the events of 19 August last year, in particular the wilful damage to property, especially the gift shop, and to the serious assaults on police and security personnel. Having regard to the numerous individuals photographed actually committing criminal offences, have persons been charged? Have any persons been convicted? If so, what were the outcomes of the convictions? Has any restitution been paid in respect of damage to property and personal injury?",31
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. The issue is a complex one. I can tell you that on the day of the disturbances approximately 62 members of the police and associated security forces were injured. A number of charges have been laid-I think about 12 in numberand a number of convictions have been made and fines and other punishments levied. But I will endeavour to acquire the information you request and provide you with more detailed information later. Hours of Sitting: Occupational Health and Safety,31
135,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, as we appear to be going to sit late tonight and tomorrowit appears that we will be sitting at least 24 hours, most likely 26 or 28 hours-could you advise me or the House how this equates with occupational health and safety because I do think it is a health matterMr Brough-You're asleep all the time.",31
136,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,-That is because of the hours we sit. I do think it is an important issue for all members of the parliament.,31
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the honourable Money member for Throsby for his question. I know that honourable members are driven by zeal and enthusiasm and a commitment which is not generally recognised out there in the wider community.

147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The consequences for ordinary working families and the Australian economy of the Government's proposed abandonment of its $4.5 billion superannuation co-contribution commitment. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",33
148,Mr GARETH EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This government has done many outrageous and indefensible things during its first year in office but the worse stain of all on its record, and one that will be remembered by future generations long after everything else is forgotten, will be the abandonment confirmed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) last weekend of its $4Y2 billion promised superannuation co-contributions. Let's cut through all the jargon and all the complexity of this issue and focus on the three big, ugly things that the government is doing by this decision. In the first place, it is guaranteeing that a worker now in his or her mid-30s will have over $100,000 slashed off the superannuation package, or retirement package, that he or she would otherwise be collecting. Whatever else is involved in this decision, that is the bottom line. If the government's promise is implemented, ordinary wage earners now will then be more than $100,000 better off. If the promise is abandoned, ordinary wage earners will be more than $100,000 worse off than they otherwise would have been. The second big and ugly thing that this superannuation decision is doing is raising a fundamental question mark that goes really to people's sense of security for the long-term future-a question mark as to whether, in future decades, members of ordinary working families will be able to be sufficiently looked after in their retirement. The problem is that Australia's population, like that of most developed countries, is rapidly moving from a traditional pyramid shape, in which those who were retired were supported by a much bigger base of younger people who were still working, to something approximating a skyscraper shape in which there is a much more equal distribution across those age bands. Previously, when a large working population has supported a relatively small retired population, that meant that we as a nation could afford a relatively generous pension scheme. But there is now, because of that change in demography, a very real doubt about whether that capacity will continue in the future. By making the decision now, in 1997, to abandon the compulsory co-contribution arrangements, the government is condemning those who are going to be retiring in 20, 30 or 40 years time to dramatically reduced retirement packages-some $100,000 less, as I have already said, than would be the case for an average weekly earner now. Quite possibly, as a result of the change in demographic structure and the changing ability to generate pensions in the future, we are condemning people by this decision-if it is taken by the government-to a dramatically reduced overall standard of living. The third big and ugly thing about this particular package we are looking at today, this decision not to proceed with the superannuation co-contribution, is the government squandering the best opportunity that Australia has ever had to fundamentally change the pattern of Australian savings-to have a massive shift into private savings and a massive expansion of the national savings pool. When the full three plus three per cent contributions are taken into account, aggregate superannuation fund assets will rise from under $300 billion now to over $600 billion by the year 2005 and to around $2,000 billion-$2 trillion-by the year 2020. I will come back to the implications of that. How is the government seeking to defend itself against these very significant charges that we are making? Basically, by trying to pull six. different swifties, each of which I will deal with briefly in tum. Firstly, it is the government's promise, they say; it is Keating's promise. Secondly, the government has some kind of different mandate for savings support which would be more or less equally beneficial. Thirdly, the co-contribution scheme is unfair to workers because it involves deducting moneys from their wages and salaries. Fourthly, they say that dismantling the scheme will not harm the future retirement benefits of young Australian workers. Fifthly, they say that the cocontribution scheme is unworkable in practice. And, sixthly, they try to pretend that the scheme will not do anything much to benefit national savings. As to the first point, this extraordinary suggestion that this is not the government's promise but it is Keating's promise, it is Labor's promise, which we have heard repeated endlessly-including by the Treasurer yesterday and on the weekend in his television performance-doesn't the Treasurer, Mr Costello, recall the statement made by him in answer to a question from me after the budget in August last year when he said, 'Who is going to pay the l-a-w tax cuts? The coalition. We are going to fund them and we are going to pay them'? Doesn't the Treasurer also recall his own election policy, the coalition's superannuation policy released in February last year, just before the last election, which contained the following unequivocal language: A Coalition Government: . will provide in full the funds earmarked in the 1995-96 Budget to match compulsory employee contributions according to the proposed schedule; . will deliver this Government contribution into superannuation or like savings ... Again, it says: The coalition will inherit both Labor's proposal and expectation that has gone with it. We will deliver the full benefit of the proposed contribution ... Just to add something else, doesn't the Treasurer also recall adopting this Labor policy to the extent of repeating-precisely, word for word, comma for comma-in his budget paper last year exactly the same description of the measure which was contained in Labor's last budget paper in May 1995? If you do not believe me, check for yourself. I not seek leave to table the comparative document accordingly. Leave granted.",33
149,Mr GARETH EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you do not believe me, check for yourself the precise wording of the description in the 1995-96 budget statement on page 3-131, paragraph 6.8, and the precise wording by comparisonit is exactly the same-for the 1996-97 budget statement on page 3-121, paragraph 6.8. It would make even the member Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) blush their collective heads in plagiaristic shame when they looked at the language that had been employed exactly picking up the language of the original Labor proposal. The evidence is compelling. What the government is doing in abandoning the promised $41f2 billion contribution is not just reneging, as it claims, on a Keating promise but reneging on its own coalition promise-ratting or dogging on its own coalition promise. Secondly, the claim is made that the government has some kind of different mandate to deliver this earmarked contribution of funds into savings vehicles other than retirement vehicles. Might I make it clear that that is manifest nonsense. The truth of the matter is that the only flexibility the government has given itself in its many statements on this issue is to proceed with superannuation or like savings measures. It has always been anxious to preserve some flexibility as to the precise savings measures in question, but there is only one possible reading of that term in the English language that I know when you talk about superannuation or like savings measures, that is, savings measures directed towards securing retirement income. Maybe the government does have a better way of delivering retirement income savings as distinct from savings generally than under the co-contribution model. If so, let us hear about it. But it is going to be one hell of a good scheme-it is going to have to be-to deliver better returns to ordinary working Australian families than the $100,000 that they will be receiving on retirement if the cocontribution goes ahead. It is going to have to be one hell of a better alternative scheme to make up for the more than $100,000 they will lose if that does not go ahead. The next suggestion made, the third swiftie sought to be pulled, is that the scheme is somehow unfair because part of it does involve a deduction-at first, one per cent, then two per cent and then three per centfrom workers' incomes. But, of course, the point about that is as follows. First, if the Treasurer implied yesterday that that was crook, that was some form of theft and indefensible for that reason, why on earth was the coalition's own superannuation policy, announced by it, by him, before the election and on a number of occasions subsequently, embracing exactly that same concept of matching compulsory employee contributions? The coalition policy states: A Coalition Government will support the introducdifference tion of compulsory employee contributions to be phased in from 1997/98 ... That has always been part of the scheme. The coalition has also embraced it. It is a nonsensical point to be now making. Secondly, the Treasurer knows perfectly well that those employee deductions will go straight into workers' personal superannuation accounts. These deductions will go, without any further tax on the way in, straight towards the financial independence of retired workers. In the super funds, those employee contributions will accumulate at a faster rate than many other forms of saving for retirement due to the investment policies of the funds, tax concessionality for super and lower fees and charges. Moreover, not only will this money always belong to the workers who earned it and contributed it under our scheme-and the one endorsed by the government-but the point is that that money will double in value immediately as a result of the government cocontribution that is part and parcel of this whole scheme. Precisely because of the government's matching contribution-now sought to be abandoned; now sought to be welshed on by the government-that will no longer follow. Here we have this alleged outrage over the doubling of the future value of workers' retirement overnight. How unfair. How outrageous that is. How outrageous it is, in fact, for the coalition to be walking away from this. The next swiftie we hear is that this will not harm the future retirement benefits of young Australian workers. Let me just repeat the point about that $100,000 package reduction that will be involved for the average worker. Where does the $100,000 figure come from? I put on the record the central case study last August that makes the point. The case is of a worker in his mid-30s-34 years old to be precise-earning average weekly earnings of around $670 a week. He would retire at 65 years with a super benefit of around $265,000. Without the personal and matching contribution, this worker's final benefit would be around $160,000. That is a of not just $100,000 but $105,000. That is what is involved when you tear up this particular scheme. The next swiftie we hear from the Treasurer smirking away and arrogantly sitting over there is that this scheme is unworkable-that the Labor thing that the coalition picked up and unequivocally endorsed cannot work in practice. He says that it could never have worked. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. The simple fact that he is making this point now is because he is utterly embarrassed by the unworkability of his own super surcharge system which has been demonstrated to be an unholy administrative and financial mess. The system for administering the co-contribution arrangement has the support of the industry which has to comply with it. That is in stark contrast to the industry's reaction to the surcharge collection method. If anyone knows what is achievable, it is that industry. It will not even involve the collection method for the co-contribution exercise; it will not even involve the five steps that the Treasurer purported to identify yesterday. The super funds would not need to get the tax file numbers of all their members because they do not have to claim the co-contribution for their members. It is paid automatically to the fund after the member's tax return is assessed. All that is necessary is for the fund to have the name and address of members and the employers name for the fund to pay the amount provided back to them by the tax office to the individual members. It is an absolute nonsense to suggest that this scheme is unworkable. It is very simple and very straightforward. Finally, we have the swiftie of the suggestion pool. This is largely sotto voce because the government and the Treasurer know how indefensible this aspect of the exercise is. There is the idea, the notion and the suggestion that the scheme will not in fact do much to benefit national savings. The truth of the matter, and the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) will further develop this point in what he says in this debate, is that, by hacking super in this way, the government is tearing apart the most effective possible mechanism that any nation could possibly devise for boosting national saving and providing higher retirement incomes. The figures prepared by the Retirement Incomes Modelling Task Force and the Treasury show that, over the next 10 years, the matching government and employee super contributions will add $100 billion to the national savings pool. Our national saving each year will be boosted by 1.4 per cent of GDP by this measure. That translates into around $8 billion more saving each year within a decade, and the numbers keep building up from there. The other super measures implemented by Labor-award super and the super guarantee-are estimated to currently boost national saving by about $3% billion a year. With the employee and matching government contributions kicking in, the combined super initiatives are estimated to boost national savings by over $10 billion a year by the year 2000, just three years away. Things dramatically accelerate from there. By the year 2005, with all these measures kicking in, total savings in the national pool Will double from somewhere under $300 billion at the moment to around $600 billion. As I said, by 2020, you are looking at a national savings pool of about $2,000 billion. That is an enormous amount of extra saving to fund investment in Australia and to create jobs without drawing on the savings of foreigners, without driving up the current account deficit and without driving up the foreign debt, the debt that has actually been increasing since this government has been in office. Coming back to where I began, by attacking Labor and its own $4Y2 billion superannuation co-contribution commitment, this government is acting in a way which will have it remembered for the shame and the stain not just in the current ebb and flow of politics but for decades and generations to come. This is one of the most profoundly irresponsible decisions that has ever been made by any Australian government. It is not just a matter of securing into the retirement-(Time expired)",34
150,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"After a few years of experience in this place, you begin to understand the difference between a matter of public importance which is put down on the agenda because the opposition has nothing else to say and a genuine matter of public importance. You can see from the way in which the meagre backbench now exits, who came here out of sympathy for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), how much of a matter of public importance they thought it was. Where is the baying backbench on this matter ofMs Macklin-Tum around! Where are yours?",36
151,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, I would not bring our backbench in because we know precisely why you are doing this. You are doing this because you had nothing else to discuss in the parliament today. You are doing this because you could not make an argument in relation to employment, you could not make an argument in relation to inflation or you could not make an argument in relation to the small business package. This is the way in which oppositions work when they have no political issues. They say, 'Who can we put up to fill in the 15 minutes?' Today, they put up the deputy leader to fill in 15 minutes of important parliamentary time. In spite of all the dire words he told us as to how this would be the end of civilisation as we knew it, was there any passion? Was there any cut through? Did it have any significance? No. I am afraid it just another sad day by an opposition which has very little to talk about. Were any telling points made? None whatsoever. Were there any serious points that we had not made or not considered? Was there any cut through other than a whole list of adjectives put together about how Labor is good at government and the coalition is not? Was there any new insight that was put in relation to the debate? No. It was a performance which was designed essentially to fill in 15 minutes by an opposition which is designed essentially to fill in three years until the next election. Mr Gareth Evans-You can fill in your 15 minutes by giving me an apology, if you are gracious or decent enough. Are we going to get that from you? Would you like to put that on the record?",37
152,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You see, you are not even interjecting about the MPI now, are you? You are not even interjecting about the MPI. You are not making any interjection relating to superannuation. You are not making any advancement in relation to the argument. You know and I know that your heart is not in it. We know that the opposition's heart is not in it. What essentially is the charge? This is the national parliament. This is a matter of public importance. This should be something that is on the lips of every Australian. That is why you come in here. If you do not have a matter of public importance, do not come in here and waste the time of the House of Representatives. . What does he say? That the government is proposing to abandon its $4.5 billion superannuation co-contribution commitment. What is that backed off? It is backed off a statement that we will not introduce Labor's policy. Does he know what we will be introducing? Have we announced it? Is there something that is technical? Is there a policy in place that he is actually analysing? No. What we have said is that we will not be introducing the Labor Party's policy. Well, Labor lost the election-why would we be introducing the Labor Party's policy? Labor is lost the election. If you wanted this policy to have been introduced, you should have won, but you did not. And it is not our task in government to sit around and say, 'Well, where are all of Labor's policies? Let's implement them.' That is the one thing we will not be doing-and for a very obvious reason. If we were to sit around and implement all of Labor's policies, at the next election we would probably meet the same fate as Labor did at the last election. On 2 March 1996 the people voted for a change. Here is an opposition that has actually been trying to say it is some kind of new Labor Party, Keating is dead, we have Keating out of our system, we do not have anything to do with him. And what do they do? They come back in here arguing for the Keating policies. And this is more of a Keating policy than any of the other policies that we could enumerate in relation to the opposition. Of course, this policy has its genesis in the Keating infamous l-a-w commitment before 1992. You cannot understand modem Australian politics unless you understand the history of the 1993 election. In the 1993 election the coalition went to the Australian people and proposed a goods and services tax. In return for a goods and services tax, we said that we would reduce income tax rates. Paul Keating, who probably did not think he could win the 1993 election, produced a policy saying that he would match those income tax reductions without the introduction of any GST. He went to the election in 1993 saying that a GST was unnecessary and wrong because he would produce the income tax cuts promised by the opposition without it. And what voter would not go into a ballot box on the promise of being able to have income tax cuts without an increase in indirect tax from one side and a reduction in income tax with an increase in indirect tax from the other side? Mr Keating not only said that it was a promise to reduce income tax rates; he put it into law, l-a-w. He legislated it before the election. And I suppose much to his great surprise, he won that election. And after the 1993 election he said, 'And now what do we do with that l-a-w? What do we do with that legislation?' Those income tax cuts had never been affordable and never were. They sat down, and John Dawkins, who was the Treasurer at the time, decided it would be much more responsible to legislate them out of l-a-w than to blow the Commonwealth bottom line even further. Of course, at that stage we did not have any idea as to how bad the bottom line would be, because the Labor Party was then engaged in a deliberate attempt to conceal the state of the Australian finances. In the mid-year review produced by the Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), shortly before the 1996 election, he said that the Australian accounts were in surplus. In fact, they were $11 billion in deficit, with $10 billion deficits in all of the future years. But Dawkins at least, probably knowing what the real situation was, determined upon a course to get rid of the l-a-w tax cuts, and he did. Then, coming to the 1996 election, the Labor Party, obviously stung by the fact that they had legislated tax cuts before an election and taken them away after an election and that this would come back and hang around their necks like a millstone in the course of the 1996 election, said, 'Oh, we have got a new idea. We are not just abolishing them; we are not just taking them back. What we will do is pay them in the year 2000.' Forget about the year 1998-99. In 1998-99 it was one per cent. In 1999-2000 it was two per cent and in 2000-2001 it was three per cent. That is where you get your $4.5 billion-in the year 2001-2002. So it was $1 billion in 199899, $2 billion in 1999-2000, $4 billion in 2000-2001 and $4.5 billion in 2001-2002. So the Labor Party was now of course in a preposterous position. What had been l-a-w in 1992 was now on a promise for the year 2001-2002. What they had not been able to deliver in one year they were now promising on a delayed lay-by basis eight years after the event. When we won the election, the first thing we did was sit down and call for the papers as to how the system that had been announced in the 1995 election was going to work. For example, the first thing that would have to be done is that employees would have to pay one per cent of their taxable wages from 1 July 1997 into superannuation, two per cent in 1998, three per cent in 1999. Where were the plans as to how that would actually be implemented? 'Oh,' the Labor Party had said, 'We will try to get it into awards and buy it out with wage increases.' But where were the wage claims that could have sustained it? What would it have done to wage outcomes, inflation and interest? Oh, that had never been modelled, that had never been looked at. And what would you do in relation to people who were not under industrial awards? How would you possibly get their money? The Labor Party had said, 'If necessary, we will legislate.' Well, how would you legislate? You would not be able to legislate a contribution to a third party out of taxable income under the industrial power. There was only one way in which it could have been done-by an increase in PA YE taxation. That is, in the name of delivering income tax cuts, in order to make the legislative model you would have had to legislate income tax increases. As is acknowledged by all of those that had been around in the framing of the 1995 budget-a budget, I will remind you, that tried to maintain the myth to the Australian public that the accounts were going to balance in that financial year-what was also clear is that there had been no consideration and certainly no idea at all as to how this could ever be implemented. And I have said that there would be massive logistical problems. The first, of course, is: how would you get the money out of the employees, except under an income tax increase? That is the biggest problem of all: how would you get it out? Secondly, how would you match up an employee's contribution to make sure it was an after-tax contribution against a government payment, except by matching individually all taxpayers in the work force, because you had to match it amount for amount? The third problem is: what happens if you start making co-contributions or even employee contributions into defined benefit schemes? How would that possibly work? The fourth problem is, as everybody said: why was it that the benefits were being skewed to middle and higher income earners? The Keating answer to that was that they were the ones that were going to get the value of the l-a-w tax cuts. The fifth problem was: what about people who are outside the work force? If you got to 54, you got a contribution for one year and then it ceased? Was that the way in which it was going to operate? All of these questions met wry chuckles when one asked how all these problems were going to be met. You would look at them and you would say, 'Surely this had all been contemplated.' Nothing had been contemplated. Nothing had been put in place, and it could not have been workable. You come in here and say, 'Oh, well, ASFA says that they would have been quite happy to make it work.' Of course ASFA would have been quite happy to make it work because they wanted the money. I have never seen an opposition run by an interest group in the way this opposition is run by the AS FA. The ASFA does have a lot of industry funds and they have a lot of trade union representation on them, but they are not all trade union funds. You do not have to take your orders from ASFA because only a part of ASFA is the trade union movement. But you come in here in relation to this amount and you say uncritically, 'ASFA said it could work.' Who do you think was going to get their hands on the money? What do you think happens in these superannuation funds? It is not just administration costs. Have you ever heard of fund managers? If you are talking about $600 billion under management with fund managers taking one or two per cent, have you any idea of the money that is being made in this industry? What is more, it is a unique industry. This is an industry where by law they get income. These people do not have to go out like a bank or a share trader and say, 'Come to me; I have a good product.' This is an industry where you have legislated a steady stream of income which goes into management and is under commission. This is a guaranteed legislative income operation. You come in here and say, 'The ASFA would have been quite happy to make work an extra three per cent legislated income plus a three per cent government income.' Of course they would have. There would be no person in Australia who would look back and complain if you gave them six per cent of income in Australia which they managed for a profit under funds management on commission. Who would complain about it? It is one of the richest industries that has been set up in this country. I have said that we will not be introducing this scheme. You do not know what we will be introducing, but it will be guided by all of the things that I have said before. It will be guided by fairness, it will be particularly directed to ensure that there is more fairness for the lower income earner, because you were skewing benefits to middle and higher income earners, and it will give more flexibility and more choice. But it will not be Labor's scheme-for one very obvious reason: Labor lost the election. They no longer have the right to have their policies implem, nted.",37
153,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Treasurer (Mr Costello) says that we are doing this because there is nothing else we could raise, it is of no significance and our heart is not in it. Let me repudiate all of comments at the outset. There is great significance in this issue, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has said. Our hearts are very much in it. This is an enormously significant issue for this parliament and for this nation. What this government is doing is ratting on the most important savings scheme that this country has ever seen. Indeed, there is probably nowhere in the Western world that has had a savings scheme of this significance, and it is being destroyed by a government which promised to introduce it. This is another broken promise by a lousy government which continually breaks promises, especially this Treasurer, who has broken promise after promise on taxation: no new taxes, no increases in any tax. He has broken that umpteen times and now breaks another one, the biggest of all, because his party promised to introduce this measure. It is not just Labor's measure; you endorsed it. You said it was your policy. Don't sit there and say, 'This is Labor's; it has nothing to do with us.' It has everything to do with you because you said it was your policy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has read quotes which show that that is unambiguously the case. Let me just add to them. In the superannuation policy issued last February, they issued a comparison of Labor's policy and their policy. It said on employee contributions to superannuation, 'The Labor policy is phased introduction of up to three per cent of employee contributions through enterprise agreements and awards. Our policy: no change.' And yet you stand here and say it was not your policy. It was absolutely a policy you told the Australian people was your policy. And now you are squibbing and ratting on it once again, as you have on so many other policies. When it came to the government co-contribution, the $4Y2 billion, what did they say about that? They said, 'The coalition will meet the government's co-contribution commitment.' That was their promise, which they are now walking away from. It is an outrage that they can stand up here and say, 'It was those never our policy' - hand on the heart as though we should believe them. How can you believe anyone who walks away from such unambiguous comments as that? Of course, they always had a few slippery slide words and they said, 'We reserve the right to vary the delivery mechanism to provide the most effective and equitable payment system.' They never said what that meant. But it certainly does not take away from the fact that they promised to introduce the co-contribution-to pay it. And they are not doing it. This is an outrageous step by this government, from whom nothing surprises you any more. But I am amazed that they can be so blase about something of such enormous significance to this country. They say that this system would not work. There is absolutely no reason to believe that, because the fact is that this system would work. It would work because all it requires is for the awards to be changed. The unions had agreed to that. Do you think the commission was not going to agree to changing the awards or that the employers would object? Of course not. Once the awards had changed, the employer deducted the contribution of the employee as per the award, paid it to the ATO and that was shown on the group certificate. The employee sent the group certificate to the Taxation Office as normal, they saw the amount of payment by the employer for his super and they paid the matching cocontribution, depending on his income. It is relatively simple. It is absurd to say that this is something that could not be introduced. Indeed, the then opposition said that they would legislate in respect of this. They said that employee contributions may be legislated depending on how implementation progresses. In other words, if awards are not good enough, they will legislate to make sure it happens. They were going beyond our policy, yet now they are saying that they will not do any of it. He is also saying that legislation would not work, having promised that he would do it, if necessary, before the last election. This is a total abandonment of any credibility that was ever left with this Treasurer. There is a total loss of credibility. The Treasurer also said yesterday that the Public Service did not know how to implement this. That is absolute rubbish. The fact is that the Treasurer was involved in the development of this and the officer, the key person, most involved in developing this is a person regarded by this government as of such importance that he is the secretary to the Wallis inquiry. If he is such an idiot, if he is such a fool that he produces an unworkable scheme, why did you appoint him to such an important job? Why did you give him a position of such great significance if he is such a complete fool to produce an unworkable policy? Obviously, he is not. He is an extremely well credentialled officer who is respected by all who know him. The policy that was produced is a workable policy. It is complete obfuscation to say that this is an unworkable policy when trying to develop some excuse. The fact is that what is happening here is quite deplorable. The broken promise point has been made, so with time disappearing I will quickly move on from that. It is incredible that we continue to see these broken promises. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, this ruins a very good retirement incomes policy which gave workers the prospect, in the 21 st century, that they could retire on their full incomes-that is, on average weekly earnings or below. It will take years to develop for someone who goes into the work force at the beginning of the next century and spends their working life paying these contributions, but at the end of it they would walk away with their wages as their retirement income. Not having that means, in terms of a lump sum in today's money, a loss of $200,000 in real benefits. To say that there is no loss to people is just absurd. There is an enormous loss in retirement income. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, with the ageing of the population it is doubly extraordinary that the government can just abandon a scheme of this order. This country needs to have an important savings scheme. We all know that one of the key points of this scheme was to improve national savings. Why do we want national savings improved? We want to reduce the savings investment gap so that we can get the current account deficit down and have that lifted further off our shoulders. There is obviously agreement around the parliament that we should have a better savings effort. The question is: how do you get there? Here was a savings scheme which was going to provide a tremendous long-term boost to savings. All the figures were given by the .Deputy Leader of the Opposition; I will not go over them. The government are throwing all that away. It is extraordinary that they could be so blase as to throwaway something of such crucial importance to the future. They say, 'We will have another scheme, which we will announce in the budget.' That scheme will not have compulsory contributions by employees. Therefore that element of the savings boost will not be there. If it is not for retirement purposes but is some sort of a working life savings vehicle, whereby one can be in it for several years then access it, you will get enormous leakage of the savings. This is nothing like a savings scheme that superannuation provides. So you do not get that boost to savings, you do not get that improvement to the national economy in the mediumand long-term that this scheme was going to give. To abandon it is total economic irresponsibility and represents ideology gone crazy. How does that sit with the budgetary policy? We have seen swingeing cuts in so many areas. We have seen the slashing of labour market programs, of higher education, of small but important areas like legal aid. We have seen tremendous cuts and pain inflicted all over the country and we have had all the broken promises on tax. What is that said to be for? Because we need to boost the national savings. Yet whilst you are doing all that-creating all this pain, breaking all your promises to boost national savings-you are destroying a program which is there to boost national savings. It just does not make any sense whatsoever. As far as I can see, this is the most outrageously stupid decision that any government has made in the history of this country. It is a total and direct breach of promise to the Australian people. In a few weeks time this Treasurer will stand up in this parliament and say that he needs to do more things-to inflict more pain, make more cuts and increase taxes to increase national savings. Yet he is here today saying, 'There is no need for this scheme because it would not have worked anyway and we don't care about national savings through superannuation.' He says that he has got this other vehicle, which presumably he will announce at the time of the budget, but it will not have anything like the impact of the previous scheme. This issue is a matter of tremendous importance to the Australian people and it is tremendously important that this issue has been raised in the parliament today. (Time expired)",40
154,Mr MCDOUGALL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Griffith) (4.14 p.m.)I can understand why the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has got so excited over this issue. It was the member for Gellibrand who introduced this policy idea in 1995 called 'saving for our future'. One of the most important things that we have to remember about this subject is that this policy that the opposition today have raised as an MPI is their policy. It was this side of the House that was voted in in March 1996. We do not have to accept the policy that they laid down. Let us look at it in detail. Let me go back to superannuation. I believe that superannuation is one of the most important vehicles that we have in this country to not only increase national savings but also to give individuals the opportunity to contribute to their own future. The other day in this place I rose to talk about a similar matter, the superannuation surcharge. One of the greatest ways to ensure that people make a contribution towards their future is to make sure that they make a commitment, and a major commitment, in their own right. When we look at the superannuation system prior to 1983 we see that the incentive for people to make a contribution was to get taxation benefits by doing so. But the most important thing that happened was that people made a contribution of at least 50 per cent in savings for their future. With this proposal that was brought in in 1995 that the opposition is saying the government must adopt, we can see that, since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy in 1983, the employer contribution has been climbing towards nine per cent. The copayment system as introduced by the now opposition in the 1995 budget involves the employee building up to a total of three per cent. The co-payment contribution means that the government, the taxpayers of this country, will put in another three per cent. Where is the equality in that? At the end of the day we are looking at 12 per cent from the employer and the government, and three per cent from the employee-not a bad little system. - But where is the incentive for the employee to make that contribution and to make a decision about providing for their future from their own income? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) talked about the pyramid. It is true that, back in the 1960s and the 1970s, the ageing population narrowed to a very high peak in the pyramid. That is flattening out today. But we have to look at it very seriously and very conscientiously to see who is going to pay at the end of the day. I am sure it is the average taxpayer who will also be the recipient of co-payment superannuation. So, for the government to make a contribution in the form of a copayment to a funded scheme, it means the government has to find the three per cent. Where will they find the three per cent? Mr Deputy Speaker, we have heard a lot in this place about unfunded schemes. The current government scheme for the bureaucracy is unfunded. It does not need to be funded, but this proposal is to fund it. So where will the funds be found? Obviously it will have to be funded from revenue. If it is going to be funded from revenue, there are two choices: cut services or raise taxes. Is what the opposition is seriously saying to us? Yes, we have to help people for the future, but we have to look at how we go about it in a very serious way. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it appears that the way the opposition is heading towards actually delivering this co-payment is very much in the dark. While they thought up a good scheme, where is the detail on how they are going to deliver it? I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it will put pressure on wages and it will put costs onto jobs because somebody else is trying to find the money. I think that is the basic flaw in the opposition's argument. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we did not break any promise. The promise was made by the opposition in 1995. I can understand that the member for Gellibrand is very upset; it is obviously a proposal he passionately wants to get forward. Now he is looking for somebody else to do it. Let us look at the administration of it. In the last couple of days in this place into the superannuation surcharge, we have heard that there will be enormous expense involved in administering it. We are talking about four per cent of employees in this country who are likely to be paying the superannuation surcharge. In co-funded superannuation, we are looking at 94 per cent of workers in this country paying three per cent. Who will have to administer it? It will have to be administered by the government and by employers. Let us look at the government side. They are going to make a contribution. First of all, they will have to make an individual contribution in some form to every worker in that 94 per cent of employees in Australia. Is that going to cost twopence? Will that cost a few cents? How many millions of dollars will it cost? What extra cost is going to be added to the taxpayers of this country to enable this to be administered and delivered? When would it be delivered? Is it going to be delivered per pay packet? Is it going to be delivered per month? Is it going to be delivered per quarter? Is it going to be delivered, as I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth that Evans) said, possibly once a year at taxation time? How is that going to take place and what is the cost of delivery-that three per cent co-contribution? How many millions is that going to add to the budget every year to be able to deliver this and what difference is it going to make to the outcomes and the benefits that are going to come to the recipients? Let's look at one type of scheme: a defined benefits scheme. A defined benefits scheme does not require an employer to contribute, so long as there is an audited amount remaining in the scheme that will guarantee the payout for all the employees. If a defined benefits scheme has the amount, is the government, as a co-payment, going to be liable to continue paying even though it is not required to pay under the rules of a defined benefits scheme? These details have not been clearly displayed and I believe the opposition today certainly have not displayed their case.",42

156,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I present the committee's report entitled Report on the annual reports of the Australian Securities Commission and other bodies 1994-95. Ordered that the report be printed. NA 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 February, on motion by Mrs Moylan: That the bill be now read a second time.",43
157,Ms MACKLIN,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Jagajaga) (4.26 p.m.)This bill has the specific purpose of establishing administrative procedures to support the implementation of income testing arrangements that have been deemed necessary by this government as part of its changes to aged care. However, its provisions can only be properly understood in the full context of those changes to aged care which were anwould nounced by the government in the last budget. These changes are primarily contained in the Aged Care Bill 1997, which the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) informed us her second reading speech will also be duced in this sitting and which will supersede the bill currently under debate once it passed. This bill is inextricably entwined with the provisions of the Aged Care Bill, which I understand from the minister will be introallows duced this week. The Australian Labor Party is opposed the proposals contained in this Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997, just as it is implacof ably opposed to the proposals contained in the major Aged Care Bill. That, of course, is not to say that we are opposed to measures to upgrade nursing homes. The history of Labor in government was one of continuous, posifirst tive reform and upgrade of care Australians. We have seen the minister rant and rail on this point, but and talk to anyone of the many people involved in the aged care sector and they will view certainly tell her otherwise. We are opposed to the bill because it seems to us, just as it seems to a large number of people and organisations concerned with the well-being of older Australians, to be about the most inappropriate way of going about this task of financing aged care. It is inappropriate because both bills-the bill that is under debate today and the Aged Care Bill proper that we will see later in the week-will have serious adverse consequences for older Australians needing nursing home care. Our opposition to this bill, as with the Aged Care Bill 1997, is based on two fundamental points. The first is that the Australian Labor Party believes that quality health care and quality nursing home care should be available equally to all Australians on the basis of need. Secondly, we believe that this government's changes to aged care amount to a blatant and cynical abdication of government responsiagainst bility that will impact most heavily on the vulnerable. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) did promise that, whatever measures his governdisastrous ment felt compelled to take, one group that not suffer would be the most vulnerable. Older Australians in nursing homes fit into that category. But those older Australians will, as a result of these changes, be left to in conclude that when it comes to the Prime introMinister's promises, as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) so eloquently just put, is their welfare was never a core promise and, therefore, is of no concern to this government. This Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997 the Department of Social Security to collect information about the income of to nursing home or hostel residents, including those who are not pensioners, in anticipation the introduction and passage of the Aged Care Bill 1997. This information will be used to calculate how much of a daily fee of up to $64 a resident will be required to pay from 1 July this year. This income testing bill is the step towards the introduction of user for older charging in nursing homes. Mr Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the opposhe should just go sition I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a to substituting the following words: ""the House: (1) deplores the government's decision to charge a daily fee for nursing home residents which will ultimately lead to the creation of an 'economy, business and first class' system of nursing home care; and (2) is of the opinion that as well as enshrining a flawed and unjust policy, the Bill fails to: (a) allow for the need to involve persons acting for or on behalf of nursing home or hostel residents where necessary; (b) provide that the presumption should favour an appellant against a decision where the appeal has not been determined in the time allowed; and (c) provide that all determinations should be appealable through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Veterans' Review Board to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal"". While we oppose the bill and will be voting it, the government could at least consider this serious amendment. Part (1) of this second reading amendment deplores the charges in nursing homes because of the effect they will have on access to nursing home care and to the various standards of care that will depend on how much people have to pay. The second part of the amendment, part (2)(a), is necessary because a large number of nursing home residents require the assistance of a third party acting on their behalf in business dealings. More than 60 per cent of people admitted to nursing homes come from public hospitals or other acute hospitals after experiencing major illness or injury. This amendment simply acknowledges their right to have a competent person look out for their interests. Part (2)(b) changes the emphasis of this clause from one of presumed guilt to one of presumed innocence. As it is currently drafted, this clause means that if the secretary does nothing about reviewing a determination for 90 days after a review has been asked for, then the determination is confirmed. The amendment reverses this so that if no action is taken for 90 days then the secretary is taken to have decided in the person's favour. Given the amount of restructuring that is going on in the Department of Social Security-forced by this government-such a reversal of emphasis seems not just fair but a matter of natural justice. I am pleased to see the minister at the table and will remind her that this is the second time that we have had to move such an amendment. I acknowledge that the first time, in relation to child-care legislation, she accepted the opposition's amendment. It is very important that we do not have legislation that allows government officials to sit on decisions and then to find in favour of the bureaucracy rather than to find in favour of the older person as this bill does. It is Labor's view that the changes embodied in this bill, and the changes we expect to see in the Aged Care Bill to be introduced later in the week will be a disaster for aged care in this country. It seems to be the view of everybody involved in the industry that implementation is going to be chaotic because the time involved is just too short. The central fund raising proposal, too, is that people needing nursing home care have to sell their homes to pay an entry fee. It is not just unfair, it is callous and insensitive its effect on older Australians. In my view, it is also unfair that the first generation of entry fee payers will most certainly receive no benefit from their fees, given the time that capital improvements usually take and the time that people generally stay in nursing homes. This bill will, of course, facilitate the charging of an additional daily fee of 25c in the dollar of private income earned above the pension-free area of $98 a fortnight for single people. There are two important issues to be raised about the effect of this new daily charge. The first is the effect that it has on the marginal tax rate of retired Australians. Whether they are pensioners, part-pensioners or self-funded retirees they will have to pay this additional fee. Figures supplied by researchers in the Parliamentary Library show that a pensioner with $10,000 of additional income above the pension-that might arise out of superannuation-will pay an effective marginal tax rate of 94 per cent as a result of the additional fee that this bill will see them pay. Ninety-four per cent! Who else has to pay this sort of effective marginal tax rate? It is an outrage that these sort of tax rates will apply to people in nursing homes. The fees will also cause large reductions in the personal disposable income of residents. This issue becomes of increasing importance as nursing homes and hostels detail the services that they will determine will be feebearing extras. Things like clothes, fmit, fruit juice, soap, shampoo, and even toilet paper, we fear, will come into these categories. The bill also opens the way for the fee to increase beyond its current level of 25c in the dollar, with all the additional hardships that that fee will bring for nursing home residents. It is hard to imagine that the fee will just stay at that level and I know that many involved in the nursing home sector have already raised this concern with the minister. Will it go higher? Will this government, at some future date, feel the temptation, just as we now see with the increases in the Medicare levy? Will we see the government increase this fee by 30c or 35c in the dollar? The minister must, if she will not throw all in the other mad ideas out in this bill, particularly in the Aged Care Bill, give a guarantee on behalf of the government that the fee will at least be pegged at its current level. Failure to give that guarantee would be tantamount to foreshadowing fee increases in the future. Another concern with the fee is that not only will it increase but also variable fees will be linked to variable standards of care. We will see different nursing homes-in fact, as the Aged Care Bill envisages, different wings in the same home---offering different levels of care to residents. The way it has been put to me by one nursing home resident is that some will get orange juice, some will get orange cordial and a few will only get water. While this might sound a trite example, it does represent the thin end of the wedge that will very quickly drive up the cost of aged care. Just as we have seen in other areas of the health sector of the United States, if fees are allowed to become variable and rise unchecked at the top end, the result inevitably is upwardly spiralling health care costs. This bill is also an example of callous cost shifting from a shared cost, undertaken by everybody in the community through the public system, to an onerous discriminatory charge on those who unfortunately do need to go into nursing homes. Let us remember that it is only a very small number of people that this applies to. It is only three per cent of the population over the age of 70 who will ever need to be admitted to a nursing home. Such a shift from the public purse to the private purses of those who need nursing home care will be hard enough on those who have assets such as a family home. But, of course, it will be much more serious for those without income or savings because it is they who will miss out on access to nursing home care or will receive a very second-rate standard of care. The second concern I have is about the way the new fee calculations are affected by the level of the entry fee charged when the resident enters the nursing home. That is the way in which these two fees are intimately linked. Residents who pay nursing homes an entry fee in excess of $88,500, to be indexed, will not be eligible for the pensioner supplement payment. This means that those residents will have to pay a higher base fee of $26.40 a day. Per fortnight, this is $421.80, which is higher than the value of the full pension. Residents in such homes would need to have income from other investments of at least $21.80 per fortnight just to meet the higher daily base fee. Then there is still the matter of the extra income to purchase the items that, in my view, will no longer be supplied by the home. The inevitable result of this requirement to pay a higher daily base fee is likely to prevent many pensioners accessing homes charging these very high entry contributions of over $88,500. We are already hearing spokespeople for the industry saying that fees of $100,000 or $150,000 will be charged. The other point to consider is the effect on pension entitlements for those people who are forced to sell their homes to pay the entry fee. For those with money left over from the sale of their home after paying the entry fee, this money will be deemed by the Department of Social Security to earn a minimum of four per cent per annum on the first $30,000 and six per cent on amounts above this. This will obviously affect the level of pension paid to the resident and their liability and capacity to pay the daily fees to be tested under this bill. I would like to work through a couple of examples to illustrate the impact on partpensioners in particular, as I believe these people are likely to be especially disadvantaged by this legislation. The examples are based on current Sydney house prices and assume that in both examples we are talking about single part-pensioners with superannuation assets of $150,000, meaning that after the assets test a part-pension of $235.26 is received. The examples assume an entry fee of $90,000 and $10,000 in transaction costs. The first example: a three-bedroom home in Strathfield sold for $344,000. In this instance, the person going into the nursing home would have to pay the higher daily fee of $26.40 plus, as a result of this bill, the Department of Social Security would assess them as being liable to pay an extra daily fee of $9.93. Most importantly, because the home was sold and generated extra assets, this person would fail the asset test and would lose their part-penSIOn. The second example: a three-bedroom cottage in Erskineville sold for $350,000. In this example, after paying the entry fee, they would also have to pay the higher daily fee of $26.40, plus in this case they would be assessed by the Department of Social Security as having to pay an extra daily fee of $14.28. As with the first example, this person would lose their part-pension. In both of these examples, the person going into the nursing home would have to invest the balance of the home sale price so that that money plus their superannuation benefit would provide an income stream to pay the additional daily fee and also to give them money for the extras like medications-not something that I would consider an extrafruit, toiletries and all the other things. We see from the document which the opposition released a couple of weeks ago that this government intends taking away the tax break for nursing home residents to help them pay for these things. Further, the resident would have an increased tax liability as a result of the extra money invested. These are very, very serious changes that are going to impact on people who are very vulnerable and who at this stage have no idea that this will be the impact on their part-pensions. Another concern that has been voiced is that the investment return may not cover the increased tax liability plus the extra and higher daily charges and the loss of the partpension. It is felt that residents will be obliged to dip into the capital from the sale of their home-the capital that might be left after paying the entry contributions-to pay for these additional costs. There are two other points that are most likely to cause concern for part-pensioners and for self-funded retirees as a result of bill. One is, of course, that they will increasmember ingly have to come to rely on the advice of financial advisers. The second is that they come under close and detailed scrutiny by the Department of Social Security-the first time for many self-funded retirees. An issue of great concern that was raised with me on Friday is whether or not people who are in the know will in fact pay the full value of their home to a nursing home to avoid the tax impact, the assets test and income test impact and the additional daily fee impact-all of these additional fees that the government is introducing. One way that nursing homes are thinking about getting around this with their residents is having the whole value of the home paid over as an entry fee. I understand the Department of Social Security has cottoned onto this problem, and it would be very helpful if the minister could outline in her response later this evening how this loophole will be addressed. What we are further concerned about is something that will be available to wealthy people but not to lower and middle income people-the trend of putting the ownership of people's homes into trusts. People will still live in their homes but not own their homes, so the homes will not be assessed for the purposes of entry fees and they will not be seen to have money to pay these additional daily fees-yet another loophole that we hope will be addressed. Another fundamental reason for our opposition to this bill is the blatant dishonesty it represents. In her second reading speech, the minister talked about 'the level of charges that they '-that is, the older Australians needing nursing home care-'will face when the aged care bill is passed.' If the government were honest about that, we would have the true word used. This of course is yet another tax. Just like the superannuation surcharge that was debated last night, we are today debating yet another introduction of a tax in this place, a tax from a government that promised no new taxes. Yet another broken promise. We have just heard the Deputy Leader of this the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) and the for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) outline one of the biggest broken promises so far as will superannuation is concerned. Now we have another example where the government is introducing what it calls in this bill-and what it will call in the Aged Care Bill to come-fees or accommodation bonds. These are all the new words that have been invented: surcharges, bonds, charges, fees. These are all the new words that really spell 'tax'. Certainly, older Australians know it is a tax. A great concern to the proprietors of aged care facilities is the fact that this government is proposing to turn nursing home proprietors into tax collectors, because it is these nursing home proprietors who will be collecting the fees from the residents. I would like to quote by way of example the views of the hostel operator of Brisbane Water (NSW). The chief executive officer of that hostel says the following about the collection of income tested user contributions: Brisbane Water (NSW) Legacy does not support the proposal that service providers collect the income-tested user contributions from residents. The time delays, circumstances surrounding many admissions (especially to nursing homes),a point the minister still has not acknowledgedand the additional complexities relating to direct collection of monies resulting from an income test could be avoided if the Government was to reduce pensions by the amount of the income-tested user charge at source. But that would require the government to come to terms with the fact that they are introducing a new tax. The operator goes on to say: Unless this recommendation is accepted, we would expect the Government to accept full responsibility for the collection of debts arising from non-payment of income-tested user contributions. He goes on further: Unless these matters are satisfactorily are concerned the quality of aged care for residents on the Central Coast ... of New South Wales will almost certainly deteriorate. That represents very much the views of older people in this country. What this legislation represents is yet another example of the government taking more and more out of the pockets of older and sicker people. I will finish my comments by reiterating the first part of the second reading amendment that we have moved to this bill. We do deplore the introduction of these new nursing home fees. They will mean the introduction of an economy, business and first-class system to our nursing home care sector, something that is to be deplored in Australia and something that we will certainly argue strongly against and vote against in this House.",43

159,Mrs GALLUS,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Hindmarsh) (4.50 p.m.)Let me start by congratulating the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) on her economy. By writing this speech, she has managed to avoid writing a new speech when· the next Aged Care Bill comes up. She has floated all around the place today covering every aspect of aged care-here, there, accommodation bonds-and wandered totally off the legislation, which, as she briefly pointed out in the beginning, is to facilitate the administration of the legislation that will come in in July this year. That will let people know what they will be expected to pay in the user pays system of the nursing homes. This legislation allows an assessment of that income. Let us pick up that line, shall we, that the member for Jagajaga referred to. The user pays system, she said, as if it was some sort of dirty word. Can we have a look at what was happening under the Labor government? The present cost of residential nursing home care is $2.1 billion. That is an awful lot of money that this country cannot afford, especially in light of the debt the Labor government left this country. Nursing homes cost $2.1 billion. The government is paying most resolved, we of that. Up till now, we have asked people who can afford it to pay 87% per cent of the pension. What is that equivalent to? $184. What is the cost of a nursing home bed per week? $630. That is a lot of difference. It costs $630 per week and we are asking people to pay $184. The pension covers that and, for those who do not get the pension and who have independent means, they pay that out. But there is the gap. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you about a situation that existed in one of the aged care facilities in my electorate. We will call the gentleman Mr C, for obvious reasons-so as not to identify him. Mr C had a condition where he was in this nursing home for 10 years. He paid $184 per week to be in that nursing home. The taxpayers of Australia paid the remaining $446. They subsidised Mr C in the nursing home by $446 a week. Who was it who was paying the taxes? It was the families out there; the battlers, the families with small kids who had to pay their taxes to make up that $446 a week Mr C was not paying as part of his accommodation cost in the nursing home. Mr Martin-Was he a pensioner?",48
160,Mrs GALLUS,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"No, he was not. This is the whole point; he was not a pensioner. And when he died he left $8 million to his children. So while the battlers out there, the men and women with small kids, were fighting to pay their taxes to pay the nursing home bills of Mr C, paying $446 per week to keep Mr C in the nursing home, his children accumulated $8 million, which they got when he died. Where is the justice in that? This was the system that the Labor Party perpetuated. It did not matter whether you could afford to pay your own way; you could go into a nursing home and the poor suckers out there who were paying taxes would keep you, so when you died all the funds that you had accumulated while you were in the nursing home would go to your children. Where is the justice in that? What sort of Labor Party asks the poor people in the country to pay taxes to pay for those who can afford the cost of living in nursing homes? The member for Jagajaga says with contempt, 'This looks like a user pays system.' Yes, it is a user pays system. It is about time it became a user pays system because, frankly, we cannot afford in this country to have anything else. We cannot afford for the government to be subsidising people who can afford it to the tune of $446 a week in nursing homes. It is simply not possible. Yet the member for Jagajaga, on behalf of the opposition, comes into this place and says, 'We oppose the income testing aspect of this legislation. ' In other words, she is saying to the people of Australia, the people who are fighting to pay their taxes, some of whom are giving up on basic necessities of life just to survive and bring up their kids the way they want to, 'We want you to continue to pay for the wealthy when they go into nursing homes.' When the member for Jagajaga, on her salary, finally ends up in a nursing home-as perhaps we all might-she does not want to pay for her own fees; she wants the people out there who are on salaries of a half, a third, a quarter of what she is getting, to pay for her to live in a nursing home. If that is Labor's policy, it tells us a lot about what the Labor Party stands for. The member for Jagajaga, in her rather discursive speech that went right across the whole gamut of aged care and way away from this legislation, touched on the history of the Labor Party. I did not quite get the exact quote but it went something like this: 'The history of the Labor Party is the history of upgrading nursing homes and of quality care.' This is what the member for Jagajaga said. As she introduced this into the debate, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to address those remarks of the member for Jagajaga, because maybe she did not see the 1994 Gregory report on nursing homes under this Labor government, this report which showed the absolute disgrace of what was going on in the nursing homes. Let me take a minute to say what I found when first elected to this House. As the then member for Hawker, I took up my responsibilities and went around the nursing homes in my electorate. What I found was that there were some extraordinarily good nursing homes, some absolutely fantastic nursing homes, where the residents had first-class care and first-class facilities. But I also found places where I would not want a dog to live. I found places where there were six to eight people stuck in a room, rooms without windows, with absolutely no privacy at all. I walked into one nursing home and a woman grabbed me and started babbling to me. I did not know what she was saying. It turned out she was Thai and could not speak English and she had not one person in that home to talk to-not one. The nursing staff said, 'Don't mind her; she tries to grab everyone to see whether somebody will speak Thai to her.' And there was no-one and there never had been anyone. In another nursing home the only place out of the wards where they were not stuck with six people in a room was a corridor; and there they were, lined up in the corridor, in front of one television set. And this was the standard of nursing home care of the Labor government. The standard of some of the buildings was appalling. The Gregory report said that 70 per cent of the homes needed upgrading at a cost, simply of the buildings, of half a billion dollars-$521 million, simply to bring up the buildings to health and fire standards. That is what had happened under the Labor government-the standards had dropped. Yet the member for Jagajaga dares to come into this place and question the need for an accommodation bond. It is those accommodation bonds that are going to allow nursing homes to change what was an absolutely disgraceful situation, a situation where 39 per cent of the residents were in rooms with four or more beds per room. How could the Labor Party live with that? The Gregory report looked at the Australian design standards. Let me read some of the faults which it found in nursing homes, which, without accommodation bonds, did not have sufficient funds to upgrade their buildings. Amongst the main faults found were: small or insufficient bathrooms or toilet facilities and lack of lever taps and shower seats. There were no shower seats! This was the standard of nursing home care under what is now the opposition-the then Labor government. The list of faults continues. There were narrow corridors-I have told the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) how I saw people in those corridors watching television. There were smail rooms, inadequate ramps and lack of wheelchair access and there were multi-t lrey homes without lifts. How were the re-idents going to get out if there was a fire? Remember, one of the big problems with the homes was that they did not have sufficient fire standards. And yet they had multi-stories and no lifts. Let us have a look at the outcome standards that this opposition-the then Labor government-lived through and was satisfied with. The member for Jagajaga said, 'We had a great reputation. We are happy with what we did in nursing home care.' The report says there were toilets not large enough to allow assistance for residents with frames or wheelchairs. How do you think they got in? They had a frame or a wheelchair, and they could not get into the toilets in their own nursing homes. I presume the nursing staff had to physically lift them off their chair and carry them into the lavatory. How demeaning was that? The report goes on to list: too few toilets; inadequate access to basins for residents and wheelchairs; small rooms; multi-storey buildings with-again-no lifts; inadequate heating and cooling, so in summer they were too hot and in winter too cold; and rooms with no external windows. You have to remember that a lot of people in nursing homes cannot move out of their rooms. Those rooms are where they spend their lives-yet they were spending them with no privacy and in rooms without any windows. This was the standard of care that the member for Jagajaga says the Labor Party was so proud of. She said, 'We did not need accommodation bonds'; what does the Gregory report say other than, 'For heavens sake, put more money into nursing home care'? Accommodation bonds are certainly one of the ways to go about it. Under fire authority orders the report lists lack of fire doors, smoke fire detectors and a fire main. Under health authority orders it lists inadequate laundry and kitchen facilities and inadequate pan rooms. A number of homes are described where the dirty laundry and the food were delivered through the same chutes. This was the system of nursing home care that the member for Jagajaga said the previous government was so proud of. The member for Jagajaga has made a lot of noise today. She has said-the absolute horror-'Some people might have to sell their homes', and she has cried crocodile tears. But wasn't this the Labor Party's policy? Didn't the Labor Party set up a system where people going into hostels sold their home to pay an accommodation bond? When I go round to hostels and ask what happens, they say, 'People sell their homes as they come into the hostel.' That was a Labor Party system. If it was such a great system for hostels under the Labor Party, how come suddenly it is such a bad system for nursing homes under the coalition? This is so typical of this opposition-it is totally and utterly hypocritical. This opposition brought down tariffs but now has an anti-tariff policy. This opposition brought in accommodation bonds for hostels and is now opposed to them in nursing homes. Has this opposition no integrity at all? It is totally hypocritical. If you go one step further, you find thatunder the present system set up by Laborwhen people move into nursing homes they end up selling their homes anyway. Under their rules, social security may deem the home as part of the assets of the person for pension calculation after they have been in a nursing home for two years. That means that people lose part of their pension and, to pay what they have to pay, they sell their homes. That is exactly what happens now. People sell their homes to go into nursing homes, because, if they do not, they cannot get enough money because their pension is reduced. But people sell their homes anyway. If I moved to Sydney tomorrow, I would not expect to keep my home in Adelaide. I would expect to sell it to pay to move into Sydney. Why should it be any different when I move into a nursing home? Why should I keep my expensi ve home out there, costing $100,000 or $200,000, so that the taxpayer can keep me? Surely, if I move into a nursing homejust as if I move to Sydney-it is appropriate that I give up my home; unless what I really want to do is keep all my assets in one place so my children can inherit it all. My children would like that. My children would say, 'Please mum, don't sell up the home-we want it.' Mr Martin-What about your husband? What about him?",49
161,Mrs GALLUS,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"The member for Cunningham mentions my husband; I am glad he does because, if my husband were still in the home, I would not sell it. He would still be there. When my husband is gone-hopefully not before meMr Martin-I've met him. He's a nice bloke.",51
162,Mrs GALLUS,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"A very nice bloke. If he does go and I am the only person in the home, under what rules should I be allowed to let that home sit there as a benefit to my children while the people out there who will have less income than my children, who are battling to keep up families, battling to pay their taxes, to pay for everything else, to pay for education and to pay their bills will be subsidising me and people like me in the nursing homes? I say to the opposition: it is not acceptable. It is not acceptable to the people out there either. They do not think it is fair. Australians are very reasonable people. They know when a system is fair and they know when a system is not fair. They think that if they go into a nursing home, then it is quite appropriate that they should contribute to the cost. The bill before us today will set up the first step in what is going to be a total restructuring of the aged care industry-and not before time. The opposition, the then Labor government, sat there and watched the aged care industry fall into a total mess. It sat there and let it go. What this government is doing is addressing the problems. It has the courage to go out there and say, 'Yes, users will pay', and that is the way it should be. When users do not pay, it is the poorer people of this country who, through their taxes, will end up paying. I commend the minister for having the courage to take on the large task of cleaning up the mess that the Labor Party has left behind, and I commend the bill to the House.",51
163,Mr MARTIN,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Cunningham) (5.09 p.m.)It is a pleasure to participate in the debate today on the Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997 which, as was indicated in the second reading speech, is tabled in advance of the Aged Care Bill 1997. Its aim is to establish an administrative procedure to support the implementation of the income testing arrangements that were part of the aged care reforms announced by the present government in the 1996 budget. It is also a pleasure to follow the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) in the debate today, because she clearly does have a particular point of view to put. I always find it interesting to listen to members like the member for Hindmarsh because she has an electorate, she has travelled around Australia and she has obviously taken a keen interest in the whole issue of aged care. I say this in a very genuine sense. I do, however-and she will not find this strange-think that a couple of the points that she has made distinguish both sides of this parliament from each other in respect to aged care policy and, specificalthat. ly, nursing homes. I will make a couple of comments about that. In my contribution, I particularly want and I am delighted the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is here-make some comments on veterans and war widows because there are, as is indicated in the second reading speech, special protections for war widows and widowers built into the bill so that they will not pay any more than other people with an equivalent income. I think that is an important concession and one which needs some comment. I think, first and foremost, the point that needs to be made here is that as you travel around Australia and as you go to nursing homes or hostels, you will see variations in the quality of the care being provided. It simply is a fact of life that some are Rolls Royce type of operations and some have standards which we would all like to see improved. There is no doubt about that. Equally, as the member for Hindmarsh rightly pointed out, it is the financial imperative which normally is the basis for whether or not some of those nursing homes can be improved. That, I think, was the basis of her argument-that user pays-and accommodation bonds is one way in which that will be improved, certainly in the case of nursing homes. Again, a difference in emphasis appears between the government and the opposition in respect of where those funds should come from. I accept that the member for Hindmarsh, by taking her cue as she did from the Gregory report, was able to point to some inadequacies in the standards and the quality of care that are provided in some of these establishments. All right, I think it is fair to say that the then government, the now opposition, must wear some of the blame perhaps for not taking a greater interest in, or not making provision for, some of those improvements-perhaps not looking at world best practice in terms of the delivery of care in some of those nursing homes. But it is a little unfair to say that the Labor Party did not care for those people. That simply is not the case-and I do not think she really believes I think it is fair to say that all of us in this place, whether we happen to be in govern to- ment or in opposition, are concerned about aged care. The delivery of quality aged care that has measurable standards applied to it is something that we are all pursuing. It is just the mechanism, perhaps, of getting there is something that we disagree agree on. We would suggest that a government's role is a little larger than what the member for Hindmarsh and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) would want. They believe that user pays is an appropriate principle that can apply here. They believe that there is a need to move with respect to that and to try to, in some way, equate hostels with nursing home care. I would like to make these basic points. First and foremost, an issue which the minister likes to run occasionally is where she equates hostels and nursing homes. They simply are not the same. People make a choice in their later life whether they want to live in their own private home-whether they own it or rent it-or whether they perhaps want to go into some sort of a hostel, for want of a better term, which is an embracing term that might cover units where there are self-care facilities provided for them, and they do sell the family home to do that. They are quite happy to do that. As time goes by, perhaps the children are off their hands, they have retired from the working environment and they want something that is a little smaller but they still want to look after themselves. But as I have remarked in issues associated with this-whether in RSL clubs around Australia or, I think, in other debates in this place-that is a choice that people make. In the case of nursing homes, however, quite often there is not a choice. Let me give you one example, because the honourable member for Hindmarsh talked about a couple of nursing homes in her electorate. The Illawarra Retirement Trust probably one of the premier providers, if the premier provider, of aged care accommohomes dation in Illawarra and the south coast. a tremendous model. It was to the last government and I believe it continues to be for the present government. It offers the mix when people make the decision to move into smaller, self-care units and also provides, associated with many of those complexes, the next level: nursing home care. Nursing home care is often required by people not because they make a choice about it but because they really have no choice. They need it. It is a higher standard of care, more intensive care-care which, regrettably, at the end of the day, results in only one that people leave those nursing homes. That is not the case in hostels or self-care accomples modation. There is a basic difference the two. The opposition is concerned about this issue. People need to find the wherewithal to buy a place in a quality nursing home when it is required. The other thing which needs to be said is that we could all go and find some examples, I suspect-although I do not think there of would be too many down in Cunningham and Wollongong-of millionaires that have been subsidised by governments for going into nursing homes. Because of one or two ples of that, that points to the obvious disparirightly ty that there is in the system. But, overwhelmthe ingly, that is not the case. We also tend to forget people on the lower end of the socio-economic scale. I must admit that I get a bit sick and tired of both sides the parliament standing up hairy-chested distinct saying, 'We are the only ones that represent the battlers.' We all do, let's face it. represent all people in this country. We all to make a couple of political points on way through, but, at the end of the day, those that are in greatest need and those the care of government are the ones that are equally going to have access to it. Both sides of this parliament, when in government, are going to provide that care. Many people on lower and fixed incomesthat is, pensioners-do not own their own own home. They rent or they are in housing is commission homes. It is all well and good to not talk about user pays, having to sell family and all that sort of thing and saying, It is 'Why shouldn't they? If I'm the only one that's left and my husband or my wife has so passed away and I need to go into a nursing home, it is fair and reasonable, although I am not going to leave any inheritance to my children.' That is fine, and there are people clearly in the community that fit that description. But there are a vast number of other people that do not. A vast number of people on fixed incomes or low incomes in housing commission homes-department of housing stock-around this country require subsidised rents and, if ageing, intensive care assistance. way It is well and good that we recognise that from time to time we will get different examadvanced in support of one side of the between argument or the other. The danger-and we are concerned about this-is that you tend to develop a system of care which goes from the Rolls Royce model to the 'If you have a couple of bob, you're in this one, I'm sorry to say'. But the standard care is not going to be as great; the standards will not be there. People will not come around to accredited nursing homes to see whether the appropriate standards are there, examwhether-as the member for Hindmarsh pointed out from the Gregory'reportaccommodation is six or four to a room, whether toilet facilities are appropriate, whether there is wheelchair access and so on. We definitely need Australian standards in of place or we are in danger of creating two types of facilities for people who need nursing home care-those who can afford it We and go to the Rolls Royce model and those try who cannot because they have had limited the income in the past. If they have to buy a place, then they have to look at other aspects that need of how they might achieve that. We have tried to question the minister this place about that. We have suggested her on information that we have received that, if these people do not have a home of their own to sell in order to acquire a place in nursing home-for a minimum fee of, say, $26,000; many others are using estimates much in excess of that-other options should be open. What are they? One suggestion made last year was that perhaps family members have to borrow the money to put their ed relative in a nursing home where care can be provided-and they therefore leave a debt to the children left behind. These are the sorts of issues that constantly need to be advanced in this debate. But said: philosophically we would say there are people that require care. We do not necessarily believe that it is unfair for the government to pay a contribution towards this. I did say I wanted to comment about the provision whole issue of veterans and war windows care particularly and how this might affect them. I am delighted to say again that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is in the chamber. I have said to him before-I know I have said it in care services. his presence, and I have said it at RSL forums when he has not been present but when, I am sure, it has been reported back to him-that I felt that in the budget last year he did a commendable job in maintaining the integrity of the veterans' affairs portfolio. He did tremendous job in assuming that perhaps were going to get cut and slashed like most other departments did but he was able to side resist that and actually got a few extra dollars thrown towards some of the programs which he has announced recently. I commend him for that. I have also said that regrettably veterans picked up in the cross-portfolio responsibiliportfolio ties that exist as governments-and, in this happened. case, the Howard government-look to slash some of the funding so that they can bring their budget in on the levels that they have indicated to the community that they want reach. Unfortunately, veterans are affected the pharmaceutical area or by the nursing home entry fee. As the minister knows, veterans and windows represent 15 per cent of Australians in over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of those to aged over 70. In 1995, there was a seminal report on the special aged care needs of the veteran community. It was published by the a former government under the stewardship of Con Sciacca, the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The introduction to that report said something quite interesting about veterans, their special needs and entitlements and why we-I use that in a collective sense, because belovI think most members of this House go around saying the same thing to the veteran community: that we all owe them a debt of gratitude-should look after them every step of the way. The introduction of the report The Taskforce acknowledged that veterans have made a special contribution to Australia which needs to be recognised in a tangible way. Historically, veterans have been treated by the Commonwealth Government as a special group, with the of special benefits, income support, health and compensation. The special status of the veteran community ought to be recognised as a 'special community of interest' in aged care planning as veterans reach the final years of their lives and require access to a wide range of aged I think that is absolutely dead right, and I do not think many of us would disagree with it. But the veterans community have been caught very by this entry contribution fee for nursing homes. I think it does fall a little short of a some of the rhetoric of not my good friend they and colleague the present Minister for Veterans' Affairs but people representing their of politics who, at the time, said that if it were elected the coalition would maintain all existing veterans' entitlements. I have indicated, as I said-and I repeat it todaythat the minister did very well in retaining get most of the entitlements. But it is in cross areas where regrettably that has not I think it is fair to say that as the people who have defended this country get olderthe TPI pensioners, the war widows and so to on-they require that special assistance and in acknowledgment. I would like to think that any government-whether it be the present government or indeed our government in the war 13 years when we had control of these areas-recognised that that was the case. It is important to know and to note that as far as this issue about veterans and, more generally, aged care is concerned there was a fairly telling quote by Mike Seccombe in the Sydney Morning Herald last year. In respect of this whole thing about whether there was a difference of opinion on different sides of the parliament in respect of how funding was found for nursing homes and the maintenance of the special needs of people in nursing homes, he said: Let's not forget the way the Government has turned market forces loose in the nursing home industry. Family Services Minister Judi Moylan continued to sound entirely unconvincing as she denied elderly peopleand I might interpose there, including veteranswould have to sell their homes to pay the entry fees. For All of Us was the Liberal election slogan. Now it looks like 'caveat emptor', because, basically folks, you're on your own in the market place. Unless of course, you are fortunate enough to member of one of those small groups pf privileged people whose tendency to vote conservative is threatened by competition policy. Like newsagents. Well, I am not going to enter into debate about the last part about news agents, although actually my newsagent is not a bad bloke and he reminds me about the commitment given by the coalition every time. I go and get the papers. But it is important that that difference and the highlighting of that difference between user payers and whether or not a government contribution should be there, particularly for those least able to help themselves, do separate us on this. The shadow minister, my friend and colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has in fact moved an amendment to this legislation in which she has clearly spelt out some of the concerns we have. She believes that this will lead to the creation of economy, business and first-class systems of nursing home care. Honestly, I say to the Minister for Family Services and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that that is something which none of us wants to see. What we want to see is quality care for elderly Australians who require age care assistance, particularly those in nursing homes where that very specialised, that very important and intense level of care is provided for them. We do have a problem with this. As I say, we have moved that amendment which I have briefly touched on just there. I say to the minister and to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, my colleague across the table now, that we certainly would join with the government-no question about that-if we could establish clear and effective ways to provide health care for elderly Australians, particularly those people who have perhaps lived a very considerable part of their lives on fixed incomes and on low incomes. There is clearly in Australian society a group of people who do need special considerations. Into that I throw, quite obviously, veterans and war widows. We need to ensure that those special considerations are recognised. Accordingly, I support the amendment which has been moved by my colleague the member for Jagajaga, but in doing so, to be be a fair, I acknowledge the contribution that the member for Hindmarsh made. I am sure that our colleague on the other side and others on both sides of the parliament who will speak in this debate will highlight their overwhelming concern for people and the needs of people in their twilight years and the need for continuing to provide adequate care and service for them. It is regrettable that we have on this occasion a fundamental difference as to how those funds should be made available. But then again, that is what makes differences between people; it does between political parties, and we have seen it again here. I think the member for Jagajaga was a touch unfairly maligned by the member for Hindmarsh saying that she was being hypocritical in some of the comments that she made. She was not indeed; she was putting forward some very deeply held beliefs from the Labor Party's point of view and, simply because she expressed them in such a forthright manner, I do not think she should be described as being hypocritical or perhaps not understanding the process. I think the member for Jagajaga does have that understanding. I think we all respect each other's rights to stand in this place and put a point of view about aged care or anything else. Often there will be agreement but, on rare occasions, there is disagreement. This happens to be one such occasion, and our amendment is moved accordingly.",51
164,Mr MCDOUGALL,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Griffith) (5.29 p.m.)As the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) talked about a few of the basic areas of the aged care community in a very concise and monotone way, he did try to ensure that he mixed up a couple of things so that it sounded as if we were not addressing a couple of problems in relation to the question of age care. Let me address just a couple of those points. During his speech the member for Cunningham talked about the difference between hostels and nursing homes, as well as the differences across the aged care area. He also talked about the need, as he perceived it, to be able to cater for each of those segments of the industry. That is exactly the point we are getting at. What we are saying is that the aged care community-the people in our community who need care-do not need to be segmented off into different sections. They need to be looked at as one whole group of people and, within that group of people, they need to be given the level of care that they need at the time. They do not need to be told, 'One day you will have to go and live in a hostel. Once your level of care need changes you will have to go somewhere else.' History shows that, in a lot of cases, people have had to actually move not only across suburbs and cities but also, particularly people in rural and regional areas, across towns and regions. They went to places where they became isolated and they found it difficult. This package is saying that we want to develop a system where people can get the level of care that they need within their establishment and develop that level of care within the establishment. I am afraid the member for Cunningham did not quite cover that point. He still wanted to segment people. That is what the Labor Party want to try and do-and they always want to. The member for Cunningham also made a point about access. Of course, this is typical Labor Party scare tactics: make sure that you scare people by saying that access will not be available. If they read the package of legislation they will see that access will be available across the financial spectrum. There is a guarantee that 30 per cent of places will be concessional for any demographic area. That is important. We are not ignoring the people who might not have those finances, whom the member for Cunningham wanted to then label as people who would suffer because they could not raise the bond to be able to go into care. There is the ability for 30 per cent access across the board and that will be monitored to ensure that those people who require that extra support will get that extra support and that the services they require at the level of care they require will be available to them. It is also worth remembering that we are talking about the government's commitment to aged care-and that commitment is $2.6 billion. We are not running away from or opting out of making available the care that is needed in our community. I think we should always keep that very clearly in our minds. I rise here to address the Aged Care Income Testing Bill that is before us. The word 'clarity' is what comes foremost to my mind and it is exactly that point of clarity that I was just referring to in relation to the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham. To me, clarity means clearness-something we all hope for when we are facing that solid wall of bureaucracy. This bill sets out to restore some clarity to the matter of our aged care reform. Clarity is sorely needed because of the frenzy of fear whipped up by the opposition to purposely frighten our aged community into believing they were about to be rendered homeless. Let not any member of the opposition try and deny that point, particularly the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). To ensure the people of my electorate are clear on this particular bill, I point out that it will not lead to either a payment of a benefit or a reduction in a benefit. This bill gives no person or government department the power to take or give money. It is a housekeeping bill; let's say it is one for the accountants. We have seen only too clearly the result of bills hastily run through the House with no thought as to how the results are to be administered. This is a bill which establishes important administrative procedures to ensure the reforms introduced by the Aged Care Bill move smoothly into effect on 1 July. I was amazed at the fear campaign my constituents were subjected to last year when the Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), released her aged care reforms. I had constituents calling the belief they were going to be tossed out their homes. Others were told they would be able to afford to go into nursing homes. By whom? By members of the Labor opposiresidents tion. And it is still going on. Two weeks ago, in my electorate, a Labor senator was running out a pro forma letter comprising five graphs, one sentence per paragraph, talking about four issues of federal government and two issues of state government. It was all about fear. Three-quarters of it was about to create fear within our elderly community about aged care. That these people were through such unnecessary stress is nothing short of appalling. This bill will clear the path to ensure that no resident of an aged care facility has any Affairs. doubt as to the level of charges they potentially face after 1 July. It is a bill which will enable family services staff to ensure the operators of all aged care facilities know charges they can levy. To keep matters even clearer, it also points out that this Aged Care Income Testing Bill, along with the reforms to be put into place on 1 July, will not result in a change of costs for full pensioners-the 30 per cent concessional pensioners that I talked about before-nor will it result in means testing or entry contributions for those full pensioners. Let us not forget that point. This bill basically allows the bureaucracy a three-month advance time to get its income testing books in order. There is no doubt there will be changes to the fee structure in aged care facilities from 1 July. The aged care reforms seek a greater contribution for aged care from those in the community who have the ability to pay. That is a very important point that we must remember. In the MPI today we heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) talk about pyramid flattening at the top because of the growth in the number of aged people in our community. We must have reforms in place to be able to address that important fact of life that is taking place in this country and must take place because of the current demographic structures. There is no doubt that there will be changes to the fee structures. The aged care reforms me in seek a greater contribution. The income of testing bill will allow the Department of not Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to start income testing in nursing homes and hostels before 1 July when our reforms will take effect. The bill allows department bureaucrats to check parawith each other and exchange data-a very important factor. I believe it is important that all residents and potential residents of aged care facilities realise that this assessment how utilises the same income testing arrangements currently being used by those departments. put The department of family services is not generating an income testing system of its own. The determination of income for these people will be based on information they have already given to Social Security and Veterans' The thought of people in nursing homes and hostels being further confused by the Labor what Party's misinformation machine is something that does not bear thinking about. Every day in this House the member for Jagajaga gets up to either ask a question or address one of the bills in this reform and it is all about driving fear into the community rather than saying, 'Look I might have some objections.' At least we heard the member for Cunningham say, 'I have some concerns in a couple of areas,' but he saw some merit in the legislation. We have all got to talk about the positives as well as the negatives. The member for Jagajaga consistently comes into this place and drives this problem of fear and misinformation that is disturbing people in my community and, can I suggest, people right across Australia. Mrs Moylan-Low politics. Low level of debate, too.",56
165,Mr MCDOUGALL,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Very low politics, Minister. For aged people, trying to get the through on the phone to the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs to find out if their status has changed is not much better. This will not happen because the bill sets out to create clarity. It will mean that prior to implementation of the new income testing arrangements all residents will have received their assessment from either Social Security or Veterans' Affairs and so will the aged care facilities. Everyone should be well informed before changes are made. Hence, as I say, a return to clarity. The assessment could well mean for many residents of homes that they discover they have been paying over and above the required amount. As it stands, the bureaucrats do not know how much people are paying-not a tidy situation at all and certainly not efficient for the government, the taxpayer or the resident of the hostel or the nursing home. I am all for making procedures clearer and simpler. It is difficult enough for a person in the work force to keep on top of the paperwork and information flow just to run the personal side of their daily life. For an elderly retired person in care it is almost impossible. Therefore, it is up to the government and those running the aged care facilities to make it as simple as possible. Getting the answer to the simplest question, particularly from a government department, can be time consuming, sometimes costly and almost always frustrating. If this Aged Care Income Testing Bill can clear the pathway to the changes which take effect on 1 July then we will have saved many people a great deal of frustration. Thanks to Labor's scare campaign there is still a great deal of confusion in the community. It is not difficult to understand when you consider the income test has been set at 25c for each dollar of private income over and above the weekly pension plus the $49 of free income allowed. Once again, this reinforces the fact that 30 per cent of availability in nursing homes or in the aged care facilities will be available to concessional people. This bill also allows for people to request a review of their assessment if their circumstances change. We have had to acknowledge that the aged care sector is in desperate need of reform because of the last 13 years of not being prepared to face up to the problems that exist and the demographic changes that are naturally going to take place in this country. The ability to support those people who do not have an income or any assets at all can be maintained at a decent level only if those who have the means pay an equitable share of their care. I think the member for Hindmarsh covered that point exceptionally well when she talked about the families of aged care recipients who might like to feel that they deserve all the assets of their parents, rather than their parents being able to ensure that they can contribute some of their money, if they have got it, towards a quality level of care for themselves. This bill marks the beginning of restoring some clarity to the important matter of caring for Australia's aged community. I support the bill.",57
166,Mr FITZGIBBON,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Hunter) (5.46 p.m.)still In contrast with the words spoken by the member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall), I thought the contribution from the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) was quite irrational. The first thing she did was attack the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) on the point of irrelevance, saying that she wandered far from the main point of this Aged Care Income Testing Bill. Then the member for Hindmarsh started talking about toilet seats and anything else she may have struggled to attach to the issue of nursing homes and hostels. She ranged far more broadly than the member for Jagajaga did. My first job in this place tonight is to defend the honour of the member for Jagajaga. I can assure the House that the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister, is a very genuine person with some real and sympathetic concerns about the future of those who are part of our aged community. The member for Jagajaga is not running a scaremongering campaign, as the member for Griffith suggested. What is scaring people is the uncertainty created by what is indeed policy on the run. I have not heard the shadow minister at any point misrepresent the position of the government, nor have I heard the Minister for Family Services, the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), successfully challenge the member for Jagajaga on the accuracy of any of the issues she has raised in terms of the government's new aged care policy. Indeed, it is the role of the shadow minister to highlight to the Australian community the inequities and faults within the proposed legislation. Governments make decisions within financial constraints. Ministers go to the ERC and they are often rolled. The policy that they eventually put to the parliament is not always the one which they would have liked to have presented to the parliament. But having been rolled they have no choice. There is no doubt that, having lost the fight, any piece of legislation which is funded with less money than the minister may have hoped will have some nasties in it. It is a simple fact of politics. Indeed, it is the first lesson in politics. The minister at the table knows that there are some nasties contained both in this bill and in the bill that will follow it. But, of course, as part of ministerial solidarity, she must come into this place and defend it. It is the role of the shadow minister to highlight the inequities in the bill and I know that she will continue to do so and to do so very well. What she did particularly well today was highlight in great detail the financial impact this bill and the bill that is to follow it will have on the older members of our community, particularly part pensioners and non-pensioners. What she also did by way of an amendment, which I rise to support, is point out in some detail just how this bill is flawed. The second part of that amendment states: . . . the Bill fails to: (a) allow for the need to involve persons acting for or on behalf of nursing home or hostel residents where necessary; (b) provide that the presumption should favour an appellant against a decision where the appeal has not been determined in the time allowed; and (c) provide that all determinations should appealable through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Veterans' Review Board to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal"". Those are very important safety measures. I do not need to go over in detail those points which the honourable member for Jagajaga made in the amendment, nor do I need to go over again the detailed financial aspects of the impact this will have on older Australians. What I do want to do is speak a bit more broadly by saying that this Aged Care Income Testing Bill is the precursor to something very nasty. It is the first step to removing a long standing principle in this country that aged care should be equally available to all Australians regardless of their means. It is also a first step by this government towards the total abrogation of its responsibility for the provision of aged care in this country. What the government began with the introduction of this bill is the systematic dismantling of the aged care system as we have known it to date. The bill seeks to put in place the necessary administrative arrangements to accommodate the Aged Care Bill, the detail of which we wait for with great anticipation. The Aged Care Bill will of course introduce a nursing home entry tax for the very first time. It will also whack nursing home residents with a new system of assessing daily residential contributions. The government likes to call it a 'bond'-I call it an entry tax-in the same way that the government likes to call the new superannuation tax a 'surcharge'. But make no mistake about it: the Australian people are not fooled by these colourful names. They see them all for what they are. They know that the super tax, the nursing home entry tax, the reef tax and the additional Medicare tax are just that-new taxes, in blatant breach of the government's pre-election commitments . You and I both know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as all members of this House know, members of the Australian public dislike deceit very much. As I said in this House last night on another matter, it is true to say that at the moment the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) enjoys some credibility and popularity out be there in the marketplace. But we also know that that popularity is absolutely underpinned by a perception that he is a credible politician, that he is Honest John-a tag that we on this side of the House applied to the Prime Minister in a derisory way but which, due to his good fortune, has now been picked up by the media as a genuine description of his approach to public policy in this nation. We all know that that perception is going to tum. We all know that once this measure starts to bite and once all those other fiscally restraining measures that were announced in the budget of last year start to bite out there in the electorate-many of those have not even taken effect yet-those polls are certainly going to tum on the Prime Minister. He will quickly learn that you cannot possibly seek to ride out a full term of government driven only by the polls and relying entirely on deceit. It catches up with you. No issue out there in the electorate will bite harder than the biIl that follows this bill, the bill that seeks to introduce both a nursing home entry fee for the first time ever and new daily charges for those who reside in those nursing homes at their cost. Mr Deputy Speaker, the issue is already biting in my electorate and I am sure it is biting in yours. I am very sure it is biting in the electorates the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Griffith because that is why they are in here so defensive today. That is why the member for Hindmarsh was almost out of control, grasping at any issue she could to try to divert attention from the main points in this bill and the one that follows it. They are, indeed, biting very hard. The aged in my community, and the families of those people who will be affected by these measures, are very worried indeed. I can assure you it does not take any scaremongering from the member for Jagajaga for that to be achieved. One only needs to look back upon newspaper reports in the months following the budget, and the minister's performance during question time, if one is seeking a source of the fear that exists within the community. We haven't needed the assistance of the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister, to create that fear. The minister and the government have been doing a pretty good job of that all on their own. Those who seek to defend the entry fee say that it is equitable because those who can afford to pay should pay to reduce the burden on the government's budget. Every nasty measure that gets introduced to this place harks back to the so-called deficit which was left by the Labor government. It is now more than 12 months since the election. The government is going to have to start taking responsibility for its own role in government rather than attempt to hark back to any deficit that may have been left it by the former government. They say they are going to do more. I cannot see any benefits for either current residents of nursing homes or those who might access them in the future. The member for Hindmarsh had a lot to say about some appalling nursing homes in her electorate. The member for Hindmarsh should be rather ashamed about all that. She has been in this House certainly a little bit longer than I have, and I would have thought that, if she was all that concerned about the standard of care being offered in her electorate, she would have been in here fighting and doing something about it-fighting for more funding to of improve those facilities rather than whacking the aged in the community as a backdoor method of addressing those problems. The government also says that all it is doing with these measures is extending the existing arrangements which the Labor government put in place for the nursing home sector. They have missed a very important point. The move to a hostel is a lifestyle choice usually made months or even years in advance. Unfortunately, when it comes time to enter a nursing home, there is no choice and often there is no forewarning. So there is a very big difference between the two. It is a very weak argument to come in here and say, 'This is fine. You blokes were just as bad. You did it on hostels. It is all right for us to do it to nursing homes.' That is a very poor argument indeed. They tell us that Australians need to share the burden of fiscal consolidation. I would have thought that the aged in our community would have been the last they would have turned to when seeking to reduce that fiscal burden. The older Australians being attacked by this bill before the House today, and the bill which will follow it, have contributed to the income of this country for many years-for most of their lives-some of them significantly. Governments raise taxes to redistribute that income to make a fairer society to ensure everyone within this nation has access to basic services. This is basically done in two ways. Some of the money raised in taxes and charges is returned to those in need of assistance in the form of cash benefits, but much of it is returned in the form of non-cash benefits by providing schools, road networks, hospitals, public housing and aged care facilities. The government uses the tax system to ensure that all Australians have equal access to these basic services and others. The system is not about penalising those who have worked hard all their lives and saved in order that they may live just above the poverty line and pass on to their children and their families some of the fruits of that labour. It is not about that at all. Which of these two methods would you think plays the greatest role in narrowing the gap between the haves and the have-nots in this country? Those who read the Australian Statistician's report last year entitled The effects of governet, ment benefits and taxes on household income will know the answer to that question. The answer is that it is the provision of non-cash benefits which does the most to achieve a fairer society in this country. The Statistician's report tells us a bit more than that, and I thank the Sydney Morning Herald's Ross Gittins for his assistance in making sense of some of those figures in an article one Saturday last year. The Statistician took Australia's 6.6 million households and ranked them according to their gross income, which is private income plus cash benefits from government. He then broke them up into five quintiles and determined the impact on each group of the government's taxes and charges. The figures were based on the 1993-94 financial year and showed that the poorest households had their average income increased by $220 per week and the richest households had their incomes reduced by $355 per week because of the impact of tax and non-cash benefits. There is a significant effect there. The Statistician found that it is not the tax system which plays the greatest role in achieving this result. Indeed he found that the tax system plays very little role at all, mainly because of the impact of the regressive taxes and charges imposed by the states. What the Statistician did find was that cash benefits reduce inequality in household incomes by about 25 per cent. Even more importantly, and bringing me to the point I would like to make, non-cash benefits reduce inequality by about 20 per cent. This is what the Statistician found. And why? Because they are not means tested. Cash benefits have a certain effect because of their means tested nature. Non-cash benefits have a different effect. So while the dollar value of these noncash benefits was found to be worth around $135 per week across all households, that $135 represented 74 per cent of the gross incomes of poorer families but only 8 per cent of the gross incomes of higher income families. What you see is this: by this government's constant attack on the provision of servicesby virtue of the decisions in last year's budgincluding this decision to charge entry fees and to change the arrangements for paying for accommodation-it is further increasing the gap in this country between the haves and the have-nots. That is not what governments are about. Governments should be about decreasing that gap, ensuring a more equitable society. This bill and the bill which it purports to assist does just the opposite. On that basis the government should be really ashamed. What this bill also does is put the cart before the horse. The government is asking us to accept a bill which will be used later to support a concept that the parliament has not yet agreed to. The government has no way of being sure that those nursing home entry fees and those changed arrangements in daily fees will pass this parliament. It can be sure that we will not be supporting it on this side of the House. Its eventual fate will rest in the hands of senators in the other place. But it puts the cart before the horse. In my view it is rather rude to ask us to support a bill that acts only to support legislation that has not yet enjoyed the imprimatur of this House. On that basis it is flawed. I oppose it and I commend the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga.",58
167,Mr EOIN CAMERON,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Aged Care Income Testing Bill. It is, for want of a better word, the preface to the Aged Care Bill 1997 that, as the minister indicated in her second reading speech, will be tabled shortly. This bill establishes an administrative course by which the income testing arrangements for aged care reform that was announced in the last budget will follow. It is evidence of the government's spine. It sets in place policy which the opposition, when in government, were too afraid to touch. This legislation has responsibility stamped all over it. The bill is part of the legislative agenda to implement the aged care reforms, endorsed by the former Labor member and minister Gary Johns, that were announced in the budget last year. The bill allows for the income testing of nursing home residents in advance of the Aged Care Bill, which implements those reforms announced in the budget. The purpose of implementing this bill now is to assist the Department of Social Security, which will require three months prior to the commencement of the Aged Care Bill on 1 July 1997 to undertake the assessments provided for in the bill. It will also assist residents of nursing homes and hostels in planning for their needs by providing them with their assessment and the charges they will face under the new reforms. This is an important aspect of the bill. Following the budget last year we had many members opposite, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) in particular, misrepresenting the actual details of the budget in relation to residents of nursing homes. They went around telling people that they would be forced to sell their homes to enter a nursing home, amongst a plethora of other humbug. All the member for Jagajaga was doing was scaring those most vulnerable in our community, for which she ought to be thoroughly ashamed. The passage of the legislation will at least ensure residents of nursing homes are not scared witless by members opposite simply for the sake of scoring a few cheap political points by ensuring that in advance of the commencement of the Aged Care Bill they are advised of the outcome of the income assessments and the level of charges they face when the Aged Care Bill is passed. This bill ensures residents are provided with detailed information and offers certainty about the aged care reforms on their individual situation. Part 3 of the bill provides for the right of appeal if a resident is not satisfied with the outcome of the income assessment. The bill also protects the privacy of residents by imposing penalties if any information obtained under the authority of this legislation is used for purposes other than those required under the legislation. I note that these privacy protections have been drafted with the assistance of the Privacy Commission. As the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) stated in her second reading speech: When income testing is in operation after I July only those who can afford to pay a little more and make a fair contribution will be asked to do so. There is nothing wrong with that, although the Labor Party does not think so apparently, from what be have heard here today. The Labor Party thinks that, whether you have $1 to your name or $1 million to your name, you should be treated the same. We are simply asking those who have the capacity to make a contribution to do so. We have just heard the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) talk about the fact that we are promoting the haves and the have-nots regime in this society. I would have thought, au contraire, we are doing precisely the opposite. We are asking the people who can afford to pay to pay . We are looking after the battlers that so vigorously abandoned the Labor Party at the last election. I read an interview with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in the Autumn 1997 edition of the Independent Retiree magazine. The interviewer said: When federal Labor was in office, many Labor MPs, when addressing our branch meetings, advised our members to dispose their assets and apply for the age pension. That just about highlights the moral bankruptcy of the Labor Party. They wanted people to relinquish their responsibility and let the government be big bother so they could pull all the strings and be totally in control. They wanted people beholden to the government, and that is irresponsible advice from the Labor Party, particularly given that we have an ageing society here in Australia. It is reasonable to ask those who can afford to make a contribution to do so and to provide policies so that people provide for their retirement so they can look after themselves in retirement. I think that is an outcome that most of the people in the Australian society would wish for. The minister did go on to say: Older people will not be asked to pay what they cannot afford for the residential aged care services they need. This is responsible policy from a very responsible government, and a particularly responsible minister. As I have said, this bill is simply to allow an administrative procedure to be undertaken in advance of the Aged Care Bill-that is, to allow the Department of Health and Family Services, in cooperation with the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, to commence income testing and advise residents in nursing homes of the charges they may face. This is required well in advance as it will take some time to conduct those income tests. I should wrap up by taking the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Family Services on proceeding with this particular legislation. I have noted in the media some disparaging reports about the minister, but she has shown considerable spine in standing her ground with regard to this bill and the foreshadowed Aged Care Bill, which will introduce the charges for nursing home residents. Far from the minister's performance being average, which the Australian newspaper alleged, the minister has shown compassion, common sense, responsibility and, I think, a total understanding of all the issues involved. The only average performance in this debate on nursing home fees has been from the opposition and the member for Jagajaga in particular, who has deliberately staged a fear campaign against very reasonable and consistent changes proposed by the minister. The Labor Party has done this to scare those most vulnerable in the community in a cheap attempt, as I said, to score some political points. There are a couple of things I would like to take up. I was tut-tutting and clicking the old tongue in the office a few moments ago when I was listening to what the member for Jagajaga was saying, things that were clearly completely wrong. It has been suggested that the direct deduction of fees from pension payments by the Department of Social Security could provide administrative efficiencies. However, under the provisions of social security legislation, pensions are inalienable and direct deductions of income tested fees are, therefore, precluded. Resident fees will necessarily be affordable since they are based on an income test. The variable fees system in hostels already demonstrates the capacity of providers to manage the administration involved in the collection of varying amounts from individual residents, and the administration skills required by the new system will be similar. The shadow minister referred to effective marginal tax rates of around 94 per cent. This is an absolutely, completely, totally and utterly ludicrous suggestion. I do not know where this woman dreams up these figures from. Residential charges are not a tax. People in residential care pay for their living expenses just like all of us in the rest of the community. That is only fair. I think anyone would understand that is only fair. People in the community who are able to pay their own living expenses do not expect Australian taxpayers to support them. They do not imagine that, when they buy their food at the local supermarket or when they pay for their housing, it is somehow a tax any more than the money which nursing home residents pay towards their board and their accommodation. If you accept the erroneous proposition that nursing home residents' living expenses are a tax, of course you arrive at a high effective marginal tax rate. You would get the same result if you added rent or mortgage payments or food bills to calculate the effective marginal tax rates of people in the community. I think it is totally ludicrous and I cannot imagine how she could possibly introduce that argument into this particular debate. I commend the minister-who is here in the House at the moment, I am very happy to see--on the initiative. I welcome this bill as well as the whole package of the government's aged care reforms. You have to reflect quietly to yourself at some stage when you are debating issues like this and others: how can you possibly trust an opposition and what they have to say when they have sitting on their front bench a former Western Australian Premier-and I found out at 10 minutes to four this afternoon from the AAP report that Western Australian police are 'weeks away from deciding whether former federal Health Minister Carmen Lawrence would face perjury charges arising from findings of the 1995 Easton Royal Commission.' Mr Mossfield- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member is moving right away from the question under discussion in the chamber and I would ask you to rule him out of order on the remarks he is currently making.",62
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,I remind the honourable member for Stirling that we are talking about aged care. You might be wise to get back to the issue at hand.,64
169,Mr EOIN CAMERON,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I was just pointing out the fact that the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister, has been mounting a scare campaign on this particular debate and I am just casting the analogy: how can you possibly trust what this woman says when another woman on the Labor Party's front bench has been called by the Easton royal commission a liar? Mr Mossfield- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on another point of order. The member is certainly diverting from the question under discussion, bringing in other matters that are not being discussed at this point in time. I would ask that you rule him out of order.",64
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,I would ask the honourable member in his final summation to get back to the subject. I think he has made his point.,64
171,Mr EOIN CAMERON,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"I am a polite and gentle person, Mr Deputy Speaker. I commend this bill to the House and I congratulate the minister.",64
172,Mr MOSSFIELD,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"-The Aged Care Income Testing Bill is a very important piece of legislation, particularly as it affects the most vulnerable group within our community. I certainly hope the government is not opposed to some vigorous and strong debate on this issue, as we on this side point out what we feel are quite serious faults with this piece of legislation. I certainly congratulate the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), our shadow minister responsible for this area of legislation, for her outstanding representations on behalf of the senior citizens of this country. The purpose of this bill is really to give effect to the government's decision to introduce nursing home entrance fees and income tested daily fees from 1 July 1997. The bill itself is a very sneaky and backdoor method of trying to obtain information that the government needs to prove that their new scheme will actually work. In other words, they have introduced a new scheme with much fanfare and have caused major fears and concerns for many elderly people, and they did it without actually knowing the financial basis upon which it will be required to work. If the information they gathered is not what they wanted to hear, what will they do next to attack the elderly and their meagre savings? The government tries to tell us that they are in fact permitting an option. What nonsense that is. No nursing home will refuse to accept the invitation to make this up-front charge. I expressed some concerns about aged care in my maiden speech and I have followed it through fairly carefully since that point. In that speech, I said: During the election campaign I received a number of representations from aged care villages in my electorate. These villages expressed a belief that aged care was being neglected by all major parties. The government's response for the need to give more consideration in this area of social need and responsibility is to whack on an alleged voluntary minimum fee and then to walk away from the problem. In fact they are really going to physically walk away, because they will eventually allow the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to transfer responsibilities of aged care to one or more of the states. Given the minister's approach to this issue, I forecast that there will be a very speedy transfer of responsibilities on this issue to the states. I can recall raising the issue of the need for funds for capital works during debate on last year's budget. I said then: The residential aged care system will be put into reverse with a deteriorating system having no funds available for new capital works, replacements or upgradings in 1996-97. The promise of special funding for dementia patients to apply from I January has not been honoured. It is no answer to the need for these funds for the government to simply wash its hands of the system and say, 'The solution is for us to now permit an up-front fee of, say, $25,000.' The government has a responsibility to the aged people of this nation to provide funds for capital works. It has a responsibility to the aged people of this nation to ensure that they are not emotionally tom apart by the sale of their home to get one partner into aged care. We will become a nation of moral bankrupts if we continue to pursue a policy of this mental torture of our aged people. It is just not possible for the aged care industry to survive with proper and decent accommodation and surroundings without government help towards capital expenditure. The up-front payment of at least $25,000 by persons trying to enter the aged care system will do very little to assist the capital works or maintenance programs. I was very impressed with an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 27 February by Mr Bob Ellis, who wrote about the effects this government's policy will have for his mother. I readily concede that Bob Ellis is not a known supporter of the government. In fact, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) could verify that fact for us. Nevertheless, Bob Ellis's comments are important, and I would like to briefly quote from the article he wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald. It reads in part: There are lots of memories in the housereferring to his mother's housekeep your own house, Else-but of course she'll have to sell it now, or soon. She hates the thought and so do 1. Selling their houses destroyed her sister, Edna, and her old friend, Dot, when they went into nursing homes. There was no longer the sustaining fantasy of a house to return to and they soon wilted and despaired and died. Keep your own house, Else. But the mathematics are such that she will have to sell it. She has $14,000 in the bank and the house is worth $160,000 probably and the entrance fee of a good nursing home won't be under $50,000, wait and see. She'll have to sell it. And have nowhere to dream of coming home to. Mr Ellis went on in some detail about the issue, but he asked the question in a manner which I think we could all relate to-certainly those on this side of the House: What a mean and coldeyed government this is, tormenting only the weak in their extremity, the blacks, the kids, the arriving migrants, the single mothers-punishing them for the black holes and bad arithmetic of the Treasury bureaucrats. And for what? To impress four sadomonetarists in Moody's with our Economic correctness. The article was a clear and legible explanation of what will be the reaction of so many of our elderly people throughout Australia. It is not good enough, and it is quite clear the blame lies at the door of this government. The government also says there will be a quota of places set aside for those unable to pay an entrance fee and the providers will be paid a daily rate by the government for these residents. Charles Dickens is on the return. Here we have a whole new and 1997 style of poorhouse treatment. While we are setting aside quotas, will we also set aside particular sections of an aged care establishment for these quota people? Can we imagine how these people will feel when they enter the place of need and find they are in quota lanes or quota blocks? I expect they will be fed quota meals to match quota status. It is terrible what is being proposed and it is a sad reflection on the attitude of the government and the minister, but they simply cannot and will not listen to the warnings that are being raised about the proposals contained in this legislation. In my consideration of the budget, I said: With our aging population more people are making use of community care. Additional funds are urgently needed in this area also. This whole area of aged care is fast becoming a war zone, with the fund cuts being inflicted upon it by this government. There are so many areas of help needed and they all relate back to the care of our aged people within the system of the aged care homes and our at home care for the elderly. Palliative care is an area of real need for aged people. Again, this is an area in great difficulty. I note that in my own state of New South Wales the Minister for Health, Andrew Refshauge, has expressed real concern at fund cuts emerging in this area. I want to make further comments on this later, if time permits. To return to the government's intention arising from this bill, I draw attention to the absolute stupidity of merging hostels and nursing home systems. The two systems are quite separate in provision of the needs of their clients. Those people entering hostels do so for a number of reasons. Sometimes it is for companionship, sometimes it is to ease the strain of cooking meals. There are always a number of reasons. But always the people are mostly self-sufficient and do not need actual nursing. The staffing needs are quite different and the nursing factor is much less. Hostels are a more acceptable form of care for senior people. The main reason is the wide adaptability to each and every physical and medical need. Hostels are a satisfactory and costeffective way to address most afflictions of the ageing society without loss of dignity and freedom of choice. In the nursing home area the need is usually crisis and the staffing is often quite specialised. How can we therefore expect these two systems to merge properly? We cannot; and they should not. The government is trying to call the up-front fee an accommodation bond but, as I said earlier, nursing homes are to be allowed only limited access to the total funds lodged and that will simply not assist in upgrading work on these properties and associated facilities. Even worse, there is no compulsion on the providers to even spend the money on improvements of facilities and services. The requirements of nursing homes to pass a minimum building quality inspection to allow them to charge entrance fees is also one that has its pitfalls. It is possible that homes most in need of an upgrade and which would be supposed to be benefiting from this plan by the minister will in fact be unable to accept the income stream that is alleged to have flowed to facilitate the upgrade. The department has estimated that this problem applies to about 35 per cent of nursing homes-a third at least-and I have no doubt that many others will fall into this category. I now tum to the protection of the aged person's accommodation bond. Are we going to insist that their money be lodged with an aged care equivalent of a rental bond board? I very much doubt it. What will then happen is that although the homes are permitted to access only $13,000 of the accommodation bond there is going to be a massive and unacceptable fraud perpetrated throughout Australia on our aged community. A letter in the Daily Telegraph of 25 February by Mrs Aileen Pereira says in part: The government is asking elderly people to put up 'part of their life savings' as a 'bond' or 'interest free loan' to the nursing home proprietors on entry to invest at whatever interest rate they can get until they use it to upgrade or improve the capital value of their investment. For this the elderly lender will not receive any interest, not even the 4% deeming rate available in a pensioner bank account. They are also required to pay $2600 per year out of this donation over and above the usual fees for five years or until they leave, at which time the balance is returned to the estate. Depending on the nursing home's number of beds, after a number of years the nursing home people could be looking after a tidy sum of the patients' money. That point has been clearly spelt out in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of last Saturday by Adele Horin who, in respect of this question, said: We face the prospect of some private homes, including ones that are in good physical condition, being flush with funds. For example, a 100-bed facility, charging an $80,000 fee could earn about $600,000 a year in interest. It would be under no legal obligation to do one iota of improvements if it meets basic standards. Aged people have always been the most vulnerable. There must be real prudential arrangements and protections put in place before the first payment is extracted from an aged person. Let me briefly comment on another aspect of this problem of aged care that is clearly going to be affected by the implementation of the government's policyand I have referred to it briefly; that of palliative care. Many people choose to either not enter nursing homes or not have their partners placed in nursing homes when they become very ill. These people choose to give palliative care at home, with government assistance. This must be taking some of the strain off the already crowded nursing home system. I was appalled to read a media report from the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, Dr Andrew Refshauge, on 26 February on this important issue. Dr Refshauge has been forced to draw attention to the federal government's cut in the funds to the states in this area of aged and health care. He pointed out that the services at risk were seven-day a week, 24-hour a day community based palliative care services, palliative medical training and palliative care services in rural areas. Any reduction in funding for this type of service is going to mean that more and more people will need the service of nursing homes. Has the government thought of all its aged and health care policies in a global manner? I suspect it has not; and cabinet should call for an immediate review of these types of issues. If cabinet will not do it, perhaps when there is enough push from the people, as happened with the Austudy issue, the same nervous backbench coalition MPs will join with us for a review in this area. And not before time. It is quite incredible that in this whole debate that has occurred from the budget to now, the government was unaware of its costings. Only now, by the introduction of the aged care income testing bill, can it begin to try to get the needed information to actually implement its main policy thrust. I support the view that the introduction of the daily fees will ultimately lead to the creation of a first and third class system of nursing home care. Nursing homes are much more likely to take those who can afford to pay the daily rate and continue to pay it as it increases, as it surely will. I quote again from Mrs Pereira's letter: When this budget was brought down we were promised the elderly would feel hardly any effects. Yet we have seen: high cuts to dental care; increased charges for prescriptions; low bank interest rates on savings; higher bank charges where savings of the elderly are funding lower home mortgage rates and assisting bank profits; and now they fund the nursing home industry interest free. Once again I will refer to the article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Adele Horin. She opens her article with these remarks: When the Coalition promised before the last election a better deal for nursing home residents, few dreamed it meant the residents themselves would have to foot the bill for higher standards. Few twigged the frail old would have to sell their homes to provide the capital for nursing home improvements while the Government would save itself $560 million over four years. Of course, in any debate of this nature we put our views as forcefully as we possibly can in support of the position we are taking. But I would like to conclude my remarks by briefly referring to a fax I received from Ellen Long, one of the leaders of a senior citizen organisation in my electorate of Greenway. I asked her to give me some of her views on this particular piece of legislation. She has given me a fairly lengthy document and has used fairly strong language, but I will simply paraphrase some of the points she is making. The views I now put are not mine but hers. She has been speaking to a large number of senior citizens, and she states: The most alarming conversations took place between myself and many senior couples about this problem of future care and the family home. Of thirty couples that I spoke to eight ... If I could put it this way: eight 'would rather be dead than separated'. with one partner being homeless. The other point made by Mrs Long was: Early immigrants are considering the move back to their home country where governments have a kinder more caring attitude to the aging process. A further point she makes is that some: ... non home owners expressed much alarm at the prospect of living in a place that carries first second class passengers. First class persons would receive first class all the way, and they, the unskilledthe term she usedwould be fed leftovers to eat, live in sub standard rooms with institutional decor. Finally, she makes this appeal: If our government is serious about meeting the needs of our seniors, perhaps they need to look and listen in our less affluent areas of Australia. I strongly make the point that there is a need for this government to look at and listen to those groups of people, being referred to in this statement, who reside in our less affluent areas of Australia. Mrs Long continues: Many senior organisations are out there, a simple questionnaire could easily be put in place. I therefore support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Jagajaga. While on this occasion we may not have the numbers to carry the amendment, I believe that those out there in the electorate will take a strong and favourable interest in what we have said on this issue.",64
173,Mr VAILE,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"The point the Labor Party seems to be missing in this evening's entire debate, of which the Aged Care Income Testing Bill now before us is a part, is that the reason for income testing and means testing is to ensure that the needy in the community do get the service which is provided to them by the Commonwealth. That is what this is all about. It is to ensure there is no abuse of taxpayer funded services by the middle or upper classes in this country. This is exactly what the Labor Party was concerned about when it was arguing in favour of the assets test applying to pensioner applicants of over 70 years of age. Going back to those days, the Labor Party argued: why should the former Prime Minister Sir William MCMahon get paid a pension? Indeed, why should he? And, similarly, why should Kerry Packer be able to enter a nursing home for free? That is the salient point in this debate, and the Labor Party has rather lost the plot a little in that regard. It was the Labor Party that introduced these measures into hostels. Also, it was the Labor Party that was planning to and extend these measures into nursing homes, because the report it commissioned and paid for from Professor Gregory indicated that all was not well in aged care services in Australia. Before I go any further, I will refute a couple of the comments that have been made by the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I note the odd part (1) of her amendment which reads that the House: ... deplores the government's decision to charge a daily fee for nursing home residents which will ultimately lead to the creation of an 'economy, business and first class' system of nursing home care ... Obviously, the member for Jagajaga has not taken the opportunity to go along and talk to many of the operators and community based organisations that provide and have established nursing homes and nursing home care throughout Australia, because their total focus is on providing the best care possible to all residents of their nursing homes. They are not likely to embark on what is being alleged by the member for Jagajaga. The government obviously will vote against that amendment, and refute the allegations being made by the member for Jagajaga in her amendments. A couple of other comments were made by the member for Jagajaga in her contribution to this debate, the first of which was with regard to direct deduction from pension payments. She suggested that the deduction of fees from pension payments by the Department of Social Security could provide administrative efficiencies. However, under the provisions of social security legislation pensions are inalienable, and direct deductions of income tested fees are therefore precluded. Resident fees will necessarily be affordable since they are based on an income test. The variable fees system in hostels already demonstrates the capacity of providers to manage the administration involved in the collection of varying amounts from individual residents, and the administration skills required by the new system will be similar. In discussions with consumer representatives, the government has been advised of their outright rejection of this proposal. In consultation, that has been canvassed, and it has been rejected by consumer representatives. The other issue about which the member for Jagajaga seemed a little confused was residential charges and marginal tax rates. She referred to 'an effective marginal tax rate of around 94 per cent'. It is a ridiculous suggestion that it is a tax; it is a residential charge. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you or I, travelling around the countryside, go and stay in a motel and get sustenance, we pay for it. If someone is staying and being cared for in a nursing home, they pay for it, it is a residential charge. So residential charges are not taxes. The shadow minister should not be alarmist. It is the phraseology she has used. The Labor Party has a tendency to do this: to use different phraseology, different words, to try to stir up concern amongst the community. That is what I think the shadow minister has been doing here in calling that residential charge a tax. People in residential care pay for their living expenses, just as do people in the community. This is only fair. People in the community who are able to pay their own living expenses do not expect Australian taxpayers to support them. They do not imagine that, when they buy their food at a supermarket or pay for their housing, it is somehow a tax any more than the money which nursing home residents pay towards their board and accommodation is a tax. Their residential charges are accommodation fees. If you accept the erroneous proposition that nursing home residents' living expenses are a tax, you then arrive at the high effective marginal tax rate that the shadow minister was talking about. You would get the same result if you added rent, mortgage payments or food bills to calculate the effective marginal tax rates of people in the community. Again, this is an alarmist tactic being used by the Labor Party in this whole debate, just as they did when they scurried out of this place after the budget last year and frightened the living daylights out of all those senior citizens in the community who will face at some stage in the not too distant future the prospect of having to enter a nursing home. The Labor Party conjured up the prospect of those people having to sell their houses and the prospect of their partners being left with nowhere to live-it was just ridiculous! Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, not much more than 12 months ago-I am sure this happened in your electorate as it did in mine-in the last federal election campaign the Labor Party got up to the absolutely outrageous practice of sending senior citizens, particularly pensioners, completely false Telstra accounts: 'This is what is going to happen to you with the sale of Telstra.' These false accounts, the ones that were distributed in my electorate, were printed by one of the unions in the Hunter Valley. That is the sort of nonsense that the Labor Party gets up to. It is not straight, it is not fair dinkum and it is not honest with the people of Australia. This went on for many years while the Labor Party was in power in this country. It tried to continue it during that election campaign with those outrageously high and false Telstra accounts. But all it did was scare the senior citizens in our community. And that is all that is happening in this debate on this reform package: the Labor Party is trying to frighten the senior citizens and the aged people in our community. The fact is that the Labor government has left us with an enormous problem to sort out in this country. To its credit, the coalition government is sticking to that task and making some hard decisions. The people of Australia accept that there are hard decisions. They also accept the fact that this government was elected to make those decisions. The Australian people wanted a government that was prepared to govern for future generations, not just for today and not just for its own benefit. That is basically what this is all about. I referred earlier to the Labor funded Gregory review. From that review I will quote from the section headed 'The Condition of Nursing Home Stock': The first report concluded that the current system of nursing home funding does not seem to provide sufficient incentive for the maintenance of the quality of nursing home buildings and the replenishment of nursing home capital stock over time. The lack of incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock is a result of the funding system, under which nursing homes receive a set amount for each resident, based on resident frailty, which is the same regardless of the age or condition of the building. There is no depreciation element included in the funding to provide for the replacement of buildings and, even if there were, there would be no incentive for homes to spend this money on rebuilding. There is also close to 100% occupancy which leaves little opportunity to additional residents and thus income by improving building qUality. The survey also recorded the number of people in each room of the nursing homes. The results have been set out in a table. It continues: ... 12% of residents are in rooms with 5 or more beds, with 6%, 3,600 people across all nonGovernment homes, being in rooms with 6 or more beds. While there is no absolute standard as to how many nursing home residents should share a room, most people would regard having this many people in a room as unacceptable. A further 39% of residents are in rooms with three or four beds which would be seen by many people as undesirable. At that stage of the review, the Labor government did not like what it was hearing from Professor Gregory: like the overall health system in this country, the area of funding for nursing homes was heading towards disaster. In my part of Australia, in my electorate on the mid north coast of New South Wales, we have been in a crisis situation for years in the provision of nursing home beds. There is always a waiting list. We always have problems with people who, having gone through the aged care assessment team and been assessed as needing nursing home care, then have to be shuffled off to Newcastle and Sydney. They might be in nursing home care there for six or 12 months, waiting for a bed to become available in the local area so that they can come back and be domiciled in the local area near their loved ones. If you have been involved in a circumstance such as that, with a close relative who may be infirm having to stay away at that stage of their lives, you will know that it is not very nice. The government is genuinely trying to address a very serious issue which is not going to go away, which we cannot ignore and which really does need some major attention. It is interesting to note some of the comments that have been made along the way since August last year when this package was announced in the budget. I will quote from a few of the comments made by people who should know and understand some of the problems that lie ahead as far as strategic planning in this area is concerned. Maureen attract Lister from Aged Care Australia-an organisation which represents the church, charity and community group sector and provides most of the hostels and about 45 per cent of all nursing home beds-said: Certainly for the majority of pensioners there will be no requirement for them to pay an accommodation bond at all, and entry to an aged care facility will be based entirely on the care need. That is what this is all about. It is not about focusing on beds and funding beds and physical infrastructure; it is about the need of the aged citizens in our community when they are assessed as needing nursing homes care. We want to fund the need rather than the bed. Maureen Lister went on to say: We've had entry contributions in the hostel system for some ten yearsremember, introduced by Laborand I don't believe that residents of hostels would ever say that there's been any discrimination against their admission on the basis of the amount of assets that they've had. That debunks the argument that the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, has proposed in her amendment to this bill. Maureen Lister went on to say: We will be able to see quite significant improvements in the buildings of nursing homes, and everyone knows that that's gravely needed. In another quote, the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd commented: Overall the new aged care legislation delivers incentives for aged care service providers to strive for continuous improvement in care standards and upgrade accommodation standards. The National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals commented: The Aged Care Structural Reforms guarantee a better system of residential care under an accredita- way. tion and quality assurance system that will allow for vast improvements in aged care under a spirit of competition. No such competition or incentive to better accommodation prevails under the existing arrangements. Probably the most interesting comment in this debate since the budget last year came from the former Keating minister, Gary Johns, who admitted that the coalition's reform makes sense and that it is an entirely fair policy. His endorsement was, again, a rebuttal of the arguments that have been put forward since the budget last year by the shadow minister. In fact, it was from Gary Johns's letter to the editor of the Australian 'Fair deal on nursing home payment' that I quoted earlier in my address when I referred to the debate that took place when the Hawke government wanted to introduce an assets test on pension applicants over the age of 70 years. I will quote again from Gary Johns letter to the editor of the Australian in supporting the coalition's aged care reform package. He said: ... the Hawke government's imposition in 1983-84 of the assets test on over-70 pensioner applicants. But the principle is the same: just as Labor argued that former prime minister Sir William MCMahon should not get a pension, why should Kerry Packer be able to enter a nursing home for free? Why indeed? That is basically what this is all about. Is the Labor Party arguing that, were Kerry Packer to go into a nursing home, the taxpayers of Australia pay for it? Is that what the Labor Party is arguing? Maybe the member for Jagajaga should comment on that particular point. I hope, in my contribution to this debate tonight, that I have made it a little bit clearer-as I have been doing in my electorate, because of the scaremongering of the Labor Party-to people in my electorate exactly how the system is proposed to work and how fair it really will be. When you quietly and sensibly explain that to people, they readily accept that there is no opportunity for a free ride on the back of the taxpayer in this country, that there should not be middle-class welfare in this country, and that people who have means to pay their way-and Australians are reasonable people-do expect to pay their They expect, if they are down on their luck and things are not going so well, that some of their mates might give them a hand. We are not opposing that. That will be provided. That is what the means test and the income test is all about. This is a very fair package as far as that is concerned, even though it might be complicated. Australians are very conservative when it comes to change. This is a lot of change and it is going to take time for them to get to understand exactly how this is going. But when it is explained to people, they accept that it is very fair. In the moments remaining, I want to talk about a situation that arose in my electorate under the former Labor administration with regard to getting nursing home beds in my area. What happened to these beds is still the great mystery of one part of my electoratethey seemed to disappear into the ether. On 1 July 1994, the chairman of the board of directors of the Lower North Coast Area Health Service wrote to me on behalf of his organisation and the broader community generally. He stated: Our Board of Directors are concerned with the shortfall of nursing home and hostel beds in our local District when compared to the Commonwealth Department of Health formula. They provided a table which showed that the area health service was 45 nursing home beds short, according to the Commonwealth formula, and 164 hostel beds short. He went on to say: It should be noted that in relation to this last figure, account has not been taken of the proposed 60 bed hostel at Forsterwhich has subsequently been completed by Baptist Community Services in July 1994. The Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health advertised that recurrent funding was available for the provision of new and additional hostel, nursing home and community care services. Target areas publist. - d included a nursing home priority for the Great Lakes area. Bear in mind that this was three years ago. The advertisement indicated that there was a need for an allocation of 30 nursing home beds in the Great Lakes area. Two organisations from that area, both of which had established infrastructure-Great Lakes Aged and Invalid Care Association and also the Baptist organisation-applied for those 30 nursing home beds. The Baptist organisation has a brand new hostel facility which is called Kularoo Gardens, which is bigger than the other facility. It also has facilities and infrastructure to accommodate the nursing home beds that the Commonwealth Department of Health advertised for back then. The closing date for the applications came and went. I supported both applications because, if the department had been of a mind to allocate the nursing home beds to either of those organisations, it would have been a welcome and needed addition to the services in the area. To the surprise of the entire community, only 20 beds-after 30 were advertised-were allocated to a company based in Inverell in the electorate of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and nowhere near the Great Lakes area in my electorate, and that company had no infrastructure in the Great Lakes area. That seemed extremely strange to us. We had great problems trying to find out what decision making process had taken place within the department and by the then Labor government. We subsequently found out that the Inverell company tried to relocate the nursing home beds to Coffs Harbour-remember, they were allocated to the Great Lakes area-and then tried to relocate them 450 kilometres north of us. When the approval for that relocation was not forthcoming from the department, the 20 nursing home beds disappeared and have not been seen since. I tried to find out where those beds were from the minister of the day, but could not find any information at all. Now, again, there has been an advertisement for 30 nursing home beds in the Great Lakes area by the Department of Health and Family Services. Hopefully, one of those two organisations, which I am sure have applied for those beds, will be allocated them because they are ready to go. They will provide caring aged care for the seniors in the community in the Great Lakes area in my electorate, contrary to what the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister, is alleging is going to happen under our proposed aged care reform of having three different classes of aged care in Australia. It won't happen. (Time expired)",68
174,Mr ANDREN,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"The Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997 is designed to establish an administrative prothe cedure to support the implementation of the income testing arrangements that are part of the reforms for aged care announced in the last budget. At the outset, let me say that I have had few problems with the thrust of the changes which the government has in mind. With an aged population above the age of 60 expected to be about a quarter of the national population by the year 2020, it is obvious we cannot have an open-ended public provision of aged care facilities, despite the fact that a vast majority of people have paid their taxes all their lives and may well ask why they should not enjoy a totally or substantially publicly subsidised aged care accommodation; but we cannot afford it. I see the nursing home fee reform that will be assessed through this preliminary bill as a way of restoring the sadly declining nursing home infrastructure in this country, especially in smaller communities where the client can stay within his or her community, where aged care staff can remain and the aged person does not need to travel away from their local district. I hope that is one of the results of this new approach. I note the value of aged care accommodation bonds will not be classed as deem able financial assets for the purpose of income testing, while at the other end of the scale those who cannot afford to contribute over and above the basic fee will not be asked to do so. Every residential care facility will be required to set aside a minimum number of places for those who cannot pay, while current occupants of a nursing home will not be asked to pay a bond in respect of that nursing home. These are welcome. I applaud these assurances within the proposed aged care legislation that will follow this income testing bill, as I do the government's undertaking to put in place prudential arrangements to ensure accommodation bonds are protected. I applaud, too, the setting up of the Aged Care Standards Agency, to come into effect from 1 January next year, which will monitor the resident charging practices in the industry. That is only just when we are dealing with the savings and assets of the frail aged who are anxious enough about their circumstances and situation. My major concern is just what, if any, cap is placed on the size of entry fees to nursing homes. At the moment, looking at the draft bill, there are no provisions for any cap and, as ii stands, a nursing home could charge whatever are the client's assets, less the 2Y2 times the basic aged pension entitlement, currently about $22,500, leaving the accommodation bond open ended. That is the way I am reading it. In fact, the minister's office has confirmed this. There is no cap as such, I am told. It is more of a reverse cap in that the users must be left with at least 2'h times the pension. That is all very well, but I certainly do regard that as a sufficient cap. Surely we do not expect the well off to donate all their assets to their nursing home to invest on behalf of that business because at the moment the bonds appear to be that open ended. There must be a cap and a scaling of bonds depending on means and the absolute assurance that the financially disadvantaged have the same access and level of service as any other client. In other words, there must be absolute and firm regulation of this industry, otherwise it will exploit. The facts are clear, though: the nursing home industry is in a state of infrastructure crisis. The Gregory report highlighted the parlous state of the industry when it pointed out that 75 per cent of homes need fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards, 70 per cent of homes need fixing or rebuilding to meet Commonwealth standards, 13 per cent do not meet fire standards, and 39 per cent of residents are in rooms with four or more beds. As well, the report identified poor wheelchair and frame access, no grab rails, inadequate ramps, multi-storey buildings without lifts and insufficient heating or cooling. The government is right when it says it has inherited a time bomb because, like it or not, the aged care industry is the major growth industry facing Australia in the next 20 years or so. We are not in a position to meet the demand unless we access more funding. It would be great if our government-and that before-was bold· enough to tackle the big issue, that is, taxation, for there could be ample revenue from what is now avoided tax to fund a large proportion of this aged care infrastructure. There is also a responsibility, for those who can, to pay for what at the end of the day amounts to their accommodation and health care-something those of us who are able must do at other stages of our life. I am sure an open-ended bond system is not the intention of government because no elderly person would accept such an openended fee. There must be a cap and I presume that will be detailed in the so called 'users' rights principles' still to be released by the minister. I am told the users' rights principles not will be tabled some time before the budget and circulated for discussion. I believe these principles should have been made available with the draft aged care bill and that draft bill should have been made available long before submissions on it were due to close, because the users' rights are essential to understanding what the government's aged care bill and in fact its whole aged care strategy is all about. This reform appears to have been rushed through rather than there having been the wide consultation the minister suggests has occurred because, as I said earlier, there are big grey areas that are causing concern to not only the aged but to aged care providers and their families. The opposition has been labouring this point for many months and has been accused of scaremongering. But, until the users rights principles are detailed, no-one can be comfortable with either the aged care income assessment procedures or the draft Aged Care Bill because they are both asking the frail aged to take the government on trust. If elderly people will not accept an open-ended charging scheme, and they will not, then the scenario painted by the Central West Aged Care Assessment Team that I met recentlythe Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has a copy of the document-will become a reality. This team, made up of aged care professionals, tells me that old people will dig their heels in and refuse to take up accommodation bonds. The home and community care system will be unable to cope and we will have, potentially, an unholy disaster in aged care in this country if we not careful. At the moment we are, however, debating a bill for aged care income testing to lay the groundwork for the government's users who can pay for aged care reforms. This biIl will enable the Department of Social Security to have the necessary lead time to assess the income and assets of existing clients of the nursing home system. I only wish there had been sufficient lead time for the aged themselves to absorb the ramifications of the changes these reforms will have on them. From the August budget or a bit before to now is not long enough. This is a period of anxiety for the aged in care facilities and those others who might soon be looking at the prospect of entering a nursing home. They are being assessed for payments they know little about. There is an understanding that the users pay principle should be applied to aged care if possible. Most Australians do not have problems with the concepts of equity and fairness. I only wish the kind of backup planned after the introduction of this and the subsequent aged care legislation had been in place before the bills were introduced. I referred earlier to what I see as a lack of consultation and information with the aged care industry in my electorate and, I believe, elsewhere in regional New South Wales at least. I had discussions with the minister over this issue after a recent grievance debate contribution I made on the matter. I pointed out that copies of the aged care draft had not arrived on my desk and certainly were not available to aged care providers or assessment teams in the central west of New South Wales until days before submissions were due and only after I had chased up several scarce copies. The minister did apologise for this and agreed to receive a late submission from the Central West Assessment Team on several aspects of the Aged Care Bill-and for that I am grateful; I notice that the minister is in the House and I thank her for that courtesyincluding these income testing arrangements. Let me list some of the concerns from the Central West Home and Community Care Forum. It points out that clients who may are have the financial resources to pay an entry contribution may actually decline placement after the assessment of their liability under the provisions of the aged care income testing legislation. If they refuse entry because they feel they do not wish to contribute to their care in such a fashion, not only will they place further pressure on already stretched home and community care services but, with dementia care counselling also being shifted under the wing of home and community care, those resources are likely to be stretched even further. I am told HACC providers are frequently confronted with very at-risk clients who refuse residential placement and the payment of an entry contribution will exacerbate this problem. I hope the Standards Agency will indeed monitor those other areas of concern that have been outlined to me and the minister from the Central West Aged Care Assessment Team such as the availability of the same standards of care and accommodation for all, be they the top contributors or the pensioners onlythe sorts of occupants with no bond. Also I am told that there is concern about those who are not aged but have to access nursing home accommodation because of early middle age dementia or physical or mental handicaps and so on. There must be a temptation for the provision of deluxe care for the higher contributors, and I would want this area to be closely monitored. I am also aware that the Uniting Church is on the record as dismissing the government's estimate that the average accommodation bond will be about $26,000. Some reports suggest the average could climb as high as $80,000. This is interest-free money, we must remember, a long-term loan which will generate income for the holderthe aged care provider-so we must be sure the money is used for the improvement of those aged care facilities. It is not good enough to simply allow the size of the entry contribution to be negotiated between the resident and the proprietor. At a time when the aged care assessment team have recommended the nursing home option, we must not have in place a system that allows for protracted haggling over entry contributions when the would be client is under enormous stress because of the move from the community to the institution. The bond, or contribution, must be set beforehand according to a fair formula. It must not be a leverage for the nursing home company to extract maximum investment opportunities from individuals on a case by case basis. The draw down of $2,600 a year for five years is not the point and nor is the return, without interest, of the unused entry contribution to the person or their family. It is the level of contribution and how it is used that concerns me. One other area of aged care that also concerns me both with regard to this bill and with regard to the Aged Care Bill to follow is the situation regarding occupants of nursing home type beds in smaller country hospitals. Will there be any requirement for aged occupants of these facilities to pay more than the current 85 per cent of their pensions? What about the aged care nursing home type patients in the Molong, Cudal, Canowindra and Eugowra hospitals? These are not multipurpose services and thus are not categorised as nursing homes. While multipurpose service programs have got under way in some towns, it seems this nursing home status for most smaller hospitals is a long way off. I understand the federal government has called a halt to the program because of concerns in country communities that they are about to lose possession of their aged hostel assets. In parts of New South Wales, the NPS system-which I believe, if properly managed, could very well be the answer to aged care in small communities-is being looked at with hostility because there is a feeling that the state government wants to grab community owned assets and moneys and force hostels into amalgamation with rural hospitals. The federal government must speed up the establishment of mUltipurpose centres but must insist, as a prerequisite to any subsidy, that those local assets remain in some form of community control. Having said that, the existing public hospital de facto nursing home system could wel1 be swamped by old people lining up to get into this alternative nursing home system if people refuse to pay the increased fees or bonds. State governments can legitimately ask whether, until a federalstate community multipurpose service is in place, they will be required to take on a greater aged care responsibility. Will there be a cost shift from federal to state in this area without any form of capital back-up from the federal government? The accommodation bonds and increased fee structure could be a win-win for the standard of aged care in smal1er communities and the economic stimulus health care offers such communities. It could also be a win for the clients who can remain in their communities. But the reforms to aged care must embrace those smaller de facto nursing homes in country hospitals or they will not be able to cope. The provisions of this specific enabling legislation are fair and adequate as far as they go. But the process of income assessment will begin for existing nursing home patients long before the details of the government's aged care reforms have really filtered down to that aged community. There are dangers ahead in this reform program for the government, and I urge the minister to careful1y read the concerns of aged care providers and the elderly in country and regional areas because they feel they have had less than adequate input. The opposition amendment leaves the inadequate existing system as it is. There is a crisis in nursing home accommodation and care in this country. There is already an economy, business and first-class system in place, as alluded to in that amendment. We have to try and even out those inequalities and we need money to do it. Unfortunately, we are asking the aged to contribute in varying degrees which, in many cases, will see their assets cashed up to provide this care and accommodation. As the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) pointed out in an earlier speech, if she had to relocate from Adelaide to Melbourne she would have to sell up and refinance her new position. The real issue facing this government is the problem I pointed out yesterday in reference to the superannuation surcharge. This income testing bill is part reform but also part of the grab for more revenue. In effect, it becomes a tax like the super surcharge-a tax on the elderly who have paid taxes all their lives and who never expected to be slugged so hard towards the end. But, as I said, most understand that and will also accept a 'users who can pay' principle with provision for those who cannot. My message to the government is: you have broken your promise of no new taxes. Why do you not do the job properly now, break the big promise and undertake a total review of tax in this country? Let us look at wholesale sales tax and value added consumption tax, but especially a tax on those areas now taxed so slightly that it is a joke. Everybody out there who is regarded as a battler by this government, and by the opposition, knows it is a joke, because while people of means are escaping their tax dues in this country-and out of this country, in fact-the retired are being asked to make sacrifices, as they will, when the revenue missed from tax could fund the aged care system on a more subsidised basis than our current tax take allows. But that is not going to happen, I do not believe-in the short term, anyway. Meantime, our nursing homes are run down, in need of an urgent injection of funds that government cannot or will not find because of an obsession with the deficit black hole and its spinelessness on tax reform. On balance, I will be supporting the government's aged care bills-both this and the one for accommodations bonds-because I believe they will maintain the viability of the aged care delivery to rural communities, particularly, provided community hostel assets do remain locally owned, provided multipurpose services are established, provided there are caps on bonds, provided the income assessment of the aged is handled with sensitivity and provided there is more consultation with aged care deliverers and the aged in my electorate. I reserve the right, if I see this system as causing distress over the next few weeks, to lobby members of the Senate to amend this bill and the Aged Care Bill that will follow. I would prefer the government to delay these reforms of aged care to allow longer consultation, but that is not likely. With all those many reservations I have outlined, I support this legislation at this stage. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (7.12 p.m.)-I rise tonight in support of the Aged Care Income Testing Bill and to congratulate the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) on a job well done. She has worked exceptionally hard, in very difficult circumstances, to deliver in a negative fiscal environment. We have Henny Penny the-sky-isfalling-down Macklin trying to scaremonger to the people point of order. Ms Macklin should be referred to as the member for Jagajaga.",72
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Mr Andrew)The member for Chifley does make a valid point of order. The member for Lindsay does have an obligation understanding orders to refer to the member for J agajaga as the member for Jagajaga. Miss JACKIE KELLY-The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), the shadow minister for aged care, keeps scaring the people that she should be looking after. She keeps attacking a bill which was made in exceptionally difficult and tight fiscal circumstances and accepts no responsibility for her government's actions in bringing us to this state. What I say today will be short, because I know that I will be given a further opportunity in this House to discuss the actual substantive bill. Let us be clear that this is only the income testing bill, which shows the vision of the minister. We are putting this into place now so that in June-July, when the substantive bill comes into effect, things flow smoothly. Residents will already be aware of who is going to be affected and who will fall into that 30 to 35 per cent of people who cannot afford to pay and will not be asked to pay. It is reasonable, in this era of high unemployment, when we have a health system which is falling down around our ears, when we are short on education, with a $10 billion hole to pay back, that we ask the aged to contribute to their maintenance. It is predicted that, by the year 2030, 19 per cent of our population will be over 65. That is the equivalent of four million Australians currently in Australia. Think about there being four million Australians over 65 in Australia today. There are only eight million people who are employed and paying tax. That is an incredible burden for my generation to bear when it comes to the year 2030. We do not want a situation where the gulf between the generations widens and the younger generations see the aged as a burden. We are simply extending to nursing homes the policy that the Labor Party introduced to the hostels. The other scaremongering going on is that people are saying it will cost up to $80,000 to enter a nursing home. If you want to pay that much for a nursing home, you will get gold-plated taps, jacuzzis and shag pile carpet. But not all of us wish to live in that standard of accommodation. Given share market forces, we estimate, quite realistically, nation. that the prices will be around $26,000, which is about what they are paying for hostels at the moment. Again, it is Labor's misinformation which keeps this issue alive, and it is upsetting numerous aged people in my electorate. When I speak to them, they say, 'Oh, is that what it means? That's fair.' This bill is about identifying people early on by allowing the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health and Family Services to crosscheck their references to come up with incomes that will crystallise the identification of those who will be asked to make some contribution towards their care. After wages, mortgage, the cost of food, utilities and tax have been taken from the people of Lindsay, by and large they are left with very little more than six per cent in disposable income. Heaven help them if they also want to run a car, pay school fees and other essentials that go with the period of life prior to age 65. We are simply asking the aged to make contributions to those assets when they are in an environment where their utilities, tax, mortgage and food are taken care of and they have absolutely nothing to worry about for the remainder of their days. One of their biggest concerns will be who their neighbour is at lunch. The other important thing-and I will get to this when we come to the substantive bill-is the burden placed on young people who will have to work in aged care homes. Prior to my election to this House, I had never visited a nursing home. When I did, it astounded me to learn of the level of labour required to maintain services to the aged. By the year 2030, when 19 per cent of people will be over 65, a greater proportion of those under 65 will have responsibility for the care and sustenance of those in nursing homes. It is a major problem which is brought about by the dreadful financial difficulties in which we currently find ourselves. It is all very well to say, 'Oh, you're attacking the aged again,' but right across the board we have taken funds from all areas to repair our On 2 March 1996 our nation was at death's door. The lifeblood was bleeding from this country, with high levels of unemployment, huge Commonwealth debt, huge foreign debt and a health system which was overtaxed, with enormous waiting lists. People had no vision of the future for their generation, let alone for their children's generation. We have come into that scenario and, instead of providing aged care absolutely free, as we would love to do, at the gold taps, jacuzzis and shag pile carpet level, we have realised that we as a nation cannot afford it. We must be responsible in these things. I congratulate the minister on having the vision to put this act in place before the substantive bill comes on. It has been meticulously planned. It has been achieved in a very short period-within the space of our entry into government and within the first budget period. The urgency of the problem was obvious, given the fiscal problems we were left with. I congratulate the minister most wholeheartedly on her efforts to date, and I commend the bill to the House.  speaking in opposition to this bill, the Aged Care Income Testing Bill. It comes as a bit of a shock to me to learn that the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) believes that this is a revenue measure, or in some way is going to overcome the government's deficit problem. Mr Deputy Speaker, I need to make an apology at the very beginning of my speech because in my electorate-I am not sure about yours-my constituents have suffered a lot. An amount of $100,000 of their superannuation is going to be ripped from them when they retire. Child-care charges have been upped. Labour market programs have been destroyed. The government has played wedge politics and tried to marginalise Aboriginals and migrants in my electorate. There is no industry policy. As for helping small business to export, they have cut revenue there. Education has been a disaster, and we put much store in my electorate on educating our young. Mr Deputy Speaker, my apology is made because of all the horrible measures done by the government, I find this one the worse. This is a measure done by a ruthless minister in a heartless government. I want to respond to a few things that have been said. Firstly, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the member for Lindsay have said, 'All we are doing is extending Labor's hostel program into nursing homes.' I want to make this qualification. I am not trying to suggest that our scheme was perfect either in relation to hostels or in relation to nursing homes but the minister and the member for Lindsay get up here and say, 'All we are doing is borrowing your system in hostels and applying it to nursing homes.' What a canard! People choose to go into hostels but you cannot get into a nursing home unless you are medically assessed by an aged care assessment team. There has to be an assessment. No member of parliament can use influence to get people into a nursing home unless they are assessed as being required to go into a nursing home. Why wouldn't there be a difference in a system where you choose to go into accommodation compared to one where you have no choice, where you are assessed as requiring the facilities of a nursing home? This is repeated ad nauseam and it is a lie, a bald lie. I am indebted to the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan, because today I got a response to a question I had placed on notice. The first question I asked was: What is the (a) average upfront fee paid by new residents and (b) level of demand or waiting list size for each hostel in each State and Territory owned and operated (i) for profit, (ii) by government and, (iii) by community and religious organisations. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are anticipating a very fulsome answer because what the minister and the member for Lindsay has said is, 'We are just extending the hostel system into nursing homes.' What was the response? It was: Entry contributions are refundable deposits negotiated between resident and the provider. They are private arrangements and for this reason the government does not collect administrative information from them. The government does not collect information on hostel waiting lists which are essentially a private administrative concern of the hostels. If we are transferring this system from hostels to nursing homes, what the minister is clearly indicating is that not only does she have no information about hostels but where is the proposal to collect the information on nursing homes under the new regime? My second question was: Has her Department developed an afford ability index for intending hostel residents; if so, (a) what is it and (b) how was it developed; if not, why not? Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will believe that she, having flunked the first question, will be spot on in the second, but let me read you the answer: The government does not collect information on entry contributions paidthey have not got a clue what the variations areand does not have an affordability index for such contributions because they are private arrangements between the provider and the consumer. So they do not know. That is what they are really saying: they do not know. In hostels, part of the requirement of course is that they provide beds for financially disadvantaged. It is a condition of getting a licence. There are some people who do not pay an up-front fee to go into a hostel. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, just keep on remembering this point: people choose to go into hostels as a more convenient and appropriate living arrangement, whereas nursing homes are compulsory; you get assessed when you go in. The industry knows, if the minister does not know, that all that the government is setting is a minimum requirement for an entry into a nursing home-$26,000. But the industry knows that proprietors, particularly proprietors for profit, the employers of the former Senator Woods, for example-well connected to the Liberal Party---can charge what the going rate is. I am surprised the member for Lindsay did not say, 'Oh, well, of course, if there are two people in a family home, we're going to make sure that they don't have to sell the family house. ' You did not say it. I thought you would have run that argument. Maybe the member for Lindsay understands the situation where one spouse, one partner, of an aged couple-usually grandparents-is faced with the advice from her doctor and from the ACAT team that her partner needs to go into a nursing home and she starts the ring-around and wants to get her partner placed in one and she cannot find one of those free beds, the beds where you do not have to pay an up-front fee. What the proprietors will say is, 'Well, look, I'm sorry, we haven't got one. But, you know, if you're able to pay $30,000 or if you're able to pay $40,000, a bed will be available.' Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you: what would you do in that situation? Would you choose to keep your partner at home, knowing the doctor and the ACAT team have said, 'This person is best pl-ced in a nursing home. That is where they will get the most appropriate care'? What would you do? I think I know, Mr Deputy Speaker: you would sell your house because you care for your loved one and you will put them in the nursing home. That is what this government is doing to the frail aged in our community. The member for Lindsay got one thing right-about the growing numbers of people that will need nursing home care. Even this draconian system may have some justification if we could argue that there would be a provision of extra nursing home places. But under this legislation there is not going to be one extra nursing home bed: not one as a result of this legislation, not one with all the up-front fees that will be collected. I had some recent family experience with nursing homes. You usually cannot get your relative into the nursing home of your choice initially. If you keep on moving that relative, you keep on having to provide up-front fees and if you do not you will not get a place, you will not get them in. The thing that I find absolutely outrageous is that the minister cannot tell us. We know what is going to happen with those nursing home up-front fees, particularly in those nursing homes run for profit: it will go down into the bottom line. They will be collecting the interest on it, drawing down the $2,600 every year for five years. But who is going to pay the income tax? That is not clear. What a double whammy! You have to sell your home, get your partner into a nursing home and pay your up-front fee. The nursing home is being operated for profit, the proprietor pockets the money, improves his bottom line and, of course, you are stuck with paying the tax on the interest earned. I hope that the parliamentary secretary at the table will clear this matter up. Maybe I am wrong. But it is unclear to me and unclear to a lot of others. We have talked tonight about those who either have the financial capability or who are forced to sell the family home. But what about the pensioners like the pensioners I saw on Sunday during Senior Citizens Week? What a lovely present they have. What a lovely present to have this delivered by a government. What does someone in a housing commission home do? Let us say they are a single person and they have been assessed by their GP to go into a nursing home and they have been assessed by the ACA T team as requiring nursing home accommodation. They cannot bribe the proprietors to get a bed; they just do not have the money. I will tell you what is going to happen. Increasingly, we are going to see in Australia our frail aged being put with their families. There will be assessments; they will require a nursing home; there will be no nursing home places; and they are going to stay with a relative. In a goodly percentage of those cases we are going to see an increase, because of this government, in granny abuse by relatives frustrated by their inability to deliver the levels of care required by their relatives staying at home who really need a nursing home bed. We are going to see granny abuse increase on a scale that we have not seen before. If you think I am scaremongering, this is what senior citizens were telling me on Sunday when they were expressing their concern. I note the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) is at the table. Let me tell you something else that I was told on Sunday that absolutely horrified me. It upset me no end. I can understand where they are coming from because, when you get to be of some age, you do not want to be a burden on anyone. You do not want to be a burden on your family or on your neighbours. The one thing you do want in your old age is a degree of dignity. But what one senior citizen said to me on Sunday was that couples now are making suicide pacts because they can see that they are never going to be able to afford a nursing home bed. I think it is a great irony in this parliament, when we have seen the Andrews bill go through the Senate preventing euthanasia, that indeed we have a heartless government and a ruthless minister. Some of the aged people in my electorate and, I am sure, in other electorates are now considering suicide as a way of avoiding the changes to nursing home charges. I think that is an absolute tragedy. The government members love to rubbish our system of nursing home care. As I said to you, I do not particularly defend it. I am always keen to listen and learn and see what we can do to improve things. I accept that some changes need to be made, but under Labor it did not matter whether you were a millionaire, it did not matter whether you were on a fancy salary, and it did not matter whether you were just a pensioner: if you were assessed as requiring nursing home accommodation, in you went straightawayfirst come, first served on a needs basis-no up-front fees and no special favours. We are replacing this with this draconian system that is going to see aged couples forced to sell the family home. No wonder people are calling this an inheritance tax. No wonder people are calling this an early death duties tax. They are going to be forced to sell the family home to get their partner in. There is one other point that I wanted to make-90 per cent of people who are actually in nursing homes do not have a spouse. Their spouses have pre-deceased them. It is quite clear under the legislation that, if your partner has died before you and you are there on your own, you most definitely do have to sell your family home. Of course, overwhelmingly these people are women. Just recently we celebrated International Women's Day and I think lots of us rejoiced at all the progress we have been able to see in this century as we head into the next. But what is this government doing? It is ensuring that those women are going to have to pay varying entry fees, but inevitably will be selling the family home. I am sure they want to leave something for their kids and I am sure they want to leave something to their family. But we are ripping into these women, who are, apart from newborn babies, probably the most vulnerable in our community. No wonder I take such great exception to all the exceptional hurt this government has delivered in my electorate. This is why I take such great exception to these measures. I understand that there are some constitutional questions about the way the government is going about this. There is a suggestion that this up-front fee is in fact a tax. I do not want to quote all of the argument that goes with suggesting that this is a tax, but there are a number of cases-such as Matthews v. Chicory Marketing Board, and General Practitioners Society in Australia and Others v. the Commonwealth of Australia that would establish that this government is imposing a tax. The area of unconstitutionality would be this: if these charges are indeed a tax and the up-front fee is variable but does not relate to the level of care that the individuals are receiving, then this legislation can be thrown out under the constitution. I do not normally say this about legislation, but I would love to see this thrown out by the High Court as unconstitutional, because it is discriminatory. The member for Lindsay says that this is an example of 'share market forces'. I think she meant market forces actually, but I do not think she could have got it more wrong. Proprietors cannot create more beds. They have to be licensed to do so. There is nothing in this legislation that increases the number of available beds. The only way standards of nursing homes can be lifted at the moment is by inspections, and a so-called standards body is to be set up. I for one would say that I would not mind a little competition between nursing homes so there is an incentive to lift standards and so there is an incentive to improve services. I think that might be a healthy thing. I think that is something the parliament needs to look at. But I want to finish on this note: not one extra nursing home bed is created by this legislation, but you are guaranteed that people will have to sell their houses and that there will be more granny abuse. I am horrified by what a constituent said at the weekend that some are considering suicide. (Time expired)",76
176,Dr NELSON,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"I sought service in public life because I had an agenda which had been frustrated by the previous government and which I carried into the presidency of the Australian Medical Association. One item on that agenda was a more logical and sustainable financing system for aged residential care and a vision of where it ought to be 20 years from now. I do not often come into the House to speak on bills with which I do not agree, but I can assure you that I enthusiastically support the Aged Care Income Testing Bill. I say to the  there will come a time when, instead of each of us on the Labor side and on our side, the Liberal side, constantly try to score political points off one another, we just sit back and look at the long-term future and where things are going to go. On 10 February, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) released the exposure draft of the Aged Care Bill. It proposes a restructure of the existing programs funded under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954. It brings us into a new residential care system. As a package, these measures set in place a sustainable system of financing the residential care of frail, older Australians into the next millennium. As age dependency ratios rapidly change and the number of us relying on government support increases, these historic changes also herald a change in cultural expectations. Those who can afford to do so will be required to make a financial contribution towards their own residential care so that the standards under which everybody currently lives may be gradually improved. I just suggest to the member for Chifley and others, in the context of politics, to consider this. At the moment about 13 per cent of us are over the age of 65. By the year 2050, it is estimated by the ABS, about a third of us will be over the age of 65. Eight per cent of us over the age of 75 currently suffer from dementia in the absence of a cure. It is estimated by Professor Bob Officer in the National Commission of Audit report released last year that, over the next 40 years, we will have to spend 10 per cent of this nation's productivity on the health and welfare costs of ageing above and beyond present levels and above and beyond real growth from those levels. At the moment there are 5.3 Australians in this country between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person under the age of 15 and over the age of 64. The age dependency ratio, as it is known, is currently 5.3 to one. It is estimated that over the next 40 years, based on our current and reasonable life exceptions, that ratio will go to 2.6 to one. According to the ABS, last year there were 7.8 million people in Australia who worked and generated income upon which they were taxed. In contrast, there were 6.2 million people in Australia relying on some form of social security-1.2 million of them dependants. Within the next decade, in the absence of changing Australia's cultural expectations, apart from anything else, those trend lines are likely to cross. The previous government introduced some very good and very sensible reforms for hostel care in 1988, the main consequence of which-upon which these proposals are modelled-was a substantial increase in the standards of hostels in which people lived. We are now trying to apply those very same principles to the entire aged residential care industry. This is about vision. It is not very often that that word can be used to describe the things that governments do. It is about having the courage to do what is right and what is not necessarily popular. If I were a political opportunist in opposition, this is the kind of issue that I would to embrace because it is easy to manipulate and frighten people who are vulnerable and scared. It is even easier to frighten people who have lived for 60, 70 or 80 years with a certain expectation and then you start to change the way in which you finance things. I urge those on the other side so vigorously resisting these measures to transcend their own political self-interest. By all means criticise the detail of what we are doing and help us get to where we need to get 20 years from now, but help us and support us in -::.-Iivering a better future for all of us as we age. A vital part of this process is the Aged Care Income Testing BiII, which I will now address. This introduces procedures that will allow existing and intending residents not in receipt of Commonwealth income security payments to have their income assessed. In particular, it necessarily alIows the Secretary to the Department of Health and Family Services to delegate functions related to the determination of ordinary income to the secretaries to the departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. These assessments wilI determine the level of daily contribution that aged people will be required to pay while resident in a Commonwealth approved aged care facility. The assessments will be reviewable on application and subject to review by the AAT. This bilI enables income assessment to be undertaken and advice of that assessment to be provided to operators of residential care facilities. It is a process piece of legislation and will rely on the future passage of the Aged Care Bill, which, of course, we are alI anticipating. Given the circumstances under which elderly people frequently are placed in aged residential care facilities, urgently or semi-urgently the Department of Social Security will be required to expediently and accurately provide income assessments to residential providers. The substantive income testing provisions upon which alterations to charges and subsidies would be based wilI be provided for in the Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997. In love providing for an exchange of information between the Department of Health and Family Services, the DSS and Veterans' Affairs, the ordinary income of residents will be determined in anticipation of the passage of the Aged Care Bill. This bill provides that any personal information exchanged cannot be used for any purpose other than that of income testing. It has been developed in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. The income test to be applied is that which is currently used to determine entitlements to pensions and benefits. As such, those already in receipt of social security or veterans pensions will not have to provide additional information unless their circumstances have changed in some way. In other words, the only people who wilI be affected by this measure are those who are not currently in receipt of a pension, a part pension or a Veterans' Affairs entitlement. Nine per cent of current nursing home and hostel residents are non-pensioners. DSS will undertake assessments for those people to make sure that they are advised of their potential income tested charge as much in advance of 1 July as is possible, hence the necessity of this bill in advance of the Aged Care Bill to provide the prerequisite time for income assessment of non-pensioner residents. The pensions income test has two principal features. The first is the assessment of income. The second is the assessment of a so called free area income. Income includes superannuation, war disability pensions, compensation payments and income from real estate and family trusts. This income is added to the income assumed or deemed by the government to be earned from financial assets. The free area is the amount of income a person can have before their level of income starts to have an effect on fees and pensions. The present free area is $49 a week for a single and $86 a week combined income for a couple. Residents receiving the full pension at 1 July will pay no more than the basic pensioner contribution and pay no further income tested charge. Those on a part pension will pay a slightly higher fee unless they have dependent children. All pensioner residents have the right to decline to have their pension income disclosed to the department. However, if they decline, they will not be entitled to a subsidy rate and will have to pay the full fee, up to a maximum of $60 a day. All self-funded retirees can, if they choose, refuse to supply details of their income to the department. However, if they so decline to provide such information, they will not be entitled to a subsidy and will pay the full fee of up to $60 a day. If a self-funded resident does agree, they will complete a departmental form and may, if they wish, nominate an agent to deal with the department on their behalf. A DSS representative may visit the resident to clarify the information that is provided. At any time the self-funded retiree can ask the department to conduct a new income assessment. Of course, review and appeal rights will apply. DSS will provide a financial inform ation service officer who, for the cost of a local call, can answer queries about any aspect of income testing or provide information on how to get better returns from financial investments. In the area of income testing, it is worth referring to the report of the funding and other implementation issues working group to the Minister for Family Services. The working group comprised representatives of Aged Care Australia, the Alzheimer's Association, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, the ACTU, the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Carers Association of Australia, Community Services Australia, the Council on the Ageing and the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals. The group noted and strongly supported the agreement with the department that entry contributions or accommodation bonds would not be classed as deem able financial assets for the purposes of income testing, a very important point. The Department of Social Security will provide income testing outcomes for individuals, both pensioners and self-funded retirees, to the Department of Health and Family Services, which will set fees. The Department of Health and Family Services will advise residents and facilities of the fees and benefits that are payable. The working group further noted that Department of Social Security assessments for all residents will be appealable to the Department of Social Security and that the income review strategy will be the same as .for the pension generally, using established risk assessment criteria. The group further accepted that the existing DSS separate fee areas for single people and partnered people should be used for the income test for residential care benefits, noting that the existence of income splitting for many couples would outweigh any potential disadvantage arising from application of the married free area. There would be less than 10 per cent of residents for whom an income assessment was not available at the time of entry. The DSS anticipated that income assessments would take a maximum of 28 days, and significantly less in straightforward cases. In terms of trying to deal with Australia's future needs in aged care, yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced a package of $600 million for small business, to try to assist small business. That has a lot to do with this, because the people in this country who create wealth, which is taxed, need to work in an environment where it is easier to create the wealth that we require to spend on those who will be in need of aged and other forms of care. As the member for Chifley and other speakers on the other side have said, this is about changing cultural expectations. It is about making sure that, whoever is in government in the year 2020, we will no longer be in a world, we will have lived through a period-particularly over the last decadewhere Australians have come to expect that government will be able to provide everything for everybody, and preferably at no cost. And no matter how noble that notion may be, it is simply unsustainable. If any of us who have actually spent any time at all in a nursing home-other than visiting one for morning tea and speaking to some of the residents-and have been to a nursing home, particularly late at night or the early hours of the morning-were to ask ourselves, 'Is this a place in which I would like to live, where I would be happy to see my mother live?' most of us, I think you will find, on most occasions would actually answer no. Forty per cent of people who are living in nursing homes at the moment currently live, for example, in a room that houses at least four people. They live in institutions-and Bob Gregory identified this in stage 2 of his review of nursing home funding-on which we have to spend $1 billion today to bring them up to health, fire and outcome standards. The previous government had effectively in its last budget committed $12 million for capital upgrading. What we are doing is honestly recognising as a government that in terms of expenditure we cannot continue to indulge the present generation at the expense of our children by spending more than we earn, by maintaining social infrastructure on debt and asset sales; that we have to responsibly get ourselves into a fiscal consolidation program and fund social infrastructure on surplus, as existed until the time of the Whitlam government. Whilst these things are understandably not popular, and it is not popular to say to a section of those in need of aged residential care that they may have to spend a small amount of their income on their own care or spend a small amount of the money which accrues from their assets on their own care, it is something that is absolutely necessary and needs to be responsibly done. Since 1987 under the previous government, no matter what sort of accommodation you received, a nursing home resident, no matter what their financial status, paid no more than 87Y2 per cent of the age pension and, on face value, that may seem reasonable. But unfortunately standards had fallen because of the non-discriminatory nature of the policy. The previous government had done the right thing in hostel care but, for obvious political reasons, had been reluctant to embrace what is so necessary and was so strongly recommended by Bob Gregory in his review. The government is introducing means tested in accommodation bonds or entry contributions and fees, and each will be paid by those who can afford it. And the moneys raised can be spent only on the upgrading of the facility in which that person resides. It cannot be taken as profit and it certainly cannot be used by government. Nursing homes which still generally look after those with the greatest need have had no capacity whatsoever to charge any entry contribution fee up until now. Those who will be not required to pay an accommodation bond include full or part pensioners who have not owned their own home in the past two years and who have assets under $22,500, for singles. Similarly, those who have a spouse or a partner or a carer or dependent child living in the house will be protected. Whilst it may be smart politics, it is mischievous to go out and say to people that they will have to sell their homes. Under the hostel system that has worked so well that was implemented by the previous government, about 40 per cent of people have not paid accommodation bond at all. And keep in mind that these are the people who have income; these are the people that have substantial assets. We are saying that you will be required to pay a small amount. And that accommodation bond can be taken as a debt against your estate. It can be paid a higher weekly, fortnightly or monthly It may not be paid at all. Importantly, amount of the accommodation bond that is invested will not be taxable. Most of the speakers in this debate been sincere, whilst I disagree with them, I say to the members on the other side, 'Just hose yourselves down for a minute and have a listen to what you are saying.' you are saying is that we have to perpetuate and continue to have a system that provides substandard facilities and care for all Australthere ians, irrespective of their income, so that may continue to have what in many cases are very large, empty, family homes sitting out the suburbs. What we are saying is, 'Look, some of the money that is a part of you will be required--or may be required-to spend on your care, on getting a better for yourself.' It is has just aggrieved me enormously the years to see people who have considerable assets and, in some cases, significant inis come--estimated by Bob Gregory in 1994 to be $238 million a year-sitting in a nursing home bed in a run-down facility, in a fiveor six-bed ward. And then I see a pensioner who has spent the last 20 years of their life before going into that home living in a housing commission flat, with no choice, no income, no capacity to pay whatsoever. And I know that the government cannot afford to look after everybody. So what a responsible and government has to do-any government that is thinking about the future-is bullet. I challenge the Labor Party now: whenever you return to government-and the political cycle will turn-I guarantee you that you will not repeal this measure, if it is implemented. By the time you get into government, everybillion one who lives in an Australian residential care facility will be having a higher standard of any living than they enjoy now and will not accept returning to the past.

177,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"I hope the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) will stay and listen to some reality rather than go on with the pap that we have just been hearing. The hypocrisy that has been as evident from those opposite in this debate is fee. nothing short of absolutely appalling. We the have heard this story about sub-standard nursing homes over and over. Let me tell you about them. In 1983, there was someone in a have nursing home in Newcastle whose husband but was living on dog food because he could not afford to buy food. Why? Because the nursing just home charges were being paid for by the What husband out of his pension-the charges above the person's pension. When we brought in standards of nursing home accommodation was a great hue and cry from the nursthey ing home community-particularly the private for profit ones-about it. I did not then hear in the now government coming in and supporting the need for quality but also recognising that asset the need for a contribution. The impressien people might get from this care debate is that the government is somehow going to generate $130 million a year of extra over money to help upgrade nursing homes and build new beds. That is absolute nonsense. It wrong, false, deceitful and a lie; it is everything one can imagine is dishonest in people's perception of politics. What the government is doing is cutting out half a billion dollars of funding for nursing homes and hostels over the next four years.. That is what this about. To project the idea that somehow or other this whole concept is going to improve nursing homes is absolutely wrong. It is worse than wrong; it is deceitful deceptive. And what it is doing to people is attempting to put forward a picture which bite this they know is false. I have heard speaker after speaker talking about conditions you would not put a dog into. Let me tell you folks: it will get worse a long while before it ever gets any better. The fact is, these figures are shonky. Half a dollars is being cut out of spending over four years-$125 million to $130 million a year. So the $130 million of up-front fees is needed just to stand still. Anything for upgrading and improving will be beyond that. The concept that somehow the $26,000 average will provide new beds is flawed, and we all know that. Because of land and building costs, the cost of a nursing home bed is somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000, depending on where it is-what state and what region. It probably averages $70,000 a bed, to build and put a new bed on the ground. It probably costs $30,000-$40,000 to upgrade a bed. So we are talking about an average fee of $26,000, a draw down capacity of those up-front fees of a maximum of $13,000 and a relatively small number who would not have to pay at all because they have no assets. When you try and work out how an organisation can find the capital to put up $70,000 to build a new bed, out of two and a half thousand dollars per year for five years, it does not exactly work, unless they get a very large amount in up-front fees-well over $100,000. The interest on that money could provide it. Alternatively, you go to the recurcan rent fee structure and look at the extra charging capacity over and above pensions-the one dollar in four for beyond the cut-off rate for pensions. So people on either no pensions or very small part pensions are paying very large amounts of recurrent fees to help service that capital outlay. Every new bed that is produced will require and tie up $70,000 of capital, which will need servicing. And we all know that on the current fee structure there will not be enough surplus of those funds to service that kind of capital. So those opposite who keep telling us that this is about making better nursing homes are blatantly lying, and they know it. As I said, I had a gentleman in 1983 who was buying dog food for himself to live on. When I went through all his affairs, more than half his pension was being paid to a nursing home for his wife. She had been in there for eight years and the fees went up every year, and he was paying it out of his pension. We changed all that. We limited the maximum that nursing homes could charge, but we also put in capital. And it was absolutely wrong and outrageous to hear the needed member for Bradfield talk a moment ago about $12 million for upgrading nursing homes and for him to put down what the last government did. But let me go further, because there are some really interesting stories out there of dishonesty, deceit and breach of faith. It is normal when a new government comes in that they bring in new policies. But it is also normal and required that they maintain existing contracts. I want to read part of a letter from the matron of Maroba Nursing Home in Waratah in Newcastle about a decision by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) regarding a grant to that nursing home. The letter states: I am Director of Nursing of a 79 bed nursing home, owned and operated by Islington Baptist Church, which has enjoyed a fine reputation in the community for over 35 years. The Maroba board has always sought to make improvements to the home, to ensure a high standard can be maintained. I can vouch for that. It continues: In recognising that the needs of Dementia sufferers be quite different to those of the frail aged, the Board investigated the possibility of establishing a purpose built unit to cater to the needs of these individuals. At the time it was believed that the old style floor plan of the existing wards was not conducive to reducing stress levels in the confused elderly person who did not require specific dementia management. Also the Board set on a course of meeting OH&S requirements in every way it possibly could, and ended up with a $1 million project. Needless to say Maroba did not have $1 million sitting in the bank to spend on this development. Assistance was sought from the Federal Government by way of a capital upgrading grant. In 1993 and 1994, Maroba received two capital ° upgrade approvals in principal which totalled about $500,000, for payment over 1 years. Payment of which did not commence until stage 1 of the work was completed in 1995. The capital funding changes announced in the 1996/97 Budget, ruled that additional recurrent funding under the National Health Act would no longer be available to Nursing Homes if they choose to charge entry contributions from July 1997, which immediately affects Maroba. What that means is that the previous government's announced grant of half a million dollars to be paid over 10 years in annual instalments has been withdrawn. Or they cannot charge up-front fees. In other words, the new milch cow, the new source of revenue, for nursing home upgradings and new beds-up-front fees-is not available if the nursing homes keep their grants. That is the most deceitful and disgraceful decision that I have seen in a very long time. An organisation that spends a million dollars on upgrading its facilities based on a half a million dollar grant is then told two years into that grant, 'We've changed our policies. If you want to keep the money you cannot charge up-front fees.' Yet they are out there talking about up-front fees as being the great saviour for the nursing home industry. What hypocrisy, what deceit-and how vicious can you get? I wrote to the minister about this issue back in December and I still have not got an answer. My letter was based on a letter from departmental staff to Maroba which made it absolutely clear that they had a choice-the money or the box; take your grant over 10 years or take up-front fees. The letter of 3 December last year to Mr Taylor from Jane Halton stated: As you correctly point out, recipients of additional recurrent funding under the National Health Act will be required to choose between retaining the subsidy or relinquishing it in favour of entry contributions and recurrent subsidy supplements. Recipients of grants under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act will not be required to relinquish or repay grants. What we have here is that recipients will be required to choose. They already have a contract, in my view. They entered into a building program worth $1 million based on a contract with the government which said that they would give them half a million dollars towards the program payable over 10 years. Two years into it they are told, The rules have been changed. If you keep on with that grant you can't charge up-front fees.' That is what has happened. For the government to go around talking about the quality of nursing homes and the quality of care and saying that you would not put your dog in them is absolutely outrageous. One can go slightly further into this whole question of how this new system is going work-this wonderful new world where suddenly $130 million a year is available that was not available before. Sure, one can argue that there is some merit in those who can contribute towards the cost of their accommodation in these places doing so, but this is not about that. This is not about those who can afford it contributing. This is about saving half a billion dollars in government spending. The member for Bradfield said that we would not rescind it when we come back into government. Why will that be? Because it is locked in. Once spending has been cut, to get half a billion dollars back in one area alone is very difficult. I will tell you what your next trick is going to be. You will probably announce it in the next 12 months. You will announce a new scheme of insurance to prepare for your old age-a retirement insurance package whereby you start paying up now so you can afford a nursing home bed if you need one. Take the chance. If you think you might have dementia in the family, take out a policy and that way you might not lose your family home. That is what you will do next. That is your next stunt. Having created the monster, you will suddenly find an answer to it. That ain't no answer, either. These people do not choose to enter nursing homes. We have all heard that. None of us want to go into a nursing home. None of us want any of our family to, but the fact is that some people have to in the same way as some people have to go into hospital. We heard the quote tonight about Kerry Packer going into a nursing home for free. If he goes into hospital, do you expect him to pay for half the ward as well? No, you do not. The infrastructure is there. The system we had was operated on a recurrent basis and was means tested. Those with high incomes were paying their recurrent funding as they went. The government was providing part of the infrastructure in the same way as taxpayers provide for part of the roads and a whole range of infrastructure. Nursing homes are part of our social infrastructure. Access was on a needs basis, not on a money basis. What this does is completely distort and change our whole notion of social responsibility. What will come next, as I said early, are insurance bonds, insurance schemes. They will say, 'Here you are, Mr and Mrs Jones, when you first marry take out a policy and if either of you ever needs a nursing home it will be okay because this will cover it. If don't, you have wasted the money anyhow.' In other words, this is user pays in advance. The idea that somehow these people have a choice is wrong. We have heard stories about how bad these homes are. Let me tell you: they were a lot worse under coalition governments. We all know that and so does the industry. The fact is that no-one believes this government when it mouths that kind of nonsense. That has been stated over and over again. Certainly from my contacts in the industry that is the case. Let's go to another example, which I think is an interesting one. There is a privately owned nursing home in Newcastle which the owner is in the process of selling. He is entitled to do so; I have no problem with A few weeks ago when I spoke to him about that, 21 people were still looking for placements. A number of those people's families rang me in that period saying that they had rung around all the nursing homes looking for possible locations for their relatives. Some these people had been in that nursing home for quite some years. All the nursing homes have got queues. The letter from Maroba states that it has a queue of 95. It has listed 11 of the people from Learmonth Lodge-the one that is being closed. They all have to look towards the probability that if a bed became available it would be beyond 1 July. Of course, the families are required by every nursing home to essentially state what their circumstances are. They are asked, 'Do you have any money? Do you have any houses? What is the situation?' After 1 July there will be an up-front fee for the next bed they find if they have got more than $22,000. In many cases the family members who are involved are grandchildren. In many cases there are very few left in the family. There may be assets; there may not be. The families without any money are desperately worried, because they believe that it is very likely that they are going to find it very hard. All of the 21 people who are looking for placements are currently nursing home residents. They are all qualified. How are they you going to be chosen for a placement? Which ones will get in first? Given the changed circumstances and the cuts in funding, can we really expect nursing homes want to take into account how much money they have got? The families involved in this are going through agony. Most of the people involved do not even know what is happening. When those beds are sold-I hope they are re-established in Newcastle-the new people coming into them will have to pay up-front fees as well. We have got a nursing home bed which is occupied at the moment. It will be empty after 30 June. The person who had that bed will have gone somewhere else, with an up-front fee. The bed will be located in another facility and the person coming into it that. will have to pay an up-front fee. These are the things that the government is not talking about. It is trying to pretend that this whole exercise will find fresh extra money to help improve the circumstances, which is absolutely wrong. What this is about of is covering up for a shift in our support systems. This country has had' one of the world's best aged support systems, be it in home and community care, community aged care packages, hostels, or nursing homes. On a visit to England in the middle of last year I spoke to a lot of people in the care industry and in government. They were interested to know about our procedures because they saw us as being one of the world's best at what we are doing, even though the integration of our services still has a long way to go. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the House committee's report on home and community care pointed a long way into the future in these directions. It pointed to a shift in assessment processes and the seamlessness between community care and institutional care. We all saw the way it was going and there was effectively bipartisan agreement on a move towards shifting the funding from bricks and mortar to more of a service base. That has been understood for a very long time. We in the industry and in the community sector had understood that and were working that way. No-one anticipated that the government would shift its funding responsibilities by the extent that has been proposed in that last budget. That has absolutely destroyed the improvements to HACC. There have been changes in state and federal government relationships. It will massively undermine the community sector's preparedness to invest in nursing home care. Quite frankly, these charities cannot afford it; they do not have money. This to them is a caring responsibility, not a financial one. So we are going to see a great shift in the infrastructure provisions. At some later stage the government will say, 'It wasn't our fault. We had to be responsible. We had to look at consolidation. We did not want to pass on debts to our children.' Instead, we will pass on people living in their homes who should not be there, who cannot and are not being supported. The cost to our children and our children's children of these kinds of measures will be horrendous, but most of all the cost to us as a society will be great. You judge a society by how they care for their young and how they care for their old. We were well thought of once. What this government has done is introduce a new paradigm. We no longer care for our old; they care for themselves-God knows how-in some way. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not doubt that in the months ahead you and your colleagues will be talking about nursing home insurance policies to help make sure that when you get old enough you do not need to sell the home.

178,Mr WILTON,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Being the last in what has been a rather lengthy list of opposition speakers on the Aged Care Income Testing Bill, all of whom have both comprehensively and cogently put the case of those on this side, affords me the opportunity-albeit it somewhat briefly-to overview the opposition's case on this matter. It is certainly not my intention in that regard to be anything less than brief. This bill is inextricably entwined with the Aged Care Bill, which will be introduced into this place in the foreseeable future. It goes without saying that those on this side of the House are very supportive of any initiatives and proposals to upgrade nursing homes and to eliminate the sorts of problems that have been highlighted by a number of notable academics and industry representatives of the ilk, for example, of Professor Bob Gregory. The former Labor government had a fairly lengthy and cherished history of ongoing improvement and reform in the area of nursthe ing homes and aged care. We consider this particular bill to be a most inappropriate way of continuing the reform process. It is inappropriate because, in my view, both of the related bills will have seriously adverse impacts on older Australians who need nursing home care and the sort of attention that those in their stage of life require. These bills will also have devastating consequences on the way in which aged care is serviced and delivered throughout our society and across this country. These adverse consequences are totally out of any context or proportion with any positives which may be construed as being derived from either of these bills. I will discuss very briefly a couple of the premises on which our opposition to the Aged Care Income Testing Bill is based. Firstly, I tum to the question of health care. As is agreed in a bipartisan way, all Australians-in particular aged Australians-need access to affordable quality health care, specifically on the basis of need. That is why the Medicare system was introduced by the Labor government as the then Medibank back in 1974. We do not believe that this bill affords those Australians most in need-that is, the poorer among the aged community-the opportunity to gain ready access to affordable quality health care which is delivered on an equitable basis. The second premise on which those of us on this side are opposed to this bill is based on the fact that this government 'initiative' will impact most heavily on those who can least afford to pay. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised, both during the election campaign preceding the March 1996 election and subsequent to that, not to hit the most vulnerable. The welfare of those whom we perceived to be the most vulnerable was never a core promise in the mind of the Prime Minister because he has simply swept away the needs of the most vulnerable. This bill, in its administrative essence, affords the Department of Social Security the opportunity to gather information about a nursing home or hostel resident's income, including the incomes of those who are not pensioners, in expectation that the Aged Care Bill 1997 will pass this House at some later time. The intent is to quite legitimately gather data which will be used to calculate how much of the daily charge of up to $64 the resident in a nursing home will be required to pay come 1 July 1997. The Aged Care Income Testing Bill will again afford the government the opportunity to levy or charge residents in nursing homes potentially a new and higher daily rate at some stage in the future. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who is in the House this evening, has made the claim that this bill only enables an income assessment to be undertaken. But the point of making that assessment is clearly so nursing home residents may be charged a high daily fee in much the same way that the Medicare levy has been increased by legislation of this parliament. The question also needs to be asked as to whether the level of the fee will remain fixed at its present rate. It may well go higher. Will your way. the government determine at some future time, as it has with Medicare, to increase this charge? As a bottom line, the minister should offer all Australians an assurance or guaraJatee on behalf of the government that this charge will be pegged at its current level. Any shirking of that issue and any failure to offer Australian citizens such a guarantee equates to a hidden agenda of future fee rises. Another concern with this charge that those on this side of the House share is that variable fees may well initiate differing standards of service. The shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who is also in the House this evening, has quite lucidly put the analogy of first, business and economy class service. She cited an example in her own presentation earlier on today of some patients being offered orange juice, while those who could only afford cordial would be offered the same. I was thinking much the same in terms of chicken: those who could afford breasts would get breasts, the business class people would get legs, and those who could least afford to pay would get the wings. Those are analogies that merit some consideration. I have seen those sorts of things happening within the United States of America, having lived with the manager of a nursing home in Kentucky and spent much time at that home. The end result of the scenario I have painted-rising fees and the potential for the same-is simply escalating health costs into the future. This bill is a fairly tawdry attempt to shift the cost from the equitably shared arrangement currently pursued by the public health system to a fairly discriminatory tax arrangement on those unfortunate enough to be required to avail themselves of nursing home facilities. In the shadow minister's assessment, they amount to some three per cent of the population of those over 65. That would be a discriminatory charge on those who require entry to a nursing home. Even if you had some form of wealth-income or assetsunder your belt, any charge would be hard enough. But, if you haven't, it would look like a substandard level of care was heading One cannot really stress vigorously enough the fact that only a small percentage of Australians will be requiring nursing home care. It is particularly necessary and incumbent upon those on our side to stress this because of the fact that the Prime Minister has said, on at least one occasion, that these people have-to paraphrase him-'a responsibility to pay back the debt that nursing home residents owe society at large'. Obviously the view on our side is quite the reverse. These people have paid taxes and made a contribution to our great society for many years, so it is incumbent upon us to repay the debt to them-certainly not vice versa. It is, perhaps, an attempt by the Prime Minister to create some sort of crisis or perceived crisis by saying that of Australia's elderly population. At the very least, it would be considered a derogatory insult to those same citizens. As I have said, it certainly brushes aside the profound commitment that they have made to our great Australian nation throughout their working lives. It is not the Prime Minister's right, role or responsibility to try to portray those people as being on the scrap heap and as being the ones who must repay some sort of ill-conceived debt to society at large. These people continue to make a valid contribution to our society by way of advice proffered to those who come within their range. From my own experience, I know how many local volunteer groups revolve around senior citizens without whom, I believe, society would collapse. We on this side are absolutely appalled at any assertion made by any member in this place that those who are among the aged population of our country should be required to repay a debt. I believe that, similar to the superannuation surcharge, it is incumbent upon those opposite to rightly come clean and to, in the Prime Minister's words in regard to that particular legislation, call a spade a spade and call these nursing home charges taxes. This is an additional tax on the existing Medicare levy and a tax on universal health care. This is a tax from a government that was a 'read my lips' government-a 'no new taxes' government. In fact, this is the second new tax that we have seen introduced this week by those opposite despite the fact that they have gone to untold lengths to disguise this as a charge on aged care. It is our contention that the two bills that I have alluded to represent a double whack for ageing members of this society because they are clearly faced with the prospect of not only an up-front nursing home charge but also selling their homes. They also have to face the prospect of a daily charge for aged nursing home care. It is somewhat trite for the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) to suggest that there is almost no harm in aged Australians who own homes selling their homes to meet this upfront nursing home charge rather than, in his words, allowing some empty large dwelling to lie vacant in the suburbs. Clearly, many parents have a strong desire to leave the family home, it being their prime asset, to their children. They do not want to put themselves ahead of their kids' future welfare by being forced to sell their family home, which is often their only major asset, to meet their nursing home needs and to meet the unfair and discriminatory charges that are being placed upon them by this government. The minister has persisted in her attempts to hide the fact that this is not going to happen-that no homes will be required to be sold. But she is among the very few people who currently believe that. The member for Jagajaga has put in her submission here earlier today that the media, nursing home proprietors, both private and not for profit, her own department and some of her own party believe that Australians will have to sell their homes. They understand that they will have to do that if they need nursing home care. In conclusion, this is clearly a tax. It is clearly a whack out of the breadbasket of those Australians who can least afford it. It is discriminatory and we believe it should be opposed. I urge members on both sides of the House to do just that.",89
179,Mrs MOYLAN,AGED CARE INCOME TESTING BILL,"Let's be clear about what we are doing here tonight because a lot of debate has focused on a bill which I expect I will introduce into the House tomorrow. The Aged Care Income Testing Bill will allow the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to commence income testing of residents in nursing homes and hostels so that they can be advised by my department, in advance of 1 July 1997, about the level of charges they will face in the event that the Aged Care Bill is passed. It does not pre-empt consideration by this House of the Aged Care Bill which, as I have just said, I expect to introduce into this House tomorrow. This bill only enables an income assessment to be undertaken and advice to be provided to residents of the outcome of that assessment. It does not enable charges to be increased, nor does it allow any reduction in the level of Commonwealth subsidies paid under the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954. What it does give is certainty for those residents who currently do not have an income test in place, and there are only around nine per cent of current residents in nursing homes and hostels-about 11,000 people in total-to whom this bill will apply. These residents want to know the level of their obligation and providers will also benefit by having certainty. The reality is that residents are more concerned than they need to be, and this is because of the Labor Party's scaremongering on this particular issue. There are protections in the bill for residents. There are provisions in the bill to ensure that any personal information exchanged for the purpose of income testing is not used for any other purpose, and these provisions have been developed in consultation with the Privacy Commission. We have gone to considerable lengths to ensure that that was carried out. Special protections for war widows and widowers have been built into the bill so they will not pay any more than other people with an equivalent income. The notion that was promoted by the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), that providers will become tax collectors under this bill really is a nonsense. The government does not require that any provider collect money for the government. This government has asked older people to make a fair and reasonable contribution for their care where they clearly have the means to do so. They pay this to the provider for their care and the government will continue to provide subsidies for their care to the provider. Indeed, consumers prefer that the fees are collected from them rather than government taking decisions on their own behalf. They much prefer to do that. In fact, when the working group was in operation, both the unions and the consumer representatives felt that they would not want that position to be changed. This is consistent with the principle that pensions are inalienable and, therefore, direct deduction on income tested fees are precluded. The variable fee system in hostels, which has been in place under the Labor government, already demonstrates the capacity of providers to manage the administration involved in varying amounts from individuals. Once again, we have seen Labor indulge in its favourite pastime of scaremongering and frightening older Australians that the government's aged care reform package will lead to a two-tiered system of aged care and that individuals will be forced to sell their home to gain access to residential care. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is we now see about 50 per cent of people voluntarily electing to sell their homes because they are going into a permanent form of residential care. For most of them it is quite unrealistic to expect that they will leave their home vacant while they enter a residential care unit option. We have given those who have the means a flexible option to be able to pay an accommodation bond. We have said that access to residential aged care will be based on needs, not just on means. So it will be based on what people need, not on how much money they have. Nobody will be forced-and I repeated that word on a number of occasions-to sell their home. Of course, they may well elect to because that is the most comfortable and appropriate thing to do to access residential care. We have also said that access to residential aged care by people of limited means will be protected. Labor's two-tiered system of aged care just will not be tolerated. It has existed in the past and we believe that our reforms go a long way towards stamping out that practice of the two-tiered system, that the rebuilding of the nursing home sector will be of benefit to everyone who enters residential nursing care. This bill is a further step in this government's steps to better care for older Australians. We did inherit a nursing home sector that is in a very bad state. We take the responsibility now to proceed to fix it and to put into place in Australia a sustainable system of aged care in a country where we are facing an increasing number of people over the age of 65. We have that responsibility. We do not resile from it. We will address the specific issues raised by the shadow minister in the consideration in detail stage.

Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",91
180,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"Jagajaga) (8.53 p.m.)Just before I go to the details of the bill, the clauses I want to raise with the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the minister said, I think, in her concluding remarks that the government does not require nursing homes to collect this fee for the government. Is that correct? Mrs Moylan-Yes.",93
181,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"Minister, I was under the impression from material published by the government around the time of the budget that the government is reducing its subsidy to particular nursing homes by the amount that nursing homes collect from nursing home residents. Is that correct? Mrs Moylan-Yes, that is correct.",93
182,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"That is a fairly important consideration, obviously, as to whether or not the money is being collected to replace subsidies previously paid by the government. But I am sure we will talk about that more when we get to the debate about the main bill. As far as today's bill is concerned, in my amendment to the second reading I drew the House's attention to three problems which I just want to raise now. The first is that I would seek the minister's consideration of the need to allow nursing home residents to appoint an agent or somebody to act on their behalf, given that a very large number of nursing home residents are unable to act on their own behalf. I draw the minister's attention specifically to the notice of determination in clause 9 and also to the reconsideration in clause 10(6) where at the moment the bill only says that the secretary has to write to the person whose income has been determined or reassessed.",93
183,Mrs MOYLAN,PAIRS,"The fact is that this is already covered in clause 6(b). The fact is that 90 per cent of residents who are already customers of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs have already had the opportunity to nominate somebody else to manage their affairs. Clause 6 of the bill specifically allows the person acting for or on behalf of a resident to give information so that ordinary income can be determined. The bill takes privacy very seriously. It is not appropriate to be releasing people's confidential information to anybody else unless that person has been nominated, has a power of attorney or is a legal representative. The income testing form will allow for the person to nominate someone else to act on their behalf.",94
184,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"As I read clause 6, that enables the secretary to request information from the person involved or a person acting on behalf of the nursing home resident. The difference is in clause 9 where the department is notifying the nursing home resident of their determination. What flows from that is any determination to charge a fee. It seems to me that it is pretty important at that time that a similar clause appears in 9 and in 10(6), as in 6, in relation to a person acting for or on behalf of that person, where the determination has been re-examined. I take the minister's point about privacy; I am certainly not seeking to reduce the privacy provisions. But as clause 6 shows, we are dealing with people who in many circumstances will not be able to assess the Department of Social Security's considerations. It is important that they have the capacity to have someone act on their behalf. The second issue is in relation to clause 11 (7) where, as I said in my remarks earlier today, for the second time in legislation I have had to deal with-and I do not know about other times-we have a situation where the secretary to the department is able, in effect, to sit on a decision for more than 90 days and then, after sitting on the decision, the secretary's opinion holds. That seems to me to be completely contrary to any view of natural justice. That is why I recommendand moved in my amendment to the second reading-that the presumption should favour the appellant, in fact the nursing home resident, where the decision on the appeal has not been made in time by the department.",94
185,Mrs MOYLAN,PAIRS,"We believe that this is a slightly different situation and subclause 11(7) provides that, where a person has requested reconsideration of their income determination and no decision is made within 90 days, then this is taken as confirmation of that determination. This is to the benefit of the person, as it means they can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Most reconsiderations of income are made well within the 90 days. The suggested amendment is likely to mean that decisions in the person's favour will take longer if the 90-day cut-off is used to make a positive decision. The requirement to decide in the person's favour if a decision cannot be made within 90 days is also unrealistic, particularly in complex cases where further information needs to be obtained to adequately assess the person's income.",94
186,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"I am not seeking to have the time reduced, I am trying to get the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to see that from the point of view of natural justice this clause favours the department doing nothing rather than favouring the needs of the nursing home resident. It seems that the minister is not prepared to take that natural justice consideration into account. She mentioned that the person in the nursing home has the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The third amendment that we sought to have moved is to allow nursing home residents to take their determinations through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Veterans' Review Board because both these tribunals are much less legalistic than the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I would prefer that the secretary's opinion does not hold whether or not he or she makes a decision within the time. Given the minister is not going to agree to that, I would strongly urge her to consider allowing nursing home residents to take their appeals to these tribunals rather than immediately to the more legalistic Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The same situation applies for all other recipients of social security benefits.",94
187,Mrs MOYLAN,PAIRS,"In relation to that, part 3 of the bill from clause 10 to about the review procedures, as is schedule 1. The key point is that if people make an appeal they will be treated exactly as they are treated now under the social security legislation or the veterans affairs legislation if are a veteran. These were the arrangements under Labor when they were in government. Item 3 of schedule 1 enables people who have had their income determined by the Department of Social Security to appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Clause 14 allows veterans to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Item 4 of schedule 1 achieves this for Social Security clients. The Veterans' Review Board has no jurisdiction to review the assessment of income levels for any pension or benefit covering veterans. Its role is simply one of deciding entitlement to the pension itself. People assessed for social security pension or benefit already enjoy one layer of review right compared to people covered by Veterans' Affairs. After they have used the internal review mechanisms they can still appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Veterans can only seek internal review of their assessment of income for pension purposes. They have no further appeal rights except to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and this is a right shared by people assessed by Social Security. The aged care legislation in effect is simply mirroring a difference which already exists between the Social Security and the Veterans' Affairs pension, which was the case when Labor was in government.",95
188,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"Despite the persuasive arguments of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), I do not think she has succeeded in convincing the opposition of the merit of her case on that point. I will move on to another point. The proposed system for exchanging information seems really complicated. The Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs accumulate all of the information on someone's income and assets. They pass that information on to the Department of Health and Family Services, which passes on some determination as to how much the nursing 14 is home day benefit is to be reduced to the nursing home. The nursing home, the third party in the chain, passes on to the fourth party in the chain-the resident-and lets them know how much their nursing home fees they are going to be increased. Wouldn't it be more efficient to simply have the Department of Social Security make an adjustment to the person's pension and have it written on the correspondence to the pensioner that that deduction is being made as a result of this government's decision to impose this 25c in the dollar additional means test to cover the cost of the nursing home accommodation? Wouldn't that be simpler?",95
189,Mrs MOYLAN,PAIRS,"Yes, that well may be the case but the fact is that when this matter was discussed with the consumer group representatives and the union representatives they urged us not to do that because of the inalienable right of people to receive their pension and not have government make deductions from it. There was clearly a wish by those consulting with government on the implementation details of these bills not to go down that path, and we respected that view and the consumer's right to their pension entitlement.",95
190,Mr LEE,PAIRS,I seek clarification from the minister. I have had feedback from some of the people who speak out and claim to represent some of the proprietors and operators of the aged care nursing homes and hostels and they told me that they would prefer the government to collect this information rather than residents blaming the proprietors for this increase in their fees. Could she clarify that? Is she saying that the nursing home proprietors and owners would prefer that they collect this additional fee rather than the government? The clear statement that I have had is that the operators would greatly prefer the government to collect the additional fee as a result of an adjustment in pensions.,96
191,Mrs MOYLAN,PAIRS,"I do not propose to keep debating this matter so I will not speak further on it except to say that we tried to balance the requirements of the providers and consumers in this case. We respected the consumers' right to receive their entitlements intact.  the minister indulge me by trying to clear up a matter? This bill, of course, sets down the relevant tests to determine who on entering a nursing home will be freed from obligation of the entry fee. Will those who are required to pay the entry fee to the nursing home be liable for income tax? I understand that that is treated by nursing home proprietors as being in trust on behalf of the resident. So, for income tax purposes, might not the resident rather than the proprietor, who gets the benefit of the income, be responsible for income tax?",96
192,Mrs MOYLAN,PAIRS,"This is not a matter that goes to this bill.  that. I am not trying to raise a frivolous point. I understand that the suggestion that the residents may be liable for income tax is contained in a library digest. If that is the case, I think we should try to clear up the point very quickly. I accept what the minister is saying-that this is not part of the bill. I thought it might be helpful if we could clear that up, because I am sure that the library digest is going to get very wide distribution. If the minister is not responding, I will just raise another point. I appreciate that this bill is one part of the package and it is establishing the income test, but it does go to the opposition's second reading amendment where it was raised that the entry fee has the characteristics of a tax and because of itsMrs Moylan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. These matters do not go to the bill which we are debating. They will be matters which will be raised properly in the bill to hopefully be tabled in the House tomorrow.",96
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! I take the point that we are now down to very specific aspects of the bill.  going to dispute your ruling. That would be quite improper of me. I just want to explain to the minister that I raise these points as elements of concern and I was hoping to give her the opportunity to clear these matters up at the earliest date. That opportunity was extended. I guess we will wait until tomorrow. I warn that the speCUlation will be fanned because the library digest suggests that these measures may be unconstitutional.,96
194,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"The last point that I would like to raise with the minister concerns war widows. I am grateful for the fact that she has responded to a number of the points the opposition have been raising tonight. I think it certainly does help to make for a constructive debate in the chamber. In your second reading speech, Minister, at the top of page 2, there was the following sentence: Special protections for war widows and widowers have been built into the bill so that they will not pay any more than other people with an equivalent income. I was hoping the minister might clarify what that meant, because we know that there would be no way the government would be suggesting that in some way they would be put in a worse position than anyone else on an equivalent income. I am not quite sure what additional protection is given to war widows and widowers as a result of this clause. My second point is that in the past war widows over the age of 60-60 and a bit, these days-received a war widows pension plus an age pension. Sure, there is a means test on the age pension, but there is no means test on the war widows pension. That is my understanding. Let us assume that someone does have some interest income and their age pension as a result is reduced to zero but their war widows pension is still at the full rate, because there is no means test on that. Does the introduction of this 25c in the dollar means test mean that for the first time these people will have a means test applied to the war widows pension? If you would like to clarify that, I am happy to expand on the point. The point is that, I think, at the moment it is about $64 a week for war widows, and the result of this new introduction might mean that for the first time war widows will have a means test applied to that $64 a week war widows pension.",96
195,Mrs MOYLAN,PAIRS,"The provision in clause 8 is designed to make sure that, for residential aged care income testing, this special group of people are treated exactly the same as somebody who has an equivalent amount of money available to them each week. This is needed because where war widows or war widowers also receive a part age pension, various rules do apply which limit the amount of each type of pension and count income in special ways. The fact is that they will be tested in the same way that they are tested now. Without this provision, some people, though, could have their income assessed at a figure that is the same as someone who is not a war widow but, in fact, they could really have less money each week in their pocket.",97
196,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"Oh, come on, Michael.",97
197,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"The Government Whip interjects. This is an important point. He is always saying across the chamber that we are wasting time and he thinks we have got understandings. We have had a pretty constructive conversation here tonight, and we are at the last point, which is about war widows. You come in in your usual manner and try to disturb the flow of the discussion, which results in us wasting more time. I do not think it is a waste of time to actually talk about the rights and entitlements of war widows. I acknowledge the fact that the minister has provided a response to the point I made. Perhaps it is because of the hour, but I am a bit thick at this time of night and I was a bit confused by the minister's answer when she said that there would be no change in the circumstances of war widowsI thought she used words to that effect. My understanding is that at the moment a war widow does not have a means test applied to that war widows pension. If there is no change in the war widows pension, can the minister assure me that there will be no reduction in the government's subsidy to the nursing home proprietor which, in effect, reduces the war widows pension because they are receiving that income from the Department of Veterans' Affairs? There is no point in saying, 'You still get your money from the Department of Veterans' Affairs' if the government takes away 25c in the dollar of that money--or more-and recovers your war widows pension through an increase in the nursing home fee which is payable. I hope the minister gets the point I am trying to make there.",97
198,Mrs MOYLAN,PAIRS,Perhaps the shadow minister could listen a little more closely. What I did say was that they will be tested. They do have a means test applied. They will be tested in the same way as they are currently tested.,97
199,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"When the minister says that they will be tested in the same way that they are now, given that there is no incomes test on the war widows pension, is the minister saying there is no reduction in the nursing home benefit for the income that is provided to a war widow by the Department of Veterans' Affairs?",97
200,Mrs MOYLAN,PAIRS,Yes. My officials tell me yes.,98
201,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,So it is not counted as income and will not be assessed. Is that correct? Mrs Moylan-Yes.,98
202,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"It will not be counted as income from the point of view of the assessment of the 25c. They are not going to have to pay 25c in the dollar for their widows pension.

Their purpose is to declare petroleum terminals on part IlIA downstream access for the Trade Practices Act. This is a very important reform, particularly in a week when the government is saying so much about small business, because, for all the talk and all the parliamentary answers and statements about small business, there was one sector that was totally forgotten-the small business service station sector in Australia. The government has declared its support for the closure of 3,000 out of the 9,000 service stations in Australia. I cannot believe that a government declares so much support for small business, yet does so little of substance to assist those 3,000 service station small businesses around the country, which are facing bankruptcy. I will just provide an instance of this government's neglect. I refer the House to the Daily Liberal newspaper from the town of Dubbo in central New South Wales. It started out a report on 14 March by saying: Plunging petrol prices have Dubbo's fuel retailers at the brink of turmoil. One company is netting as little as $300 for a combined total of 140 hours per week, slightly more than $2 per hour. So for all the words, for all the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his cabinet colleagues about small business, this in fact is the reality in regional Australia of what is happening to small business under this government's negligent attitude to the petrol industry. We have existing service stations which are being squeezed out of business. A family business in Dubbo working 140 hours per week with no greater income than $300, that is, $2 per hour-that is the reality of small business returns under this Howard government. And I cannot imagine anything more negligent, anything more abusive of the interests of small business than for a government to come out with a statement about the future of small business in Australia and to neglect the major industry, the major small business sector that is going to the wall, as a product of the government's inability to act with sensible reforms. For those 3,000 service station small businesses around Australia that are going broke because of this government's negligence, the small business statement this week counts for nothing more than crocodile tears-nothing more than crocodile tears and empty platitudes about their particular circumstances. The truth is that the 9,000 service stations in Australia need a fair chance to compete. They ask for nothing more than a fair chance to compete against the likes of Woolworths, against the likes of the big petrol multinationals that have so much power and control in this industry. These small family businesses ask for nothing more than a competitive wholesale market. All they are asking for is the same access to wholesale product that has now become the industry norm in electricity and gas. You do not need to own an electricity generator to be an electricity retailer on fair, competitive terms. Why then are these petrol service stations denied access to a competitively priced wholesale product? There is only one reason: the neglect of this governmentthe neglect of this government to do something constructive about the petrol industry. There is a crisis in regional Australia when 3,000 small businesses are facing bankruptcy. There is a crisis that this government needs to face up to. Of course, the attitudes of this government are totally incorrect. I can refer the House to the views of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who expressed his views in the Wagga Daily Advertiser newspaper on 7 March. He had this to say: Retailers and franchisees blame the oil companies and the oil companies in tum blame the retailers and franchisees, but the truth is they equally share the blame. It may well be that the ACCC needs increased powers in order to be successful in legal action against those suspected of price fixing. From its bottom ranks to its top ranks, this government is out of touch on basic petrol questions. Here is the Deputy Prime Minister saying that retailers are as much to blame for high prices as multinational petrol companies. That shows how out of touch the National Party is when it comes to these questions. There is no need to blame the retailers in Australia. Their margins are so narrow that they are going broke-all for the sake of propping up multinational petrol companies. (Extension of time granted) The Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party is out of touch. He should not be blaming the retailers and their skinny margins. With 3,000 of them likely to go broke because of this government's negligence, he should be blaming the multinational oil companies, because they have the control, the control from exploration stage to refinery, to production, to distribution, to retailing. They have integrated control throughout this industry. The Hilmer reforms 18 months ago sent a very clear message for public sector organisations that are vertically integrated with a homogenous product, that is, 'Break up. Move towards vertical separation. If that is not possible in terms of ownership, access part IlIA of the Trade Practices Act for the downstream access regime.' It is a sensible reform for the public sector; why will this government not support it for the private sector? The government alibi of course is to say, 'Oh, look, we are negotiating with these petrol companies.' You have Collins Street Costello wandering up and down Collins Street trying to negotiate with the big petrol companies on these matters, but all he is talking about is small 'a' access. He is talking about access to petrol terminals on the terms and conditions set by the big companies, that is, no competitive price gain for retailers, no competitive price gain for the motorists around the country. The truth is that the only gains in this industry come from big 'a' access, that is, legislated access, access under part rnA of the Trade Practices Act. If the government talks the rhetoric of access, why is so scared of these amendments? Why will the government not support the amendments that write the access provisions into the law? Why will the National Party and its leader not do more than blame the retailers? Why will they not stand up to the big multinational companies and say that they are the same as public sector electriaccept city or the same as public sector gas and that they need to be applied on the downstream access regime? These are sensible reforms. Nothing is more sensible. Nothing is more sensible than for this parliament to say, 'If it is good enough for electricity and it is good enough for gas, it is good enough for the petrol industry.' In a week in which the government has said that it is pro small business, it has no more outstanding reform on its agenda than to preserve the business interests of those 3,000 service station small businesses that they would otherwise send to the wall, with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs around regional Australia. The problem is that because of the franchised arrangements, the fixed on selling arrangements of the big companies, the existing service stations do not have a fair chance to compete against the likes of Woolworths. This government is turning country towns into 'Planet Woolworths'. Woolworths will have all the groceries, the newsagency, the pharmacy and all the petrol retailing. And all the small businesses that the government talks about will be wiped outwiped out because of the dominance of 'Planet Woolworths' in country New South Wales and throughout the country. That is a terrible shame. Why will the government not establish, by supporting these amendments, a competitive wholesale market? It is such a simple principle that existing service stations should have the same access to competitively priced wholesale petrol as the likes of Woolworths. If they did that-if the government supported those measures and put them through the Senate-then, of course, petrol prices throughout Australia would drop by up to 6c a litre. That is not my figure; that is a figure from the MTAA, from the Service Station Association and from APADA, the distributors association. It is all right for some of the government figures to wobble their heads like dogs on the back of the car, but the truth is that if they talk the language of supporting small business they should be willing to the estimate by the small business sector about price gains of up to 6c a litre because of competitive wholesale prices and an access regime. So these are common sense reforms. Small business people in Australia should not be working 140 hours per week for $300 net gain-$2 per hour. That is the reality under the Howard government. We should not be facing around regional Australia the loss of 3,000 small business service stations and tens of thousands of jobs. There is one easy step for this government to take. Forget about all those reforms and handouts in the small business statement, change the law to declare petrol terminals and the downstream access regime and this government will do more for the small business sector in this country than it could ever imagine. Support the Labor reform and do the decent thing for small businesses, for jobs in regional Australia and for major pricing benefits for motorists across the nation.",98
205,Mr MILES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.31 p.m.)-The speech which we have just heard with regard to this proposed amendment by the opposition is quite amazing really. Here we have a person who was part of a government which instituted the Laidley agreement, under which you would not allow anybody except the TWU to go through the gates, and you come in here and you are talking about competition. What were they doing for 13 years? It is absolutely outrageous that the opposition spokesman for competition would come in here and talk about petrol stations and petrol on an issue that really relates to other sorts of infrastructure in country, like electricity, or railway lines, or gas pipelines. He is trying to tag on here an issue that he wants to run that has already been defeated in the Senate and is going to be defeated here. It is really absolute grandstandonly ing on the part of the opposition just to waste time with purely political point scoring. He knows it is a ludicrous suggestion because the essence of what he is saying, in regard to part IlIA, is that these people would have the right to have petrol they owned pumped, stored or refined, but they would not have the right to buy it. What a ludicrous suggestion. You have to own the petrol. Your suggestion is totally flawed. I am not sure where the oppositIOn stands in regard to competition policy because you come in here running a line for competition, free trade and the rest of it, yet the rest of the opposition seems to have a line of going back to the 1960s. We are opposed to this amendment because there is a range of reasons why this amendment would not work. We certainly do not believe it is sensible to be tacking this amendment, related to the petroleum industry, on to this legislation. Let me just go over a few points at this stage. The opposition's suggested application of this part IlIA access regime to petrol terminals is fundamentally misconceived. It is true that the pefrol industry is vertically integrated, but petrol terminals are not natural monopolies. The opposition's amendment extends the scope of part IlIA far beyond its original intention as enacted by the present opposition. Secondly, the opposition's amendment is technically flawed. Part lIlA provides access to infrastructure services, such as the service of moving electricity over a grid, not the supply of goods, as such goods are able to be linked to infrastructure services only if they are an integral subsidiary to the infrastructure service. The opposition amendment does not overcome this limitation, it just gives another example of infrastructure services, but this would still be subject to a limitation on goods. People who want access to terminals want petrol. That is the whole reason. It is this hardly integral but it is subsidiary to the service. Accordingly, a person who seeks access to terminal services under the opposition amendment would not have the right to buy petrol, the right to have petrol they own stored, pumped or refined. So the amendment you are proposing is a ludicrous proposition. It just would not work. We, as a government, do support equally open access to petrol terminals and we are pursuing that and we will continue to, but this is not the place and not the legislation to be trying to tack it onto. Not only that, your proposal is unworkable.",101
206,Mr LATHAM,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has raised a few points that deserve a response. What he is doing when he criticises the opposition is also criticising the MTAA, the Service Station Association and APADA. He is criticising the aspirations and suggested reforms of close to 9,000 small businesses around Australia. Yet here was the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), just a few days ago, saying that this was a government that listens and acts on the advice of small business. Small business in the service station sector and distributor sector of this industry supports the Labor Party reforms. As for his claim that part IlIA is only devised to deal with natural monopolies, he obviously has not read the ACCC material on this. The ACCC produced a discussion paper. If you read these things as thoroughly as I do, you will notice that there is a very significant note in that discussion paper which said that part III access can apply to natural monopolies but also to natural oligopolies. That is what the petrol industry is-a natural oligopoly where obviously there is an economy of scale such that it is not economic for a vast number of participants to construct petrol terminals in every part of Australia. It has natural oligopoly features. The ACCC, in their published guidelines and in their evidence to a parliamentary committee chaired by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), have said that it is totally proper to consider downstream access for natural oligopolies. So the parliamentary secretary and his advisers need to catch up with the latest ACCC advice, as I have done. In terms of the debate about whether it is a service or a good, it is up to the parliament. This is an amendment to a statute of the parliament, and the parliament can determine whether or not the semantic arguments about services and goods hold weight at law. What this parliament would be saying is: whether you declare petrol terminals and their products as services or goods, there will be downstream access to them. That is the right of the parliament. We are not here to have the country run by a dictionary. We are not here to have the country run by some bureaucrats looking up the finer points of the meaning of 'service' and the meaning of 'economic goods'. We are here to have it run by the parliament that wants to do good things in the public interest. The good thing in the public interest is to say that whether petrol terminals are a good or a service, they are essential facilities for downstream access purposes. That is what my amendments would achieve. As for the question about retailers not being able to access the wholesale petrol because they do not own it, what is the whole point of downstream access? Of course downstream accessors do not own the upstream wholesale product. They purchase the upstream wholesale product because there is excess capacity upstream. If there is a dispute about the pricing of the purchase, it goes on to the ACCC for arbitration. This is exactly the same principle that the parliament has legislated for electricity and gas, but somehow the government has a phobia about doing it for the private sector petrol industry. On each of these things the parliamentary secretary has been shot down. In terms of what the Labor Party has been doing about it, goodness gracious me, who do you think carried the weight of the Hilmer reforms that got part IlIA written into the Trade Practices Act? It was the Australian Labor Party. So there we were getting the access regime into the act just 18 months ago and commissioning a report from the ACCC. If we had been in government we would have acted on the ACCC report by saying it was faulty, it missed the main game, it missed the boat when it came to sensible petrol reforms and the only thing to do is use the original act to put petrol on the downstream access regime. Again the parliamentary secretary is completely shot down in flames. On each of the matters that he has raised before the parliament, he is clearly inadequate. He cannot explain why the government one day says that it listens to small business and the next day says, 'We are going to ignore the interests of 3,000 service station small businesses which are likely to go broke.' While the parliamentary secretary sits on his hands and while the Prime Minister fiddles from Kirribilli House on Sydney Harbour, these businesses go broke systematically. That will be marked down as the great black spot on the record of the Howard government. The irony of it is that the bowser boy Johnny Howard, who grew up in a small business service station family, sent them all broke. Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, 1 raise a point of order. I ask that the Prime Minister be referred to in the proper manner.",101

Holding, A. C. Draper, P. * denotes teller Question so resolved in the negative. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Miles)-by leaveread a third time. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (MALE TOTAL NA BENCHMARK) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 March, on motion by Mr MCGauran: That the bill be now read a second time.  p.m.)-This piece of legislation, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation An.endment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill 1997, originated as a result of debate in the Senate last year on the government's budget social security package in which the opposition moved an amendment to give legislative effect to the commitment to maintain pensions at or above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Faced with the possible prospect of it being agreed to, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) agreed to come back with a proposition of her own to give effect to the 25 per cent commitment. No doubt the government would have people believe that this is a very generous measure on its part. It will be recalled that during the election campaign, after some degree of tardiness, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) agreed to adopt the 25 per cent benchmark, after having earlier said that he was only committed to maintaining the normal indexation arrangements for pensions. After being challenged about that, he gave this commitment and said, 'Yes, we will maintain this 25 per cent benchmark,' the implication being that the benchmark would be maintained more or less in the form that it had operated under the Labor government where from April 1990 onwards, in fulfilment of our election commitment, we managed to consistently maintain the pension above 25 per cent average weekly earnings. The problem you have with this sort of commitment is that it is open to a number of different interpretations. What do you mean by maintaining the pension above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings? Does it mean, for example, maintaining it above 25 per cent over the entire course of a year, which is way in which we interpreted it? Or does it mean maintaining the pension above 25 per cent of male average total weekly earnings on average over the course of a year, which is a somewhat weaker interpretation than the one that we adopted? Those are the two possible interpretations that were provided to the Minister for Social Security as part of the briefing to the incoming government. The two options in respect of this commitment were those two-that is, keep it above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings at all or keep it above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings on average. In fact, this legislation goes for a significantly weaker commitment than that. It is a weaker commitment in a number of respects. For a start, and this is the most extraordinary facet of it, the legislation that the government has brought before the House today imposes a five-year sunset provision on this commitment. In other words, the legislation ceases to operate after September 2002. This is a truly remarkable way of approaching a commitment of this sort. If a commitment of this sort means anything at all, it should stand as a permanent arrangement. Of what use is it to a pensioner, or somebody expecting to go on the pension at some future time, to be granted a five-year commitment to maintain that 25 per cent of average weekly earnings? Retirement incomes are quintessentially an area where you have to think long term. Any commitments you make, if they are to have any significance, have to be long-term commitments. The notion that you would have a five-year sunset provision on a proposition of this sort is just simply preposterous. It really shows quite clearly the real significance of this government's commitment to pensioners. With the spread and growth of occupational superannuation in recent years, some fear has been expressed from within pensioner organisations that maybe the pension, as we know it, as a basic adequate safety net is an endangered entity. Suspicions have been expressed at various times that governments of whatever persuasion might, at some future time, intend to remove the pension in its present form as the that basic income support safety net for people in retirement. A proposition - ike this, putting a five-year sunset on a commItment to a basic adequacy benchmark, can only reinforce those sorts of concerns and reinforce them with a considerable degree of justification. Just what is this government's long-term perspective about pensions and retirement incomes generally? The reality is that dealing with the long term fiscal implications of an ageing population is one of the central challenges which will face any future government of this country. You need to put in place a framework of policy that is capable of dealing with the sorts of circumstances with which we are going to be faced, with a steadily increasing proportion of the population of pensionable age. By the time you get a few decades into the next century, that is going to be a very significant fiscal contribution, not only because of its impact on social security outlays but because of its impact on a variety of other outlays, particularly health. The government is saying, 'We have made this commitment for five years and we will keep it for five years, but we are a bit worried about where it might lead us from a fiscal point of view in the long term and we do not want to be locked in.' I do not think this provides any grounds for confidence on the part of pensioners about what this government is likely to do about this or what its long-term intentions are in the retirement income area. There is no doubt that the ageing of the population is something for which substantial preparations are going to have to be made, and they are going to have to be made now. In government, we took a number of steps to try to make sure that we were in a situation where we could deal with an ageing population. The decision to raise the pensionable age of women to equate it with that of men over a 20-year period-a measure that was introduced during my period as Minister for Social Security-is one example. The whole thrust of policy under us-to achieve the most efficient possible targeting in our social security safety net-was also part of that. As anybody who lived through the political battles over the introduction of the assets test in the mid-1980s will recall, particularly in the early years of the government, decisions that brought no small amount of political pain to the government at the time had to be taken to ensure that we had a properly targeted system. There were some hard decisions that had to be made, and we showed ourselves prepared to make them. However, the reason those sorts of decisions ultimately proved to be politically sustainable was that people were able to have reasonable confidence that we had a robust commitment to the basic pension and to maintaining its adequacy-not just indexing it so that it kept track of inflation, but linking it to a benchmark that related to community standards and expectations in terms of living standards. Hence, we saw the links to average weekly earnings as being absolutely fundamental. To recapitulate, what we did in government was develop a social security safety netincluding that relating to aged pensions-that was efficiently targeted but where we went to a great deal of effort to ensure that the adequacy of the basic payment structure was sustained and that, in the case of pensions and a number of other payments, there was a clear linkage between the level of those payments and some sort of community standard. That commitment on our part was beyond doubt. Given the overall policy framework that we created and were putting in place, which included taking a long-term view of thingsthe move to substantially raise the extent and level of superannuation coverage obviously has implications in the long-term for the level of social security outlays-and given, as I said, the efficient targeting we sought to build into the structure, we believe that it was possible to have a sustainable adequate basic pension in the long-term. That was what we were on about providing and not just a shortterm five-year commitment to something so - nherently long-term in nature as retirement mcome. A number of modelling exercises were undertaken. I recall that there was quite a bit of attention given to getting a better handle on just what was likely to develop in this area in terms of long-term fiscal implications. The so-called retirement income modelling task force which was made up of officials from the Department of Social Security, the Department of Finance and Treasury, did a lot of work to analyse and evaluate what the long term implications of our policy framework would be. That is a necessarily uncertain process, although when you are talking about demographic factors it is possible to talk about things with some degree of confidence. The basic structure was a very sound one. In 1995, the World Bank released a report on how different countries were coping with the problem of an ageing population. That report explicitly endorsed the broad approach we had adopted towards ensuring an adequate retirement income system which had sufficient flexibility to enable us to cope with the fiscal consequences of an ageing population. A three-legged structure has been developed in this country, where the foundation is an efficiently targeted but adequate pension system increasingly supplemented by contributory superannuation and the third leg is private savings-which in this country, historically, has taken the form of people acquiring their own homes. About 70 per cent of our pensioner population own their own home outright, which is a very high rate of home ownership by world standards. Given those three legs of retirement income policy, I believe we created a sustainable system in which pensioners could have confidence. That is the first point I would make about the way in which this government is stepping away from the fundamental commitment to an adequate basic pension linked to average earnings. It is clearly farcical to interpret with its five year time frame. The second point I have made is that there are different ways you can interpret the 25 per NA Table I Maintain pension at 25% AWE at all points in time $m Age pension Disability support pension Widow B pension Sole parent pension DVA pension Mature age allowance NSA JSA Sickness allowance Special benefit Widow allowance Additional family payment NA cent commitment. Does it mean, as I said, keeping the pension above 25 per cent of average male total weekly earnings at all points throughout the year? Does it mean, alternatively, keeping it above 25 per cent of average earnings over the course of the year on average-in other words, being prepared to accept that there might be points where it dips below? They are the two interpretations that were traditionally argued about and we interpreted the commitment as being to keep it above AWE at all points. There are problems with that. If average earnings move quickly, you could find a situation where momentarily the level of pension could dip below that benchmark. But the point is that our commitment was to that interpretation of the benchmark. So they are the two possibilities that, I suppose, have been talked about as the main options in this area. I have a copy of the briefing that was provided to the incoming government after the election of March last year. The section which talks about this point actually deals with those two options which I have just described and provides detailed costings of those two options. I seek leave to have a table incorporated in Hansard which sets out the costings to the department of the that, two options that I have discussed. Leave granted. The table read as followsFULL YEAR PROGRAM COSTS* 1997-98 1998-99 267.3 404.9 97.7 147.9 10 15.2 59.3 89.8 54.8 82.8 8.5 12.9 35.5 53.5 29.9 45.2 3.9 5.9 3.2 4.8 0.2 0.5 73.1 110.3 643.4 973.7 Table 2 Maintain pension at an average $m Age pension Disability support pension Widow B pension Sole parent pension DVA pension Mature age allowance NSA JSA Sickness allowance Special benefit Widow allowance Additional family payment NA *Table 1 and Table 2 include flow on to married 60 who have been on income support for at least payments. Excludes flow on to  the figures in those tables on both the interpretations I talked about, and if you look at a comparable year, which is 1998-99, the sums involved exceed by very large magnitude the estimated fiscal impact of this bill. Obviously, those figures are not directly comparable because there are all sorts of parameter changes that have taken effect. You cannot directly and precisely compare figures in this legislation with the numbers that appear in those estimates that were prepared for the incoming government. I acknowledge that, but the differences are not marginal differences. You are talking about a very large order of magnitude by which estimates of the fiscal impact in a comparable year, an estimate for the incoming government, exceed the estimated fiscal impact of the government's legislation. That makes it very clear that this represents a substantial weakening of the commitment to the 25 per cent benchmark, as we interpreted it. The pensioners of Australia need to understand that very clearly. This is a government that wants to put a short time frame on legislation with a five-year sunset provision combined with a substantial weakening of the interpretation of the benchmark as it is to apply over that period of time. That is the second point. of 25% AWE over the financial year 1997-98 1998-99 109.4 258.7 40.1 94.5 4.1 9.6 24.3 57.5 22.4 53 3.5 8.2 14.7 34.1 12.4 28.8 1.6 3.8 1.4 3 0.1 0.2 15.7 57.6 249.7 60.9 pensioners and allowees, single allowees aged over 6 months, single allowees with dependants; and family single allowees without children. The first point, as I said, is the sunset provision. The second point is the way in which the 25 per cent commitment is being interpreted. The third point is the lack of provision for the flow-ons, which we regarded as fundamental, from the pension benchmark to certain other social security payments. Some of those flow-ons will occur. The government, in this legislation, has explicitly incorporated the married rate of pension as well as the single rate of pension. Half the married rate is currently 83 per cent of the single rate of pension, and that ratio will be maintained. So the government'is, in fact, honouring the weakened short-term form of the commitment in regard to married pensioners. It is also going to be an automatic consequence that the benchmark will flow through to family payments. The family payments are currently legislatively linked to the married rate of pension, and that legislation stands so those two flOW-OTIS will operate. But there are a number of others that are not legislatively provided for, and I am talking about the rate of payment to married allowees, to certain single allowees, particularly those with dependent children, and to those over the age of 60 who have been on income support for six months or more. We maintained that link. This government apparently does not intend to do so. There are significant budgetary savings there, but we would argue that it is unacceptable for people in that circumstance-that is, people on very low incomes with dependent children. We would maintain that their incomes also ought to be linked to some sort of community standard as well as the CPI. The government apparently does not share that point of view. For those three reasons, we think this legislation and the approach this government is taking represent a major weakening of that core fundamental commitment to an adequate pension. This is one of the strengths of the system we have in this country. It is interesting to note that, in the debates that have gone on in the UK about retirement incomes, even within the Labour Party over there, it has been considered a bit too hot to have this explicit link between average earnings and the rate of pension. I think this is a very strong feature of the system we have developed in this country, and it is highly unfortunate that this government has seen fit to so substantially weaken the commitment. As I said, the government was forced, in effect, by action in the Senate to bring forward some sort of piece of legislation on this. In a sense, I think it has been quite useful because it has made transparent just exactly how this government views things. It likes to talk about its commitment to older Australians, and the reality is that the coalition did receive substantial support from older Australians in the last election. There are no two ways about that but, once older Australians start to gain a more accurate perception of just what this government is on about, that position is likely to start to change. This legislation is one facet of this government's approach to older Australians and pensioners in particular. There is a range of other acts that the government has undertaken, particularly in the last budget, that adversely affect older Australians. The coalition said before it came into office that it would not do anything to reduce the basic rate of pension. Technically, it might not have done that-although, as I said, it has brought in this much weaker commitment to the 25 per cent of the AWE-but it did do a number of other things in the last budget that have a significant impact on the living standards of pensioners. For example, the government abolished the earnings credit, which was a significant savings measure, and decided to deem on small bank deposits. More significant were the changes in nursing homes, which for some older people are going to have a very major impact. They also made changes in the concessional pharmaceutical arrangement. All these things are effective reductions in the living standards of pensioners. They vary obviously according to the individual circumstance, but there is no question that there are some pretty ugly things being done to older Australians. The nursing home matter is the most egregious, but there are a range of others: for example, looking beyond the pensioners, for the older people of work force age, the decision to have deeming provisions on superannuation assets for people over the age of 55 is another example of an action by this government that is deleterious for older Australians-the people who will later be in the pension system. To sum up, the government clearly intends that this legislation be viewed as a highly benign measure. The fact is, though, that the government was compelled to do this as a result of action by the Senate. It is not a benign measure. It does represent a substantial weakening. The good thing about it is that it actually makes far more transparent just what this government is on about in the retirement incomes area. In due course, the reality of that is going to start to come through to older Australians. At this stage, I would like to formally move the second reading amendment which has been circulated. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for continuing to mislead Australian pensioners by introducing a bill which includes a completely inadequate mechanism for maintaining the single rate of pension at 25 percent of male total average weekly earnings, for the following reasons: (1) the bill contains a sunset provision which means that the commitment only extends for five years; and as such provides no long-tenn security for pensioners; (2) the bill as drafted gives effect to a new, and much more parsimonious, interpretation of the commitment than that of the previous Labor government since it only guarantees that the commitment will be met at the two annual indexation points, with the possibility of pensions falling significantly below the benchmark between adjustments. (3) the bill makes no provision for the maintenance of the link to a number of other Social Security payments, particularly payments to partnered unemployed people and those with dependant children. (4) the bill does nothing to redress the multifaceted assault by this government on the living standards of pensioners through such measures as increased costs for phannaceuticals, for nursing home accommodation and for other services"". That is the second reading amendment. I will conclude my remarks at that point.",103
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TOTAL,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ted Grace-I second the amendment.,109
209,Dr NELSON,TOTAL,"The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill gives legislative effect to the government's commitment to maintain the single adult rate of pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings as well as continuing the existing relativity between the single and married rate of pension, the latter being 83 per cent of the single rate. All social security pensioners, service pensioners and income support supplement recipients will benefit from this measure. Additionally, because of the existing legislative link between the partnered rate of pension and the maximum rate of family payment, MTAWE increases will flow through to the family payment. The legislation takes effect, as we have just heard, from 20 September 1997 and it will have a five-year sunset clause ending on 21 September 2002. The sunset clause, with a measure like this, is of course eminently reasonable. In fact, it is quite responsible of any government, whoever that may be at the time, to review the nature of the outlays, how well this has worked for pensioners in particular and whether it needs to be reviewed either up or indeed down. The cost is locked into the forward estimates at a little over $2 billion for the four years of the estimates. As noble as its intent may be, it is not appropriate to extend these amendments to allowances because pensioners, by definition, usually are required to live indefinitely on the basic pension, and allowees will in any case continue to have their benefits indexed to allow for increases in the consumer price index. How many of us could live on a pension? How many of us in fact know what the level of the current pension is? The single pension is currently $347.80 a fortnight. That is $173 a week or $24.50 a day. The pensioner couple need to survive on $290.10 each per fortnight. The maximum payment diminishes once you start earning $98 a fortnight. Sixteen per cent of those on a full pension rely on nothing other than that pension-that is, $24 a day, and that is up from 15 per cent last year. One million aged pensioners receive the full pension. As such, they do not benefit from policies that are delivered through the taxation system to retired and working people who of course are paying taxes. The Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation has supported and commended the government's initiative to put a legislative floor under pensions by making them equal to at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. That adds certainty and stability to the system. Again, I come back to the sunset clause. This is plain common sense. I asked the statistics group in the Parliamentary Library to provide me with some figures as to how movements in pensions would have fared had they been set at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings over the preceding five years. Had they been at that level, the pension in March this year would have been $5.60 less than the $173 that it currently is. In other words, this is an absolute minimum but at least it provides some degree of certainty. I think it makes quite a bit of sense to review it at the end of a five-year period. The pension is $24 a day, yet examples of the typical prices for essential groceries are as follows: a litre of milk is $1.15; bread is $1.68 a loaf; a packet of tea bags is $3.24; butter is $1.70; eggs are $1.80 for a dozen; toilet paper is $1.38 for four rolls; four lamb chops are $4.20; a kilogram of potatoes is $1.68; and one kilogram of carrots is $1.60. If you think about having $24 a day on which to live, pensioners have every reason to be cynical about pension movements being linked simply to the consumer price index. The latest figures indicate that in the six months to December 1996, prices rose by only 0.2 per cent. In fact, as most of us are aware, we have the lowest inflation rate in years. The annualised price increases last year were 1.5 per cent but petrol increased by 3.1 per cent, hospital and medical charges increased by five per cent-keep in mind we have 850,000 people over the age of 65 still with private health insurance-cigarettes were up 4.4 per cent, and of course I would advise pensioners to give that away; and food increases averaged 3.2 per cent for the year, which was more than double the official consumer price index. What pensioners know much more than any of us, or our partners who may do the shopping, is that whilst we may say that the consumer price index has been 1.5 per cent underlying or there is a headline inflation rate of 2.1 per cent, most people know when they are shopping that the prices of the things they are buying to survive on are rising at a rate far in excess of that. In fact, fresh fruit and vegetables were up 16.8 per cent last year. One of the reasons the CPI is as it is is home mortgage rates, which fell last year 7.8 per cent. But there are only 11.5 per cent of people between the ages of 55 and 64 who are paying off a mortgage and for those above 75 years the rate is 3.2 per cent. I think the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation make a very legitimate point when they say that perhaps bank fees should be included in CPI calculations. Certainly, pensioners think so for very understandable reasons. Another critical area for pensioners is that of concessions. The 1993 liberalisation of the means test for pensioner concession cards has resulted in many concessions offered to pensioners being reduced in value over the ensuing four years. There is also a disturbingly ad hoc approach to concessions that lacks national uniformity. Even more importantly, concessions or rebates are not indexed for increases in the cost of living. I think state and local governments should mirror the Commonwealth's actions in this bill by indexing concessions which are so essential to the financial survival of pensioners. Our government, in particular, in reviewing national competition policy needs to take into account the community service obligations of organisations that become the subject of privatisation, so that the importance of a concession to a pensioner trying to survive in this modem world is maintained. I commend to honourable members the results of a study that was conducted and released last year by the Older Women's Network. It was entitled 'Difficult decisions; older women talk about money, life and retirement'. There were 245 respondents to the survey and there are some results in particular that I draw the House's attention to. Some 80 per cent of women surveyed were worried about finding money to replace household equipment which had worn out, rates, house repairs and premiums. The research demonstrated the ways in which older women have contributed to their family's needs, often at great expense to their own long-term economic security. I think many of us here have mothers or grandmothers who have done just that. Some 17 per cent of women living alone relied solely on the pension and 63 per cent of women pensioners received a full pension; 84 per cent of respondents who relied only on the pension were battling to make ends meet and 72 per cent were dissatisfied with their quality of life. Many expressed little faith in the responsiveness of the public hospital system and 45 per cent of those respondents, despite all that, still maintained private health insurance for which, if they are married, they will receive $250 in a rebate come 1 July. I come back to the comments made sincere Baldwin). I think we will need to be vigilant to see that pensioners do not go backwards. The 25 per cent male total average weekly earnings figure, if applied over the past five years, would have meant the pension would currently be about $168.30 rather than $173. The legislation sets a floor, irrespective of what happens in the rest of the economy, but a floor above which I believe the government will need to keep. Any consideration of pensions must necessarily occur in the context of the income side of government. As late as only a few days before last year's federal election, we were told that the budget was doing all right and that we did not have a deficit when we did have one of $10.3 billion. Pensions and social security are one of the three big ticket items of government. Expenditure is very much a function of the general state of the economy. In the 1995-96 years, for example, we spent $71.3 billion on health, education and welfare, which is more than all of the money that was raised by taxes on PAYE income earners. As I will not be here tomorrow to conclude my address, the one point I would like to make is that as the population ages; as the Internet becomes increasingly used; as we see growing income disparity in Australia; as we move into an environment of international competitiveness; as a lessening proportion of income earners in Australia, compared with those relying on social security benefits, develops; as the economy globalises; as we realise that public sector deficits are no longer sustainable; and we become increasingly aware of the vertical, fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states, it seems quite obvious to me that until we simplify Australia's taxation system it is going to be increasingly difficult for people to create more wealth in this country. Equally, until we broaden the tax base, whenever that may be, the government of the day will have no option but to continue to review necessary government spending programs. We cannot forever continue to tax productivity, employment and savings. I think the people who are suffering most from the narrow nature of the taxation base are those who most benefit from government spending. Debate interrupted. NA",109
210,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjoum. Government Expenditure",111
211,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I made some remarks last week regarding the current changes taking place in a number of areas of government expenditure. I would like to read to the House tonight a letter that I received and have forwarded to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) this evening. It is addressed to Mr John Howard, care of myself, and it says: I am writing to you today as a very upset and concerned member of the community. I received from the Department of Social Security a letter to inform me that I would lose $30 from my 'rent assistance', starting from 1st July 1997. As I am unemployed and cannot afford to lose any money from my benefit I called my local member to express my concerns over this and also put my concems in writing. I then proceeded to call Mr Tierney's Newcastle office to ask why this was happening. I called and was asked for my name and phone number and was told that somebody would call me back. When the person did call me back, the first thing I was asked was 'who did you vote forT I then stated 'Labor'. I then was given a complete run down of what Labor had done wrong before the Liberal Party took over. Again I asked 'Why am I losing $30 from my benefitT I then got the reply 'So?' So much for Liberal concerns about we unemployed. I am unemployed by no fault of my own. I would like nothing more than a real job. I am trying very hard to get a job and I must believe that I will hopefully get a job soon. It is very hard to try and live from fortnight to fortnight. When I get my fortnightly payment I have to pay my rent, buy my food and clothing, pay my power and water bill as well as live. So can you now tell me how the hell I am supposed to live $30 short each fortnight, when I am now struggling from fortnight to fortnight to survive? It may not seem much to you, but then again I am not getting paid what you get paid. I am very angry at the way in which I was treated by Senator Tierney's office today and would ask why has he an office when concerned people from the community cannot speak their minds about something as important as this. It seems that being unemployed means that I am not a part of the community and that I am in some way to blame for being unemployed. It would seem that we are not of any importance to the Government and we should be overlooked. Well this is one person from the community that is unemployed that will not take this lying down. I am an Australian citizen and I have rights. It is just a pity that the Liberal Government does not think the same. I can tell you now that at the next election I will again vote for the Labor Party and I know they will get back in and I just hope they will be able to correct the damage that the Liberal Party has done to this country that I love. Thank you for your time and I hope that you will have the matter of this new policy reviewed. I would see this as a sign that the Liberals are not all together only for the rich and the strong. It is signed John Wayne Davis. Mr Davis makes his point very clearly and very succinctly. As a concerned citizen he approached a member of government and the first question he was asked was, 'Who do you vote for?' That is the kind of approach that the government takes these days. It is not about the battlers or the whole community; they ask what your politics are first and then go on. Last week in Newcastle we found Social Security offices short of staff because the staff were off on stress leave. The difficulty they are having it! implementing these changes is causing enormous problems. The government members all know that. I have heard it around the corridors; I hear and see the differences going on. But what are you doing about it? Are you doing the same as Senator Tierney? Are you only responding to Liberal voters? Are you asking who they vote for first? Is that the new method of governing the country: by the Liberals for the Liberals only? If not, then it is up to the Prime Minister to make it very clear, not just to Mr Davis but to the parliament and to the whole community, that all members of parliament represent their whole society, not simply those who share their political views or their religion or their other beliefs. As Australian citizens they are equal. Mr Davis was entitled to be treated with courtesy and concern. He got neither and that is not good enough. It is a disgrace not just to the government but to the whole of the country. Universities  empowers and leads to the intellectual, social and cultural fulfilment of individuals and, consequently, communities. Indeed, Australian universities, ranked amongst the best in the world, have often been champions of new ideas in Australian society, challenging individuals to apply themselves to move beyond the threshold of change. However, while the importance of universities as institutions of academic excellence is rarely understated, often overlooked are the ways in which universities can empower regional economies like South Australia, generating many jobs and opportunities for a community that has been hit hard by the economic mismanagement of years of state and federal Labor governments. Tonight I want to highlight the contribution the University of Adelaide, the Flinders University of South Australia and the University of South Australia collectively make to the economy of my home state. I suspect that there are a few states in which universities make a greater economic contribution than do those in South Australia. Therefore, my home state provides an excellent example of the central role that universities can and should play in the community's development. As I have said, South Australia has three universities. The University of Adelaide was established in 1974, making it the third oldest university in Australia. However, Flinders University and the University of South Australia also have proud histories of achievement, the latter being established by the 1991 merger of two institutions which dated back to the 19th century. Between them, these universities employ almost 7,000 people, representing one per centMr Fitzgibbon-How many homes are on the market near them?  aren't you, Mr Fitzgibbon? They represent one per cent of the total employment population in South Australia. In addition, approximately 45,000 students are enrolled in South Australian universities, a significant number of whom are overseas students. It will come as little surprise, then, that a report conducted by the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies in 1996 into the contribution universities make to the state economy recognised higher education as South Australia's fastest growing export industry. University expenditure in South Australia is $600 million each year, equivalent to 1.7 per cent of gross state product. Universities draw roughly $400 million worth of Commonwealth expenditure into the state, as well as over $200 million from nonCommonwealth sources. A conservative estimate of the flow-on impact of this expenditure suggests that as much as $1,050 million is added to the state economy every year, generating 19,000 jobs. In addition to these direct benefits to the South Australian economy, many indirect benefits also exist. All three universities are engaged in collaborative research with local public and private sector enterprises, fuelling economic growth by providing links between research and commercialisation. South Australian universities have played a critical role in attracting high technology growth industry to the state. Each year, approximately 10,000 students complete university courses taught in the state. While many seek entry to higher degrees, 80 per cent of those entering the work force find employment in South Australia. The universities, then, are the major suppliers of professional staff to South Australian industry and government. Another indirect benefit to the state economy is provided by the many annual conferences organised and hosted by South Australia's tertiary institutions. Last year, conference alone attracted more than 500 delegates from around the world and generated expenditure of approximately $1 million. However, conferences and university organised events make more than a financial contribution to the state economy. They also establish South Australia as a prestigious site of intellectual achievement-a reputation forged both nationally and internationally. This reputation has been reinforced further by the relations established by university staff with institutions of excellence throughout the world, increasing the potential for positive spin-offs for regional economic development, including the attraction of new industries. For these reasons, universities provide many long term benefits and are vitally important to the economic well-being of the state. As economic activity becomes less resource intensive and more knowledge intensive, industry will increasingly demand a skilled and well-educated work force. This will place greater emphasis on university research, teaching and training to ensure that the contribution that South Australian universities make in empowering the state's economy will continue to grow. I imagine that the members who represent the Hunter Valley region--one of whom is here-and the members representing Newcastle would envy the role that the three universities in South Australia. I have mentioned play in the South Australian economy. Small Business Chicken Processing Industry Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (10.40 p.m.)On Monday, the government released its response to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in particular, has had a fair bit to say about small business ever since then. He has described the small business sector as the. engine room of the economy. He says that the government package would give small business every encouragement to hire new staff. We will wait and see, because certainly they are shedding jobs in the universities-in particular, in South Australia. Tonight, I too want to talk about small one business. In particular, I want to talk about 900 small businesses around this nation. I want to talk about the 900 independent chicken growers around this nation. I also want to speak about the chicken processing industry. Those two industries between them, directly and indirectly, employee around 17,000 Australians. What has Mr Howard said to this sector? He has said, 'Look, up until now you have enjoyed protection from imports.' That protection, I recognise, has been underpinned by quarantine concerns. I am delighted the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) has joined us because he, too, has recognised what a sham this whole process has been and what a threat the importation of chicken meat is to the local industry. John Howard says to the industry, 'But under the new world order, this protection must go. We must allow the giants in the USA, the EU and Thailand to export their chicken into this country.' In other words, he is saying that he will slash the tariff rate from 100 per cent to zero per cent overnight and he says, 'But you must simply adjust.' The Howard government wants to be seen internationally as the perfect free trader. The chicken industry is not an industry that is hidden behind tariff walls. It has grown steadily in terms of production, jobs and investment. It has enjoyed annual growth of up to 20 per cent over the past decade. It has improved its competitiveness both domestically and internationally and, of course, it is value adding. Raw poultry now represents about 50 per cent of production. Mr Bob Baldwin-What have you said to Bob Collins?",111
212,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"I just welcome the interjections from the member for Paterson, because this is an industry his government is selling out and he is not prepared to stand up to it. You should come over to this side and have your say. Raw value added product accounts for about 30 per cent of the market now and is growing at a rate of between eight per cent and 10 per cent. The cooked product now represents 20 per cent of the market and is growing at between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. Total investment in the industry is now ','ound $2 billion. This is a very significant u:Jmestic market. Adding value means adding jobs. This industry is adding jobs where we need them most-in rural and regional Australia. You would think the member for Paterson would be on his feet defending this industry. As I said earlier, directly and indirectly this try creates 17,000 jobs in Australia. And they want to talk about cutting a little red tape. They would do much better to simply stand up for this industry. The USA, the European Union and Thailand are the world's major poultry producing nations. But post the Uruguay Round, these countries still operate on a playing field you could hardly describe as level. In fact, some countries-for example, Singapore-use the Uruguay Round to actually increase their tariffs. While the USA is not a heavy subs idiser of its poultry industry, it uses its export subsidies to expand its agricultural markets at Australia's expense. The export enhancement program for the period July 1996 to June 1997 provided bonuses for the export of 33,000 tonnes of frozen chicken meat to 27 countries. Thailand and other Asian nations use strong fiscal incentives, such as tax breaks and subsidies, to assist their local industries. I would have thought, as I have said, that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who has made a complete botch of this whole issue, would stand up for the industry, and I would have thought that the member for Paterson would also be standing up. I would have thought that they would be adopting the unanimous recommendations of the all-party Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee to ensure that jobs in rural and regional Australia are maintained. It is no good coming in here and talking about cutting red tape and those peripheral issues if they are not prepared to simply stand up and defend a very strong and very significant local industry. Don't worry about anything else-just defend the jobs we already have. (Time expired) Sheffield Shield",114
213,Mrs WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"At 5.12 p.m. Canberra time a historic event was taking place in Western Australia, the likes of which has only ever occurred on one previous occasion. Most Queenslanders will know what I am referring to and a great many Western indus- Australians will wish they did not. I am speaking about the quest for the Holy Grail of cricket-yes, the Sheffield Shield. Today Queensland won the shield for only the second time in the history of the competition, and they did it with style. With the odds stacked against them, the young Queenslanders dominated the final from day one. The side had been labelled as the rank outsiders to win the shield for a number of reasons. Firstly, we had just managed to scrape into the final after a tense last round in which we had to win outright and hope New South Wales could beat Tasmania. This was one of the very few occasions on which you could catch a Queenslander openly barracking for a cockroach. Once into the final, history was well and truly against the young lads from the Sunshine State. Since the finals concept was introduced 15 years ago, only one side has won away from home. Further stacked against our intrepid Bulls was that statistic. In 47 visits to the W ACA, Queensland had won just seven matches. The Sandgropers had dominated the regular season and only needed to salvage a draw to win the shield. To make matters worse, on match eve, confidential documents walked from the Queensland dressing room and ended up in enemy hands. These papers listed the strengths and weaknesses of all the Queensland playing staff. The papers also suggested points of attack against the West Australians. Fortunately, it would seem that either the West Australians decided in the interests of sportsmanship that they would not use the information or, alternatively, they simply could not understand it. How else could you explain their performance in the final? Despite these setbacks, and the fact that Hayden, Healy and Bickel are all in South Africa, our Queensland boys achieved the ultimate: their second shield win in three years. It has been a match of personal milestones and courageous if not heroic performances. The bowling of Adam Dale and Michael Kasprowicz has been inspirational, as has the leadership of Stuart Law. Law has proven himself to be an innovative and adventurous leader. His move to give spinner Paul Jackson a ball just 10 overs old was both brave and inspirational, and it paid off with an immediate wicket. His team-mates have not let him down. They have pulled together against all odds to win in sensational style. But, as with any champion team, there is always one stand-out player-one who performs above and beyond the call of duty. In this match that player wasMr Tony Smith-Trevor Barsby.",114
214,Mrs WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, Trevor 'Tank' Barsby. In his last year of shield cricket, Tank could not have wished for a better send-off. He has been the stand-out player of the final. His century in the second innings was an amazing knock. Battling a severe bout of flu, Tank carried on well past the comfort zone. If not for the encouragement of skipper Law, Trevor said he would have thrown his wicket away. But, wait, there is more. His contribution did not end there. Upon taking the field in the second innings, Tank pulled off what Stuart Law described as the greatest catch he has ever seen. This phrase gets bandied about, particularly by a certain television commentator, but on this occasion Law was not far off the mark. Barsby's herculean efforts in this final have been matched possibly by just one other, West Australian skipper Tom Moody. Moody's second innings dig was inspirational and possibly the only thing that saved the West Australians from total humiliation. Unfortunately, he was largely left alone in his defiance. His team's last ditch effort to save the match was commendable but way too late as the horse had, as they say, bolted. The Queenslanders had a throttle hold on the match from day two and were not about to let it go. After being the butt of many jokes for far too many years, the Queensland Bulls have come of age. They have proven that their victory in 1995 was not a fluke. With the team brimming with young talent, I predict that this is the start of a glorious decade for the Queensland Bulls.",115
215,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! You've hit me for six. I call the honourable member for Shortland. Shipping  p.m.)-Yesterday in the grievance debate I outlined some of the stories of the motor vessel Hunter, a Greek owned Panamanian registered ship of shame. One shipowner company, the Associated Euro-Atlantic Co., is out of London. After the ship's arrival off Port Newcastle on 12 January 1997, the crew of the vessel complained to the International Transport Federation about mistreatment and non-payment of wages. Polembros Maritime Co. Ltd of Piraeus, the managers of the ship, conjoined the Port Waratah Coal Services, the International Transport Federation, the Maritime Union of Australia and the Newcastle Port Corporation in legal action for damages under section 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act. The union had sought permission to board the vessel at anchor. This permission was denied by the Captain, Georgios Kourtessis. Honduran and Romanian crew members wanted to get off the ship to escape threats from the Greek officers, particularly from Chief Officer Nikolaos Georgiadis, and to collect unpaid wages. I happened to speak to that chief officer just before the ship sailed. As I said, the ship is managed by the Polembros Maritime Co. Ltd of Piraeus. The company has an established record around the world of denying its crew wages, medical care and even reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by crew members in respect of work related illness. Ships in the fleet include the African Addax in which 12 seafarers were replaced before coming to Australia in December 1996 to avoid action in Australia for unpaid wages. They have had trouble with other ships in relation to their crew entitlements on the vessels the Leon, the Leonidas, the Theocennitor and the Brazil Vitoria. The company has a reputation of using multiracial crews. In the case of the ship in Newcastle, the crew was made up of a mixture of Honduran, Filipino, Greek and Romanian sailors. The strategy behind the use of multiracial crews like that sometimes is to keep the crew in small groups, because a crew all of the one tongue makes it easier for the crew to organise in respect of their mistreatment and when they have not been paid their proper entitlements. Mr Tony Smith-Divide and rule.  That is exactly what it is about. The ship management company, Polembros Maritime, was due in court again today in pursuit of its actions under sections 45D and 45E against the parties that I mentioned earlier. I do not know what has happened there. But again we see a foreign corporation using Australia's domestic law to seek to evade its international obligations in respect of sea safety, ship safety and crew treatment-obligations to which Australia strongly subscribes. This company is making a laughing stock of Australia in the shipping world. Polembros's action against the MUA and the ITF is aimed at preventing these unions from assisting foreign crews to collect their rightful wages-not something they are not entitled to, just the wages that they have signed up for and the ordinary treatment that we would take for granted. It is abhorrent to me that Australian lawyers would be party to activities aimed at exploiting and abusing Third World seafarers. And the seagulls tell me-w- all know about the seagulls-that the firm of Norton Smith and Co. out of Sydney, maritime lawyers, are on a retainer to watch any action by the Maritime Union of Australia and the ITF to grab them under 45D and 45E and make an example of them. They thought they had them with the MV Hunter, except that there was not any industrial action and the case is still before the court. Polembros is a rogue shipping company that manages a fleet of 25 ships, almost all of them, 23, are 19 years of age or older. It has an established history of mistreatment and underpayment of Third World crews. The flag state at fault, the Panamanian government, has to accept some responsibility, but the Greek government must accept responsibility for infamous behaviour by Greek corporations. The Greek government claims that ships wearing its flag are not ships of shame-well, that is contestable-yet it turns a blind eye to the substandard practices followed by Greek shipowners and Greek ship management companies. The ruthless and exploitative practices of some of these owners and managers damage Greece's reputation across the world. I want this government to give a commitment not to allow Australian law to be used by foreign shipping corporations to evade their international maritime obligations for safety at sea and treatment of crew. I call upon the government to raise in the strongest terms with the Panamanian government the failure of ships registered in Panama to comply with international maritime regulations and Panama's failure to carry out flag state obligations, with special reference to the murder of Budi Santosi on the Glory Cape just off Port Hedland on 31 October 1995which remains to this day uninvestigated, and the crew carries on and ship carries on-and also in respect of the MV Hunter. Small Business",115
216,Mr ANTHONY,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to speak about the plight of small business, a particular small business operator in my electorate. This is a story of a typical small business operator who has worked on the premise that if you work hard and do the right thing you will get ahead and be able to enjoy your life to its fullest. I would also like to take the opportunity to compliment the government on the small business package which was released this week, particularly the changes to capital gains tax, FBT, unfair dismissal and streamlining red tape-an excellent package. Tonight I would like to highlight a brief history of a businessman in my electorate who has been having a number of problems. His named is Mr Bill MCColloch. His father, Bill senior, purchased a muffler and exhaust business in 1985 with the opportunity to become self-employed and to successfully operate a business. The purchase of this business included a distribution agreement with Berklee Distributors of Queensland. Although this agreement did not include royalties, it did give the MCCollochs sole selling rights for Berklee products in the region stretching from Murwillumbah to Currumbin. In September 1988 Berklee Retail was forced to oversee the Berklee exhaust franchise nationwide. It approached independent Berklee distributors all over Australia in an attempt to sign them up to Berklee franchise. Mr MCColloch was approached and offered the Berklee franchise but declined. At the time, he was told that the agreement he had with Berklee Distributors in Queensland would still be honoured. Berklee Retail decided to keep pursuing Mr MCColloch to try to convert him to the new agreement, but the offer was again declined on the grounds that their business continued to trade successfully under the old arrangement and that the new arrangement with Berklee Retail sounded totally restrictive. Mr MCColloch was then contacted by the Managing Director of Berklee Retail, Mr John Rippon, who offered yet another financial package to bring the MCCollochs into the Berklee Retail franchise. Again, the offer was declined. Mr MCColloch said that at this stage Mr Rippon lost his patience and threatened the MCCollochs that if they did not accept the Berklee Retail deal Berklee would open a store just around the comer in direct competition with him. Bill MCColloch and his father were faced with an ominous choice-ignore the offer and watch as they were forced out of business by Berklee Retail or join Berklee Retail and try to continue making a profit under their restrictive franchise agreement. The MCCollochs were forced to sign', with no mediation or compromise offered by Berklee. It must be pointed out that Mr MCColloch was told that the franchise agreement would include a package whereby 50 per cent of royalties would be spent on local advertising, promotion and marketing within his demographic area. These claims are all repeated in a booklet and video produced by Berklee. Mr MCColloch has told me that from January 1989 when they signed with Berklee until 1991 they strictly adhered to the franchise arrangements. Unfortunately, Berklee did not do the same. Berklee's local advertising and support package failed to materialise. Furthermore, the agreement also included the requirement that Berklee would supply its franchisees only with Berklee products and that Berklee franchisees would sell only Berklee products. Again, Berklee did not hold up their end of the bargain. Instead, they produced cheaper and unbranded products which were sold to non-Berklee outlets in direct competition to Bill MCColloch. At this point I want to highlight to the House that Mr MCColloch is not the only hard-working small business person that has been deceived by Berklee retail. My National Party colleague the member for Capricomia (Mr Marek) spoke in this place in December last year highlighting that exactly the same problems were being experienced with a constituent in his electorate. I congratulate the member for his work in highlighting this problem. My neighbouring MP, the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), and the member for Makin (Ms Draper) in Adelaide have also received complaints from other franchisees in relation to this issue. Both the member for Capricomia and I have written to the Chairman of the ACCC, Allan Fels, asking that he investigate what seem to be serious breaches of the Trade Practices Act. I encourage other members in this House, regardless of their politics, who have been contacted by discontented franchisees with Berklee, to add their weight to this debate. I would also urge that the ACCC leave no stone untumed to ensure the allegations raised by these franchisees are fully investigated. If Berklee is found to have acted in any way unconscionably or to have breached any section of the Trade Practices Act, I would implore the ACCC to throw the book at them and apply to the Federal Court for compensation. As I mentioned before, this is a group of hard working, honest small business people who have done the right thing but have been deceived and driven to the point of bankruptcy by the actions of a large company. I bring this to the attention of the House. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following notices were given:  amend the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989.  That the standing orders be amended by inserting the following standing order after standing order 143: Questions to committee chairs 143A.

The fifth committee was that regulations be added to before electing to return to their home state of prisons in that home country, and that of the committee thought essential. NA 2990 I think it fair to say that the general consensus General to be overly paternal if a prisoner, their home country, with open eyes nonetheless General should not step in and say, 'You cannot your home country as being up to international A good example of that was given to the the United States it is the practice to put prisoners is contrary to international standards relating the case that an American prisoner in Australia home state. It would be inappropriate for, as matter, any state Attorney-General-to be overly applying to return home if that prisoner, with wanted to return home. The next aspect, in recommendation 6 of mechanism, and I think that is appropriate-indeed, be some initial teething problems with perhaps the best of their ability, if I can put it that at what steps can be taken to get everyone It must be said that it is probably an area party, but it is just one of those acts of parliament origins under the former government, but the up the issue with some expedition; and obviously as appropriate, even though there are probably would be very concerned if any state authority votes in it for us, so why should we cooperate?' indeed.

I should say that the explanatory memorandum little cost implication for the legislation, of the number of foreign prisoners in our gaols in foreign gaols, on one view we have the because, in theory, more would desire to return their home gaols as acceptable.

I suppose it had its current Attorney-General has well and truly taken both sides of the House regard the legislation no votes in it at the end of the day.

He took the opportunity Australian embassy to thank them for all their not caused them any embarrassment by his escape. and warmth that he had for their efforts. It is clear that our Australian missions devote prisoners.

(4) How do the figures for Australia compare with known international figures? Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Suicide data are collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) based on the findings of State and Territory Coroners. (2) A suicide is considered a youth suicide if it is in the 15-24 year age range. (3) (a) A variety of definitions of rural and urban locations have been used by various researchers and data collection agencies for particular studies. The following tables are based upon defining a Statistical Local Area as rural if it has less than 20,000 inhabitants. (b) Tables containing relevant available data for Australian and Victorian urban and rural youth suicide comparisons follow. No data is available for the years 1985 and 1980. Data for the period 1993 to 1996 is not yet available in publishable form. No information was held in my Department regarding youth suicide rates for the electoral division of Wannon.

Australia's reported suicide rate for young women was 15th highest amongst the same 45 countries. Australian youth suicide rates remain amongst the highest in the western industrialised world. Services: Discharged Personnel (Question No. 1165) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) Have personnel been discharged from the Services in relation to the Chief of the General Staff Directive on Army Individual Readiness and the Chief of the Air Staff Directive on Royal Australian Air Force Fitness Policy; if so, for each month of 1996 (a) how many personnel were discharged, (b) what rank did each hold and (c) from which Service did each come. (2) Have personnel been advised that they will be discharged; if so, (a) how many, (b) at what rank and (c) from which Service. (3) How many personnel by rank, who have been, or will be, discharged have (a) full entitlement to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and (b) been given or offered redundancy packages. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Army timetable for implementation of the Chief of the General Staff Directive 24/96 on Army Individual Readiness allows for the completion of implementation by 12 December 1997. Accordingly, no personnel have discharged from the Army to date as a result of that Directive, and none will be recommended for discharge before full implementation and consideration of individual circumstances. However, the Chief of the Air Staff Directive 3/96 on Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Fitness Policy was effective on and from 1 June 1996, and members have been discharged as a consequence of the Directive. (a)(b)(c) RAAF personnel discharged pursuant to the terms of the Chief of the Air Staff Directive 3/96 are as follows: 1996 June Nil July Corporal-l Leading AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-l August Corporal-l September Sergeant-l October Flight Sergeant-l Corporal-l Leading AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-2 November Sergeant-2 Corporal--4 Leading AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-2 AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-l December Corporal-6 Leading AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-8 AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-l 1997 January Flight Lieutenant-l Flight Sergeant-l Corporal-l Leading AircraftmanlAircraftwoman--4 AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-3 February Warrant Officer-l Corporal-2 Leading AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-3 AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-l Note: The Directive on RAAF Fitness Policy focussed specifically on deployability, whereas medical/fitness requirements existing before the Directive were of a more general nature. To put the foregoing figures in their proper perspective, it is assessed by RAAF personnel staff that some 90% of the personnel who have been discharged under the new Directive, since June 1996, would also have been discharged under the pre-existing policy, had not the Directive been implemented. This assessment is based on the nature of the known medical condition(s) in each case. A similar percentage would apply to the following figures relating to personnel who have been advised that they will be discharged. (2) Yes. (a)(b)(c) RAAF personnel effected are as follows: Wing Commander-l Flight Lieutenant-3 Flight Sergeant--4 Sergeant-7 Corporal-II Leading AircraftmanlAircraftwoman-14 Aircraftman!Aircraftwoman-l (3)(a) Of the foregoing, 16 are, or were, members of the Defence Force Retirement and Death BenBenefit Refund of contributions plus gratuity (class C invalidity, less than 20 years service) Invalidity pension class B or class A invalidity Retired pay (class C invalidity, more than 20 years service) (b) None of the members shown in part (1) (a)(b)(c) redundancy package.

Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) & (2) (a) & (b) Commonwealth Supported Accommodation Assistance Act funding, allocated to the States and Territories during the period 1990-91 to 1996-97, was as follows ($'m): 92-93 93-94 94-95 95-96 96-97(est) 3l.856 36.018 18.230 57.067 39.844 2l.554 23.155 24.249 26.395 29.635 15.195 15.666 15.942 17.317 17.557 8.474 8.734 4.446 14.473 10.240 8.696 8.623 8.679 12.221 10.806 3.475 3.767 3.739 3.838 3.930 2.415 2.545 2.594 2.827 2.892 3.037 3.174 4.269 3.519 3.718 94.702 101.682 82.148 137.657 118.622 (c) The information requested is not available. Nationally, it is estimated that some 28% or around $59m of total 1996-97 program funds ($21Om) will be expended in respect of women's domestic violence refuges. (3) This information requested is not available. SAAP is administered by the States, and they do not keep information on bed places. The availability of beds is not restricted to properties operated by SAAP agencies, but is handled more flexibly by utilising a range of accommodation types on a purchase as needed basis. (4) The new SAAP Data Collection, which commenced on I July 1996 incorporates provision for an annual unmet demand survey. The first of these surveys was conducted in November 1996. The results are currently being analysed and will be published in March 1997 as part of the reports on the first six months of the collection. (5)(a) Yes. (b) Yes. Following a tendering process, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare was contracted to undertake the role of National Data Collection Agency.
