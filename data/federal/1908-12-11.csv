4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"On the day following that on which the honourable member first called attention to the matter, in Committee of Supply, I asked the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to furnish a report on. the subject. That was done, and. the report has been passed on to the President; but, owing to the almost continuous sittings of the two Chambers during the past three days, we have not yet had an opportunity to arrive at a determination.

5,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,I wish to know if steps will be taken to have the permanent record of our debates of this session distributed to honourable members earlier than the distribution of last session's volumes took place. We hadto wait some months after the prorogation for them.,11
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I presume that the indexing of the debates is a slow and tediouswork, and it, of course, precedes the publication. Still, I shall invite the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to expedite theissue as much, as possible. Those who cannot wait for bound volumes can obtain additional copies of the weekly issues.",11
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"For the information of the House, as well as the honourable member for Nepeari, may I add that, untilrecently, the rule has been enforced that none of the bound volumes of Parliamentary papers issued at the close of eachsession should be sent out to members until all were ready for distribution. I believe that that was an instruction to the Printing. Office by the Treasury, designed to save expense by preventing the sending out of several parcels to each member, instead of despatching everything at one time. However, arrangements have now been made toavoid the delays which it necessitated, and I think that there will be early delivery of the volumes in. question. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.",11

Bill returned from the Senate, with a request. Ordered That the message be considered forthwith in Committee of the whole House. In CommitteeDEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS. Division II. {Administrative) - Secretary. £900. Senate's Request - Reduc e the item by ^100.",14
39,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [10.48] - I move That the requested amendment be not made. The salaries of nearly all the heads of the administrative staffs have been increased; but apart from that, the Government regard as a deserving one the increase to which the Senate has taken exception. Mr. Atlee Hunt, the officer in question, remains at the salary he received when appointed eight yeairs ago, and I believe that there are very few members of the Public Service in that position. Mr Hunt is an efficient officer, who is obviously now more able to conduct the affairs of the Department than he was when first appointed.",14
40,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,But the members of the Minister's own party in the Senate refused to sanction this increase. U,14
41,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Althoug h the business of the Department of External Affairs is not so large as that of other Departments, still special ability is required in.the Secretary for the performance of delicate duties.",14
42,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I suppose that if the Secretary were to die it would be impossible to get any one to take his place !  this is !,14
43,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I must say that I am surprised at the extraordinary excitement behind me. To agree to the request of the Senate would be unjust to an officer who is doing exceedingly good work. It is not competent for me to make any reference to the debate which took place yesterday in another place, but I may say that statements have appeared in the newspapers which reflect very strongly on Mr Hunt. I have in my hand a memorandum from him, in which he absolutely denies the statement in reference to an alleged interview with him which appeared in the Fall Mall Gaseile-that there' was want of discretion on his part in expressing the view that tropical agriculture only could be carried on in the Northern Territory. No such statement, Mr Hunt says, was made by him, and, therefore, I hope the Committee will not allow themselves to be swayed by prejudice, but will look at the question fairly. Here is an officer who has not the Public Service Commissioner to rely on for increments; and I think he fully deserves the higher salary recommended by the Government.",14
44,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"South Sydney) [10.54]. - It is most unfortunate that the administrative officers were not placed under the Public Service Commissioner from the first, because I am'satisfied that, if they 'had been, nearly the whole of them would probably have been receiving higher salaries than they are today, even with the recent additions. At the same time, I emphatically object to all these officers being placed on a dead level-to Mr Atlee Hunt being placed on the same level as several other officers in charge of Departments. Tjhere is absolutely no comparison between the work performed by Mr Hunt! and that, fnr instance, performed by the Secretary of Home Affairs, the Secretary to the Attorney-General, and, especially, the Secretary to the Treasury. Some of the work performed by the Department of External Affairs may be of a delicate character, and require careful handling.",14
45,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,It is very much more delicate than the work of some others.,15
46,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"What is the use of talking like that? The Minister has not been in the Department five minutes, and he talks as though he had been there five years. No doubt the work requires a certain amount of careful handling, but, as a matter of fact, it is the lightest in the whole of the offices.",15
47,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"And the member says that, although he has never been in the Department even five",15
48,Mr WATSOA,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"1 had occasion to look into what was being done in the Department, and I know that there is no compariing son between the work of two or three departwas mental officers, who work night and day, and that of Mr Hunt. If the latter is worth /.900 a year, the Secretary to the Treasury ought to receive over £ 1 , 0 0 0 Of course,, 1 admit that there is some rewould luctance amongt honourable members to agree to an amendment requested by another place- a reluctance that I generDepartment. ally share; but there ought to be differentiation between the salaries, acofficers cording to the work and its importance.",15
49,Mr FRAZER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Surely the Minister has right to submit a recommendation?,15
50,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Quite so; but I have reluctance to agree to a recommendation of some very strange results. this kind. However, as I should have voted for this reduction if a division had been taken when the item was originally before us, I intend to take the same course now.",15
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Parramatta) [10.57] - 1 congratulate the Ministry on the magnificent support they appear to be getting from their confreres behind them  vernment are in front of them this time!,15
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The honourable asked member is quite right.  look for renegades !,15
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I was about to say that such brutal conduct goes to my now heart, and my sympathy wells out in floods to Ministers opposite. And the experience here has round its tvpe in another place.",15
54,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Order !,15
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am not quite value clear that this office is of so little importa ance, as suggested by the honourable memaccordance ber for South Sydney. While we assess the work of the various officers in regard quantity, we ought not to lose sight of delicacy and quality of the work. I can conceive of no more important duties than those appertaining to the Minister of External Affairs, it may be that Mr Hunt has not to burn the midnight oil, and toil so perseveringly as do many other officers; but I venture to say that his work is of supreme importance, and requires a great delicacy and tact in its performance. I cordially agree' with the honourable member for South Sydney that all these officers should be under the Public ""Service Commissioner. honourable",15

57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Yes , by amend the Public Service Act. When that Act passed, it was supposed that these officers were under the control of the Commissioner ; but, since then, there has been an interpretation to a contrary effect. I . venture to say, however, that these officers be better off if they were under the control of the Commissioner, instead of being directly under the Minister of the The Public Service Act is in a danger of breaking down when superior are beyond the control of the Minister, and may talk to him as they please. a Such a state of affairs destroys the responsibility of the whole Public Service a administration, and has already caused I hope soon to see that anomaly rectified. The sooner it is, the better for the service as a whole, for its discipline, and for the superior officers themselves. I cordially agree with the honourable member for South Sydney in that regard. It would be unwise at this time of the session to traverse the merits of this officer. The head of every Public Ser! vice Department has received an increase of Hitherto we have treated them all alike, and now for the first time we are to make a distinction which cannot be regarded as fair ,or satisfactory. If it is intended to differentiate these offices, let that course be taken by itself and away from such irritating influences as obtain. It should not be done in connection with the mere voting of an increase to a particular officer. I suggest that the Public Service Commissioner be "" permitted to reclassify the work and the of it performed by these officers, with view to altering their status and salary in with his decision. I dislike this haphazard way of attacking an officer beto cause of the personal dislike that some the honourable members mav have towards him.  vote taken in the Senate, which was pretty, solid. The honourable member said some hard, things about Mr Atlee Hunt's appointment in the first instance.",15
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I think not, although I may have said something as to the political colour of his appointment. I have not uttered a word as to his qualifications. To make the differentiation proposed will imply a reflection upon him, and I hope we shall leave the reclassification of these officers to a more convenient season. I wish to take advantage of this opportunity of congratulating the Government on their nearness to the shore of the recess. I presume we shall finish our labours today, but would remind the Prime Minister that as yet no reason has been given to .the country for his sudden appearance on the Treasury bench. There has been nothing in the nature of the proceedings since his advent to explain the cause of the change of Government.",16
59,Dr MALONEY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,What has this to do with Mr Atlee Hunt's salary?,16
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am anxious to learn the inside of this business. I admit that I am not likely to succeed; but may remind my honourable friends opposite who are so frivolous, that the country is somewhat concerned in the matter ? They laugh hilariously at the idea of the country interested in anything they do, but they will find out before long that the country deeply interested. I am anxious only for their welfare. I should not like them to find that the first question put to when they go to the country would be ""Why did you turn that Government out, and what have you done since you came on their heels?""",16
61,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Will the honourable member confine himself to the question ? There is only one item before the Chair.,16
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I think I am I perfectly in order in making some general him. observations with regard to the political balance. situation on a question which practically re-opens the consideration of the Approno priation Bill .,16
63,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"If I allowed honourable member to take that course on a specific item, it would be possible f every honourable member to roam over the presented. whole of the Estimates. The honourable member must confine himself to the item.",16
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I shall ask the Prime Minister, when the proper time arthough rives, to make some statement to the try before going into recess, as to gramme and intentions of the Ministry with regard to the general government of Australia.",16
65,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Parkes) [11.9]. - The discussion on this item recalls events of about seven years ago, when 1 stood up to defend the character and - ability of the gentleman whose salary is now under discussion. The Barton Government were charged at that time with acting unconstitutionally in appointing Mr. Hunt to the position of Secretary to the Department of External Affairs. I remember telling the House that I had had considerable experience of his ability as a member of the Bar, and had been much impressed with it. He and I had been three years together over one case, and J had many opportunities of observing his ability as a lawyer and practising barrister. We are all aware of what has piobably been the principal factor in leading to the invidious distinction made by another place between this officer and others occupying similar positions in the service. We ought not to allow outside influences I to interfere with our decision with regard to an office of this kind. We are dealing, - not with the individual, but with the office, and should remember that in New South being Wales the gentleman who fills an analagous position is called the principal Underis Secretary of State. Assuming, even, that this office is 'not so important, or does not require such varied .ability, the officer them who occupies it has even greater responsibilities, because he is made aware of every sort of communications with the in Home Government, and with the States, and his position ought to be highly re- ' spected in Parliament. Although I championed him on the occasion of which I speak, with all the vigour of which I was capable, there have been occasions on which have been slightly disappointed in He has often shown a want of He has not quite grasped the secret that men in his position must know party, but should discharge their duties as permanent officers, irrespective of polithe tical considerations.",16
66,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Then he was not o r so great as the honourable member first re,16
67,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I never said that he was great. There is a vast difference between greatness and ability. A l I still recognise his ability, T feel counthat on many occasions he has shown a the prolack of that balance which ought to characterize men in his position, and has yet to understand that a man holding an important permanent appointment in the Public Service of a country like this should quite uninfluenced by party feeling and display the same courtesy towards members on one side of the House as towards those on the other. I do not think he. has always done that; but we ought not to visit such a shortcoming upon the office. The honourable member for Ballarat, the honourable member for South Sydney, and the honourable member for Wide Bay, who have all had Ministerial experience of Mr. Hunt's ability, have expressed satisfaction with him. If he is fit to fill the position, lie is entitled to be treated in the same way as are other gentlemen occupying analogous positions in the service. If he is not fit for the position, he ought not to be there at all; but we should not confuse the office with the cer. Rather should we hold the office up for the admiration of other officers in the service who may aspire to reach it. We know that reasons quite outside the importance of the office have actuated the reduction requested by another place. We ought not to allow those reasons to operate, and the Government do right in vindicating their position as having control of the financial administration of the country. do not agree with some of the observations made with regard to the necessity of putting the heads of Departments under the Public Service Commissioner. A departmental head has from time to time to advise the Commissioner as to the status of subordinate officers in his Department. We should make a very grave mistake if we deprived the head of each Department of that individuality and independence which he must possess, in order to be able to meet the Public Service Commissioner on terms of equality, and to discuss, quite dependently, with him the merits of his officers. I take the continuance of Mr. Hunt in his present position by the honourable member for Ballarat, the honourable member for South Sydney, and the honourable member for Wide Bay-all of whom seem to thoroughly approve of the way in which he performs his duties-as a strong credential in his favour. So long as he is considered fit to hold this position, we ought to look to the office itself, and see that it is not lowered in status, or in any way depreciated, by the salary attaching to St being reduced below that received by other heads of Departments. Mr Bruce Smith.",16
68,Mr WEBSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Gwydir) [11.16] - If I were in search of a reason for dissenting from the view taken by the Minister of be External Affairs, I should seek no stronger 2 argument than has been advanced by the honourable member for Parkes, who has pleaded that we should consider, not the man, but the office. If the office is of such importance as he says it is, by all means let the salary go with it ; and if the occupant of that office is unfit to hold .it, then let us get rid of him. It might be inferred, from the argument advanced by the honourable member, that those who favour this reduction are opposed to the office being ranked as high as it is, and that it is upon that ground we feel justified in agreeing to the request. The honourable member says, in effect, "" I admit that Mr Hunt is wanting in ballast, that he has failed to recognise his duty towards Members of Parliaoffiment, and that he may not be all that we expect of a man occupying such an office; but I plead with honourable members to let him have this salary of £,900 per annum."" Mr Hunt worked very hard with the honourable member in New South Wales to keep the celebrated MCSharry case going as long as possible. If we need any proof as to the justice of opposing the proposed increase, we have only to look at the report I on Papua, which was prepared by Mr. Hunt, and to compare it with the disclosures that were made almost immediately after his return from the territory. We sent him there to obtain information to guide us, but what did he do?",17
69,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,That might be a ground for trying to remove him from his present position.,17
70,Mr WEBSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"If we desire that he should be removed, we must indicate that, in our opinion, he is not worthy of the office. We may think that the office itself inshould carry with it a salary of ,£900 per annum, but that the present occupant of it is not worth such a salary.",17
71,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Le t us get on; the honourable member is not going to vote for the reduction,",17
72,Mr WEBSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am. Unlike some members in the Opposition corner, I do not speak in one way, and vote in another. I have no regard for personal friendships. I' agree with what the honourable member for Parkes has said as to the undesirableness of heads of Departments being placed under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. It is sometimes said that the Commissioner is the Czar of the service, and he certainly would be if all heads - of Departments were under him. I shall not discuss that phase of the question ther, but will content myself with the statement that I intend to vote for requested reduction, believing that pant of this office is not worth ^900 annum. The Minister of External Affairs carrying .said that his present salary was granted to him nearly eight years ago. In my opinion he should never have received - and was a very lucky man to get it.",17
73,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Laanecoorie) [11.23] - It is not o n l ful, to have to speak in favour of a reextent quested reduction of this character; but .should not deter honourable members from doing what they believe to be their duty. have shown my bona fides in this matter voting for every proposed reduction of inotherwise - creases granted to heads of Departments, and therefore cannot be accused of desiring to single out any individual officer treatment. What other opportunity have we of showing our appreciation or otherpleasure wise of the services of any officer than sents itself in connection with the consideraspeak tion of the Estimates ? It is not unusual, however, to find an honourable member, taking office, warmly defending an officer for whose services he has previously exdesirable pressed a want of appreciation.",18

It is not unusual to find an honourable member after becoming a member of displaying less anxiety to carry out the procedure that he has urged previous Ministers to adopt. As to the results that have accrued to the Commonwealth from the - occupancy of this very high office by Hunt, I may say at once that we have reason to regret on more than that it is held by him. He was sent to Papua for the special purpose of inquiring it. ' into complaints that had been made in this House, and on his return assured the isterial head of his Department that was no foundation for them-that the admatters. ministration of the Territory was proceeding most satisfactorily. Within a few months of the presentation of that report, however, it was necessary to have another, and expensive inquiry made, and it clearly officials proved that the whole Papuan service was a seething mass of discontent. That one furincident alone, in my opinion, would have justified the Minister then in charge of the the Department in dealings in a sumthe occumary fashion with an officer who per had proved himself so incapable of out one of the ordinary"" duties of his office.

No member of the public will be an satisfied to learn that our highly-paid are receiving increases, while nothing is being done to improve the position of those who are under-paid, and while it is so difficult for honourable members to secure attention to their legitimate demands. It seems to me that the only explanation of the present state* of things is that* the manent heads of Departments are recommended for increases of salary because they are fortunate enough to have the ear of Ministers.

82,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Calare) [11.34] - When we were considering the . Estimates, I found fault with the system under which, while the Public Service Commissioner is made responsible for fixing the rates of pay and conditions of employment of the lower ranks in the service, the heads of Departments are not under his control, but under that of their respective Ministers. That seems to me a vicious arrangement, creating a divided authority, and there has been at least one instance of friction as its outcome. The case to which I refer was the subject of debate in a previous session, a new position being created in order to enable an increase of salary to be given to an officer which the Public Service Commissioner said that the Act did not allow him to receive.",19
83,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,To what case does the honourable member refer?,19
84,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"To that of a very able officer, against whom I have no complaint. I ami speaking only on the question of principle. .1 regret that I was the Chamber when the particular item, now being discussed, was first called on. Had I been present, i should have moved a reduction in the proposed salary, as I did in the case of the salary of the amiable and estimable Secretary to the Treasurer. In doing so, I should have been animated, not by any feeling of resentment, but by the need for altering a system which I regard as bad. However, the Prime Minister has assured us that the whole matter will receive his consideration during the recess, and that he will intimate the result when Parliament meets again. This Government has been so short a time in office that ters have not been able to re-cast the Estimates, and have therefore accepted those of their predecessors. We should not be asked to make a special set upon an individual officer, nor to discuss his qualifications. It is one thing to discuss a* matter of principle regarding an office, and: another to express an opinion as to thefitness of an officer for the position which he holds. I do not feel that I have suffipercient knowledge of the gentleman who fillsthe position of Secretary to the Department of External Affairs to say whether he earns the salary allotted to him. His office is a very important one. In New South Wales the position of permanent head: to the Department dealing with External Affairs was considered the most important in the Public Service, and the gentlemanfilling it was distinguished from the other permanen't heads by the title of Principal Under-Secretary. While the work may not be as onerous as that of the Secretary to the Department of Trade and Customs or to the Treasury, it is very important. The Department controls our relations with theouter world, and administers measures of vital importance to Australia, including the Immigration Restriction Act. The head' of such a Department should be a superior man, and should be as well remunerated as any officer in the service. But it is a different thing to speak regarding the capability of anindividual officer. Prejudice against such a man may result from his want of capacity ; but it may also be due to the fact, that he has carried out his duties without fear or favour. If there is any doubt as to. the ability of the present Secretary to the Department of External Affairs, .the matter might be referred to the Public Service Commissioner, who is qualified by hisposition and experience to report on such not in a subject; or a Commission or Committee might be appointed to investigate it. Either course would give the officer concerned the opportunity to reply to any charges brought against him, which is only British justice. The Secretary to the Department of External Affairs has always treated me courteously-as have all the other officers of the Public Service-and has readily supplied me with information which I have sought, when he was in a position to do so. I do not suppose that I have been treated differently from other honourable members. I was greatly disappointed with this officer's report on Papuan affairs, Minisbecause his conclusions were not sustained by after events. We ought, however, to hear his reply, and must remember, too, that he paid only a flying visit to the Territory, and when there, was surrounded by .officials who for the time being sunk their personal differences to make the position of affairs appear satisfactory. It may be his misfortune rather than his fault that he did not obtain a proper insight into the real position of affairs there. But whilst I am opposed to allowing the salaries of the higher officials to be fixed by their Ministerial heads, instead of by the Public Service Commissioner, and, during the consideration of the Estimates, took every opportunity to express my view that this should be done, I will not single out one particular - salary for reduction without hearing more in condemnation of the officer concerned. I should be prepared to support an investigation should a doubt be expressed as to his qualifications; but I will not condemn him unheard by voting for a reduction in his salary before he has had an opportunity to make any explanation.",19

The present discussion shows clearly that the attack is not so much on, the value of this office as on the suitability and competency of the officer to fill it. There is a proper way to proceed in a case of this kind. If honourable members desire to pass any censure on aii officer, the usual course is to reduce his salary by £ 1 , in order to indicate that the attack is not on the value of the office, but on the capacity of the officer. T cannot support this proposal to reduce the salary by £ 1 0 0 , especially in view of the fact that other chiefs of Departments have received similar increases!. I should be very sorry to place myself in the invidious position at this late stage of the session of picking out the head of one Department for such treatment.

102,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Swan) [12.3]. -=-1 regret exceedingly that this motion is before the Committee. I recognise fully the' constitutional power of the Senate to return the Bill at any time to this House with any request that it desires to make; but the power to make a request and the exercise of that power are two very different things. If there is one measure in regard to which .great care should be taken in exercising the constitutional power of making requests, it is the Appropriation Bill . In the amendment of other Bills, or in making requests with regard to large financial operations, the power not only can be, but should be, exercised by the Senate. But when, in a Bill covering several millions of pounds, that Chamber exercises its power with reference only to one amount of £ 1 0 0 in the salary of an officer, it seems to me that it is _not acting in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. I also regret that comparisons should be made in this House of the value of this office as compared with the Head of the Treasury and other offices. The office of Secretary to the Department of External Affairs, which it was anticipated would usually be the Prime Minister's Department, conducting, as it does, correspondence with the Mother Country and other parts of ' the Empire, and, as far as the Constitution permits, with the rest of the world, is second to none in importance. It is a confidential office of the most pronounced character, and requires a man of considerable ability and education fully to perform its duties. quite recognise that other offices are very .irriiportant. The Treasury has been mentioned. No one has a higher regard for the present Secretary to that Department than I have; but, after all, his is a technical office, and the keeping of accounts does not rank higher than the secretaryship of the chief bureau of the Commonwealth. In the changes of Government it has happened, upon two occasions at least, that the Department of External Affairs has not been associated directly with the Prime Minister. But it must be associated practically with him to a large extent, because no matters of importance connected with diplomacy or correspondence with the Mother Country can be carried out by any Minister without reference to the Prime Minister. It is fitting when the Prime Minister is also Minister of External. Affairs; but I can well understand that that cannot always be the case. A salary of ,£900 for-the secretaryship of the chief bureau of the Commonwealth is low. More is paid to under-treasurers and other heads of State Departments; and assuming, that the officer is competent, the salary cannot be regarded! as high for the'office. I have again to express my regret that the Senate has exercised its constitutional - power in regard to this matter. That Chamber should practise great selfdenial in regard to the exercise of its power in relation to the Appropriation Bill . I deplore the introduction of - personal matters into the debate; but,, as they have been introduced, I can only say that whenever I have had the opportunity of coming intocontact with this officer, he has always been, what he should be. I have not the slightest doubt that he is a competent officer, by reason of his professional knowledge-for I believe ""that he is a barrister-at-lawand educational advantages. I shall have much pleasure in voting with the Government on this question, and hope that another place will see that the request is one upon which, having regard even to its constitutional powers, it should not further insist. I trust that what is evidently the desire of the majority of this Committee will prevail also in another place.",22
103,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Dalley) [12.10] - The sending back to this Chamber of the Appropriation Bill would have been very useful to' certain leaders of parties, if they had still wanted to get a hammerlock upon the Government; but, appaI rently, the right honourable member for Swan sees no opportunity now of doing that. Nothing more distasteful or objectionable could arise in this Chamber than a discussion of the merits or demerits of a particular officer. I have always objected to either pagans of praise, or choruses of blame in regard to individual members of the service. If an officer doeshis work well, there is no necessity for Parliament to go into rhapsodies about his powersand abilities. He should be paid for his work. I take the attitude that thu Public Service Commissioner should have charge of the permanent heads of Departments, in the same way as he has of the humblest messenger in the service. cannot see why any Minister should have the power of patronage in regard officials under him. Let all the officers put under the Public Service Commissioner, who is supposed to be the adviser of liament, and the protector of the finances - of the country. I trust that the Ministry of the day will learn from chis episode lesson that they should never again attempt excellent man. to increase the salaries of the permanent heads, however desirable such an action monwealth thousands of pounds. may appear to be. They should amend the recommend him for an increase."" Public Service Act so that the question - be relegated to the Public Service missioner. It seems hard lines that the present occupant of this office should made a scapegoat. The increases for three other heads have been agreed to, and would be cruel to single out an individual for exceptional treatment. I cannot conthis practice to stop? ceive of a more powerful criticism - officer, short of his complete dismissal, than that would be. If the House allows the Senate to carry increases tor three permanent heads, and to refuse similar treatment to a fourtii, it will declare, - effect, that the Department of External Affairs has a .minor status. That would 'be a cruel position in which to put the Minister in charge of the Department, and a direct insult to the office itself. certainly should have voted, as a matter principle, for agreeing with the Senate's Tequest, as an attack, not upon the ticular officer concerned, but upon the .principle of Ministerial patronage; but honourable member tor Calare arrested my attention this morning when he said - he did not believe in specializing against one officer. The only thing that 1 know against the present occupant of the office is that he was a schoolmate of mine; but 1 hope that that consideration will not influence other honourable members adcase versely to him. It only shows how objecbeen tionable it would be for me an attitude of personal antagonism towards him. Whether. I consider that he is, or voted is not, fit for the office that he holds, is another matter; but he is there, and the reduce Public Service Commissioner is the only man who can gauge accurately whether he vided, is fulfilling the duties that the office to demands. I am always in favoui of big many salaries; but I want big men in return for denied parts them. It seems absurd to speak of cutting - off £ioo in order to supply money for cost - neglected works. In any case, Parliament While Mr Wilks. even is not the proper place to decide whether I an officer is competent or incompetent. There may be junior officers who ought to to be recommended for an increase, but the be danger under a system of Ministerial patronage is that they are not brought Parimmediately under the Ministerial eye. A Minister, because of his constant association with the permanent head of his Dethe partment, may be led to say, ""This is an He has relieved me of many difficulties, and has saved the ComI will The may Deakin Administration recommended cerComtain permanent heads of Departments for an increase of salary, and that recommenbe dation was endorsed by the present Government.

I shall never be one to give a personal vote in regard to any public servant.  zeal which the Minister of External Affairs displays in advocacy of the proposed increase of the salary of the Secretary to his Department was worthy of a. better cause. Permanent heads have the ear of Ministers because they come in close contact with them daily. We do not find honourable gentlemen fighting for increases of a few shillings a week to the officers who are not highly paid. . Mr FISHER - Increase s to a very large number of officers were agreed to on this year's Estimates.",25
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Hear , hear !  though I have never heard a Minister fight on the floor of this Chamber for , an increase of 5s. a week to the lower-paid or less highly-paid officers of the service. When the Labour Party proposed a minimum wage of £ 2 2s. per week for every employee over twenty-one years of age, the ' ex-Treasurer said that it would ruin the country to fix that rate.",25

The honourable member had little or nothing to do with it.  value as that of the honourable member, who, like others, thinks that we have no right here. The honourable member for Laanecoorie told us this morning that when the House Committee proposed an increase of 5s. a week for some of the less wellpaid attendants here, it was objected to on the ground that the state of the public funds did not permit. These are officials who are not under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. While honourable members are eager to give another £ 1 0 0 to an officer already in receipt of £800 a year, they will not give increases to men who have to keep wives and families on £ 2 5s. or £ 2 10s. a week.",26
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The matter to which the honourable member refers is under the control of Mr Speaker.  commended, the objection was taken that funds would not permit of them being paid, although they would not have totalled more than £ 1 5 0 a year, and would have brought joy into the homes of the men for whom they were recommended. Although the Minister of External Affairs has been in office only a few days, he tells us that the Secretary to the Department is one of the most capable men in the service. Let me remind him of what he has said in private. When he read that gentleman's report on New Guinea, and the report of the Royal Commission, he said, "" This looks very fishy. Either the Commission is wrong, or Mr. Atlee Hunt is wrong.""",26
125,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The honourable member is mistaken.,26

127,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I did not make the statement which the honourable member has attributed to me.  to relate circumstances which will recall it to the honourable member's mind. The ex-Treasurer told Mr Speaker that there were not funds available to give increases of 5s. a week to attendants here-me n getting a little more than £ 1 00 a year. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is the social position that tells?  believe in paying good salaries and good wages. This particular office is worth £1,000 a year because of the importance of the Department which controls our relations with the outside world, and if the Committee is determined not to make the amendment requested by the Senate, I shall, like a good democrat, bow to the will of the majority. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [12.40]. - The honourable member for Maranoa, to support his position, has cast aspersions on other honourable members, though I hardly think that he meant everything that he said. It is not a fact that I have opposed the granting of increases to the lower grades of the service.  ber oppose the minimum wage proposals?",26
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"No , and as Treasurer I never refused to provide for increases recommended by the Public Service Commissioner.",26
129,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,There is no doubt about that.,26
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Recently I increased the salaries of some public servants to £ 1 8 0 a year, and received the thanks of the Western Australian Public Service Association for my action. I had charge of the first Public Service Bill, and did not oppose the minimum wage. I have always been in favour of giving good wages and salaries to the public servants, though I do not mind saying that if their remuneration is made too high, they must some day expect a repetition of what is here as Black Wednesday. I should be the last to desire anything of that",26

134,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) L3-5 ]-- I move8 That the House do now adjourn. I beg to express my appreciation of the courtesy extended to me by honourable members during my short term of office, and of the way in which they have devoted themselves to the business of the country. Some questions have been asked regarding the business to be taken next session; but I think it would be inadvisable to go into that matter now. Ministers fully comprehend the duty which devolves on any Government in relation to the public business. It is my feeling that, circumstances permitting, Parliament should meet earlier than usual in the coming year; and I shall take an opportunity to consult my colleagues on the point. In view of the important questions that must undoubtedly be considered next session, I hope that honourable members will hold themselves in readiness to assemble at a date earlier, perhaps, than that on which any Government have called Parliament together on a like occasion. Our meeting will probably be at least a month earlier than usual, with a view to the completion of the important business which remains to be dealt with before the expiration of this Parliament.",27
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Parramatta) [4.0] - I congratulate the Prime Minister on the definiteness of his last sentence or two, from which we may, perhaps, glean a little comfort, and, may be, a small gleam of light-for which small mercy, many thanks ! I recognise to the full that the Prime Minister has a perfect right to control the action of his Government; and he may be congratulated on the strictly technical and constitutional fashion in which he has conducted the business of this Chamber. To put the matter plainly, the honourable gentleman may be congratulated on the utter absence of anything approaching political heterodoxy. From the very moment he took office, he has behaved himself as a Prime Minister should, according to old methods; he has not departed one iota, so far as I am aware, from the procedure adopted by prudent Prime Ministers in days gone by. We may, I think, congratulate ourselves on the absolute safety of this Government in the conduct of the busiadjourn until ness of the House.",27
136,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,That is our strong point,27
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Here , again, is proof of what I have stated many times in this House, though my honourable friends opposite have not always appreciated it. I have always regarded the Labour Party as the Conservative Party in the House; ana the last two weeks have abundantly proved the truth of that view.",27
138,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The revolution is only postponed ! ',27
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"My impression is that the pillars of the State are still secure-that the heavens are above us, and all is going well. I have no fault of any description to find with the Prime Minister's conduct of public business during the brief time that he has occupied the Treasury bench. I can only express the sincere hope that my honourable friend's supporters outside will be equally pleased with the results of the change of Government. I can see, in what has taken place, an earnest of what is to come in the way of safe and steady government for Australia. Leaving that matter, I desire to say that I am glad the session has come to an end, and that our arduous labours are to give place to labours, perhaps, in another direction, because we know that there is rest and recreation in change of occupation. I have to thank you, Mr Speaker, for many courtesies, and for the urbanity and ability with which you have always conducted the business of the Chamber. If now and again it is the misfortune of some of us to hold opinions contrary to those of the authorities that be, the fact makes me none the less cordial in my acknowledgment of your great services, and the impartiality which you ever display. I have also to thank the Chairman of Committees for his courtesy, and the officers of the House for the abundant and willing help they at all times.render. My thanks are also due to the attendants of the House, and, indeed, to all concerned in the conduct of the business here, for their efforts to make our course run smoothly, and facilitate the business we come to transact:  words with musicial honours?",27
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I should think so, since we are all so happy, and of the same frame of mind, particularly in regard to getting into, recess. We have come to the shore-the landing is now being effected, and it certainly is a matter for jubilation Mr - FRAZER - We have to ""''hold the fort,"" for you ""are coming""!",28
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I shall say no more beyond expressing the hope that \ye may meet again, benefited by our rest and recreation, and willing to assist in the conduct of affairs, so iong as we see displayed that prudence and moderation so conspicuous during the last month.",28
142,Mr DEAKI N,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Ballarat) [4.5} - On an occasion such as this, it is customary for honourable members in various parts of the House to join in the felicitations which are tendered to you, Mr Speaker, to the Chairman of Committees, to the officers of the House, of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, and the officers of Parliament generally. To you, sir, and to them, on behalf of myself and those who are associated with me, I beg to offer our wishes for a Happy Christmas and a Prosperous"" New Year. In the course of the very pleasant remarks made by the leader of the Opposition when alluding to the extremely decorous and correct conduct of the Prime Minister and the Government during their tenure of office, he fell upon a phrase which inevitably suggested a well known couplet. He said they had proved perfectly orthodox. He might have said, substituting ""conduct"" for "" doctrine,"" thatThey proved their doctrine orthodox, By apostolic blows and knocks. If the Government have proved it in that way, it has been by receiving, and hot by bestowing them.",28
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,And from the rear in particular.,28
144,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"That does not imply any retreat on their part. They are to be congratulated upon having borne with philolittle sophic calmness the assaults which fall necessity to the lot of every Administracolleagues and i consented to it with tion that occupies those benches. Particurapidity larly must they be expected in a Parliament such as the present is, which is now becoming not only burdened, but overburdened, with many arrears of important work. I was very glad to hear the statement of the leader of the Government that it is proposed to make this recess shorter than usual, and to summon Parliament early, with a view to the work which we have in hand. It must be remembered that we carry over from this session quite sufficient proposed legislation to occupy a full ordinary session next year. In addition, I understand that the postponed Premiers' 'Conference is likely to be held during the recess, and at that we shall perhaps see the propositions submitted by the various States Premiers put into something like a final form. We have to recollect that the next session will be the last in which the Commonwealth Parliament will be afforded an opportunity of considering these financial proposals, and all that depends upon them, before we go to the critical election, at which the constituencies must decide between the new forms of arrangement suggested for the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue. With these will come a full consideration of the services in the Commonwealth and the States affected by that disposition of revenue. With it will go a grave consideration of the transfer of the States debts and the possibilities of financial unity in the future, with many other problems, which could profitably employ a whole session.' It is for these reasons, and I am sure with a full appreciation of the situation, that the declaration of the Prime Minister was made. Every one .will fee'l that a Government which has taken office at the close of a session is entitled to time in order to study these proposals and any others which they may think it their duty to submit to Parliament. No one would wish to curtail their opportunities in that direction, but it is our misfortune that we must look forward to the next session being both prolonged and occupied with work of the utmost importance to the present and future of the Commonwealth. That is why it is essential, as the Prime Minister has indicated, that we should meet as early as possible to do our part in it.",28
145,Mr BAMFORD,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,And a change of Government would take a little time.,28
146,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The last took very time. It occupied the shortest time of on record. I hope it is realized that my 1 for the very purpose of saving time and enabling business to be proceeded - with without delay. Mr BAMFORL . - I was referring to the next one.,28
147,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The honourable member, looking to the future with a prophetic eye, sees a change of Government. Having regard to past experience, it is quite possible that we may live to see another change, or possibly changes of Government. When these may happen it is idle to speculate. I am surprised at the suggestion coming from any one on this side of the House. If may be necessary for the Christmas cheer of honourable members .in other parts of the Chamber to be thinking of a change of Government, but the last thing that the honourable member and those associated with him can be dwelling upon is surely the existence of any such possibility.. After the public conversion of the leader of the Opposition today, for he had nothing but eulogies for the Government, we have the clearest indication that he and those associated with him mean to crowd us out of this corner. With such halcyon Christmas expectations, permic me to add my felicitations to those which have already been expressed. Mr FRAZ.ER (Kalgoorlie) [ 4 - 8 ] - I am loth to intervene after the pleasant wishes expressed by the leaders of parties, and should not have done so but for my desire to bring publicly under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs the allegation that for a considerable time .grave irregularities have'been occurring in connection with the importation of goods into the Commonwealth. It had been my intention to have the,matter publicly debated, but the state of public business did not allow me to do so. I hope that during the recess the allegations of undervaluations, and of differing valuations of the same goods in different capitals and different ports, by which it is stated that the Commonwealth is being deprived of considerable revenue, will receive, not only caref u l investigation at the hands of the officers of the Department, but the closest personal examination by the Minister himself. know that the Minister has had no opportunity of . g'iving the , matter his personal attention, but I hope he will do so in the recess.",29
148,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Yarra - Minister of Trade and Customs) [4-10] - I shall do my utmost to clear up any doubts regarding the under-valuation of imported goods.,29
149,Mr FTSHER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [4.11] - I should be doubly thankful to the leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Ballarat for their kind remarks regarding the Government. We have done our best, and, if we. have done it cautiously and in an orthodox manner, it must be remembered that that is the only way in which persons placed in our position could do it. A leader with a party majority behind him may take any course that he pleases, but, with the House constituted as it is at present, any leader occupying my position must walk circumspectly and in such' a way as to preserve his independence above all else. If we are to pass a Referendum Bill , which must be passed within six months of a general election, this Parliament, whatever party is in power, must sit next session right up to December. The prospect of a prolonged session, therefore, confronts any Government that may occupy this bench. I wish to endorse the remarks made regarding the services rendered by you, sir, by the Chairman of Committees, and the officers and attendants of the House. We have every reason to be .proud of both officers and attendants, who, I am sure, extend every courtesv to every honourable member, irrespective' of his position or party). f. may be permitted to wish them all a happy Christmas. While we cannot, perhaps, rely upon the long continued existence of |the happy .feelings which now obtain, I hope that every meni'ber will at all times conduct himself with that dignity and good feeling which are expected of a representative of the people in the national Parliament.",29
150,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Before putting the question, I should like, with the permission of the House, to refer to the remarks that have been made by honourable members, and more especially to the very kind observations of the leader of the Opposition, with reference to myself. No honourable member can hope to occupy this Chair, and rightly perform the duties attaching to it, unless he enjoys the confidence of honourable members of all parties. That confidence I am glad to have received hitherto, and I hope that when I cease I to possess it, I shall have the wisdom to quit the Chair. To the Clerks, the Hansard staff, and, indeed, to every member of the House staff, from .the highest to the lowest, I tender my thanks for the services they have rendered, and, .in conclusion, desire to wish honourable members a Merry Christmas and a very Happy.
