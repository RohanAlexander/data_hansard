AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL 1943. PROPOSED AMENDMENTS .",13
9,Mr FROST,Unknown," by leave- I wish to announce that, since I made my second reading speech on the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill on the 17th February last, the Government has received a deputation from the Parliamentary Ex-service Men's Committeej which consists of returned soldier members of this Parliament. In consequence of the representations of the deputation, the Government has decided to extend certain of the proposed benefits, in some of them by way of an amendment of the act and others by way of regulations under the act. The majority of these were recommended by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Repatriation, which was appointed by the Government to inquire into repatriation legisThose matters, which will necessitate my moving amendments when the bill reaches the committee stage, are as follows:Removal of the means test as at present applied to war widows. This will mean that the minimum pension paid to a war widow will be £2 10s. a week. In order to remove any misunderstanding, it should be stated that the only means test now applied in connection with the pensions of war widows is in respect of widows without children who possess income from property exceeding £1 a week. Widows with children receive the maximum rate of pension without having to submit themselves to any means test. In respect of widows without children, although it has been the practice in the past to disregard all personal earnings, income from property exceeding £1 a week has been taken into account and the maximum rate of pension has been reduced by so much as the income from property has exceeded that sum; but in no instance, of course, has the pension been reduced below the statutory rate shown in the act. Notwithstanding this, the Government considers that the means test should be abolished in such cases. Extension to fifteen years of the time limit of seven years in connection with the wives of soldiers in the present war. This will mean that any wife who was married to a member of the present, forces prior to fifteen years after discharge of the member will be entitled to receive a war pension in respect of any incapacity suffered by the member due to war service, or to receive a pension in respect of her husband's death from war service. Any children born of such a marriage will be pensionable, notwithstanding the date of birth. A regulation will be introduced to allow of free medical or hospital treatment being given in respect of all disabilities suffered by members of the forces who are receiving a war pension at the general rate for total incapacity under the first schedule, or at a special rate under the second schedule. This, of course, will include those soldiers who are blinded, temporarily or permanently totally incapacitated, or suffering from tuberculosis. It will be necessary, however, in regard to this benefit to exclude certain diseases or conditions, and it has, therefore, heen decided that such treatment cannot be given for infectious or contagious diseases, venereal disease, unless it is contracted during the course of the member's service, mental disease, alcoholism, drug addiction, or chronic or incurable diseases requiring treatment for a prolonged period. It is the opinion of the Government that persons suffering from the above conditions, which are not attributable to war service, should avail themselves of the ordinary civil treatment. A regulation will also be introduced to give effect to the recommendation of the joint parliamentary committee that treatment, where necessary, and sustenance whilst undergoing treatment, will be given to all members who are suffering from venereal disease or its effects contracted on service. Mr Frost. Another request made by the Parliamentary Ex-servicemen's Committee was that additional assessment appeal tribunals be appointed. The Government has considered this matter, and in view of the fact that the act at present provides that such appeal tribunals as the Minister considers necessary may be appointed, it is not intended to make any alteration at this stage, but honourable members may rest assured that should such a position arise that the present Assessment Appeal Tribunal is unable to cope adequately with the number of appeals, immediate action will be taken iby the Minister to remedy the position by the appointment cf such additional tribunals as he thinks fit. It has also been decided that the Repatriation 'Commission shall appoint special boards in each State, consisting of independent specialists in pulmonary tuberculosis. These boards will review all claims in respect of this disease, including future cases aud those which have previously been rejected. It will not be necessary to amend the act to provide for the establishment of these boards or to introduce a. regulation, as it can be done quite easily as a matter of administration under the Government's instructions. I desire to point out that this plan will be put into operation as early as practicable, but I understand that the shortage of doctors is very acute throughout the Commonwealth, and it may mean that some difficulty will be experienced in obtaining the services of suitable specialists. Many of the cases previously dealt with, and those at present being dealt, with, have already been considered by specialists, but notwithstanding this the Government has acceded to the request of the Joint Parliamentary Committee and the Parliamentary Ex-servicemen's Committee that further investigation of these claims shall take place upon application.

11,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I assure the honourable member that in releasing the statement to the newspapers on Saturday last, I intended no discourtesy to him.

15,Mr HARRISON,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Has the Deputy Prime Minister seen a report in yesterday's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald in which Mr J. S. Garden, described as liaison officer between the Minister for Labour and National Service and the unions, addressing striking textile-workers at the Leichhardt Stadium, said that the strike had been worthwhile because for the first time in the history of trade unionism",15
16,Mr SPEAKER,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,Hon. W. M. Nairn). - Order ! Questions of this kind are becoming too frequent.,15
17,Mr HARRISON,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Havin g regard to the Prime Minister's threat that the Government would act if the employees failed to do certain things, will the Deputy Prime Minister, after consultation with the Prime Minister, order Mr. Garden's removal from his present position for inciting the workers to strike ?",15
18,Mr FORDE,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"I have not read the statement attributed to Mr J. S. Garden, but I know that the Minister for Labour and National Service played a very prominent part in bringing about a settlement of the textile-workers' strike. He is the responsible Minister at the head of his department, and I prefer to accept his view of the matter rather than that of a comparatively junior officer.",15
19,Mr WARD,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES," by leave-During the last sitting of the House several honourable members directed questions to me on the temporary stoppage of work in the textile industry. I am now pleased to be able to inform the House, and particularly those honourable members, that the stoppage has been overcome, due to the co-operation of the Department of Labour and National Service with the officers of the Textile Workers Union, and that full production has been resumed. On Friday last, 120 shop stewards of all metropolitan mills in Sydney met at the Trades Hall and unanimously carried a motion pledging themselves to co-operate with federal officers of the union in achieving full production at all mills not later than Monday, the 8th March. On my instructions, a mass meeting of striking textile workers was called at the Leichhardt Stadium on Sunday afternoon, the 7th March, and the resolution of the shop stewards was put before the assembly. As the result of this meeting, and an appeal by me to the workers to resume, the meeting agreed, with a vote of five to one, to return to their mills at the first shift yesterday. During discussions with union officials, several instances were brought to my notice of employers having allegedly taken advantage of the stoppage for their own disruptive purposes and to discredit the workers in the eyes of the community generally. Probably the most glaring instance of this occurred on the night of Saturday, the 6th March. On that night one of the leaders of the Textile ""Workers Union broadcast an appeal to striking textile-workers to return to their mills on Monday morning. He read the text of the resolution unanimously carried by the shop stewards and emphasized the need for continued production. ately the union official went off the air a paid advertisement, authorized by one Sydney mill, was broadcast. It informed workers at that mill that there would be no work available for them on Monday, the Sth March, and added that if sufficient workers did not present themselves to enable full production on Tuesday, the 9th March, the company would close the mill until Monday, the 15th March. Such was the provocative attitude adopted by one mill, whose directors were apparently more preoccupied with profits than with the nation's peril and the need for maintaining full production of essential war requirements. ""When this matter was brought to my notice, I issued a strong warning to the mill in question, and to others which may have had similar ideas, that the Government would take a most serious view if mills were not ready for the resumption of work at the earliest possihle date. In the published reports of the causes and progress of the stoppage, the public was again misinformed of the true nature of the dispute, with the result that the average man in the street, who has no knowledge of the conditions under which textile-workers spend their working day, was duped by the press into believing that there was no cause for complaint by the employees. But then, that is nothing new for sections of the press which have always displayed an aptitude for putting the workers' side of a dispute in an unfavorable light? There was likewise no novelty in the alacrity with which members of the Opposition-without first ascertaining the facts, but merely upon prejudiced newspaper accounts-framed questions and launched attacks upon the workers which only led to further resentment and increased the difficulties of the Government in securing a resumption of work. I make no attempt to condone - industrial stoppages in the present period of national danger, but believe that, with Mr Ward. intelligent handling of industries through production committees, stoppages would cease to be inevitable. However, as conditions now exist, the germs of industrial unrest breed in the unhygienic mills and factories where the workers spend the major part of their waking day. The textile industry has Immedi- working conditions and atmosphere requirements which are quite peculiar to it. Honourable members, who vaguely picture aU factories as being fundamentally alike, may be interested to hear of some of the findings that were reached during an exhaustive survey the textile industry carried out by officers of my department during 1942. In all, 130 mills, employing more than 30,000 work rs, were surveyed in New South Wal s, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania. Certain processes in the industry must be performed in rooms where temperatures are high and there is still air. Others throw into the air minute dust particles which enter the workers' eyes, ears, nose and throat, causing temporary inconveniences and often permanent disabilities. Welfare officers who conducted the survey came to the major conclusion that an all-round improvement of the standard of working conditions was necessary in practically all mills. They la/id down improved standards for ventilation, air space, air supply, tempera ture control, the provision of forced draughts or respirators to protect workers from dust and fumes, the separation of various processes, and the provision of better lighting, of eating and drinking facilites, and of firstaid equipment. It seems apparent that, because of the strange conditions required for certain processes in the industry, some employers are taking advantage of them to avoid providing the adequate welfare facilities which could be reasonably expected by workers in modern industry. While such circumstances continue, it is clear that the workers in the industry will become resentful and will be prone to show their dissatisfaction of their conditions by stopping work. My department has prepared detailed codes of working conditions for both men and women textile workers, and the introduction of the codes into textile mills would go a long way to avoiding the insanitary and uncomfortable working conditions which too often lead to stoppages. I pay a tribute to the officials of the textile union, who co-operated with the Government throughout the recent stoppage in an effort to secure a resumption of work and a return to full production. I also pay a tribute to the textile-workers themselves, who heeded the advice of their leaders and returned to their mills to resume their important work of producing textiles to clothe our fighting services and the civilian population.",15

27,Mr BREEN,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Has the Minister for Supply and Shipping received any advice from his responsible officers concerning the comparatively heavy wear on tyres on motor vehicles equipped with producer-gas units? If it be clearly established that the rate of wear is much greater in respect of vehicles using gas than in respect of those using petrol only, will the Minister review the instructions issued to owners of motor requiring them to equip their vehicles with producer-gas units under penalty of having their petrol ration",17
28,Mr BEASLEY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"I think it may be for granted that the extra weight of the producer gas unit must have the effect of increasing the wear on tyres. However, if liquid fuel is in short supply we must seek a substitute, and the most ready substitute is producer gas. The whole idea is to keep essential vehicles on the road. course, it may well finish by our having neither liquid fuel nor tyres, so that the problem will , in some measure, solve itself. In the meantime, we are trying to handle the matter in the fairest way POTATOES.",17
29,Sir EARLEPAGE,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"I have received the following telegram from the Agricultural Bureau at Guyfa, which is the most important potato district in New South Wales:Disaster facing whole potato crop Giiyra district.

Use every endeavour to supply efficient labour to save some part of remaining crop. Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture make every effort to have men ldoased from military camps in the neighbourhood of Guyra to dig the potato crop or arrange for potato-diggers to be sent there by the Department of Labour and National Service?",17
30,Mr SCULLY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,I received a telegram from the same source yesterday. I took immediate action and the matter is now well in hand. Fifty potato-diggers will arrive at Guyra within the next two or three days. Some are already on the road. Their despatch was arranged by the Department of Labour and National Service. Investigations have failed to reveal that experienced potato-diggers are concentrated in any section of the Army. The infestation of the potatoes referred to in the telegram is seasonal.

The honourable member's suggestion will receive full consideration. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION.",18
34,Mr HOLLOWAY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Las t week the honourable member for Melbourne (Mb*. Calwell) and the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) asked questions relating to the lack of hospital accommodation. The honourable member for Melbourne asked me whether I had read of the vain efforts of a mother to secure accommodation for her child, whose death occurred within a period of twelve hours, and I promised to inquire into the matter. The Minister for Health in New South Wales, Mr Kelly, has informed me that the information given by the honourable was correct and that there is a serious shortage of accommodation for. maternity cases in that State.",18

42,Mr BEASLEY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"I therefore con-sidered that the question was one which the Minister for Trade and Customs should answer personally.

LEAVE: SUFFERERS FROM MALARIAFUNERALS OF RELATIVES.",19
43,Mr FORDE,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES," by leave--Last . week the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) and the honourable member for Lang (Mr Mulcahy) made representations to me that men on leave who contract malaria should be granted an equivalent period of additional leave. The practice which is now being observed is as follows: The personnel who contract malaria when on leave have been instructed to(a) report to the nearest military hospital, or, where this is impracticable, to the nearest area medical officer; or (&) report at once to the nearest public hospital if a military hospital or area medical officer is not available; or (c) obtain private medical attention if unable to attend or be taken to a military hospital or public hospital where a military hospital is not available, and immediately forward a certificate by the medical attendant to the nearest head-quarters or a lines of communication area. Personnel are granted recreation-leave by their commanding officers, and that leave expires on the date fixed by the commanding ofiScer and is specified on the leave pass. This applies whether the member becomes ill on leave or not. Commanding officers of hospitals have authority to grant up to fourteen days' sick leave when personnel are sufficiently I recovered to receive it. They are being instructed that, in any case where a man has spent a portion of his recreation leave in hospital, a period of leave at least equal to that, portion is to be granted, even though it would not normally have been granted on purely medical grounds.",19
44,Mr GUY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Will the Minister for the Army inform me when I may anticipate a reply to a question I asked about a fortnight ago as to whether it was a fact that members of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces, wbo were granted special leave to attend the funeral of a deceased relative, had their pay stopped during the period of their absence?",19
45,Mr FORDE,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,I shall make inquiries from head-quarters to ascertain why the honourable member has not been furnished with the information. I assure him that he will receive a reply within 24 hours. DIABETIC FOODS.,19
46,Sir EARLE PAGE,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Many diabetic patients in Sydney have made representations to me that for some reason they are unable to procure suitable foods. I understand this bas resulted from rationalization of manufacture. ' There has been a serious deterioration of health and in some cases gangrene of the limbs, despite the use of insulin. As the actual number of diabetics needing such food can be easily obtained from the medical profession or hospitals and the amount of specially prepared food that is required can be accurately determined, will the Minister for Health take up with his colleagues the matter of the preparation of such food?",19
47,Mr HOLLOWAY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Althoug h I do not admit the allegation regarding a shortage of these foods, I shall refer the question to the Director-General of Health, and the matter will be investigated. I agree with the right honourable member for Cowper that, as the number of cases can be ascertained, the quantities of food required can be calculated for the purpose of organizing the supply. That work is already being done; the Australian Food Council has not overlooked it. The council was established for three purposes: first, to maintain the general supply of food; secondly, to prevent the waste through maldistribution Or local shortages; and, thirdly, to provide substitutes when an inevitable shortage occurs. For the last-mentioned purpose, Dr Clements, the dietitian, was appointed to the Food Council. Already tablets containing certain vitamins have been produced so that children will not have to go without orange juice. The matter to which the right honourable gentleman referred constantly receives attention. I agree with his statement that a supply of insulin without the appropriate foods would be practically valueless. I shall discuss the whole matter immediately with the Director General of Health for the purpose of ascertaining whether any of the suggestions of the right honourable gentleman have not yet been given effect. FOOD FOR BRITAIN .",20
48,Mr SCULLY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Las t week the honourable member for Wannon (Mr MCLeod) asked me1. Has the attention of the Minister heen drawn to the published statement honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Pagej regarding the decline of food exports from Australia to Great Britain' 2. Does the Minister think that the statement is a reasonable summary of the position? 3. Is not the decline due to a shortage of shipping rather than to the inability of Australia to supply the food? I have since had the opportunity to examine the report in the Sydney Morning Herald, and can say that the figures quoted by the right honourable member for Cowper in relation to meat exports were not correct. The right honourable member stated, for instance, that Australia was exporting 150,000 tons less meat now than in the first year of the war. The total shipments of frozen carcasses in the first year of war approximated 250,000 tons. At that time space was available for all meat which could be exported. Honourable members will appreciate that an entirely different position obtains now because of the smaller shipping space which can be made available. For this reason, Great Britain has set down the order of preference as follows: Canned, dehydrated, and frozen meats. The Government's plans for this year envisage the export of the carcass equivalent of 185,000 tons, the bulk of which .will be lamb. From these figures, it will be seen that the decrease of meat exports compared with the first year of the contract is equivalent to 95,000 tons, but it should be borne in mind that the decrease is related to shipping and not to production. It can be stated that Australia will fill every ship which can be made available. What is important from the viewpoint of honourable members is that the Commonwealth has been able to meet all its obligations to the Mother Country, to the Pacific peoples, and to the allied forces serving in the South-West Pacific, without in any way seriously interfering with the supplies of basic foodstuffs for the civilian population. When it is remembered that basic foodstuffs have been rationed in America and Canada, two countries of vast agricultural output and considerable man-power resources, the part that Australian producers are playing in maintaining supplies can be underof the right stood and appreciated. PETROL.",20
49,Mr BREEN,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"I ask the Minister for Transport whether any supervision is exercised over pool petrol agents^in the country who are using big petrol wagons to deliver petrol to resellers. If such resellers could be serviced by rail will the Minister direct that such rail transport be used and thus effect a considerable saving in the wear on rubber tvres ? "" Mr GEORGE LAWSON --I shall have inquiries made on the subject and furnish a reply later. CALL-UP OE WOMEN WORKERS.",21
50,Mr ROSEVEAR,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Will the Minister for Labour and National Service inform me whether there is any good reason why the officers of his department usually ehoose the western suburbs of Sydney, which are working-class areas, for the purpose of dragging women out of their homes, and men away from their usual occupations, to be drafted into other callings? Does not the Minister consider that a quest for.workers by departmental onicials would be more fruitfu l if it were made in the eastern suburbs? Does he not think that those suburbs should be tested for female labour?",21
51,Mr WARD,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"I do not know to which call-up the honourable gentleman refers, but the call-up to secure additional labour for canning factories was made in particular districts, in the first instance, having in mind the proximity of the factories to the place of residence of workers. As far as possible, steps are taken to obviate travelling long distances to and from work. It has been discovered, however, that insufficient labour was secured on that occasion, and the honourable gentleman will be pleased to know that this week there will be a call-up in the eastern suburbs, including Vaucluse, Rose Bay, Point Piper, Bondi, and Potts Point.",21
52,Mr MULCAHY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"I direct the attenprovided tion of the Minister for Labour National Service to the following graph in today's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald relating to the employrepresentations ment of women in canneries:Most of the 190 women and girls who began arrangement. work at two Sydney canneries yesterday called up hy the Department of Lahour and National Service, and had no previous experience of canning. Most women who began work yesterday live in industrial suburbs and do not look as though they are unacquainted with hard work. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honourable member is reading comment. I ask tankers,. him to state his facts.",21
53,Mr MULCAHY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"The article continuesWomen from other parts of the metropolitan area will begin work at the same factories this week. At one plant an attempt is being made to ensure that women from the same social group work together. Does the Minister consider that an article of this kind is calculated to assist the war effort, or does he regard it as an attempt to sabotage the important work in these canneries? Mr SPEAKER,-The honourable member is seeking an expression of opinion, rather than information, and I rule that the question is out of order.",21
54,Mr HARRISON,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Will the Minister instruct that statistics shall be kept, showing the production of the women called up from Vaucluse, Rose Bay and Bondi, in excess of that of women called up from the eastern and western suburbs of Sydney, in order that the House may be acquainted with the extraordinary manual dexterity of the women from the first-named districts?",21
55,Mr WARD,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"As women from the districts mentioned by the honourable member have been unaccustomed to hard work, and many of them will be engaging in manual labour for the first time in their lives, it would not be fair to make a comparison of their output at this stage with that of other women to whom the experience will not be a new one. WHEAT FOR POULTRY.",21
56,Sir CHARLES MARR,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,"Arrange ments were made some time ago for poultry-farmers to obtain wheat at a special price for poultry feed, it was purchased in 10-ton and lots. As many poultry-farmers in a pararelatively small way of business are unable to accept supplies in truck lots, were made to the Minister recently for a reconsideration of the An order was subsewere quently issued that wheat should be made available to poultry-farmers at the special price in 15-ton lots. I ask the Minister why the increase of tonnage was made? Cannot arrangements he made for poultry-farmers to obtain supplies in less than 10-ton lots?",21
57,Mr SCULLY,TASMANIAJST WAR INDUSTRIES,I am pleased that the honourable member has asked this question. I shall take the matter up with the Australian Wheat Board. I realise that it is out of the questiou for poultry-farmers in a small way to buy wheat in 15-ton lots. I shall give instructions that the previous arrangement for purchases of 10-ton lots be reverted to. I shall also ask the board to consider whether a scheme can be evolved whereby wheat for poultry feed may be distributed in smaller lots. NA BILL 1943. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the l l t h February (vide page 556) on motion by Mr. CHIFLEYThat the hill be now read a second time.,22
58,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"Parramatta) [3.54] - No member of the Government party could reasonably accuse me of an unreadiness to support social legislation initiated by the Labour party. My attitude has invariably been to judge such legislation on its merits, quite regardless of what party had initiated it. This measure, however, leaves me cold, because I regard it as a deliberate confidence trick and a sham, practised on the very class of people of whom Government members are prone to consider themselves the special representatives. The bill proposes to establish an entirely new legislative practice. As honourable members know, it has always been customary for Ministers, when introducing measures of social reform, to seek at the time authority to appropriate the sums deemed necessary to meet the Treasury obligations in connection with them. In this instance, the Parliament is asked to hypothecate a sum years in advance of the legislation authorizing its expenditure. It is true that already trust funds operate in connection with social legislation. In respect of invalid and old-age pensions, moneys are placed in a trust fund at frequent intervals, at the direction of this Parliament. But there is a reai danger in the practice of making payments into a trust fund before the Parliament has authorized their expenditure. Since I entered this Parliament twelve years ago, I have heard honourable members who now sit on the Government benches accuse the Treasurer in the Lyons Governmeut of having manipulated certain trust funds in order to obscure the real state of treasury funds. There is very real danger in that respect, and it will be tremendously accentuated if we break down the old tradition of making the appropriation subsequent to the legislative commitment. Because this measure introduces that dangerous practice, it is unacceptable to the Opposition. One could understand the proposal of the Government if the present were a period of prosperity and financial plenty, and if the intention were to place surplus funds aside, to be drawn against on a rainy day. Surely this is a rainy day; indeed, it is a day of deluge. It certainly is not the time to contemplate taking out of current resources the sum mentioned in the bill, and placing it in a fund for use years hence. The desperate expedients that were resorted to in order to ensure the success of recent war loans, and the plaintive requests of the Prime Minister to the working men and women of Australia to contribute at least £10 in order that the boys at the fighting front might not go short of the things that they need, may be readily recalled. Yet despite this it is proposed that at such a time £30,000,000 shall be taken from current resources and placed in a trust fund. The purposes for which drawings are to be made from the fund have not yet been divulged to us. The bill purports to do two things: First, to initiate a £30,000,000 social programme; and, secondly, to provide the £30,000,000 wherewith to finance that programme. I shall demonstrate that it does neither. Let us examine it, in order to see whether it predicates a £30,000,000 plan. The only specific items of proposed expenditure which were indicated to us by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) in the financial statement that he made recently were maternity benefits, a liberalized maternity allowance, funeral benefits for old-age pensioners, and a sustenance allowance for the dependants of invalid pensioners. The total extra charge on the Treasury, for these four items amounts to only £2,525,000. I do not object any of those proposals, or to the taking of such steps as are necessary to raise money required. I believe that Parliabeen ment would do well to pay more attention ro the very serious decline of the birthcould rate. Prom the beginning of the century the rate has declined from 27 to each 1,000 of population to 17. The effect of this is that Australia is losing every year no fewer than 70,000 babies. I am not is fool enough to imagine that the position can be wholly rectified by increasing the maternity allowance, though it has been in that direction. established that there is a close relation between economic conditions and vital statistics. However, I do believe that i we can do something to alleviate the poses mental stress of themother during the period of her confinement and immesurer diately afterwards we shall make a real contribution to the health of the children, thus reducing the incidence of infantile mortality, which is much too high in Ausing tralia. We deplore the loss of 60,000 Australian lives during the four years of the Great War, but it is a fact that during the four years of the economic war-that is, during the depression years statement:from 1.929 to 1933-24,S0 0 children did uot survive their first year, whilst many thousands more who, in the ordinary witli course of events, would have been born were not born. Therefore, if the grantaim ing of increased maternity benefits has the effect of relievfloig the mothers and enabling them to rear healthy children, I regard the money proposed to be spent as a worthwhile pro]K>scs investment. I also welcome the proposal to grant funeral benefits to old-age pensioners. I am personally acquainted with many old age pensioners who, from their meagre income, put so much aside each week in order that they might escape the indignity of a pauper's funeral. It is evident that a great many pensioners must follow this practice because there are many funeral organizations which accept contributions of this kind, and not all of them, unfortunately, are bona fide. This provision should enable pensioners to free themselves from the toils of such organizations. I also approve of the proposal to supplement the sustenance allowance to families of invalid pensioners. The time is overto due when theNational Government should make an attempt to rehabilitate the as many as possible of those who have regarded as permanently and totally incapacitated. Many of them, I believe, be restored to industry, and I trust that the recommendations of the Social Security Committee in this respect will shortly be given effect. One of the first steps towards rehabilitating such persons to lift from their shoulders the crushing burden of poverty under which they have been labouring, and this proposal is a step The four proposals which I have enumerated represent the sum total of the f social benefits which the Government proto introduce immediately. It is true that we have been informed by the Treaof certain other proposals which will, in due course, be presented to Parliament, but they are of the future, whereas the tax for the purpose of creata trust, fund is very much of the present. .In order to show that the greater part, of the. Government's social programme belongs to the future, I quote the following extract from the Treasurer's Broadly, our post-war aim must be the physical deveiopnieiit of our country linked up expanded production and increased population. Measures directed to these ends must at ensuring a high level of employment which is fundamental to economic advancement anxiety of and social security. 1'iir.thcr measures are necessary to eiiKiiru minimum social standards throughout the community. Accordingly the Government now to lay the foundation of a comprehensive scheme of national welfare which will ho developed progressively and will be brought into full operation after the war. It id impracticable in war-time to devise and introduce a comprehensive scheme for all of these serviccM. For example, under war conditions, the. strain on our medical and nursing services is particularly heavy. But investigations arc proceeding, and it is anticipated that it will bo found possible to give effect to sonic of the services either wholly or in part when the inquiries have been completed. He goes on to suggest a term of six or nine months in which health and unemployment insurance could be initiated. The serious? We have specific social service proposals before us now and others suggested for future consideration, but a tax designed to establish the National Welfare Fund will commence on the 1st April next. That tax will fall heavily on the lower ranges of income. As late as last week the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) expressed the traditional view of the Labour party that workers should not be compelled to pay for social benefits. This new tax is either a contribution by the workers to their own social services or a war tax. The Government must have it one way or the other.",22
59,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,How much money did Australia lose as the result of the aborted national insurance scheme?,24
60,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND," .jNothing. That scheme was sabotaged, but, not by me. I do not know whether the Treasurer denies that this new tax on the incomes of the lower-paid workers will represent, their contributions for provision to them of social services some time in the future. The national insurance scheme, for the establishment of which legislation was passed hy the Commonwealth Parliament but did not come into operation, provided - for a payment of about 2s. a week by lower-paid workers for the benefits which that legislation conferred upon them. Labour members bitterly fought against that provision, on the grounds that it was wrong to expect workers to pay for social services. Contrast their attitude then with the attitude of the Government today. Under the Government proposals, the man ou £3 a week will have to pay a tax of 3s. a week as a contribution towards future social services. That man today pays no tax at all. The man on £4 a week will be required to pay an additional 4s. a week tax in order that he may qualify for some hypothetical benefit. The man on the basic wage of £5 a week will have his tax increased from 8s. to 13s. 6d. a week, an increase of 5s. 6d. a week, which is about three times the amount he was to have been required to pay under the national insurance scheme. Under that scheme that man would have become almost immediately entitled to benefit, but this scheme will entitle him to some benefit some day in the future. The man on £6 a week will have to pay an extra 6s. tax, and the man on £7 a week an extra 8s., whilst the man on £8 a week will have to pay 10s. a week more. I repeat that that extra taxation is either a direct tax for war purposes or is a contribution, called tax, towards some prospective social benefits.",24
61,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,O r both.,24
62,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND," Even when he has paid the tax the worker will not be nearly so secure as he would have been under a properly arranged and designated contributory scheme, because no scheme which depends for its finances entirely on the Treasury can possibly be safe, whereas under a contributory scheme the man who makes his contributions week by week builds up a. vested interest of which no misfortunes of the Treasury can rob him. We need not go far back into history to see how easy it is for social services which entirely depend on the state of the Treasury to the break down, for in 1931 invalid and old age pensions were slashed, not by the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) or the right honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr. Fadden), but by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), a Labour Prime Minister, who was forced by the financial circumstances of the time to do something which normally he would not have even dreamed of doing. Instead of imposing contributions on the people by means of a tax, the Government should do the honest thing and call the new tax what, it really is, namely, a war tax, and when the time comes make provision for the financial support of social services by a straightforward system of contributions. This legislation purports to have two objectives. The first is the initiation of a £30,000,000 social services programme. I think that I have effectively dealt with that, for it is only a £2,500,000 programme, and the rest of the programme is being put by for some time in the future. The second is the provision of £30,000,000 a year with which to finance that programme. The second objective is as unreal as the first. Clause 5 readsThere shall he paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, for the purposes of the National Welfare Fund, in each financial year (commencing with the financial year commencing on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and forty-three) the sum of Thirty million pounds, or a sum equal to one-quarter of the amount received in that financial year as income tax from persons other than companies, whichever is the less. There is the rub- "" The sum of thirty million pounds, or a sum equal to one-quarter of the amount received . . . as income tax from persons other than companies, whichever is the less "" ! Never will the £30,000,000 be appropriated for the national welfare fund until the income tax from persons exceeds £120,000,000, and never in our history has the Treasury raired £120,000,000 by way of income tax from persons. The Treasurer declared that in 1938-39 the Commonwealth income tax. assessed on individuals yielded £7,000,000, in 1940-41 the sum of £30,000,000, and in 1941-42 the sum of £50,000,000. The estimate for the current year is approximately £70,000,000. It is true that the Treasurer pointed out that an additional £40,000,000 will be raised by the legislation which the House passed last week, increasing collections from the income tax this year to £110,000,000. Referring to the report of the Commissioner of Taxation, I find that income tax collected from individuals during the last ten years, which includes heavy additional taxation during two years of war, totals only £120,000,000 or an average of £12,000,000 a year.",24
63,Mr JOLLY,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,Does that include receipts from companies ?,25
64,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"No , receipts only from individuals. Twentyfive per cent. of £12,000,000 is not. £30,000,000, as mentioned by the Treasurer, but only £3,000,000. I am not so foolish as to believe that immediately the peace bells ring, we shall revert to pre-war levels of taxation. But even if the pre-war rates were trebled, the total to be appropriated into the trust fund would still be less than £10,000,000. That sum falls fantastically short, of £30,000,000, which honourable members have been led to believe was the objective of the bill. Although the Treasurer has stated that he estimates that £110,000,000 will be collected from income tax next year, honourable members must not forget that under the uniform income tax legislation the Commissioner of Taxation is now the agent for the States. On their behalf, he will collect £33,000,000 per annum. That arrangement will terminate twelve months after the cessation of hostilities, or long before some of these visionary social services coine into being. That analysis shows in bold relief the falsity of the idea that anything like £30,000,000 will be appropriated for the purposes of social reform. No serious objection could be raised to a prudent provision from surplus resources in order to meet the necessities of a rainy day, but this is not the time to incur additional legislative commitments. Therefore, I am opposed to the creation of the National Welfare Fund until the special nature of the Government's proposals has been approved by this Parliament.",25
65,Mr CLABK,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"Darling) [4.23] - The National Welfare Fund, which the Government proposes to establish, will be far in advance of the national health insurance scheme which a previous United Australia party government introduced. That scheme offered free medical treatment and certain payments during a period of illness, but it contained certain objectionable provisions. For example, invalid and old-age pensioners, both wife and husband, would have been subject to the contributory provisions of the legislation, and a married man with a wife and two children would have been called upon to pay approximately 4s. a week in order to receive the health benefits of the meagre scheme. Under the present proposals, a man with a wife and two children, in receipt of £250 a year, will pay only an additional £1 a year for the privilege of receiving social benefits far in advance of those contemplated under the national health insurance scheme. This small additional payment will also entitle families to receive unemployment benefits, maternity allowances, funeral benefits, and assistance to purchase homes. Invalid pensioners at present receive a pension of 25s. a week, plus the cost-ofliving allowance. The Government now proposes to pay an allowance of 15s. a week for dependent wives of invalid pensioners. In addition, it is proposed to pay 5s. a week for the unendowed child of an invalid pensioner. Thus under these arrangements an invalid pensioner with wife and children will receive, apart from ordinary child endowments, a total family benefit of 45s. a week, plus the cost-of-living allowance on the invalid pension itself. The cost will be borne by the National Welfare Eund. I emphasize the disparity between the national health insurance scheme and this Government's non-contributory scheme. Persons in the lower income groups with family responsibilities will be entitled to receive many benefits without being obliged to make the high contributions that they would have been compelled to make under the national health insurance scheme. The honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) tried mislead the public regarding the advantages of the present proposal. He declared that the Government's plan was visionary and illusory; but the people, who have every confidence in the Labour party, know that the necessary legislation is now being drafted. Some of the bills will be introduced during the next few days, although the more complex measures, such as that relating to the national health scheme, may be delayed for a short period. The much-discussed Beveridge report that has been presented to the British Government provides for a scheme of social benefits which is not nearly so generous as the scheme of this Government.",25
66,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,No scheme is before us; that is our complaint.,26
67,Mr CLARK,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"The Treasurer already explained the Government's proposals. The measures to implement those proposals will be introduced after certain other financial measures have been passed. The implication of the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta is that no scheme will be forthcoming. I do not accept that view. We may take it for granted that legislation to implement the Government's plans will be submitted to us. The British. Government's proposals are not. so liberal as tiiose that will be before us shortly. We have been informed in the press, during the last clay or two, that a contributory scheme of financial insurance and social lienefits has been prepared in the United States of America. Something has been said by the honourable member for Parramatta about the heavy imposts that this scheme will pls""P upon people drawing incomes of between £2 and £3 a week. As I understand it . the only people on such low incomes who will be called upon to contribute in taxation for this scheme will be minors, who can well afford to make the payments required of them. Adult workers on the basic wage, or on a wage of about that rate, will not be required to contribute. The Government is taking.a step in the right direction in introducing this proposal now. This war is being fought partly in order to ensure economic stability to the people, and I to consider that the Government is acting wisely in indicating its proposals in this regard, for by so doing it is showing the people that they have something worth fighting for. The greatest fear of the workers is the fear of tomorrow. This is especially true of people with families. Whatever can be done to assure such persons of some degree of economic security should be done at once. The introduction of the widows' pension scheme by this Government was evidence of its intention to help the ordinary people. It is true that, at present, that scheme is not of a very far-reaching nature, but the payments that are already being made to widows are very acceptable to them. The principle of the payment of widow --' pensions having been approved by the Parliament, the. rates has of payment, inav be increased from time to time as circumstances require. It is essential also that people should be assured of continuous employment, and of the provision of adequate medical services. These two ideals should be realized as quickly as possible. The proposal for the payment of increased maternity allowances, and sustenance for dependants of invalid pensioners, and also funeral allowances are to be commended. The housing scheme of the Government also is praiseworthy. People should be guaranteed homes under reasonable conditions. It is true that labour and building materials for a comprehensive housing scheme are not available at the moment, because of war conditions; but undoubtedly the Parliament should formulate a comprehensive housing scheme no w so that it can be put into operation immediately the war ends. If we wait until after the war before making plans for the housing of the people-and honorthey able members opposite seem to want the Government to wait until after the warbuilding operations will have to wait until plans can be prepared,- which will mean considerable delay. The honorcontribution able member for Parramatta has conwe tended that the time is not opportune for a measure of this description.",26
68,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,That is not what I said. I said that the Governgood ment should tell us what its objectives are before asking us to provide money for them.,27
69,Mr CLARK,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"As I understood the honourable member, he said that this not the time to provide a comprehensive scheme for social services, and that could wait u n t i l after the war. - Sir FREDERICK STEWART - I said that the Government should tell us what i proposes to spend this money on. I has not done so.",27
70,Mr CLARK,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"The honourable gentleman will find the Government's programme set out, in the second-reading speech of the Treasurer. I commend the Government upon its proposal to provide, by regulation, free university education for an increased number of children. I hope that that principle will be extended to include all children who show capacity through their examination results. Assistance in relation to university education should be placed upon the same basis as child endowment. There should be no limit . The benefit should be available to - every child of every family who can qualify for it by examination. In that way the scheme would be completely democratic and we should be assured that all competent boys and girls of the nation would receive a complete education. Thus they would become of maximum benefit to nation. Under existing conditions, many Government? boys and girls of inferior capacity frer quently fail in university examinations, but because of the financial help their parents are able to give them, the.y said, for exampleultimately obtain degrees in various professions. I u that way many secondnational rate and third-rate men are practising will and the community suffers because of mencing their incapacity. That situation would to be remedied if children of proved capacity could continue their education until graduated from the university. I congratulate the Government upon having introduced this measure. It is evidence of its sincerity in relation to social progress. I regard this bill as a towards the new deal which are being led to expect after the war. People hear a lot about the new deal, and the Government is acting wisely in introducing this proposal as evidence of its f a it h in relation to the future.",27
71,Mr MCCALL,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"M a r t in ) [4.37] - Be cause I believe that the method by which the Government is submitting its social programme is wrong I regret that I must was oppose this bill. My opinion of this measure is apparently somewhat similar that to the opinions of honourable gentlemen opposite of the national health and pensions insurance scheme which was introt duced some years ago. Supporters of this t Government, who constituted the then Opposition, condemned that scheme because they disapproved of its financial basis. They argued in favour of a voluntary scheme as against a compulsory scheme. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta (S ir Frederick Stewart) that this scheme should be opposed on the four grounds which he mentioned. The whole proposal may be described as camouflage finance. If I could see the whole scheme in clear perspective, I might have pleasure in supporting it , but all the financial proposals associated with the sociallegislation programme of this Government are unsound. I consider it to be my duty to oppose all unsound financial proposals. I find it rather difficult to understand why the Government has resorted to this method of introducing its social policy.",27
72,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,Does the honourable member find any real difficulty the in understanding the attitude of the,27
73,Mr MCCALL,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"I do, in view of certain statements made by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley). The honourable gentleman The Government proposes to establish a welfare fund through which provision be made to finance the full scheme. Comfrom the 1st July next, it is proposed pay to this fund out of general revenue an annual sum of £30,000,000, or a sunt equal to one-fourth of the total collections each year from income tax on individuals, whichever is the lower. He went onIn its early stages the fund will build up some credit balances which will be used later when the welfare scheme readies full operation. Later he said In the first year a substantial credit may accrue. These balances will not lie allowed to remain idle but will bo invested, aud will thus provide a useful source of temporary finance for war purposes, which will be replaced by long-term borrowings when the moneys are required later for welfare purposes. The people of Australia know that it is imperative for the Government to obtain money in order to finance the war. Unless the last farthing be obtained for this purpose, we shall be in trouble. Already the Government finds itself in a precarious financial position, and that puts the matter mildly. Therefore, the people of this country fully realise that taxation has to be borne in order that additional revenue may be raised. would be quite prepared to accept from the Government the statement that it required an additional £30,000,000 in order to continue to finance war Instead of doing that, the Government is using other means of obtaining £30,000,000, and its intentions are hidden in the guise of a welfare scheme. not regard that as necessary. not tell the people that this is really a taxation scheme? I fail to see how it can bo logically argued that, a scheme of this kind can be launched by the formation of a fund which will be drawn on immediately in order to provide money for war purposes. Would not the simpler and more straightforward method be to tell the people that this extra taxation is needed, and then to say that the Government believes-as we all do-that further ameliorative welfare should be introduced under the heads set out in the bill-maternity, invalid pensions and sustenance? Government could make it clear that it had those matters well in mind, and that, in a scheme of post-war reconstruction, it proposed to resort to borrowing on a scale that would fulfil the financial requirements. In fact, that is all that this proposal implies. For some reason, however, the Government has decided to adopt the Mr MoCall. present form, which I believe will not be acceptable to the people, and justifies the opposition of members who sit on this side of the House. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that this is actually a contributory plan of social benefits. Members of the Government party, when in opposition, were at great pains to make it clear to the people that they were totally opposed to any contributory form of welfare legislation. This measure cloaks the real intentions of the Government. I cannot see why the bill should not be withdrawn and recast along the lines proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta. I should have no objection to the introduction at present of a comprehensive national insurance scheme. It is to be deeply regretted that a previous government was not able to bring into operation such a scheme which would have been of very additional great advantage to the people and of tremendous benefit at present in They providing large sums for financing the war, as is done in Great Britain. The honourable member for Parramatta made an excellent point when he operations. said that any legislation, even in time of war, which would result in an increase of that the birth-rate of this country, would be of great national value. That, however, I do could be done effectively after the war, Why when the time would be much more fitting and the scheme could be placed on a very much better financial basis than is possible at the present time. I shall vote against the bill because 1 disagree, not with the social idea that underlies it , but with the method by which the Government proposes to finance the scheme. I trust that the Government will give consideration to the issues that are raised by honourable members, with a view measures to recasting the bill and placing the whole plan on a more honest and sound funeral, financial basis. The",27
74,Mr BLACKBURN,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"Bourke) [4.47] The Treasurer (Mr Chifley), in his second-reading speech, and also in hi a financial statement, foreshadowed to the House the intentions of the Government. It. proposes to bring down shortly certain measures which will impose upon the revenue a further burden of £2,515,000; that is to say, an additional £365,000 in respect of the maternity allowance; a new maternity benefit, estimated to cost £1,250,000; a new funeral benefit in respect of invalid and old-age pensioners, estimated to cost £260,000; and a sustenance allowance in respect of the dependants of invalid pensioners, estimated to cost. £640,000. The sum which it is proposed to take from the revenues and to add to social service benefits does not approximate that which is to be appropriated. We have been told that during the course of this year, which ought normally to include an election, there will sickness benefits, payable in approximately six months' time, and unemployment benefits, payable in approximately nine months' time. Normally, the unemployment benefits would not be paid before the election was held. This House will expire, by effluxion of time, in November. Normally, an election would be held some time prior to that date. Therefore, the House is asked to appropriate a large sum for the purposes of a scheme of social benefits, only - a small part of which is to be immediately in being and the great bulk of which is quite unknown to honourable members. Even if these proposals were placed before us in complete detail, they would not reconcile me to the fact that this House, on the initiative becomes law ? of the Government, has increased the burden of taxation upon receivers of small incomes, particularly the small wage-earners. It does not sweeten the fact, that the exemption has been reduced to £2 a week. But this measure does not give the House any assurance that there will be a sickness benefit, or that there will be an unemployment benefit. It says that moneys may be taken out of the trust fund which is to be created for purposes of making payments in relation to health services, unemployment or sickness benefits, family allowances or other welfare social services. The Government may range over the whole expanse of possible social services, but there is no indication what sort of services it is committed to, other than what is contained in the financial statement, or how much it proposes to expend on any or all of them. This measure contains the very important statement that the National Welfare Fund, for which the trust account is to be constituted, is to be established under the provisions of section 62A of the Audit Act, but this section seems to be an inappropriate one with which to connect a fund of this importance. It refers to a number of funds enumerated in the schedule, or which can be added to the schedule by the 'Treasurer. Most of those funds exist for a temporary administrative purpose, and the Treasurer is empowered under the section to put an end to any of them. It is provided in subsection 4 of section 62A of the Audit Act 1901-1934, that, the Treasurer may direct be that any trust account be closed, and thereupon the money standing to the credit of the account may, after all liabilities have been discharged, be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That is a reasonable enough provision in respect of funds created for temporary purposes, but it is most unreasonable to ask this House to agree that so important a trust fund as this shall rest upon so precarious a basis; that it shall be subject to the administrative power of the Treasurer to abolish the fund, and transfer the moneys to the Consolidated Revenue account. Mr Joi.xy - Coul d the Treasurer override the provisions of this bill when it",28
75,Mr BLACKBURN,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"He could in the way I have suggested. Moneys standing to the credit oif the trust account are deemed to be standing to the credit of the trust fund, and the Treasurer is prevented by the provisions of sections 61 and 62A of the Audit Act from expending money out of the trust fund except for the purpose of the fund, or under the authority of the act. He may abolish the trust account, but while money remains in the trust, fund he cannot use it for any purpose except the trust purpose. Therefore, or the money which it is proposed to put into this trust fund cannot be directly used for war purposes. The Treasurer anticipates that position by saying that the money is to be invested, and that the investment is to provide money which the Government can use for war purposes.",29
76,Mr LAZZARINI,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,Are not such moneys always invested?,29
77,Mr BLACKBURN,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"I am corning to that.

Section 62D of the A u d it Act provides that moneys standing to the credit of a trnst fun d may be invested by the Treasurer in securities of the Commonwealth Government or of any State, or deposited in any bank. That means that, instead of keeping the money in a bank, the Treasurer may invest it in Common-, wealth or State securities, but the normal rhing would be for the securities to be held by the trust fund and, when a demand was made upon the fund, the securities would be sold. That is what the act contemplates.",29

' Mr BLACKBURN - It is provided no that moneys standing to the credit of a trust f u n d may be invested in government. ment securities, but those securities negotiable, and may be sold at any time. This is what is going to happen: The money will be lent to the Government as an investment, and the Government will ultimately replace it by long-term or permanent borrowing. I cannot see why that provision is necessary when securities are held by the Eund for amounts lent to the Government. can understand why the money should be invested, but I cannot understand the special statement by the Governin ment that the money, having been distinct from sickness benefits. invested, will disappear, and require to be replaced by long-term benefits borrowing.

An amendment has been circulated which, if accepted, would reduce that amount considerably. The amount to be appropriated will be either £30,000,000 or one-quarter of the amount received from income tax on individuals whichever is the less. This money will be appropriated for the purpose of meeting immediate social welfare commitments amounting ro ' £2,500,000, and for meeting, in the future, the i ndefinite commitments referred to by the Treasurer. What is the full scope of social services to which the Government The honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) made great play with housing, but it seems to me that if housing is to be such an reimportant service, it should have been mentioned specifically, whereas there is specific mention of it , either in the bill or in the Treasurer's financial stateThe things mentioned are invalid are and old-age pensions, widows' pensions, health, sickness, unemployment and other benefits. It seems to me that expenditure on the housing of the people is far too important a social benefit to be merely Uvler alia. 3 assume that the things which the Government has in mind for its programme this year are additional benefits to pensioners, sickness benefits, I unemployment benefits, and maternity benefits. The Government itself says that it may be impossible this year to bring a'complete scheme of health benefits as The will Government should say now what social it proposes to finance out of the Welfare Fund. It may say, "" We have not worked out the details yet, be but these are the benefits on which we of. intend to spend money and these are the we propose to give-sicknes s benefits, health benefits, maternity benefits "" , or whatever benefits it intends to confer on the people.",30
81,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,That what we are asking for.,31
82,Mr BLACKBTTRN,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,Yes .,31
83,Mr CI,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"ARK - It would be difficult at this stage to specify the benefits in detail. Mr BLAiOKBURlSr - Yes , but the Government could say how much money out of the £25,000,000 or £30,000,000 which it will place in the National Welfare Fund it will have available for sickness or unemployment benefits and, on that basis, it could say what benefits a sick person or an unemployed person shall receive. The Joint Committee on Social Security has done a great deal of work and has evolved schemes, and the Government cannot say that it has no material at its disposal on which to work. It has been suggested to me privately that the Government proposes to spend £15,000,000 on unemployment benefits when it has the national welfare scheme in operation. It should be able to tell the House what amount it proposes to expend on unemployment benefits. Although it does not seem very easy under this bill to debate schemes of social relief, I should like to say that I for one do not believe that invalid and old-age pensions, widows' pensions, and allowances for children should be put, either directly or indirectly, upon a contributory basis. The National Health and Pensions Insurance Act of the Lyons Government Dvovided for direct contributions. The system in operation in New Zealand is based on indirect contributions. Every one who is able to do so contributes on a flat rate through tax, and every one is entitled to benefit regardless of whether he has contributed. The national security tax and the social security tax are lumped together and every body contributes at a flat rate of 2s. 6d. in the £1. Under the direct contributions method proposed in the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act, the only persons who would have benefited were those who contributed. The difficulty of that scheme was that a man might have contributed for years and years and then, drop out because of inability to make further contributions as the result of unemployment. When he again obtained work he would have had to start afresh. We objected to that provision as well as other provisions of that is act. I believe that the relief of old'age, invalidity and sickness are burdens that ought to be borne by the community and financed by a tax graduated according to ability to pay. I do not believe that persons receiving £2 or £3 a week are able to pay. The only concession I make is that I believe it may be possible to say that there ought to be a special tax, the proceeds of which would be hypothecated for the relief of unemployment only, and that only persons in work should pay that, tax. I prefer the non-contributory to the contributory plan. But what the Government is doing under this bill and under the new taxation scheme is to substitute indirect contributory benefits for the direct. Instead of having to make a direct contribution, as he would have had to do under the national insurance scheme of the Lyons Government, a man will be required, under the scheme proposed by this Government, to make an indirect contribution. Practically every person who earns will be making that indirect contribution. This scheme brings the range of income tax down to too low a level. I do not Hke this bill, but I do not intend to vote against it. I registered my protest during the debate on the Income Tax Assessment Bill. There is a 1 Spanish proverb which says: "" Such a Qian would steal a sheep and give the trotters away in charity."" As the sheep has now been stolen from its owner, I am prepared to vote that the victim shall at any rate get back the trotters. All he will get under this scheme is the trotters of his sheep and I propose to see that he gets them. M.r. SPENDER (Warringah) [5.7] - I intend to vote against this bill and I <hall state the grounds for my objections. It. is necessary to examine the bill to see v,hat if purports to provide. On the f:iee of it, it provides that £30,000,000, iv 25 per cent, of the personal income tax, whichever is the less, shall be put into a trust, account to be applied fo grneral welfare purposes. If this measure receives the approval of the House I assume that the Government will set aside annually £30,000,000, or less, for those purposes. If that is so, we are being asked to commit ourselves for an indefinite period to taxation at bigb rates wbicb at the present time only war can justify. We have heen given the most shadowy information in support of the proposal. It is necessary in dealing with this matter to know the background. The Prime Minister (Mr Curtin), as Leader of the Opposition, declared without equivocation in leading the attack on the Padden budget in 1941, that not even war would justify a government in taking one penny from those persons in receipt of only £300 a year, and that opinion was echoed by all his supporters.",31
84,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,And by the Independents.,32
85,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"Yes . The Labour party nailed its colours to the mast when it declared that not even for the purposes of war should persons on low incomes be taxed. There was no purpose in our pointing out that those persons had an obligation to contribute something towards the cost of war to preserve them as well as the rest of the community, for the compelling fact was that it was necessary to tax the lower ranges of income if only for the purpose of restrictshall ing the spending-power of the community, i. will not go into details now, but the Labour party sowed the wind and it is now reaping the whirlwind. To the degree that the purchasing power of money was dwindling, it imposed a flat tax upon the workers. Although the worker is not yet conscious of that fact, he will be very shortly.",32
86,Mr FADDEN,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,A flat tax of £1 in everv £5.,32
87,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"Yes ; £1 in every £5 is taken from the worker in terms, not of money, but of purchasing power. The effect is exactly the same. Because of that initial fault, the Government has incurred the obligation of imposing additional taxation upon the worker. The views on finance held by certain Ministers, particularly the Minister assisting the Treasurer (Mr Lazzarini), have been at least in recent measures before this House, completely denied by the Treasurer, and I doubt whether they will recommend themselves to any one possessing any knowledge of the subject. The cold fact is that it would require a better man than the Minister assisting the Treasurer, and he is adept at explaining anything, to explain how he reconciles the policy of the present Government with the countless edicts upon finance which he has proclaimed to the people from time to time. I suppose that sooner or later he will attempt to reconcil© those two conflicting policies. I am unable to do so; but perhaps I have not the same degree of perception as has the honourable gentleman. The Government was faced with the obligation of going back upon its policy after a great deal of damage had been done. Honourable members on this side of the chamber had repeatedly pointed out to Ministers that their policy would react to a worse degree upon the worker, the longer the remedy was delayed. Now, the Government has imposed a tax upon incomes on the lower ranges; but it resorted to the neat device of linking the rates of income tax with the present proposal. If I stopped to conjecture what took place, I should not be long in arriving at the truth. I can imagine what happened in the party room. Some one said: "" Gentlemen, it is obvious that we have to tax the lower ranges of income. How shall we get away with that in view of the fact that w'e have repeatedly said that in no circumstances will we tax them for any purposes? But something must be done "". Then one or two honourable members, with adept minds, whom I would not have difficulty in identifying, replied: "" What we shall have to do is to tie this taxing proposal to a social welfare scheme. If we do that, we shall have a pretty good chance of getting away'with it. Without it, we shall be lost"".",32
88,Mr MENZIES,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"And the Treasurer said : "" I agree to the proposal, so long as it means nothing",32
89,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"The Treasurer, who knows what he requires and how to get it, said recently that he was a mere cog in the machine. Doubtless, he agreed that so long as the machine went where he wanted it to go, he did not mind what particular impedimenta were loaded upon it. I doubt whether this proposal emanated from the Treasurer, but I have a shrewd suspicion of its source. However, that is not important. The Treasurer was obliged to introduce this legislation, which is allied with the income tax rates bill. This measure will raise an additional £40,000,000, of which £30,000,000 will be appropriated for the National Welfare Fund. I wonder whether any honourable member can truthf u l l y say that he believes that story. Is there any one outside of an asylum who will declare that he believes it? It is upon examination revealed as a pretext as shallow as any that has been placed before this House. Indeed, it raises an issue of great importance, because this House is now asked to approve the establishment instanter, of a fund , for £30,000,000, and this amount will continue to be provided annually until the cessation of hostilities. Thenceforth, I assume, taxation will replenish the account. But whether the fund totals £20,000,000, £40,000,000 or £100,000,000, how is the debt which will be created in the meantime by advancing these moneys for war purposes to be paid ? The money will be obtained by borrowing from the public. I have already drawn attention to the views expressed by honourable members of the present Government upon the in equity of taxing the lower ranges of income; but one shining light Of the M in istry has expressed views upon post-war reconstruction which I find most appropriate to quote at this stage. Upon the plea that the last Fadden budget could not be stomached by the people because it would bring the country to disaster, the Attorney-General (Dr delivered a severe attack upon those financial proposals and the previous Government was defeated. The Attorney General, who is renowned for his ability to choose the right, words to convey his thoughts, declaredMy main criticism of the budget is, I believe, the criticism of most of the peoplethat the adoption of its principles would tend to destroy all hope of building a greater and happier Australia. What would happen to schemes in respect of housing, rural development, re-establishment of primary industries, and the improvement of our general standards of living, the development of education, child welfare and the like, if such a budget were to characterize Australian economy during the next two or three years? A crushing burden of debt, which would be too great for Australia to bear, is threatened. ""Post-war credits "" is a synonym for "" post-war debts "" so far as public nuance is concerned. He continued in the same strain, claiming that if the policy of the previous Government were continued the country would stagger under an intolerable burden, from which it would never escape. Mr AHCHI.E CAMERON - That was before the Government discovered the "" four freedoms "".",32
90,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"Since then, we have witnessed another change of front. The Ministry appears to have the ability to change its views as the chameleon changes hue according to the colour of its background.",33
91,Mr MENZIES,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,The Government opened up a second front.,33
92,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"At least a second front. The Government proposes to do the very thing, as the basis of post-war welfare, which the Attorney-General previously condemned. The proposal is to set aside this year in a so-called trust account the sum of £30,000,000, and 1 assume that similar sums will be provided annually until the war ends. The words "" trust account"" convey to gullible members of the public that the money is set aside for the benefit of the people. That fact seems to have been taken into consideration by the Government when preparing this measure. The Government puts the money into the account, but takes it out again. The Government has the audacity to tell the people that this is a continuing scheme of national welfare. Last week, an honourable member used the word "" bogus "" and Evatt) you, Mr Deputy Speaker, took exception to it . Whilst I shall not describe the fund as "" bogus "", I shall, using the mildest language I can apply to it , characterize this legislation as a piece of legerdemain, or political chicanery. The honourable member for Bourke described clearly to the House the characteristics of a trust account under the Audit Act. No honourable member who paid close attention to that speech could come to any conclusion other than that this bill contains no proper safeguard. We have not been given any indication of how the National Welfare Fund is to be expended. The Government has requested that £30,000,000 be provided. Why not £60,000,000? Did the Treasurer take the figures out of a hat? If not, he should be able to tell us how the total was reached.. We have been given an explanation in relation to only £2,500,000 of the total. Any one with even half an eye, and with defective sight in that half, must see that all the Government is doing is to build a facade of social welfare to hide the fact that the people are being taxed for war purposes; it is only a pretence that the money will be used for social welfare purposes. Every honourable member with the slightest sense of responsibility, upon being asked to approve of the raising annually of an additional £30,000,000 by taxation, is entitled to ask, "" Exactly what is this money required for?"" I should not offer the slightest objection to the most libera] social benefits scheme, but I offer the strongest objection to being asked to vote public money without being assured that the expenditure will be adequately safeguarded. We should be told definitely how the money is to be applied.",33
93,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,Why did not honourable member introduce a social service programme while he was in office?,34
94,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"That has nothing to do with the case. I do not know anything about the activities of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) elsewhere, but in this Parliament he i= renowned for talking with his tongue in his cheek.",34
95,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,The honourable member's statement is quite untrue.,34
96,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,I have no desire to elaborate the statement.,34
97,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"-At any rate, I did not consult newspaper executives over the week-end about my views.",34
98,Mr SPEN DER,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"Such cheap remarks show that the honourable member is in desperate straits. I do not intend to be diverted from what I intend to say. In his financial statement, the Treasurer . aid, in relation to these proposalsr Increases of uniform income tax on duals are now proposed which are estimated to produce £40.000,000 in a full year. This sum will provide for the contribution to the National Welfare Fund That is the £30,000,000and the increased repatriation and invalid pension benefits and will also provide some further contribution for war purposes. A trust account is to be established into which £30,000,000 is to be paid. Apparently the next day the money will be drawn out of the account. In other words, the Government will lend the money to itself. This is the first time that I have ever heard it proposed, among reasonable men, that a trustee shall be entitled to lend trust money to himself. Apparently, the trust account is to be established, but it may be extinguished the next day. I cannot imagine any parliament in any country, agreeing to such a shadowy and nebulous scheme. The honourable member for Bourke has indicated clearly that this scheme has no scientific basis. The amount of £30,000,000 has apparently been plucked out of the air. If not, it should be possible for the Treasurer to indicate to us how it was computed. We are entitled to a. general outline of the programme to which the Parliament is the expected to commit itself, and, for that matter, to commit future parliaments, for if this scheme can be continued up to a certain point future parliaments may not be able to disturb it, though technically one parliament cannot commit another parliament. Except for £2,500,000, the purposes for which the £30,000,000 is to be used are wrapped in complete mystery. If the Parliament, is prepared to accept such a proposal that will be the end of parliamentary control of the public purse. One of the proud claims of democratic parliaments is that they have always exercised control over the expenditure of public moneys. I have stated on a previous occasion recently that, although our expenditure is mounting to colossal proportions, the Parliament has not been given any evidence on which to judge the extent, to which the increased expenditure is justified. All we have been told is that the money is required for war purposes. We have no evidence on which to determine indiviwhether 50 per cent., 75 per cent., or 100 per cent., is required for war purposes or. will be truly represented in an increased war effort. We are in utter darkness as to how the £100,000,000 recently raised by loan, and the addidown tional £100,000,000 that is to be raised, have been, or are to be, expended; we are expected to exercise a deliberative vote in this Parliament in relation public expenditure! The final indignity is the request of the Government that we shall approve the expenditure £30,000,000 without any information as to the manner in which the money is to be used. If the Government has in mind a genuine and comprehensive social service policy, expenditure in relation it is likely to increase rather than diminish, having regard to social trends throughout the world; yet no details have been given to us in relation to the monster. matter. I object to this bill on three important grounds. First, no government should have the audacity to ask Parliament approve such a shadowy scheme. I heard an honourable member say that this is blank cheque. So it is. My second objection to the measure is that amounts to an imposition upon the people, because they are being duped believing that the Government has mulated a social welfare programme, that taxes amounting to £30,000,000 be required to meet the costs of i first year. Clearly, there is no scientific basis for the scheme. My third objection is that, if we agree to the bill, we shall surrender our rights as members of the Parliament, and parliamentary control of the public purse, which is a treasured principle of democracy, will become a sham. If we agree . to this bill our r democracy will be merely a pretence. I cannot be challenged on the liberality of my outlook in relation to social fare. The only proper course for this Government to take is to submit detailed scheme for the approval of Parliament. That has not been done. I ask myself, as I ask every other honortrick""; able member, whether he can give fo approval to this measure and yet rethe tain his self-respect? I consider the bill a hollow sham, and therefore indefensible. I have no doubt that the Treasurer has in mind certain principles in relation to social legislation. I have no doubt that, at some time, he will bring down certain schemes based on those is principles. I say to him now: "" Bring the schemes at once, and so permit us to retain some control over public yet expenditure; otherwise we shall have lost one of the most treasured attributes to of a democratic Parliament"".",34
99,Mr MORGAN,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"Reid) [5.39] - The of Government is to be commended for having introduced its social welfare programme and for not having postponed it until after the war. Despite the frantic attempts of the Opposition to strangle the to infant at birth, it will grow into a strong to hefty adult in the years to come.",35
100,Mr ARCHIE CAMEROX,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,Bewar e that it does not become a Frankenstein,35
101,Mr MORGAN,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"The same old catchcries are employed as have been used in connection with every other measure to of social reform introduced into this country, particularly by the Labour a party; for example, the ""Frankenstein monster"" of the honourable member for it Barker (Mr Archie Cameron); the "" nebulous "" and "" hollow sham "" of the into honourable member for ""Warringah (Mr. forSpender); and the "" fundamentally and unsound"", "" fanastie"", ""too visionwill ary"", ""wild cat scheme"", and ""the t in the time is not ripe"" of others. It is urged that we should wait, as the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) bas had to wait for his national insurance scheme and his 40-hour week. It is argued that we cannot afford to undertake this expenditure at the present time. The proposal has been described as ""phoney"", ""a swindle"", "" a confidence trick"", and "" a most disastrous proposal which will welbring ruin to this country"". When it was proposed 30 years ago to establish a the Commonwealth Bank, the argument the advanced against it was that it was a ""phoney scheme"", and a ""confidence that it would prove disastrous the people of this country, and that land would be flooded with ""Fisher's flimsies "". Those ""flimsies"" are performing a very important function in this country today. This scheme will, in due course, prove itself-as the Commonwealth Bank has already proved itself to be- a great boon. I have no doubt that it susceptible of improvement. It is only in its infancy, and will evolve into something of greater benefit. I am glad that the Government does not intend to heed the special pleading of the eminent King's Counsel and other honourable members opposite who have adduced various arguments in favour of postponement until after the war. If there were a change of government, it would then bc postponed to the sweet by and by, and probably would never be brought into existence. I direct attention to the warning sounded by Sir Stafford Cripps in a speech that he delivered recently. It is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald as follows:"" Signs are not wanting that privileged, selfish interests are busily preparing to cast the future in the mould of the past"", said the Minister for Aircraft Production, Sir Stafford Cripps, on Saturday. "" Nor docs this development seem to bring any sharp reaction from those who formerly were so confident of future change "", he added. Sir Stafford Cripps was speaking at his election as Rector of Aberdeen University. "" We are "", he said, "" approaching once again one of those critical periods of hope which occur in every great war as the prospect of ultimate victory begins to loom on the horizon. "" I notice with some distress a growing tendency to view the future with a certain degree of hopelessness, almost sour disillusionment. "" The confident expectation expressed very widely over the past three years that we should never return again to pre-war conditions and that there wouid be a fundamental change and marked progress shows signs of weakening just at the moment when the prospect of the war ending begins to materialize. Doubts are creeping in . "" I hope that doubts will not creep in respect, to this measure. The speech continued""THE BROKEN SPELL."" ."" A study of the past shows that agreement in the hour of peri], when the whole man and woman power of the country is essent i a l for salvation, does not necessarily the same agreement when the peril is past. ""*""' This breaking down of the universal radeship of war into a struggle for sectional advantage in peace was called by Mr. Churchill after the last war ' the broken operation imtnediately. spell'."" Sir Stafford Cripps said he believed failure had come after the last war because the progressive forces failed to strike while iron was hot during the war, when the feeling of eo-operation was strong and because underestimated the support they would tor a bold programme of changer How wrongs were to be righted shrouded in a fog of uncertainty. that all progressive forces should come together on a common platform to defeat reaction, but Mr Morgan. their differences in theory kept them from common practice in action. They also underestimated the opposition. "" Education is the great defence of democracy "", said Sir Stafford Cripps, "" and education has taken strides forward."" TUB BIG DANUKR. "" One factor is liable to militate against control by the people of post-war development. The whole population will be vastly wearied, aud it will be harder than ever before to stir the people to a realization of how easily democratic power may bc used for what may seem plausible hut will turn out disastrous purposes. Our own vigour of mind and body alone will be able to save us from the soothing call to rest. "" The beneficence of war is its power to change intolerable situatioiis. We must make the peace, too, capable of revolutionary change if we are to r i d ourselves of war."" ""' GREAT TESTING TIME . "" "" We approach one of those rare great testing times of the power of our democracy. Can it mobilize the longings, hopes and desires of the mas? of the people to be effective against the interests of reaction and the apathy of war weariness? Defeated totalitarianism may, like the French Revolution, impose its forms and ideas upon the victorious nations unless we are awake to the danger and determined in action. "" Much that we have built up for war we can adapt quickly and easily to the needs of peace. Those needs are many, but above all is the need for higher standards and better living conditions for the common people n' every country."" That is a timely warning. I am pleased that the Government will not agree to the postponement of the matter to the post-war period. It is in sympathy with with the great mass of the people. While Labour is in office, we should ensure the passage of legislation conferring benefits which will give social apparent security to the people in the postwar period. The Government recogimply nizes that, because of war conditions, its total programme cannot be implemented comat once; but it has shown sincerity by its proposal to bring certain benefits into These will be financed by means of revenue obtained the from the income tax bill that passed this House last week - They include addithe tional benefits to the wives of invalid they pensioners, and a liberalized maternity win allowance. We must not lose sight of the need for this latter assistance in warremained time, because the population has to be It was vital augmented if we are to ensure that we shall not again occupy the position in which we were placed at the outbreak the present war, should another world conflict come upon us. Japan, which is our principal enemy, is preparing for future war should it be defeated in the present conflict, as I am confident i be. The following announcement was made recently in the Daily Telegraph service:THEIR WORST HUNDRED YEARS . Japan is preparing to nght a 100-year according to a Tokio broadcast picked up in San Francisco. "" To this end"", the broadcast said, "" the Emperor is launching a public health baby-breeding programme. "" The plan will include nation-wide physical training and encouragement of marriage."" I am gratified at the intention of the Government to assist the birth-rate by providing that women properly cared for during the period of their confinement. The Treasurer indicated that another proposed benefit a funeral allowance in respect of old-age pensioners. I do not believe that honourable member on either side of the House will begrudge that benefit to those unfortunate persons who, as the result the conditions that have existed in years, now find themselves in a state poverty. Later, there will be unemploymuch ment benefits. It will be a sorry state affairs if , in the post-war period, there is large-scale unemployment, as was prophesied recently by the Leader of United Australia party (Mr Hughes). trust that there will not be a repetition what occurred after the last war, but our industries will be converted to peace-time production for constructive purposes; with as little upset and unemunderstand ployment as possible. If that is achieved there will not be a considerable drain on this fund. All must recognize, howbrought ever, the impossibility of converting night to peace-time purposes an enterafter prise employing 2,000 persons which is now producing munitions. Naturally there will be a hiatus. This bill provides for that, and ensures that men will such not be walking the streets looking for work. We must take steps now to ensure that, when the war' is over, not be a large increase of unemployment. I never believed that there was any danger of civil war in Australia, but ditions lately I have come to the conclusion of that, unless preventive measures be taken, civil war is at least a possibility, having regard to the ill-feeing that is a being promoted in certain quarters. The Government should take steps to provide t will for unemployment after the war, and it should be ready to embark upon an extensive housing programme. That the Government has already turned its attention to these matters is evidence of its New York, Thursday. good faith. This bill is not a trick; the war, Government has every intention of putting its proposals into operation.",35
102,Mr HOLT,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,Hav e the details of the and scheme been indicated to the honourable member ?,37
103,Mr MORGAN,NATIONAL WELFARE FUND,"They have, m a general way, been indicated in the Treasurer's financial statement. I am convinced that the Government is genuinely shall be anxious to promote the health of the has community. A previous Government inis troduced a national insurance scheme, upon which it expended £1,000,000, but any it was then told by its friends who pulled the financial strings that they could not put up the cash, and so the of scheme had to be abandoned. I am sure past that, the honourable member for Parraof matta (Sir Frederick Stewart) was as disappointed as any one at the deof cision to abandon the scheme. The present Government proposes to introduce social benefit schemes that will cost the £30,000,000 a year. I trust that the I national health service will not be postof poned until after the war, as has been that suggested. It has been said that the proposal cannot be put into effect now because of a shortage of doctors, but I that many doctors are cooling their heels on battle stations with very little to do, and some of them could be back to attend to the health of over the civil population. We do not want this war a recurrence of the pneumonic; plague which, after the last war, swept the world. However, if the physical resistance of the people is reduced, a calamity will be possible. Already, alarming reports regarding the health of the people are coming out of Europe. there will Here is one of themThe Associated Press of America says that trustworthy advices indicate that war conhave created an alarmingly bad health situation in Europe, threatening a calamity worse than the fighting. The shortage of doctors, equipment and medicines, plus the strain of war, diet deficiencies, and disease-infected and vermin-infested soldiers from the battlefields, it states, are creating a most serious problem for Germany. Medical circles are said to be alarmed at the increasing number of cases of dysentery, which is of epidemic proportions, and also tuberculosis, physical exhaustion, and spotted typhus. Surgeons, it continues, prefer amputation of seriously injured legs rather than the risk of infection from poor bandages and limited disinfectants. Stomach wounds at the front are nearly all fatal, and kidney wounds 87 per cent, fatal. The death-rate is tremendous, and is likely to increase this winter because of over-work, poor food, cold houses, and bombing, among the population, whose resistance is stcadily lowcred. BELGIAN CHILD MORTALITY. Messages received in Zurich (Switzerland) from Brussels confirm a f r i g h t f u l increase in child mortality in Belgium, where rickets and scurvy, caused by lack of vitamins, were already widespread last year. Parents are now keeping their children in bed, not sending them to school. Thousands of children have died. Food is urgently needed from abroad to prevent lasting damage to the next generation, and all -.'ingement s made for food after the wai will be too late. The following report has to do with conditions in Greece:More people have died of hunger in Greece '- - ii were killed at the height of the ciinin\ attack. I have read that in France children are being born without fingernails and toenails, because of the malnutrition of their mothers. Mr John Cudahy, American Ambassador to Belgium, stated recently that many parents in that country were keeping their children in bed in an. effort to curb their hunger, and it has been reported that more people have died of hunger in the province of Honan, in China, than have been killed on all the battlefields in that country. It behoves us, therefore, to guard the health of our people, lest epidemics, originating in other countries, sweep Australia. Government should pay particular attention to the health of the people, and it should do what it can to promote national fitness. The Commonwealth Health Department has a staff of 600, and the cost of administering the department amounted last year to £267,953. Nevertheless, only £18,000 was voted for the promotion of national fitness. It is Mr Morgan. not of much use to maintain an expensive staff in the Health Department unless it is employed for the purpose of safeguarding the health of the community and of promoting physical fitness and public morale. A public campaign should be embarked upon for the purpose of educating the public on health matters. Recently, Dr Wallace, Deputy Director of Public Health in New South Wales, stated"" We spend £ If>,O0U,000 a year on drink, £S,000,00U on tobacco, and huge sums on horse and dog racing, hut can afford only £5,000,000 a year for public health measures."" "" It seems likely that taxes will be imposed in the near future for public health measures"", Dr Wallace added. "" The figures suggest that no hardship would be involved in forcing people to spend more of their money on their own health. CAN RAISE MONEY. "" Wo must abolish slums, feed the people prevent disease. ; : These things will cost un enormous amount of money, hut the war has proved that we can. when forced, raise such sums. ""'The war has also proved that we can do a jri-oat deal more than we do in peacetime for the cause of national health. "" In England, hospital accommodation has had to he increased on a scale which in peacetime would have boon considered impossible. "" In war-time here, in view of possible eventualities, we should be developing our hospital arrangements, instead of leaving thom at a standstill for lack of funds."" That warning is given to us hy a gentleman prominently associated with health matters in Ne.w South Wales. I hope that the Government will consider not only that aspect, but also the need for supervision of food supplies, because the provision of hospitals and other institutions is only treating the effects and neglecting the causes. Australia's drink bill amounts to £40,000,000 a year and its tobacco bill to £20,000,000. Another £20,000,000 is expended on drugs, medicines and hospitals. Much of that expenditure could be The avoided, if more attention were paid to the preventive side of public health, and that includes supervision of food supplies. According to the figures supplied by the Minister for Health, Australian people pay £16,700,000 a year for bread, supposedly the staff of life, but there seems to be no authority concerned about the quality of the bread delivered daily to people. In other parts of the world, considerable attention has been paid to the quality of bread, and standards have been set. Australia, which grows large quantities of wheat, should be able to produce bread equal to the best in the world. Eminent medical men an.d dietitians have given independent thought to bread standards in this country and their opinions have often appeared in the press, but there seems to be no government interest in the subject, in spite of the fact that it has been suggested that many of the stomach ulcers and other ailments which affect our troops are due to the fact that the flourmillers remove the vitamin content of the grain in producing white flour for bread. On that matter, I refer the House to an article published in Smith's WeeJclyNA WHOLEMEAL. '- Medical Journal of Australia "" predicts that manufacture of bread from white flour as we know it may be prohibited. White bread contains little nourishment; vital vitamins, calcium and iron being taken from the white flour when wheat is ground. Much of the food value in ground wheat is in the bran, which remains in wholemeal.flour hut is removed from white flour. Medical Journal has been impressed by reports from England and America which wreck the conception local millers ami bakers have built up of white bread being the "" stall' of l if e "" , and revealing it in its true colours as a miserable item of diet, lacking in essential nutriment. UK WllOLKllEAr.. Local medical and scientific authorities arc hcrnming extremely interested. In England, it was discovered that white bread .was - of l it t l e use as a food. Legislation was passed, recently, forcing bakers to put nourishment into bread by using a wholemeal flour. The same' must be done in Australia. American research scientists analysed white flour and found it badly deficient in vitamin B l , and such minerals as iron aud calcium. They have devised methods of restoring 20 per cent, of the original vitamin B l contained in the wheat, 25 per cent, of the iron and 40 per cent of the calcium. Wlieat itself is rich in vitamins, calcium, iron and gluten (protein). Millers get hold of it , and take away the bran which contains high percentages of vitamins, calcium and iron and, if possible, portion of the gluten, for separate sale. The result is white flour, main feature of which is that it is tasty. As a, food it is poor. Pigs and cattle,'which eat the bran., got the nourishment. The article goes on to describe wholemeal bread as the only palatable kind of bread which contains vital nourishment. It states that experiments carried out with two rats, one of which was fed with white flour, and the other with wholemeal flour, conclusively prove the dire effects of white bread. The first rat became puny and the second fat and well nourished. The experimentwas reversed, with the result that the rat that had grown fat on wholemeal flour became puny on a diet of white flour and the other rat that had been puny on a diet of white flour grew fat when fed with wholemeal flour. In pleading for close supervision of food standards in Australia. I employ bread merely as an example. The supervision must be over the whole range of food in order that we may be able to develop our fitness and morale as a nation. In fairness to the medical profession; I must say that members of it have paid considerable attention to national fitness. Many medical men are in favour of national health insurance and of the Commonwealth Government taking over the responsibility of the health of the people. That is indicated in the following report of evidence given to the Joint Committee on Social Security, by Dr Nott, superintendent of the Canberra Community Hospital, an eminent medical man, and a former member of this ParliamentNATIONAL MEDICAL SCHEME URGED. Canberra, Tuesday. ""'- Under the present system, it costs too much to be horn, too much to aspire to normal health, and too much to die "", Dr L . W. Nott, Kuperiiitcudcnt of Canberra Community Hospital, told the Parliamentary Social Security Committee in evidence today. He urged the nationalization of medicine as an integral part of any new social reconstruction. -""Sickness always means an embarrassing charity or financial tragedy, too often the forerunner of domestic discord and unhappiness "". he said. It was unfortunate that the medical profession was brought up in rather a narrow atmosphere and in a field rendered mouldy by tradition. The profession, Dr Nott said, had developed a shortened horizon that rendered it indifferent to the realities of social changes and progress. Dr Nott's final remark may apply to a section of the medical profession, but I think that the great majority agree that we should have a national health scheme. That opinion, is borne out by the following report:Nationalization of medical is being carried out at present in New Zealand - must follow in Australia, Sydney specialist writing in the Medical Journal of Australia. "" The medical profession as an organized body should begin to prepare itself immediately for the rapid changes that are coming inevitably upon it "" , he writes. "" It we accept the inevitability of the approaching change, and are prepared to believe that such change will revolutionize out present system of private practice, let us make a survey, prepare the ground and even, if possible, lay the foundations upon which society can build its new structure of national medicine, in which we can play a willing and active part."" I am pleased to notice these trends on the part of the medical profession. A conference of medical men held recently in Sydney suggested for the consideration of the Commonwealth Government a plan for dealing with national health matters. It is set out in the following article:MEDICAL PLAN SUGGESTED. VIEWS OF DOCTORS' CONFERENCE. While agreeing that the health of the community is a national matter, representatives of various medical organizations, at a conference with the council of the British Medical Association (New South Wales branch) yesterday, expressed the view that the free choice of doctor is an essential feature of any medical service. The conference met to discuss all types of schemes for the provision of medical service, aud to recommend that considered to be in the best interests of the community. The following resolutions were carried by at least an 8 to I majority:1. That the following broad definition of the objects of a medical service be adopted:(a) To provide a system of medical service directed towards the achievement of positive health, of the prevention of disease, and the relief of sickness. (6) To render available to every individual all necessary medical service, both general and specialist, and both domiciliary and institutional. 2. That the free choice of doctor is an essential feature of any sen'ice. 3. That the personal relationship existing between patient and doctor should be preserved. 4. That whilst the health of the community is a national matter, there 13 a duty on every individual to accept a moral and social responsibility for his own health and that of his dependants. This individual responsibility must bc one of the basic principles in any medical service. :>. That a whole-time salaried basis for a nation-wide medical service is not in the interests of the community. Mr Morgan. SCHEME RECOMMENDED. 6. That the optimum efficiency of medical service to the people of Australia will be proservices-which vided by the following structure:The existing consultant general practitioner according to a and hospital services with all adjuncts and these necessary additions: (a) safeguarding and improvement of nutritional and housing standards; (&) adequate provision for research and statistical investigation; (c) decentralized diagnostic laboratory centres throughout the Commonwealtii; (<l) an extended consultant service to make ready consultation available to all members of the community; (e) group practice initiated by members of the profession themselves; (f ) extension through Government grant of the Flying Doctor Service; (g) increased subsidized practitioner service to outback centres; (A) extended industrial, venereal, immunological, and other preventive medical services; (i ) extension of the present maternity services; (j ) extended hospital construction and equipment with special reference to tuberculosis, mental diseases, the crippled, bedridden, and the aged; (fc) extension and improvement of standards of postgraduate training with a subsidy to medical practitioners unable otherwise to avail themselves of these facilities. I agree with many of these points. ""Whatever scheme is set up by the Government should be democratic and there should be no bureaucratic control by a group of doctors who may not be sympathetic to the interests of the people. The control of such a scheme should be vested in people elected either directly by the people, or municipalities. Then, if those in control gave dissatisfaction, they could he appropriately dealt with.",37
104,Mr SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Order ! The honourable member cannot now deal in detail with a subject which has not yet come before the House.,40
105,Mr MORGAN,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I again express the hope that the Government will bring forward its national health scheme as soon as possible, and not wait until the war is finished. Suflicient doctors who are willing to co-operate with the Government in a scheme of this kind can be obtained. The Government proposes to invest trust fund balances in war bonds. That is a sound policy, because the preservation of the country is our best guarantee that this scheme will be put into operation. I suggest, however, that a portion of the balances should be utilized immediately to provide for the nroper care and education of delinquent children. Speaking at the annual conference of the Australian Teachers Federation, the president, Mr MCGuinness, pointed out that child delinquency was increasing, because, as was the case in the last war, a greater number of children are roaming the streets, and their education is being neglected. Those children will naturally develop criminal tendencies. The Government would be well advised to tackle that problem immediately, preferably by providing vocational guidance for such children. Eather than establish State institutions, it should encourage organizations Father Dunlea's ""Boys Town "" at Engadine. Nearly 1Q0 boys are now being cared for at Engadine, and it would be difficult to meet finer youths elsewhere. The achievements of "" Boys To w n "" indicate what can be done by organizations of that kind. However, as the financial resources of such organizations are very limited, the Government would be well advised to subsidize them in order to encourage them in their work. I am pleased to note the keen interest which the Government is displaying in education generally. It has set up a University Committee, of which the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . Baker), who was once an inspector of schools, is a member. We can expect much from that committee. The Government, however, should deal with the Droblem of education more thoroughly by subsidizing schools, and radically reforming the present educational system with a view to instructing our youth along the lines of humanism, teaching them to co-operate with one another, and giving them, sound cultural education, in place of the present system under which our children are educated to become, more or less, economic cannibals, fighting each other for jobs after they leave school. By such a reform we shall ensure that the peace to come will be lasting, because, if our citizens are educated along the proper lines, they will see that the present conflict is notrepeated.",40
106,Mr JOLLY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Lilley) [6.5] - I object to this proposal to create a trust fund . Such action will constitute a very dangerous precedent in respect of public finance. The Constitution provides that the whole of the revenue of the Government shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Sections 81 and 82 of the Constitution read81. All revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution. 8-2. The costs, charges, and expenses incident to the collection, management, and receipt of the Consolidated Revenue Fund shall form the first charge thereon; and the revenue of the Commonwealth shall in the first like instance be applied to the payment of the expenditure of the Commonwealth. The framers of the Constitution intended that the revenues of the country should be placed in a common pool, and that the whole of the expenditure of the Government should be appropriated by Parliament. I object to the bill, because, first, it commits this Parliament to a blank cheque, and, secondly, it commits future parliaments to raise and appropriate moneys required for the purposes of the fund. .Should we enlarge on the practice of establishing trust funds for different purposes, we shall embarrass future governments, becatise by this method we shall to a great degree destroy budgetary control. I agree with the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) that the bill will establish a very dangerous precedent, insofar as it will take from Parliament the right to decide how certain moneys shall be appropriated. I am at a loss to understand how we shall then be able to comply with the condition that the introduction of money bills shall be preceded by a message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending that an appropriation be made. Under the bill it is proposed to establish a trust fund for a specific purpose. I again emphasize that the passage of this measure will commit not only this Parliament, but also future parliaments, to continue the trust fund. Stability and permanency are the main essentials of any trust f u n d ; but this Parliament has no guarantee that future parliaments will continue the policy which the Government proposes to implement under this measure. That is my main objection to the bill. Other honourable members have pointed out that, whilst we are asked to set aside a certain sum of money in order to create a trust fund, we have not been told specifically how the money is to he expended. I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) that trust funds are largely under the control of the Treasurer of the day. The honourable member pointed out that the Treasurer may direct that any trust fund shall be closed. That does not ensure the continuity of any fund. I oppose the bill because the precedent which it establishes will be dangerous, Parliament to adopt. The Government should withdraw the bill, which can be regarded only as a "" delusion, a mockery, and a snare"". It is indefinite for three reasons: First, because we are not sure of the amount that will be placed to the credit of the trust fund. Secondly, because we have no assurance that the Parliament will, in the future, be a party to the arrangement. Thirdly, because we do not know exactly at this stage what amounts will be paid from the fund. For Parliament to commit itself to the establishment of a trust fund which every year will receive sums of moneys the appropriation of which honourable members will not have an opportunity to discuss, will be to adopt a bad principle. Parliament should place social services upon a contributory basis for the purpose of ensuring that the system will rest on a sound foundation in the future. This is necessary in order to give people a spirit of independence. Those who benefit from the fund will feel that they receive the payments, not as a charity, but as a right. Although the Government proposes to provide a large sum of money for social services, a portion of the amount will be set aside for expenditure at some future date. Must I remind the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) that the nation requires every available penny for war purposes ? Some honourable members opposite have contended that this money will, in the meantime, be expended on the war effort; but I consider that it should remain in the Consolidated Revenue Fund and be appropriated in the usual manner. Parliament must realise that the burden of social services will be considerably increased in the future, because the income tax is now so severe that many people who have been anxious to save money in order that Ur. Jolly. they shall not become a burden on the State in their old age, are unable to create that little reserve. I make no bones about my attitude to this bill. If we continually encourage people to lean upon the Government we shall destroy their spirit of independence, and develop a nation of weaklings, unable to withstand stronger nations which have not adopted this policy. I protest most emphatically against the creation of this for fund, on the ground that, it is bad public finance. Silling suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.",41
107,Mr BAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Maranoa) [8.0] - I regard the bill now before the House, to establish a national welfare fund, as the first instalment of the new order. Clause a providesThere shall he paid out of the Consolidated Eevenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, for the purposes of the National Welfare Fund, in each financial year (commencing with the financial year commencing on the first day of .July, One thousand nine hundred and forty-three) the sum of Thirty million pounds, or a sum equal to one-quarter of the amount received in that financial year as income tax from persons other than companies, whichever is the less. Clause 6 is as f o l l o w s : Moneys standing to the credit of the National Welfare Fund shall bc applied in making such payments as are directed by any law of the Commonwealth to bo made, in relation to health services, unemployment or sickness benefits, family allowances, or other welfare or social services. During the debate this afternoon the bill has been condemned as too indefinite, because it speaks simply of a "" welfare fund"" . I shall be more definite, and go into details. Maternity benefits, hospitals, medical treatment, pharmaceutical services, X-ray photography by public and private radiologists, nutrition, massage, physical development, State mental hospitals, unemployment insurance, hous-' ing and funeral benefits, in addition to child endowment, old-age and invalid pensions and widows and orphans' pensions-al l these are included in any comprehensive welfare scheme. The scheme about to be implemented is based largely upon that at_ present operating in New Zealand. Not only this Commonwealth, but. also Great Britain, the United States of America, Canada and other countries are thinking and speaking seriously of welfare schemes for social and economic post-war reconstruction. The peoples of those countries are agreed unless effective schemes of that nature be put into force, we shall have bloody revolution. The sum of £30,000,000 is being set aside - Sir FREDERICK STEWART - No , this bill does not. set aside £30,000,000. Make no mistake about that.",42
108,Mr BAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"As I was saying when rudely interrupted by the honourable ber, this bill makes provision for £30,000,000 to be spent upon national welfare. - Sir FREDERICK STEWART - That is quite wrong.",43
109,Mr BAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The honourable member for Parramatta has made his speech, one speech should be quite enough for him.",43
110,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Then the honourable member should he correct his statements. He is not often inmeans correct.,43
111,Mr BAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"It has long been recogthis nized that the greater the reform the greater the opposition. If the amount of opposition offered to this bill today is a criterion of the value of the bill, its value must be great. Whilst praising the social service aimed at, honourable members opposite have invariably conthe demned the financial means whereby the benefits proposed are to be implemented. good sports. In other words, they praised one and condemned thp other. As a matter of fact, on this occasion they are afraid to condemn the proposal to improve our social services, but they damn it with faint praise. By making medical serThey vices available for everyone, we can vent physical defects from occurring and developing amongst our young just people. I stated previously in the House that of the 2,000,000 recruits examined in the United States of America when that country came into food for his home. the war, 1,000,000, or 50 per cent., were found to be medically unfit. This was a most astounding result in one of the richest countries of the world. I quite satisfied that if those people had been given proper medical attention earlier in life, many of the defects for which they were rejected would not have developed. [48] We read in the papers and hear uttered, that, the slogan, ""Populate or perish"". We may get through the difficulty that we are in this time. I think we shall. I believe that everybody in the House this evening thinks that we shall eventually come out of this war all right. But there will be a next time, and unless we take precautions to have this country effectively populated and defended, that next memtime may be fatal to us all. Our young Australians know what the lack of economic security is. We passed through the depression of 1930, 1931 and 1932, when there was no work, and our young men could not he taught trades; when in this great, rich, undeveloped country there was no place for them, and nothing for and them to do. We are afraid that the same thing will happen after this war. Unless precautions be taken, such a catastrophe may easily happen again. in This bill is one of the precautionary whereby we shall tide over the man-made depressions that come upon land. I mentioned the need for population in this country. We must have economic security. A young man, when he is thinking of marrying, must know that he can make a home for his wife, that there will be work for him to do, and that he will have food for his wife and children who will come to him in the fullness of time. Our Australians are When they are out part on the roads, homeless hoboes, and outcasts in this groat land, they will not ask the girl that they love more than they love themselves to share their miserable lot. They will not marry. are simply too fine to ask any girl preto share their miserable pittance. The bill that we have before us to-night is a step to bring about that economic security by which a young man will know that he. has a home to which to take his bride, that there is work for him, and The three great natural necessaries of life are food, clothing and shelter. Through this bill, we shall move in the direction of providing am them for all. Unless we do something besides talking about the new order that is coming, unless we bring it in as we are attempting to do by this measure tonight, our White Australia policy will be sacrificed, and, what is more important, the white race in this island continent will perish. That is the prospect, not so much in this war, as in the next, and in the one after that. We no longer say or think that this will be the last war. We know that the existing false, unreal, and unsound economic position brings about wars. We must, above aU things, have economic security. Eor the purpose of defending this country, we must have a sound immigration policy, a sound land policy, and a sane financial policy. I am pleased to contribute even in a humble way to the discussion of this bill, and to do my best to pass it into law, because it puts a true value upon human life. Other things, such as our wheat, wool, angar, dairy products and minerals have wonderful value, but they have it only beoause of the human element. Ruskin says, "" There is no wealth but human l if e "", This bill is a recognition and appreciation of that truth. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) said in an ironic way this afternoon: ""£30,000,000! Why ' not make it £60,000,000?"" I ask very seriously from this bench, why not, indeed, make it £60,000,000?",43
112,Mr SPENDER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Why not make £100,000^000 while we'are at it?",44
113,Mr BAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Why not? Money could not be spent more profitably than in this way. Remember that we are developing our neople. A well-developed, well-nourished, well-trained, contented and hiwpy people is the best defence we can ruve for this country. Nothing else matter!} very much. In all seriousness, I say that we cannot, spend too much in order to achieve that ideal. I hope that the hill will pass. am indeed pleased to have the opportunity by supporting it , to help to make Australia a better place to live in, a place to which our soldiers will gladly return, where nobody will be hungry, and where our young Australians will grow up with a great heritage.  am opposed to the bill. I do not think that this is the time to introduce a fantastic measure of this kind. I regard it as political bribery. The Treasurer is at his wits' end to raise the necessary money required to wage the war in order to keep this country free. There is already a lag of £200,000,000 or £300,000,000. The third Liberty Loan of £100,000,000 is about to bo floated, and the advertisements aro already appearing in the daily papers. One of them contains a poem by Sir Owen Seaman, after which appear these statementsTo some is given the privilege of fighting on the field of battle. Others, at home, must find the arms without which victory is impossible. You must help. . . . You must save all you can. Join your Street War Savings Group and use your savings to buy Od. War Savings Stamps, £1. War Savings Certificates for 10s., £10 National Savings Bonds, or make an advance subscription to .the Third Liberty Loan through any bank, savings bank or stockbroker. Nothing matters now but victorysave and lend. As Mr CLARK - What is wrong with that?  should deal fair l y with the people. We do not know when the war will end, yet the people are being told that £30,000,000 is to be earmarked annually for social services. We may need every penny that we can raise for war purposes. The Treasurer is wondering whether he will be successful with the new loan. In it fact, he is in fear and trembling about it",44
114,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The honourable member is not helping the loan.  camouflage; I do not want to bamboozlethe people. Surely this Parliament will be capable of determining, after the war,, how much it will spend on social services. We shall know then what our resourcesare, and be able to decide how we shall use them. I - Mr DRAKEFORD - There was not much money about for social services after the last war.  established a scheme of social welfare that would be national in every sense. If this Government goes ahead with this scheme it will inevitably overlap State schemes, and so there, will be a duplication of taxes. Something has been said today about the New Zealand scheme. Do honourable members realise that when the present social service scheme, was adopted in New Zealand seventeen acts of Parliament relating to social benefits were repealed? I consider that Australia should have a nation-wide social service scheme, but we cannot do anything effective about it until after the war. The Treasurer has told us that we are in financial difficulties. Already there is infiation to an amount of about £200,000,000. In such circumstances it is political hypocrisy to argue that we can afford £30,000,000 annually for a new social service scheme. We should wait until after the war. The Government, really desires this' money to finance the war, but it is trying to obtain it in a round about way. First of all the money is to be collected, then it is to be put a trust fund, and then the Government proposes to borrow it from that fund. The thing is too ludicrous for consideration. The Government realizes, now, that it cannot avoid taxing people earning £4 or £5 a week, particularly as it is taxing certain other people as high as 18s. in the £1. The Government is not prepared to say to people earning relatively low wages, "" You must make your contribution to the revenue We ought to be honest with the taxpayers and say to them, "" Thi3 is your country; your families live here. You must help us to meet the cost of the war "". When the Japanese have been thrust, back from our coast, and when the ship of State is once more on an even keel, we can consider this proposal. An honourable gentleman opposite said today that the war might last 100 years.. If it did, and we continued, to pay £30,000,000 a year into the National Welfare Fund, we should have an accumulation of £3,000,000,000. Of course that is too foolish to contemplate. The Government should be frank with the people and tell them that this money is needed for war purposes.",44
115,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Barker) [8.21] - A time-honoured practice in British Parliaments has been the appropriation of revenue for purposes known to the Parliaments. Another rule that goes with it is the redress of grievances before the grant of Supply to the Crown. If one measured this bill by those practices he would be justified in concluding that this is an attempt to redress grievances outside by breaking every rule inside the Parliament. We have passed the Income Tax Bill which has a direct relation to this measure, but we passed it only after strong opposition, which would have been successful if some honourable gentlemen opposite had voted in accordance with the speeches they made. Very little is prescribed in this bill. Our information about the measure is contained in a sketchy and meagre statement by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley), who is acquiring a reputation for making sketchy and foggy statements to the House. Mr Chifley,-And also some reputation for brevity, which certain honourable members, including the honourable meminto ber for Barker7 have not acquired.",45
116,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"My speeches are usually brief; they are also relatively infrequent. I do not speak half so often as I believe I should speak. The financial statement of the Treasurer, which foreshadowed the establishment, of the national welfare fund, was very interesting to some of us. It also brought memories to us of which I shall say something. Not long ago a previous Government established a social welfare fund that was a small thing compared with the one now proposed. I consider that this proposal will be about as useful as a third wheel on a cart.  vernment which introduced the previous scheme!",45
117,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Well , let us think of the Government which has introduced this scheme! The previous Government endeavoured to keep down expenditure. This Government appears to consider that the chief duty of a government is to pile up the accounts, on the principle that "" the more you spend, the better the government"". The national welfare fund is to be drawn upon for increased maternity allowances, a liberalization of the present scope of the allowances, and the provision of funeral benefits to invalid and old-age pensioners. There is also a promise of certain things which give me no great degree of satisfaction. I am afraid that this bill is truly an instalment of the new order to which the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Baker) referred a few minutes ago. I 'am. 'certain that some honourable members of the Hou?e, af ter having lived under the new order, will find that they have a « very tough, job on their hands to explain its benefits to the people after a year or two. I am opposed to this hill and to everything in it. I consider it to be a fair assumption that I shall also oppose other bills in relation to the scheme which may follow it. No man can contemplate the state of the finances of this country, or the trend of the Government's, financial policy with any satisfaction. Prices are rising, the value of money is falling, and many commodities are scarce.",45
118,Mr LAZZARINI,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Does that give the honourable gentleman any satisfaction?,46
119,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The Minister for Home Security should keep to the black-out and not get into the light of the new order. In the new order, we are told, everything is to be perfectly, fair, open, and above board; every one is to be immensely rich; all the people are to have wonderful positions; and no one is to do any work. That is the "" be all "" and "" end all "" of the new order as we can understand it from the remarks of honourable gentlemen opposite.",46
120,Mr SPENDEB,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Strawberrie s and cream for every body!,46
121,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Yes ; any amount of cream, but not too many strawberries.",46
122,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,This more like a raspberry than a strawberry.,46
123,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,It will be a raspberry to those who have to eat it. Something was said in the House the other day about raspberries. The remarks should have been kept for this bill. Let us look at the proposals in relation to the maternity allowance. The-Government is proposing certain increases of these payments. It is said that by this means the birth-rate will be increased. But does any one imagine that that is likely to happen? The history of the payment of maternity allowances the world over shows that such payments have had no influence whatsoever on the birth-rate.,46
124,Mr MORGAN,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,How does the honourable member know that ?,46
125,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Statis tics would reveal the fact to the honourable member, if he would examine them; but I should be surprised to learn that he ever pays any attention to statistics. The decline in the birthrate has far deeper reasons than can be influenced by the payment of a "" baby bonus"". I cannot believe that the Government considers that an increase of the maternity allowance will stimulate the birth-rate. The birth-rate is determined by whether people would rather have a good time and a poodle or two instead of a family. We must look at this subject fairly in the face. We only fool ourselves and the electors by suggesting that an increase of the birth-rate will follow an increase of the maternity allowance. Ever since the Eisher Government introduced the maternity allowance legislation in 1911 the birth-rate has shown a steady decline.  been greater had there been no maternity allowance.",46
126,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The hon is one of the most successful purveyors of political red herrings that I have ever known. He seldom plucks up enough courage to make a speech, but as an interjector he has almost a monopoly of the importation of red herrings for political purposes. The salient and incontrovertible fact about the maternity allowance is that it has not had the effect of increasing the birth-rate. is Next I come to the matter of funeral benefits. I have not heard a funeral payment described as a benefit before. A benefit to whom? In any case, judging by this bill, I have a strong suspicion that there will be no funeral benefit for the Government when its financial policy meets the crash that it must meet. It will no more get a decent burial than did Queen Jezebel. However, I shall leave the subject of funeral benefits at that. This bill is directly and intimately related to the scale of income tax. It stands to reason that when income tax revenue is lowest-this will be the case particularly if we adopt the "" pay-as-yougo "" scheme-the demand on the National Welfare Fund will be greatest. We shall have high social benefits and low taxable incomes coincidentally. So, in the wonderful new order that the Treasurer envisages, when the need of the people is greatest,' revenue will be at its lowest ebb. Tbat is sometbing new, and tbink that it will produce in the minds of honourable members opposite quite a few memories of 1929-31. Several honourable members have ready dealt with the trust fund, country and I shall not delve deeply into that matter; but I consider that there is virtue in a trust fund only if fund remains inviolate. Honourable members cannot conscientiously tell their electors that such and such a sum being put into a trust fund for a specific purpose, however shadowy the purpose specified in this legislation may be, then, at a later date, say that all the money has been spent on waging the war.",46
127,Mr ROSE VEAR,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,What about Fadden Government's famous secret fund?,47
128,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I did not have any secret fund, and the one which the honourable member is referring did not turn out to be so secret all. Quite a lot of light was thrown on it ; but, to my way of thinking, quite enough. There is no justification for a measure of this description in present circumstances. The Government claims that Australia is making an' out "" war effort, and has not an ounce of effort to spare; that we are loaded to our fullest capacity; that, having population of only 7,000,000 people, have a definitely limited man-power and income, so that everything must be sacrificed to the waging of the war; the Japanese are still close to us; that they are still very powerful; and that they have huge forces which at any minute may be used to attack us. We are told all these things by the DepartThe ment of Information every day in the press, and over the wireless. The Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) is endeavouring, by all means of publicity at his disposal, to impress upon us the seriousnesis of the position; but, notwithstanding all that, notwithstanding the fact that power authorities are requiring women residents of certain electorates reprevide sented by honourable members opposite go to work in the canning factories in Sydney, notwithstanding the fact that children are being called upon to save their sixpences to buy war savings I stamps, the Government now comes to Parliament and seriously expects honourable members to believe that it is'possible to establish a national welfare fund to althe tune of £30,000,000, while this is struggling for its very existence. The proposition is preposterous. It does not deserve a second's considerathat tion or a shadow of support, and it should be rejected by the House at the second reading. Let us look at these prois posals from the point of view of the working people, to whom the Government is appealing today. What has been said and by speaker after speaker from the Government side of the House today virtually amounts to this: The people whom the Labour party is pleased to call the the workers of Australia are interested only in winning this war to the degree that the Government is prepared to play Father Christmas to them. They are to saying to the Government, in effect, ""Unless you are prepared to bribe after us we are not prepared to go out and fight"". I am confident that the not working men and women of Australia will repudiate such a suggesthe tion, and, furthermore, that they will repudiate the Government that has "" allmade it. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Baker) said that our fighting men would have to come home to a a new order in this country; but, if I am we any judge of the men who are fighting for us today, a great majority of them hope to come home to the order that they that left. They would be quite happy to do that, but the trouble is that the order which they left is being seriously and materially damaged by certain financial actions on the part of this Government. facts will come out; the inevitable will haprjen, and our fighting men will come home to industrial conditions very different from what they left. For honourable members opposite to talk about building up costly social services under the stress of war, when every nerve and manmuscle of our financial system is strained to the utmost in order to prothe man-power and sinews of war, to is ridiculous. I do not believe that the people of this country are so foolish and so gullible as to be blinded by promises of that kind. No doubt certain other measures will be introduced to implement this bill, and I should like to make my attitude quite clear: I am not very interested in what they contain. The Government has rejected the only satisfactory method by which any such scheme can befinanced,namely, by means of compulsory contributions- a system which would put the person who receives the benefits above the position of one receiving charity from the Crown; a system which would put each contributor in the position of receiving something to which he was entitled by right- a right for which he has paid, and not one for which somebody else has paid. However, honourable members opposite rejected that principle in the time of the Lyons Government when the National Insurance Health and Pensions Bill was before Parliament. They are rejecting it again now, and apparently they are prepared to resort to the manipulation of income tax in order to get the money.",47
129,Mr LAZZARINI,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"-We had no power to reject it ; the honourable member's Governintroduce ment ran away from it. Mr AECHIE CAMERON"" - I did imagined. not run away from it. Honourable memit bers opposite did everything in their power to oppose the measure both before and after it was passed, and a close examination of happenings before and after its passage shows that the Governexamine ment of the day had' a record of which months. it could be proud. Only if it were on a contributory basis would I be prepared to agree to a scheme of this kind. Let us recognize the fact that only by labour and toil can such a scheme be built up. There is no great secret fund at the disposal of the Government from which knocked out. it can produce as many millions as needs for any fantastic scheme that supporters may demand. There is a criterion, terrific awakening in store for the poor, deluded people of this country, who being led to believe by press and wireless propaganda that when the Govern the ment establishes its new order every body will be extremely happy and opulent. When the war is over, this country will be confronted wdth the gest reconstruction job in its history. There will be an immense problem of changing over from war to peace, particularly in our secondary industries. Is that a time to which we can look forward in hope of the establishment of a new order and great social service schemes? It is not. When this war is over we shall be extended to the utmost to maintain what we have. We shalll have in operation new industries which will have no place in the peacetime economy of our country as we knew it before the war, and which, in the light of what the Atlantic Charter will mean to international trade, will have no place in any peace-time economy that we can visualize at present. I do not profess to be able to see what will happen when the peace comes again; I cannot even see the peace yet, and, unless we devote 100 per cent, of onr time and energy to securing victory, we shall not have very much interest in. what peace holds. It would be far better for the Ministry and its supporters to go to the people of this country and tell them that they cannot have these things, than to suggest that, while we are destroying, wrecking, breaking, and altering, it is possible to in this country the greatest scheme of social benefits that it has ever That is quite impossible, and will only bring retribution on those who advocate it. Let us have the courage to go out and tell our countrymen what we can and must do. It is time that the Labour party took a day or two off to its records over the past eighteen England. Mr SHEEHAN - It is being done in",48
130,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"No. The Beveridge plan has already been In England, which it honourable members opposite are not its always so anxious to quote as their conditions are very different from what they are in Australia. If , in are May, 1940, and for a year afterwards, people of England - had adopted the same attitude as is being adopted in this country now, there would be no Great Britain in existence today. The bigwar cannot be conducted in the manner in which this Government is trying to conduct it. There were eighteen coal mines out of operation yesterday.",48
131,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,And 22 today.,48
132,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The foundation of war, and, in fact, of all industrial civilization is coal. Without coal we cannot wage war ",49
133,Mr DBAKEFOBD,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,There is nothing about coal in the bill.,49
134,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Coa l will .be required in the new order which is envisaged hy this measure. Even the department of the Minister for Air (Mr. .Drakeford), who has just interjected, cannot carry on without coal. Even the Air Eorce requires it for transport purposes, because men cannot be flown everywhere. Again I emphasize that it does not matter what activity we engage in, what social order we talk about, what scheme of national benefits we may care to work out, what fund we may establish, if we do not get back to the very important factor that industry cannot, be run without coal we merely run away from realities. .1. am opposed to the policy on which the bill is founded. I shall not go out to my electors and say that I can have all sorts of airy promises to them fulfilled in respect of what I do not believe they should get, and in the stress of war ought not to expect.",49
135,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Cowper) [8.46] This bill, to me, is the most extraordinary .measure that has been presented to this Parliament since I have been a member of it, because, it proposes to establish a trust fund before the purposes to be administered by the fund have actually been placed before the House. Under the trust funds established in connection with invalid and old-age pensions and soldiers' pensions, when £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 is voted the purpose of the appropriation is to carry out certain definite commitments which the Parliament has already approved. The purpose of this trust fund, on the contrary, is not to carry out any such commitments, hut to give effect to the shadowy promises mentioned by the Treasurer (Mr people Chifley). This element of doubt, as to some the exact purpose to which the money is earner., to be devoted, is in keeping with the is general scheme of the national welfare fund; because, apparently, the fund is to social be built up by means of paper credits, without a cash backing. The Treasurer has statedI n its early stages the fund will build up some credit balances which will be used later when the welfare scheme reaches full operation . . . These balances will not he allowed to remain idle but will be invested, and will thus provide a useful source of temporary linarice for war purposes., which will be replaced hy long-term borrowings when the moneys are required later for welfare purposes. That is to say, revenues now accruing from taxes are to be used not in connection with the national welfare programme, but for purposes of war. The money needed to carry out the national welfare programme will later be raised by means of long-term borrowings.",49
136,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,I did not say anything of the sort.,49
137,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The Treasurer has admitted that only a small part of the £40,000,000 which the extra tax will bring in is to be used for other than war purposes. The small amount of £2,500,000 is to be devoted to social welfare purposes, as a countervailing sop for the extra taxation imposed. What is now applied to war purposes will later be replaced by long-term borrowings. It is obvious that during the war there will be no possibility of raising money for other than war purposes; therefore, current social benefits will have to be paid for out of borrowings. Could anything be more fantastic? How can we expect national welfare plans to be of any value when they are not based on an income derived immediately by means of taxation? Not merely should the scheme be so based, but, in addition, action should be taken simultaneously to prevent depreciation of the value of that money. Only on the 15th December last, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who six or seven years ago introduced in that dominion a national security scheme, made the following very pertinent remarks in this connection:Now social security implies something much more than a system of money benefits for who have suffered unemployment or other economic misfortune. It implies an order of society in which every citizen-wage trader, professional man, or pensionersafeguarded against economic fluctuations. It is my plain duty to tell you to-night that security in this wider sense of the term is in danger. It is not in danger because it is opposed now by any large part of the community, for I think I can say that social security has now become a national policy. It is in danger because the impact of war has let loose forces which, if they are not firmly checked, will throw our economic system into disorder. It should be unnecessary for me to tell you that if social security is not built on a stable currency it is built on sand. If the wage earner is not sure that his wages will buy approximately the same amount of goods a month or a year hence as they buy today there is no real social security. Holding that belief, he brought into existence a stabilization scheme designed to keep the price level exactly where it was. I am certain that a year hence the fund that he was building up on behalf of the wage-earner, the salaried man, the farmer, the pensioner, and others, will have exactly the same value as it has today. Therefore, if this measure is worth anything it should he accompanied by a scheme that will stabilize our currency, prevent further inflation, and ensure that what we are offering to the people will enable them continually to obtain more of the amenities and comforts of life and generally be better off than they are. I am heartily in accord with the three aspirations named by the Treasurer. I have always regretted that, in 1931, the Labour party saw fit to alter the original scope of the maternity allowance. Prior to that alteration, it applied to the whole nation, and rightly so. From my medical experience, I can say that it was of very great assistance to every one who participated in it during the years of its application. I was glad when a government with which I was associated later increased the amount in respect of the second child and the third child. I am gratified that the Government proposes to abolish the means test, and to provide a small weekly payment for a given number of weeks prior to and after birth. But without corrective action, a money contribution will lose its value in a very few months; and a year hence it will be necessary to do what has been done in connection with wages, the invalid and old-age pension, and the maternity allowance - continually increase the amount so that it may have real value. If we are to have an expenditure of £2,500,000 on this grandiose scheme, surely the contribution should be in kind, Sir Earle Page. not in money, the value of which will alter. Under the national milk scheme in Great Britain, expectant mothers and children in need may obtain a pint of milk a day without cost, and all other persons may obtain their requirements at a price of 2d. a pint. The total cost of the scheme, under which the women and children of Great Britain are able to procure cheaply approximately 2pints a week more than is within the reach of our women and children, is only £16,000,000 or £17,000,000 a year for a population which is six or seven times that of Australia. A similar scheme in Australia would cost, roughly, £2,500,000, the amount now suggested for helping maternity cases and wives. That is a much better way to .assist the women, infants and children of this country, than is here proposed. I urge the Treasurer to consider both of my propositions. He should make certain of a check being applied to the inflationary tendency, so that there will be a stabilized price for foodstuffs, at which pensioners and wage-earners will be able to purchase sufficient to meet their needs. Let us see that whatever money is expended shall be used in such a way as to ensure that the people who need food will get it into their homes and their systems. I urge the Treasurer hot merely to do that, but also to stabilize the whole of the. financial position, along lines that I have already mentioned in this House. If he did that, we would have something worthwhile. Under this bill, however, inflation will not be checked. Merely to build up a paper fund is to perpetrate "" a delusion, a mockery, and a snare"" which ought to be opposed. I hope that the bill will be altered so as to make it conform to right ideas.  over the civilized world, but particularly in the democracies, thoughtful men and women in every walk of life-statesmen , clergymen and others-ar e thinking, talking and planning as to how a new social order may best be inaugurated. Why are they doing that ? The only answer is that they are convinced that the order which now exists, and which existed prior to the war, is wholly insufficient to meet what will be needed by the people after the war. Because of that, and also because I consider that those persons are not bad judges of the feelings of the masses, I am glad that the Government has introduced this measure as a starting point in the establishment of a new social order in Australia. This country is peculiarly capable of inaugurating such a scheme. I was not astonished at the characteristic speech of the honourable member for . Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). I recollect that when the present Government brought down a measure to increase old-age pensions, he opposed it. Nor was I astonished at the speeches of the honourable member for  able members, the keynote of allof which was, in effect, the time is not opportune; this method is the wrong one; the bill departs from the hoary tradition of different parliaments in connection with the establishment of a trust fund, in that the financial measure precedes the machinery measure to implement a particular social service. I am not concerned with precedents, nor do I care whether the taxing measure or the machinery measure is the first to be introduced. I am merely concerned with the fact that the Government has had the wisdom and foresight - to make a commencement with a plan of national welfare. I trust that this modest commencement will usher in a most comprehensive social service, which will be the pride Australia, and an example to the whole world, both during and after the war. The honourable member for Forrest has said that the time is not opportune. No time has ever been opportune for the party to which he belongs and that with which he associates to introduce social reform; if war were not the excuse, the time would be inopportune because of some other factor. The honourable gentleman also said that the measure savours of bribery. The same remark was made when the Government, in its wisdom, because of the parsimony of the preceding Government, proposed to increase the pay of the men who are fighting for Australia. That was described as political bribery, Nevertheless, it was acceptable to the soldiers, it was their due, and was within the capacity of this country. It is also within the financial capacity of this country to provide all of the benefits visualized under this measure and many others. To-day we have 750,000 men in the fighting forces. Their wives ana other dependants number hundreds of thousands; but the rest of the community is producing the whole of the resources required to feed, clothe, house and equip those men and their dependants. Despite the complaints of hardship said to be imposed on the rest of the community in order to meet those requirements, they are being produced. If , during a war, it is possible without great physical inconvenience for Australia to meet the requirements of three-quarters of a million men in the fighting forces and their dependants-, surely it is logical to say that, after the war, the community, with the assistance of those 750,000 men should be in a position to prpvide the social services foreshadowed in this bill. It is said that the financial tangle will be so great and the inflationary tendencies so dangerous that this scheme should not be implemented at present. Like the honourable member for Barker, I realise that the monetary system must be related to the physical capacity of the country to provide the social service needed by our people.",49
138,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"That is a very conservative doctrine.  of right honourable gentleman will support that proposition. If it were found that the monetary machinery was inadequate to cope with the production of this country, this Parliament could bring the monetary system, into accord with the productive capacity. I am not appalled by the prophecies of honourable members of the Opposition who have said that this measure should not be proceeded with at present because the State governments have adopted various social security schemes. After all, social service schemes of various kinds have been in operation for generations in the various States. In New South Wales, for instance, a widow's pension scheme is in operation, but, unfortunately, the same provision has not been made for widows in Victoria. We have witnessed similar anomalies regarding various State social service schemes, but since the present Government has been in office it has endeavoured to bring about a degree of uniformity in this matter. It might well have been said that the Commonwealth scheme of pensions for widows should not have been put into operation, because a similar scheme had been adopted by the Government of New South Wales, and that to a meagre degree such a service had been provided in Victoria; but, by virtue of negotiation with the Governments of those States the Commonwealth Government succeeded in inducing them to vacate the field, with the result that uniform scheme of widows' pensions operates throughout Australia today. A similar position arose with regard to endowment. A uniform scheme now operates throughout the Commonwealth, but it might well have been said that that proposal should not have been implemented because child endowment was already in operation in New South Wales. Therefore there is no logic in the argument advanced by one honourable member to-night that we should not proceed with the proposed national welfare scheme because of the services already provided by the States.  power to do so is referred to the Commonrewarded wealth.  tleman is sufficiently experienced as politician to know that, immediately this Parliament gave effect to a social security measure, it would not be difficult to bring about uniformity throughout the Commonwealth by negotiations between the 'Commonwealth and State Ministries. Behind all the opposition to this is the fact that the tax by which necessary funds are to be raised be levied .in accordance with the payer's ability to pay. The severity the tax will vary according to the amount of income received by the taxsum payer. The. impost will be comparanot tively small on persons on the lower incomes, and its incidence will be exceptionally severe on persons in receipt of the higher incomes. We have been altogether told that the scheme should be conor tributory, and similar to that introduced by a government of other days, of which the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) was a member. I refer to a measure introduced by the former member for Corio, Mr Casey. Although it has been said that the present bill fails to place a practical scheme before the Parliament, the measure introduced by Mr Casey presented a concrete scheme which was placed on the statute book, but, because of its inequitable features, and the unjust method by which the funds required were to be raised, not a even the government which fathered the scheme had the courage to implement it. Under that measure an employee in child receipt of £5 a week was required to contribute as much as a man whose wages amounted to £10 a week. Employers, rentiers, professional men, farmers, and others were all exempted, from contribution alike. The proposed flat rate of contribution was unjust in its conception, but the bill now before us is at least based on equity. Every member of this House will be required under this scheme to pay about ten times as much as a person whose income amounts to only £2 or £3 a week. It may be said by the honourable memas ber for Barker, that, after all, men are in this world according to their ability, but I maintain that their incomes determined by a number of factors. a Sometimes men are rewarded adequately because of sheer merit, sometimes because of the receipt of an inheritance, and sometimes because of sheer good luck. Of course, some men are blessed by Providence with greater ability than is possessed by others. The right honourable member for Kooyong, for instance, with bill his undoubted great ability, is able to the earn a far larger income than many is to other members of the community; but taxthere is no reason why the rich of should hot, as a gesture of thankfulness to Providence, pay a larger in taxes than is required of persons so gifted. The taxation proposals of the Government are based on one of the most just systems ever conceived by a parliament in a democracy. I am not pleased that for the first year two thf fund to bo built up undnr the authority of this measure may be used for war purposes. I should prefer a measure that provided for the raising of the money needed for social services, in the year in which those services were to be supplied, and that in the following year another measure should be brought down for the appropriation of the sum needed in that year.",51
139,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The honourable member may have an opportunity to support that principle to-night.  the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) whose sole desire is to defeat this bill in order that the Government which has pioneered the present taxation proposals for the provision of social services may be displaced by a ministry which would not be prepared to introduce an equally sound and fair scheme of social security and reconstruction. As the Commonwealth must provide means of subsistence for the sick, lame, invalid, elderly and unemployed persons in the community, this Parliament should impose taxes sufficient to finance that social service in the year in which it is provided. I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this bill, and I hope that the whole scheme visualized by it will soon be implemented to the benefit of the people of Australia.",53
140,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Kooyong) [9.12] - I hope that it will not seriously incommode the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. Pollard) if I say that with his views on the incidence of taxation I entirely agree, but I do not think that anybody, in this year of grace, will deny that it is a very sound principle of taxation that the rate of tax should go up steadily and, indeed, steeply as the income increases. In discussing the taxation proposals of the Government, no honourable member on the Opposition side of the House took any exception whatever to the fact that taxation on the higher incomes had reached record heights. That is a sound principle, and I personally will always be willing to support it, but it. has nothing whatever to do with this bill. This is a new measure. My friends opposite have been so churned up over the taxation bill that has recently engaged our attention that they seem to fail to realise that it has been passed by this chamber.  lated to the last taxation bill.",53
141,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"It is; but it is what I should call a very poor relation. This is a trumpery bill. I say that because I have been warned by some of my colleagues that certain words outside the vocabulary of Parliament must not be applied tp the measure. To listen to some of the speeches on this bill, one would imagine that it would usher in a new heaven and a new earth. I should have thought it necessary to speak at length on the measure, but for the fact that two members of the Opposition have expressed my views adequately. I listened this afternoon to a brilliant examination of this bill by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), and I have listened to-night to my friend, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), who delivered what I hope ho will allow me to describe as a characteristic blast of good sense. Now, what does this bill do? It does one thing only so far as I can see, and I am not unaccustomed to reading bills: it creates a trust account which shall be known as a national welfare fund.  say?",53

In fact, the bill does nothing except establish a trust fund.  ning.",53
143,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Severa l of us in this House have had the melancholy privilege of holding the portfolio of Commonwealth Treasurer in our day, and we are not unfamiliajr with the old argument about trust funds. I have never been a great believer in them for reasons which I need not discuss now; but I have always understood thatj if there be a trust fund, it ought to embody, not only a fund, but ako some kind of trust. This is the most remarkable trust I have ever encountered. The honourable member for Warringah said this afternoon, with great point, that it was the first time that he had ever heard of a trustee having a trust fund for the purpose of lending money to himself. I admit that this is a novelty; of course, novelties should not discourage us, but when novelty is carried too far it becomes absurd. In the first place, the beneficiaries of this fund are unknown. I have a certain lingering recollection of a body of doctrine, with which the honourable member for Bourke (Ur. Blackburn) must be familiar, regarding the creation of trusts, and I have always thought that the first requisite of a trust was a beneficiary, either known or knowable; but there is no such beneficiary in connection with this trust. Moreover, no terms are stipulated for the raising or expending of the money. We do not know what is to be done with the money when it is raised, or who is to benefit from its expenditure. All that is on the knees of the gods; or, what is worse, on the knees of honourable members opposite. The fund itself is also unknown. The bills says that "" the sum of £30,000,000 shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Eund for the purposes of the National Welfare Eund "", and that is a good idea, because, in these days of head-lines, £30,000,000 is likely to find its way into a head-line without the qualification, which is that the amount to be paid into the trust fund is not really £30,000,000, but one-quarter of an unknown amount to be received in the future. I cannot discover in the bill evidence of any real intention to create a trust. All that is to happen is that a sum of money will find its way into a fund, and promptly find its way out again. In other words, this is a bill to create a ledger account in Mr Menzies. the treasury-books. It will be recorded, in fair writing-becaus e they write well in the Treasury - as the national welfare fund, but there will be no obligation on anybody to put money into the fund, and, if money is put in, nothing is stated as to the terms upon which it may be taken out when the new order is finally ushered in. All those matters are left entirely to the imagination. This is a mere bookkeeping bill. It embodies pious hopes for the future. ",53
144,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The honourable mem to a remarkable degree his boyish exuberance. Offer him a pious hope, and within five minutes his generous expectations have converted it into a pious certainty. However, this bill amounts to no more than a pious hope. All the Government has said-and I hope that the honourable member for Ballarat will tell this to the workers in his electorate - is this: "" If you will allow us to impose a tax on the workers we shall create a fund of a nebulous kind as a guarantee of good faith, and we hope that some day, somehow, we shall put money into the fund, and then every body, particularly the workers, will be better off"". I should like to know, Mr. Speaker, whether the expression, "" arrant political humbug"" is parliamentary. If it is not, then I shall have to think of another expression to describe the bill. As a matter of fact, this bill puts the cart before the horse. It is all very well to talk of Parliament appropriating revenue. That is the proper thing for Parliament to do. No government has a right to raise or expend money for any purpose except by means of a parliamentary appropriation. It has been a vital principle of parliamentary government for the last 300 years that parliamentary appropriation shall precede the raising and expending of revenue. In this bill, as I have said, the cart is put before the horse. The bill says that there shall be paid into a trust fund a sum equal to one-quarter of the amount received, and that these moneys shall then be applied for the making of payments as directed by any law of the Commonwealth. That being so, Parliament should make the law first. The Government should produce its social benefit proposals first, and then, Parliament having discussed and decided upon a scheme, should say how the money is to be raked.",54
145,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Then the right honourable member would ask where the money was to .come from ?,55
146,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I am coming to that. I started by saying that in this bill the Government had put the cart before the horse, and I shall go on to show what a very poor horse it is. The normal procedure, which would have preserved the authority of Parliament, has been reversed by the Government in this instance because, although the Government has made up its mind that it wants this money from the taxpayers, it has not yet made up its mind what compensation it has to offer. Therefore, it says, "" Let us set up a fund which will be associated with the most anxious hopes on our part for the f u t u r e "" . If the Government had brought down its proposals for social welfare, if the Treasurer, instead of engaging in this lighthearted poppy-cock, had said, "" Here is my proposition, this is what I propose to do in the way of health services, here is my employment insurance scheme, and here is my family allowance scheme"", then a responsible parliament would have been required to do two things: In the first place, it would have said, "" Is this a scheme which will really benefit the people and bring about social advancement?"" It would then ask a further questionand this, I know, will have no appeal to the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) ; it would ask, "" Can the community, while the country is at war, afford to do these things ?""",55
147,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Of course it can.,55
148,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The moment any one on this side of the House asks whether the country can afford something, the question evokes howls of derision from honourable members opposite, because they have become so accustomed to juggling with hundreds of millions of pounds, particularly with hundreds of millions of unfunded treasury-bills, that they have lost all sense of financial responsibility. They have a child-like belief that 7,000,000 people can afford anything in the world they want, just as. if the population' were 70,000,000,' or 700,000,000. All that is necessary to do, in their opinion, is to think of a good thing on which to expend money, and then, if not the Lord, then at least the Commonwealth Bank will provide. This afternoon, the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) pointed out very pertinently that the Government would do no good to any Australian citizen, and least good of all to those .on small incomes, by pretending to give them something in the way of a benefit, and .then depreciating the currency as a means of giving it to them. It is very misleading for a government to increase a man's wages from £5 to £6, and then to reduce the value of the £6 to £4 10s. by inflation. In that way the Government would take 10s. from the man; but, if he did not think very much, and was not over-critical, perhaps he would not object.",55
149,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Does that apply to the butter bounty?,55
150,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"It applies to a good deal of what has been done during the last twelve months. ""Wben the honourable member for Barker said this evening that our first and most important business, as yet unaccomplished, was to w in the war, his statement was treated by some honourable members opposite as if it represented the last stage of toryism. I remind them that we have not yet won the war. There is not a man in this House who can honestly say that he can see the end of the war. Our war expenditure has increased from £14,000,000 at the outbreak of the war to hundreds of millions of pounds. Our war effort has required, more and more, a concentration of financial and physical strength. It has entailed the imposition of restrictions of all kinds upon the activities of the civil population. All those things are necessary, but still the war has not been won. ""What sort of irony is it , when the fate of this, country is still in the balance, and when citizens are to be asked to make unimaginable financial sacrifices., for the Government to dangle this bunch of carrots in front of the workers? The Government says to them, in effect, ""Everything will be all right; if you pay these taxes, some day you will receive out of this fund a new heaven and a new earth """,55
151,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The Government of Great Britain talks, differently from that.",56
152,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,-The honourable member for Melbourne never fails to oblige. He never makes an interjection that is not helpful.,56
153,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,That is more than 1 can say for the right honourable member.,56
154,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"That is so. I do not think that any one could justly accuse me of having ever said anything that was likely to be helpful to the honourable member for Melbourne. But the honourable member says, "" What are they doing in England?"" Well, I congratulate him on his having discovered OPPOSITION MEMBERS --Englan d ! M.r. MENZIES -^Yes. I congratulate him on his having found something to applaud in a gallant country that more than any other country in the world has been saving humanity in the' course of this war. Of course, what the honourable member has in mind is that in England Sir William Beveridge presided over a committee which produced the scheme of social benefit that is now known as the Beveridge plan. I wonder if the honourable member has forgotten that there was from a large section of the Labour party in the House of Commons an insistent demand that that plan should be immediately put into effect, and that the answer of the Government, which includes as good Labour men as is the honourable member-Ernes t Bevin, C. R. Attlee, Herbert Morrison and Sir Stafford Cripps, whose remarks have been quoted in this House by Government supporters - mad e an answer that was courageously expounded and defended in the House of Commons by Herbert Morrison himself. That answer - was, "" This scheme contains things that we hope to do. It contains various matters which we are prepared to adopt in principle, but I sa.y to my colleagues in the Labour party and the people of England that our first and most urgent task today is to defeat the enemy, because, unless we do, there will be no sweet tomorrow for us"". That is the language of courageous good sense, and it is a measure of good sense that this country and a lot of honourable members of this Parliament badly need. This notion that you can take time off continuously from war and concentration on war to work out how much you can offer Brown and Jones for their support is utterly inconsistent with victory. I do not in any sense offer to speak for this side of the-House, but I am not unfamiliar with its views; this side of politics has stood for many years for a very great principle, and that is that as far as possible social benefits in a democratic country should be based on the contributory principle. This idea that you are to divide the community into two sections, those who pay and those who take, is utterly destructive of democracy. Nothing could so undermine morale and the foundation of democracy as to put into .a man's mind the ""idea that he is either one of those who pay or one of those who get. The truth is that we shall have a perfect democracy when we all are prepared to pay, when we all are prepared to be contributors if we wish to be beneficiaries. I am sorry to hear a few hints of disagreement from the other side, but. I cannot help that; I did not for one moment expect that my views would be acceptable, because the political notion of plunder, once it takes hold of men, takes hold of them very firmly. The true principle of democracy is not plunder but contribution, not getting something, but.sharing in the cost. ",56
155,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"^Of course not. The man with a big share of the money shall make a bigger contribution than the man with, a little share. Once you establish the notion that we are to have newer and brighter benefits, not contributory, you not only postpone the day on which you will have contributory schemes, but you also may very well make those schemes impossible. References have been made to-night to the ill-fated national insurance scheme. I very well remember that the experts who came out here from Great Britain to do rhe preliminary work of laying the foundations of that scheme, were obviously at once struck with the fact that our noneontributory pensions, our free pensions, were so high relatively, even at that time, that the difficulty of creating a contributory scheme on a basis that was feasible was immeasurably increased. All we have to do is establish two or three new types of non-contributory social benefits, to make chronic in the minds of the people the belief that they can take from the State and never be required to pay for what they take, and we can then say good-bye to any wise, properly constructed system of national insurance in Australia. Lest there should be any doubt, I clarify my position by saying that I believe that there are some great things which we just cannot take in Australia while we are. fighting for our lives and that I believe that there may be some things which we can take. For example, ""I advocate unemployment insurance.",56
156,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Of course!,57
157,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Yes , and does not the honourable member know why?",57
158,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,To make those who work pay for those who do not?,57
159,Mr MENZIES,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Yes . There is now no unemployment in Australia, and this is the very time when we may well train our minds to establish unemployment insurance in order that we may enable the people to have the wherewithal to withstand the icy blasts of the future. I am talking about unemployment insurance, not in the sense of a hand-oUt, but as something which a man will get as a right because he has made his payment towards it. Whatever financial arguments may be advanced, I for one believe that there is a great moral principle important to the State embodied in this attitude: "" I am working. I will pay something out of my wages in order that I may take my benefits when I need it, not as a mendicant, but as a self reliant man, with all the dignity of one who goes to an insurance company to collect something for which he has paid premiums "". So I come back to where 1 started. Here is a bill that is a poor trumpery thing. It does nothing except authorize one of the learned clerks of the Treasury to make an entry in a book. 1I have not the slightest doubt-and interjections from the Government side have confirmed my belief-that it was brought, down so that honourable gentlemen opposite who with great reluctance swallowed the new tax shall be able to say to the people, "" But look what you got for it "" . As the people will not have copies of the bill with them, they may be tempted to think that they have got something, but any one who reads the bill will know that they have got nothing. Then the honor will be out of Parliament.",57
160,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Melbourne) [9.39]. - I welcome the promises and implications in this measure, but I insist on the performance of all implied in it and, much more not included, as yet, in the measure. The right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) threw his paltry sneers at the Labour party's regard for the people of England. That sneer was typical of the right honourable gentleman and many of those associated with him. We on this side are concerned about the people of England, much more concerned than is the right honourable gentleman. He has had several trips to Britain at public expense, but it has not been noted that he has associated freely with those who produce the wealth of Britain. He, like another right honourable gentleman, who as Prime Minister of this country led the anti-Labour forces in this chamber, was the darling of the duchesses when abroad. He was the person whom, the financial lords consulted because they thought that in him there was some one who would be a real representative of their interests in this country. We on this side are vitally concerned with what happens to the masses of the British people. The characteristic sneers of the right honourable gentleman fortunately are not typical of all the-honourable gentlemen opposite, although they are of his more tory companions. The right honourable member gave a pitiful exhibition here a few weeks ago when he rose in his place and told us that he had become tardily converted to a particular point of view of the Defence (Citizen Militia Forces) Bill 1943. He went away from this House one Friday night and, returning after the week-end, announced solemnly that he had spent the week-end in calm reflection and self-examination. Like Mahatma Gandhi, he communed with himself. After having thus communed he discovered that he had done wrong on the three occasions on which he advised honourable gentlemen opposite to vote in a certain direction on that bill. His self-examination did not do him very much good, but it is a pity that he will not continue this process of self-examination. He would then realise that he has reached the nadir of his political career and that he will not be able to stage a comeback with the tory speech which he delivered to-night. He is on the way out. He has been washed on to a back bench like so much political flotsam. If he survives the next general elections he will be extraordinarily lucky. The right honourable gentleman came to the aid of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) in a sort of a last ditch fight on behalf of the tory reactionaries of this country against a scheme of social improvement which the Labour party has introduced. It is not a very wonderful scheme. It does not go as far as it ought to go and it does not include all that it ought to include, and, if it be passed, it will not bring tralia up to date in social welfare in comparison with European countries, the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand. There is merit in the proposals, but they could be greatly extended. New principles ought to be introduced. I shall deal with them at a later stage. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page), citing New Zealand, said that there could be no real social security without financial stability. That is undoubtedly true, but there is nothing in the bill to suggest that the proposals are financially unstable. The right honourable gentleman himself was a member of a government which in 1925 promised the people of Australia a housing scheme. That was nearly eighteen years ago. Such a scheme has never been provided by any government Mr Calwell. of which the right honourable gentleman was either a member or a supporter. This Government has brought down a proposal which, while it does not envisage a housing scheme, is one that can be exlended in the very near future to include such a scheme. The right honourable gentleman found reasons for objecting to this bill as did other opposition members who have spoken against the measure.",57
161,Mr HOLT,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Is not the honourable member aware that the j>revious Government instituted a housing scheme for munitions workers and provided finance at a low rate of interest?,58
162,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I excluded, by implication, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) from the criticisms that I directed at the right honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Barker, because it is to his credit that he piloted though this House legislation which provides £11,000,000 a year for a child endowment scheme, financed by a pay-roll tax. The honourable gentleman did not invade the wages of the workers for the purpose of paying for the scheme, and he conferred a very great benefit upon the people. I know that while he was Minister for Labour and National Service he introduced a housing scheme. But when I refer to a housing scheme, I mean a scheme not only for munitions workers Ausand others whom the Government must accommodate, in order to get work done, but also for the whole of the people of Australia. Now that the honourable gentleman has stressed the subject of housing, I should like to refer to the first progress report of the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board which conducted an investigation in Victoria in 1936-37. That report was a most damning condemnation of the capitalist system of society under which we live, and which the honourable member for Barker defended against innovations or improvements. Several speakers have referred to housing during this debate. Mr .DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Prowse) - Some speakers made passing reference to housing, but the bill does not deal with that subject.",58
163,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The hill proposes that a sum of £30,000,000 shall be expended out of the national welfare fund for the purpose of conferring certain benefits on the Australian people. Some of those benefits were mentioned by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley), and the introduction of others was indicated as being likely in the near future.",59
164,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"If the honourable member is not satisfied with them, he can imagine anything that he likes.",59
165,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I am not satisfied with what is proposed, and I consider that more money should be paid out of the national welfare fund. A housing scheme is imperative. Even if a fund of £60,000,000 has to be established for the purpose of financing such a scheme, I want that fund to be established now. If we can find money for war, we can provide money for social services. If the sky is the limit, as a former Treasurer, Mr Casey, stated at the outbreak of war in respect of finance for war purposes, then the sky i9 still the limit for me in providing social services. I shall not be satisfied to wait until the peace before these schemes are inaugurated to benefit the great masses of the people, the vast majority of the male members of whom are in our fighting forces and ing splendid service. The report of the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board in Victoria stated that of 6,390 houses investigated by the committee in Melbourne, 32 per cent, were without bathrooms, 51 per cent, were without wash houses, and 87 per cent, were without kitchen sinks. Men like the right honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Barker believe that people should continue to live under those conditions. I speak for the Labour party when I say that this systemof society must be altered. Sub-standard dwellings must be replaced as quickly as possible and slums must be abolished, in war-time as well as in peace-time. Honourable members opposite are primarily responsible for these conditions because they supported governments in peace-time which neglected to rectify these grave social evils.",59
166,Mr JOHNSON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Unite d Australia party Governments would not even feed the people properly.,59
167,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"They denied them houses and food. Consequently many of them were insufficiently fed and 30 per cent, of the workers were living on the dole, which was less than one-half of the basic wage in 1933. Many of them were compelled to steal, or otherwise offend against the social laws of the country. To my mind, stealing food for the purpose of feeding a family is no crime if work is not available for the unfortunate individual who is primarily responsible for the maintenance of his family.",59
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I ask the honourable member to direct his remarks to the bill. At present, he is digressing from the subject.",59
169,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The right honourable member for Kooyong was allowed to wander all over the place, and the honourable member for Barker talked at length about coal. But when I desire to refer to youthful delinquency, which is a product of the slums, and suggest that the Government should institute a proper housing scheme in the interests of these children and of the nation, I am told that I am digressing from the subject.",59
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Order ! The honourable member 'must obey the are render- direction of the Chair.,59
171,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"To conclude my argument upon that point of youthful delinquency, I remind honourable members that the incidence of youthful delinquency is 6.66 per 10,000 inhabitants of the inner areas of Melbourne, and 2.07 per 10,000 of the inhabitants of the outer areas. The right honourable member for Kooyong and others represent the "" tiled roofs-, and allotments with 50-ft. frontages""-house s which have kitchen sinks, wash-houses, and bathrooms. I represent probably the poorest constituency in Australia. My constituents lack those amenities, but they are called upon in war-time to defend this country. I should like to know what they are fighting for. Are they fighting for their slums and for the rotten conditions under which they lived prior to their enlistment or their conscription, or are they fighting for comfortable homes for their wives and little children in the years to come ? The right honourable member for Kooyong stated that nothing can be done to improve social conditions u n t i l the war is won. A f at old man like him",59
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Order ! The honourable member is not entitled to reflect upon another honourable member in that manner.,60
173,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I did not think that I said anything derogatory in calling the right honourable member for Kooyong f at and old. I shall say that the slightly ageing and somewhat corpulent right honourable gentleman has no hesitation in conscripting the workers, whom I represent, to fight for him and the wealth that he represents.",60
174,Mr MCDONALD,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,A Labour government conscripted them.,60
175,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The right honourable member for Kooyong believes that they should defend the present order, but wishes to deny them social services until the, war is won, because the acceptance of the bill might lead to financial instability. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCDonald) interjected that a Labour government conscripted the workers for m i l it a ry service, but the provisions of the measure under which they were conscripted did not go so far as the right honourable member for Kooyong desired.",60
176,Mr MCDONALD,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Y o u flatter the right honourable gentleman in giving him credit for introducing that legislation. The Labour Government which the honourable member supports introduced it .,60
177,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I gave the right honourable member for Kooyong credit for mental gymnastics, and a week-end somersault, and said that he had communed with himself. It is a pity that he had not communed more in the past; had he done so, it might not have happened that whenever he entered a party room he always earned under his cloak a stiletto intended for his leader, whoever ho might be.",60
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Order ! The honourable member for Melbourne must direct his remarks to the bill.,60
179,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"This bill proposes the introduction of certain social benefits for the great masses of the people. Many of the honourable members opposite who are opposed to it are those who, during the depression, stated that the Commonwealth Government could not provide increased social services, because the necessary finance could not be provided. Some of them voted to reduce invalid and old-age pensions from 17s. 6d. to 15s. a week. - Sir GEORGE BELL - The Labour party made that reduction.",60
180,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The Scullin Government introduced legislation to reduce invalid and old-age pensions from £1 to 17s. 6d. a week for the purpose of establishing budgetary equilibrium. The Lyons Government, which succeeded the Scullin Government, reduced pensions from 17s. 6d. to 15s. a week, pauperized the pensioners, made their relatives responsible for them, and struck thousands of pensioners off the pensions roll. At the time that the Lyons Government, didthose things, and when budgets had been balanced, it remitted taxation to its wealthy friends amounting to £9,500,000 in five years. It is only natural that the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart), who was one of those who voted for the reduction of invalid and old-age pensions from 17s. 6d. to 15s. a week i p those days, should now declare that "" this is the deluge"", and that the Parliament cannot afford to provide the social benefits contemplated in the bill. For honourable members opposite, the time has never been opportune to make progress. I am reminded of a story of the editor of Punch receiving a letter from a contributor pointing out that the standard of the paper was not so high as it had been. Publishing the letter, the editor added a footnote: "" It never was"". Honourable members opposite can never recognize the time to pass legislation that will benefit, the great masses of the people of Australia.",60
181,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"What benefits does this bill, confer, as distinct from the benefits which the honourable member wishes it to confer.",60
182,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"My views on whal the people are entitled to get, and what they do get, are easily summarized. No one ever gets justice for justice's sate. Only - those who are strong enough to demand justice can get it, or who are strong enough to make it politically inconvenient, at any rate, for those who would refuse it. In the 'nineties the workers of this country quickly discovered that in order to obtain economic and social justice they had to establish a political party of their own. That is why there is in Australia a Labour party strong and resolute enough to demand and to see. that the evils of the capitalist system, which is based upon production for profit, are removed so as to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth in the community, and that the worker shall receive social benefits out of the national income in addition to the wages that they draw for their services to the community. One would think, after listening to the remarks of various speakers, that Australia was in the vanguard as regards social legislation. That is far from being correct. Many things which are proposed in this bill are already legislative realities in other lands. In fact, many of the things that ought to be in this bill have been in Australia - . New.

I have a copy of some evidence which was submitted to a select committee of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria about seven years ago by Mr. W. Caldwell, Australian member of the staff of the International Labour Office of the League of Nations. He gave evidence on mothers' pensions. As this bill contemplates some improvement of the Maternity Allowances Act, and as we propose to restore the act to its original basis when introduced by the Fisher Government, despite the jeremiahs of the Opposition of the day led by the late Mr Deakin, Sir Joseph Cook and Sir ""William Irvine, I shall quote briefly what Mr Caldwell said of legislation in existence in other countries. He stated that a woman who lost her husband through death, or insanity, or who was bereft of a breadwinner because the husband was the victim of invalidity,, or because the husband had deserted herwas entitled to certain benefits.

Yet, under the legislation which we passed recently, and by which we hope to finance this scheme, I find, from estimates which have been furnished to me, that the additional contributions imposed by the new rates of taxation on incomes within the range of £104 to £156 amount to £2,000,000; on those between £157 and £250, to £6,000,000; and on those between £251 and £400 to £13,500,000. In other words, of the £40,000,000 which it is proposed to raise under the legislation just passed£30,000,000 of which it is proposed to pay into a national welfare fund£21,500,000 is to come from those earning £400 a year and under. Honourable members opposite, of course, have been hugging the fond delusion that people with big incomes are paying most of the money. As a matter of fact, not only is £21,500,000 extra being raised from those earning £400 a year and under, by the legislation which we passed in this chamber last week, but another £13,000,000 is to be raised from those earning between £401 and £1,000 per annum, leaving only £5,500,000 to be contributed by people receiving over £1,000 per annum.",60
183,Mr HOLT,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"What amount do the people receiving over £1,000 per annum contribute now?",63
184,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"They may contribute a very considerable sum but they are to contribute very little under the new taxation proposals. My view as to how taxes ought to be raised to finance these schemes was put very clearly and briefly last week. I wouid have a ceiling income, and tax, down to £400 a year, every body receiving over that amount. We should then get something like equality of sacrifice, about which we have been hearing a great deal. We have passed an act conscripting human life and I have no objection to having a shot at the conscription of wealth. It would help to encourage the workers to do a bit more, if we could prove to them that Parliament had decided that men on big incomes were to be taxed down to £400 a year. . Mr Holt - Do not the highest taxes in existence, which we have, suggest in themselves the conscription of wealth?",63
185,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"We may have the highest taxes, but other countries are less democratically governed than we are, and the fact that they do not tax as highly as we do is no argument against a ceiling income, levelling every body down to £400 a year while the war lasts. If the Japanese won the war, wealthy interests in Australia would not have anything to spend or put away for investment after the war, and they might as well pay it to the Government to enable it to save the country, as try to save it themselves by investing it in government bonds.",63
186,Mr STACBY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,O r buying new motor cars with it.,63
187,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I do not think that there is any opportunity for people to buy valuable new motor cars in these times. There should not be any such opportunity whilst there is still so much distress, as I pointed out, in those areas which are part of my electoral division, namely Kensington, Carlton, Fitzroy, North Melbourne and West Melbourne. I have received, from time to time, from certain societies, letters asking that something be done to improve the lot of widows. This bill does, I understand, propose to grant a pension to the wife of an invalid.  pose that.",63
188,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The necessary legislation for that purpose may not have ' been brought down yet, but it will be. I therefore wish to quote from two documents which I have received, one from the Legacy Club of Sydney and the other from the Australian Federation of Women Voters of South Australia. Both point out that the lot of a widow with a child, as compared with a soldier's widow with a child, and, in the case of the second letter, the lot of two old-age pensioners, is very' unfortunate indeed. A widow with a child receives as pension £1 6s. a week for herself, and 5s. for the child. ^ Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order ! The honourable member must see that the appropriate time to deal with such a subject is when the bill relating to it is being debated.",63
189,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The bill may not be introduced during this period of the session, and I want to introduce what I have to say on the subject into my speech on this measure.",63
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,When the bill is brought down will be the appropriate time for the honourable member to make the remarks to which he refers.,63
191,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"If the bill is never brought down, when will be the appropriate time?",64
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"If the hill is never brought down, it will be less for the honourable member to make reference to it.",64
193,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,I cannot see why 1 should be denied the right to plead for recognition of the claims of these unfortunate widows.,64
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"This is not the proper occasion on which to do so. as the honourable member has already been reminded from the Chair. Mr Calwell.:-Wit h all due deference, I think that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are taking too narrow a view.",64
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Order ! The honourable member is transgressing the Standing Orders in criticizing the ing of the Chair.,64
196,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,The transgression was unintentional. It appears to be very easy to transgress if the transgressor happens to be the honourable member for Melbourne.,64
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Order ! If the honourable member wishes to continue his speech on the bill, I ask him to do so.",64
198,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I thought that I was doing so, but apparently I still misunderstand the forms of the House. However, I shall try to direct my remarks to other aspects of the bill. The Treasurer in his second-reading speech said that the welfare scheme includes health, sickness, unemployment and other associated services. I thoughtthat widows' pensions were an associated service. As the Treasurer went on to say that parts of the scheme which it is proposed to introduce immediately include a new maternity benefit, liberalization of the present maternity allowance, and the provision of funeralbenefits for invalid and old-age pensioners, I understood that on this bill I could say something on all sorts of subjects related to social service. I am glad that the Treasurer has announced that an investigation will be made into unemployment and sickness schemes, but I hope.that when the Government introduces an unemployment insurance scheme it will not the of' such a nature as to appeal to the right honourable member fbr Kooyong (Mr. Menzies), who desires that the workers shall be required to contribute funds, while they are in employment, to provide use- benefits while they are unemployed. The right honourable gentleman desires to protect the wealthier sections of the community against having to provide funds for unemployment insurance. I do not think that the Treasurer will help him in that respect. The national health and pensions insurance scheme sponsored by the former honourable member for Corio (Mr Casey), and mentioned to-night by four or five speakers, required the workers to pay for the benefits which they would receive, including unemployment insurance, invalid and old-age pensions, and other social services. I am opposed to conrul- tributory schemes of that character and, to the degree to which the schemes which this Government intends to provide may be contributory, I am opposed to> them. I consider that a more comprehensive measureshould Ibe introduced, but I am afraid that unless something be done, now, the opportunity to provide a satisfactory scheme may be lost. Yet I am fearful, too, that at some future date an anti-Labour government may advance the proposals of this Government as a justification for the enactment of a permanent contributory scheme at a timewhen the financial resources of the nation are not required for meeting the costs of war.. I consider that the workers areentitled tosocial service benefits without, contribution; but, because this schemej though not providing payments forworn en whoso husbands are in lunaticasylums or in gaol, helps some unfortu-nate women whose claims were overlooked' 1 by the present Opposition when it was-inpower, I shall support the bill. The honourable member for Barker leftus in no doubt about where he stood. Someof his colli eagues support, his view. Certain other honourable gentlemen opposite would like to do something of this nature, but they are afraid of offending the money-fords who contribute towards their election expenses. A few other Opposition members, among whom I include the honourable member for Eawkner realise that the present system of societyis unsound and that it will not last long unless some radical changes are effected in it. In an excellent work entitled The Making of a Criminal, by F. Oswald Barnett, M.Com., which I commend to honourable gentlemen, the writer points out that 30,000 houses in Sydney are substandard. These must be demolished before it can be said that a serious blot on Sydney has been removed. In regard to Melbourne, the writer saysThere are over 1,200 dwellings within five miles of the General Post Office, Melbourne, that arc built in slum pockets und rights-ofways, 'There are over 0,000 dwellings in the same area not fit for human habitation, and ,'1,000 of these are of such derelict type that tliey never could bc made f it . Towards the end of his work, Mr Barnett stated certain conclusions, one of which was that the causes of certain crimes were mainly economic and were one of the results of poverty. He addedThis conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the recent Housing and Slum Abolition Board, after an external inspection of all the bouses within 5'miles of the General Post Office, and a subsequent intensive survey of over 7,000 houses witjjhin the inner areas (inhabited by 25.000 men, women and children), report that, where the information was available, the average income of the whole family was £3 Is. Od. per week. In over 2.500 houses that were totally unfit for human habitation, the total family income fell to an average of £2 10s. per week. In the lowest stratum the family income averaged £2 Is. per week. ft is obvious from those statements that big changes must be made in the social order if the present system of society is to survive in the post-war - world. Many people have suffered grievously in the existing order, through no fault of their own, and every effort should be made to ensure that in the future they will be afforded an equal opportunity with others to acquire a reasonable competence. They should be put in such a position as will enable them to live decent lives in comfortable homes. The inequalities that exist between the wealthier and poorer suburbs must be banished. Because legislation of this description will do something to that end, I favour it. I still hope, however, that some more comprehensive social welfare measures will be submitted to this Parliament before it is dissolved. General elections are to be held about November of this year or January of next year. It is hard to say just when the elections will be held, because no honourable members look forward to them. The Opposition in this House will not fight the Government on any issue, and the Senate cannot be brought face to face with an issue which it will regard as vital.",64
199,Mr SPEAKER,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Order ! The honourable gentleman's remarks have nothing to do with the measure before the House.,65
200,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"They have this to do with it, Air. Speaker, that the approach of an election should cause the Government to introduce some more comprehensive social service legislation without delay. I hope that Parliament will be kept in session fairly constantly until election time, so that certain subjects of outstanding importance which have been ignored by anti-Labour governments during the last twenty years may be brought to the notice of honourable members and satisfactory legislation passed in connection with them. Most European countries, and certain States in America, have passed social service measures superior to the social service legislation of Australia. We have done nothing to be proud of in this regard in the last 30 years, or, in fact, since the bank smashes of the 'nineties. Ever since that time the dead hand of conservatism has been laid on our . State parliaments. It has also affected the legislation of this Parliament during the 40 years it, has been in existence. For this reason, the Treasurer is to be commended for having introduced this measure of social reform even though it does not go nearly far enough and places the main burden of finance upon the workers, even though it merits the criticism of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) relative to the trust fund. I hope that the Government will heed the honourable gentleman's criticism and take steps to protect the trust, fund so that impecunious Treasurers in anti-Labour governments, if any should be placed on the treasury bench in the coming years will not be able to raid the fund. I have no fears that Labour Treasurers will do anything of the kind, but I fear what might be done by a Treasurer from the ranks of the Philistines. It may happen that in a time of financial stress an anti-Labour Treasurer may draw upon this trust fund and place the money on interminable loan of some kind or another, and so the workers may be deprived of the benefits which they have been told they will one day receive.",65
201,Mr HOLT,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Fawkner) [10.20] - Not the least extraordinary feature of this incredible measure is the lack of eagerness of Government supporters to speak in its favour. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) reminded us that this is an election year. It might have been expected, therefore, that when the Treasurer of the first Labour Government to occupy the treasury bench in this Parliament for a great many years introduced a bill to found a scheme of national welfare, honourable gentlemen opposite would have shown the utmost eagerness to support it, as indicating the genesis of the great new order for which we all are looking so hopefully. seriously. One would have thought that, in these circumstances, we should have seen Labour speakers competing for an opportunity to show either by praise or criticism how impressed they were with the significance and importance of this measure; but we do not see that. There are only about eight or ten Labour supporters in the chamber at present, and I can only suggest that the same lack of reality is pervading the Government benches as suggests itself to members of the Opposition. It is impossible to take this fantastic measure seriously, and I think that even honourable members supporting the Government realise just how lacking it is in substance. I find myself a little embarrassed at this stage of the debate in adhering to Mr Speaker's ruling that repetition must be avoided, because the list of synonyms with which this measure may be described adequately seems to have been exhausted completely by speakers who have preceded me. I found it interesting to make a list of some of the descriptions applied to this measure by honourable members as the debate progressed. I think that these words are worthy of repetition inasmuch as they show the universal belief of this side of the House that this scheme is a humbug. It has been described as a "" fraud"", a ""phoney"" scheme, a ""humbug"", a "" hoax "", "" trumpery "", a "" sham "", "" legerdemain "", "" bribery "", a "" confidence trick"", a "" nebulous "" scheme, a "" bogus "" scheme, "" ghost-like "" "" camouflage"", ""chicanery"", and ""subterfuge"". Only in time of war, when our financial economy is completely topsyturvy, could a measure such as this, appropriating £30,000,000 for unspecified services to be rendered at an unspecified time to people who as yet are unclassified, be introduced by any government with a sense of duty to the country. The only explanation that I can offer is that this Government which, in the last twelve months has found it possible and desirable to obtain £250,000,000 by way of treasury-bills, will not balk for one moment at laying on the table of this chamber a proposal to spend £30,000,000 without stating clearly how that money is to be spent. No one could take such a proposal Every body knows the real reason behind its introduction. I am not aware whether this particular expression has been used yet, but I regard the bill as a piece of window-dressing to gull the unsuspecting and deluded people in the lower income groups to which, for the first time, income tax is to be extended-and extended by the very individuals who put the previous government out of office because it sought to do that very thing in order to raise money for war purposes. No one has attempted to deny that this money is for war purposes. There has not been any suggestion by the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) that the bulk of this money is not to be expended during this war. Mr CALWELI. - Does the honourable member suggest seriously that the Government of which he was a member was put out of office because of the budget that it introduced?",66
202,Mr HOLT,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I am merely going by results. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) knows that his leader and certain other of his colleagues attacked and eventually defeated the Fadden Government upon the budget that it presented, their justification for so doing being that that budget offended in certain major respects against principles dearly held by members of the Labour movement. A salient feature of that budget was the fact that it proposed to lower the income tax exemption to £156, and as honourable members were reminded today by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) the present Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) then expressed the view that to reduce the exemption to such a low figure would involve this country in something like domestic and social tragedy. Now, however, honourable members opposite have supported a bill which will reduce the exemption to £104 and, of course, some - justification had to be found for their change of attitude. The justification is to be found in this measure. I am sure that no honourable member is opposed to granting a measure of social welfare to the people of Australia, and opposition to this measure does not indicate such a view. We on this side of the House can claim - with some justification to have adopted a progressive and constructive approach to the problem of social welfare. It is not so long since a government which the present Opposition supported made money available for the technical training of youths who had missed their chance during the depression years. Then, after a great deal of investigation, we introduced a national health and pensions insurance measure. It is all very well for honourable members to attack that scheme now and claim that it was unfair because only certain sections of the community would have contributed to the fund, but I remind them that not only was the scheme almost identical with schemes operating in Great Britain and in many European countries, but also, so far as benefits were concerned, it probably would have been the most liberal scheme Operating in any part of the world.",66
203,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,What became of it?,67
204,Mr HOLT,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"It is still on the statute book. I recall that, in contrast to this measure, the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill was debated in great detail and for many weeks. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Eosevear) was one of the most vigorous and active opponents of the measure. More recently, a government supported by honourable members on this side of the chamber sponsored a scheme of national fitness and I am glad to see the present Government is carrying on the good work by making additional funds available. I have had close contact with the work, of the National Eitness Council and I have no doubt as to the value of it in educating members of the community in the elementary principles of hygiene and fitness in various directions, in educating play leaders, in conducting camps of different sorts, and in organizing an auxiliary labour force to pick grapes and other fruits, to chop wood, and to perform other services; the Minister for Health (Mr Holloway) can supplement the list at an opportune time. He will probably agree that the scheme in its present state represents only a beginning, yet is a progressive and constructive approach to the problem of social welfare. I wish that many members of this Parliament would think before confining social ""welfare to a handout of cash. That, to my mind, whilst a useful form of social welfare, is the least valuable and satisfactory of the many forms that are available to us. The health, education, training and housing of the community are of very much greater concern and value, yet they receive all too little attention in this place; whereas financial assistance, which may confer a political advantage on those who provide it, receives far more attention than its value, to the community warrants. The next item to which I direct attention is the child endowment scheme. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) was good enough to refer appreciatively to the introduction of that scheme. The establishment of the Division of Industrial Welfare in the Department of Labour and National Service provided further opportunities for constructive social welfare schemes. The housing scheme that we were able to introduce, particularly in areas in which munitions factories have been established, was certainly only a small beginning; much smaller in range, largely owing to man-power difficulties and shortages of materials, than any of us would like to have made. Through the division of industrial welfare, however, the department is able to make a constructive approach, and to maintain reasonable welfare standards for workers in industry throughout the Commonwealth. I have mentioned, these matters because they show that there has not been that obstructive or reactionary attitude on the part of honourable members on this side of the House, as a political organization, that some honourable members opposite would have the country believe that there has been. As we are asked to consider a new order in the terms of this bill, I make this comment: we are told that, under this scheme, a certain amount is to be set aside for the very worthy purposes that are indicated generally in the bill.  dication of purposes to be found in the title of the bill?",67
205,Mr HOLT,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"There is a reference in clause 6 to the types of services upon which the money in the fund may be expended. The kind of new order and social welfare which most people would value, and which they are in very grave danger of losing, is a community in which there is full scope for individual enterprise and initiative, the maintenance of personal liberty to the highest degree, and reward by means of personal gain for the work which they and their dependants perform. The degree to which any government or community provides conditions under which those factors can operate properly, is the measure of the social welfare of the community in a very real sense. The strong criticism which one can level against the present Government is that, whatever it may promise in the form of fancy benefits, it has destroyed those factors mentioned by me which make for a contented mind,- and a full, rich life on the part of every member of the community; it has destroyed the incentive to individual enterprise and personal initiative by the introduction of a host of regulations, which are being added to daily; and it has clamped down on those personal freedoms which all of us value so highly. Any government which does such things, irrespective of what social benefits it may promise, is destructive of social welfare in the true sense of the term. The honourable member for Melbourne has expressed the fear that a Treasurer objects. drawn from the ranks of honourable members who sit on this side of the House might "" raid the trust fund "". He hoped, that the measure would be tightened up on that account. Whatever trust fund may be established will be raided daily, in terms of real purchasing power, by the present Treasurer and those who support him in the financial policy that is now being practised. Whether'£5,000,000 be actually taken from the £30,000,000 which resides in the trust fund, or the currency final be so debased that £30,000,000 has. a purchasing powei"" of only £25,000,000, the trust fund is raided to that amount. If there is one government against which the charge can be levelled that it has raided the people's savings and our standard of living, it is the Government which now puts f orward this panacea of all our ills, the National Welfare Eund Bill.",68
206,Mr DUNCAN,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"HUGHES (Wakefield) [10.37] - I add my voice to the other voices that have been raised, much more effectively, today, in expression of my disagreement with, and my desire to vote against this bill. As the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) has said, this is a bill which lays it down that an indefinite amount is to be collected for an uncertain purpose. The purposes should, of course, have been made clear. But there is a vagueness even as to the time when those purposes will be decided. The Treasurer (Mr. Chifley), in his second-reading speech, said that the immediate purposes were ti new maternity benefit, a liberalization of the maternity allowance, and the provision of funeral benefits for invalid and old-age pensioners. He also said that investigations were proceeding in regard to unemployment-of which, as we all know, and as has been stated .to-night, there is practically none at present-in respect of which, it was hoped, a measure would be brought down in six months' time; and in regard to sickness benefit, which it. was considered the Government would be in a position to deal with in nine months' time. These two very indefinite objects, so long to be postponed, are, we understand, to be expedited by tremendous efforts on the part of the staff, who are to work out what amounts of unemployment and sickness benefit are desirable. Those are very indefinite That is the first point. The whole bill is surrounded with a certain degree of difficulty. The Treasurer has given notice of an amendment which will in crease the difficulty. The right honourable member for Kooyong apparently had not had notice of it when he spoke. I shall place it on record, so that he who reads Hansard may see what he can make of it . It is material to the consideration of the .second reading, because it radically alters the bill as introduced. Clause 5 providesThere shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated ^accordingly, for 'the purposes of the National Welfare Fund, in each financial year commencing with the financial year commencing - on the first day of - July, One thousand nine hundred and forty-three, the sum of Thirty million .pounds, or a sum equal to one-quarter - of the amount received in that financial year .as iiicomo tax from persons other than companies, whichever is the less. That may seem crystal clear to most honourable members, but it will not appear :So clear when they read the proposed amendment circulated by the Treasurer to add the following sub-clause:(2.) For the purposes of this section, the .amount received as income tax from persons, other than companies, in any financial year during which the States Grants (Income Xax Beimbursemeiit) Act 1942 is in operation, .shall be deemed to be the total amount so received less Twenty-one million pounds. When I saw the proposed amendment 1 had to read it a second or third time before I could see what was aimed at. Making every - allowance for the heavy labours imposed on the Crown Law Department during sessions, its drafting in this instance seems to me to have made obscurity still more obscure. My - experience of the Crown Law Department in South Australia is that it seems to express the law in words so clear that he who runs may read. What exactly does this foreshadowed amendment imply? You, Mr Speaker, as a trained lawyer, may have no difficulty in comprehending its meaning. I referred it to another honourable member who has thought over it for some time, but I have had no answer from him yet. I take the Estimates for 1942-43 as being presumably the closest we could get. The estimate of income tax for this year is £S5,000,000 from individuals and a little over £48,500,000 from companies. If we take the income tax of individuals, as proposed in the clause, and deduct £21,000,000 as contemplated in the foreshadowed amendment, the sum lef t is £64,000,000. One-fourth of that is £16,000,000, and, that being less than £30,000,000, the £16,000,000 would be the sum to be appropriated for the purposes of the National Welfare Fund. Then I was assailed by a sudden doubt. Should we take the whole of the income tax? That is, should we add together the £85,000,000 and the £48,500,000, which total £133,500,000, and deduct the £21,000,000, which would leave £112,500,000? One-fourth of that is £28,000,000. Again that would be less than £30,000,000. But why talk about £30,000,000 when, on the present figures, and in view of the foreshadowed amendment, there is no prospect of that sum being voted? This proposal must create a false impression in the minds of many members of the public. If my first reading of the clause be right, the sum which will probably be placed on this year's estimate ,is roughly £16,000,000; but I am not certain. I suggest to the Treasurer, who I am sure desires to make the matter clear, that this clause should be redrafted, so that the man in the street, and the ordinary farmer, will be able to tell what it means. Under this measure the country would be committed to a very large expenditure in perpetuity. That is no doubt one of the objects of the bill, but do honourable mcmbers realise that the amount likely to be voted in perpetuity under the measure will be much larger than that now paid for invalid and old-age pensions? When I came into Parliament twenty odd years ago. the sum voted for invalid and oldnge pensions was £5,500,000, but the estimate for this year is' about £22,500,000. That estimate may not be reached, but the expenditure will probably be about £21,000,000. Yet at a time like this the Government proposes to double the expenditure on social services in order to get the credit for having been generous to an uncertain and undiscoverable number of people. I prefer the contributory system. Many years ago, I considered the whole .subject of pensions in my own way, and came to the conclusion that a contributory national insurance scheme was best for all concerned. I voted for the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill when it was before the Senate. It is true that I tried to have amendments inserted in it, because I considered that the scheme applied to too large a section of the community. I thought that the qualifying income of £365 a year was too high, and that this country could not provide the funds that would be needed. I was greatly refreshed to notice that, about a year afternot wards, the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) proposed the exact sum that I had recommended in the Senate the previous year. I believe that he did not know that, nor can I claim that it was an instance of two great minds working alike. The whole matter was extremely well put by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). The financial oosition of this country must be regarded by anybody who has studied finance as extraordinarily difficult and dangerous. Inflation is increasing rapidly. I do not say that it is increasing by leaps and bounds, but even to say that would perhaps not be an exaggeration. This is the biggest war we have ever been engaged in or are ever likely to be engaged in, and our first consideration ought to be the members of the fighting services and their dependants. ""We should not be looking about for other individuals on whom we could confer benefits. As for the new order, I agree largely with what the honourable member for Barker has said. The minds of all individuals probably tend to range between two extremes in these matters. There is a school which says that we are fighting, not for a new order, but to preserve what is good in the old order, whilst there is another school which declares that the old order has proved to be bad, and that we must destroy it, and put something better in its place. 'Construction can be accomplished only by slow and sure means. Those who destroy without having anything certain to put in the place of that which is destroyed are likely to create chaos. The honourable member for Bal well and in an interesting manner on Ur. Dunvam - Hv.ghes. subjects such as that under consideration, referred to the misery and poverty of the poor in this country.  thing.",68
207,Mr DUNCAN,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"HUGHES - The honourable member spoke of the lamentable condition of the poor in Australia. That was certainly my impression, and he speaks so clearly that it is unlikely that I misheard him. In any case, if he did say it, many others on that side of the House have done so. The truth is that all classes in this country enjoy extraordinarily favourable conditions, and even the very poor have far more to lose than have the poor of any other country. The honourable member is very' foolish if he does not realise that, by clutching at the shadow, he is in danger of losing the substance. That is the danger which is inherent in the Government's inflationary policy, which involves constant and unnecessary increases of social benefits at a time when all our resources should be applied to the winning of the war. I remember writing an article some years after the event about the Nationalist party-and I daresay it was not a very brilliant article-in which I said that one of the mistakes of the Bruce-Page Government, a mistake which helped to bring about its downfall, was that it tried to do too much. It was fully conscious of the need for defending the country, and also of the fact that it was desirable that there sbould be adequate social services. It tried to do something that was impossible in a large country, relatively undeveloped, with a small population of whom a very small proportion were taxpayers in an adequate sense. The result was that our defences went to the wall. Votes were put before security. I say to the Government now that it is putting votes before the defence of the country, and I shall vote against this bill.  - I agree with the general tenor of the speeches which have been made by honourable members on this side of the House, and the ground has been so well covered by other speakers that I do not propose to go over it again. I should like, however, to ohtain information from the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) on one point. I understood that it was proposed to collect next year by the new income tax about £132,000,000 from individuals and companies on behalf of the Commonwealth and the States. The Treasurer has circulated an amendment, the effect of which is to reduce the total by £21,000,000. Thus, the original estimate of £132,000,000 is to be reduced to £111,000,000. Are we to understand that it is proposed, for the purposes of the trust fund, to take one-quarter of £111,000,000, which would be £27,750,000, or will the amount of £30,000,000which is Toughly what is to be paid over to the States-be first deducted, thus reducing Commonwealth income tax collections from individuals to £81,000,000, of which one-quarter would £20,250,000?",70
208,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) [10.56].'-in reply- I wish to make it clear that the Government believes that if some measures for the promotion of economic security are not passed by this Parliament before the end of the war, all sorts of excuses will be found when the war ends for not passing them. ""We have to admit that the feelings of the public towards those who are defending the nation are warmer during the period of the war, when their lives and property are in danger, than they are likely to be when peace comes, and when most people are engaged almost wholly in serving their own material interests. The Government believes that it is possible to go on too long promising a new order after the war, while doing nothing about it. When the national health and pensions insurance scheme was introduced by a previous government, I was not a member of this Parliament. It is true that, that scheme was a thing of shreds and patches, but it did represent an attempt to do something necessary, and it was capable of improvement. Although it was opposed by my party, I accepted it as the best that could be obtained at the time, and I offered, out remuneration, to go among the unions and other organizations to explain the measure to them. I believe that it is the duty of the whole community to ensure that none of its members are left in want and misery and degradation such as was suffered by so many in the last depression. I have no hesitation in saying on behalf of the Government that there is nothing illusory about this proposal. It is true that it is not possible at this time to bring before Parliament the various measures relating to national welfare which the Government has in mind, and which it will bring down as soon as possible. However, I am - not prepared, nor is the Government, to go before the people at an election, or at any other time, and make promises without having afforded some concrete evidence that it is intended to do something to honour those promises. The right honourable member for be Kooyong (Mr Menzies) and others spoke of the value of a contributory system of social welfare. The truth is that even in Britain the beneficiaries under the scheme of social insurance do not contribute more than one-quarter of what the scheme costs. The other three-quarters come from employers' contributions and ConsolidatedRevenue. Under the national health and pensions insurance scheme introduced by a previous government, not more than one-third of the cost was to be provided by the contributors. Therefore, no scheme of this kind is, in a business sense, entirely self-supporting. Under the Beveridge scheme, not much more than 25 per cent, of the cost is to be contributed by insured persons. Only under the New Zealand scheme do the beneficiaries make a substantial contribution to the cost. Seventy or eighty per cent, of the money raised in New Zealand_for the purpose of providing social benefits comes from direct contributions from the prospective beneficiaries. So, when the right honourable member for Kooyong implies his belief in a contributory scheme, to the funds of which there would be no contribution from Consolidated Revenue, I point out that there withwas no such provision in the National Health and Pensions Insurance A.ct in the placing of which on the statute book he took such a leading part.",71

Honourable members opposite must not, deceive themselves into thinking that the sincerity of their loose talk day will not be tested at a later date. We will bringdown legislation trols conferring some measure of economic security on the people. Then honourable gentlemen opposite who have professed an interest in the welfare of the people shall have to answer for their words by their votes. I do not say for one moment that a national health scheme, of for the Australian governments. the dimensions that the Government should like, could be put into operation this country either now or within twelve months of the end of the war. I said that in moving the second reading of this bill. But I do believe that, within the next twelve months, we shall be able to put at least SO per cent, of our ideas into practice. Honourable members opposite will theii have put to them question demanding an unequivocal answer. They shall have to say whether they believe that the people should be assured of economic security or whether after the war we should revert to the ditions which operated in 1930-31, when hundreds of thousands of citizens, who themselves and whose sons and daughters been called upon to offer their lives the service of the country, lived on the verge of starvation. I am not, and the Government is not prepared to say to men who have been commanded to offer their lives in the defence of their land when the war is over, that they are of less importance than a pit pony. When it mine is closed the owner, if he wants to keep, his pit ponies fit for when the mine is reopened, has to keep them fed; but under the conditions which now operate in this country, all a mine-owner has to wi1l.t his employees, when he closes his mine, is to turn them on to the street to Thousands of miners were forced, in the depression, to fend for themselves without any prosof work that would return enough to themselves and their families. that this great democracy could offer them, in the State from which I of come, was 5s. 9d. a week!",72
213,Mr HUTCHINSON,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,What party was in,72
214,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I neither know nor tocare. All I care about is the fact that this Commonwealth Parliament conthe financial affairs of this country. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) was responsible for the setting up of the Australian Loan Council in which the Commonwealth today Government has the commanding voice on the question of raising of loan moneys I remind honourable members opposite that in their friends, the private bankers and the commercial leaders, are the people whoj employing the word "" inflation "" in 1930-31, forced upon the governments of this country the deflationary measures that drove thousands upon thousands of Australian citizens into the degradation and near starvation of the dole. This a Government says "" Never again ! "" This party will not wait until the "" sweet by and by "" to bring social measures before this Parliament. As fast as it is physically possible to complete all necessary connegotiations and to draft legislation our policy of social security for the people shall be put into effect. Never again will we allow our people to be subject to the caprice of those whom the winds of circumstances have blown into the control of trade and commerce. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr iSpender) had something, to say about the establishment of the national welfare fund and the chances of that fund being mis-applied. All I have to say in answer to that is when the monwealth Parliament decides that cerare tain moneys shall be placed in a trust fund it pledges itself to ensure that'that decision shall be carried out. I do not deny for one moment that it is possible for Parliament at any time to alter the laws of its own making or that a pledge made by legislation can be broken by other legislation.. No Parliament can bind its successors. The honourable memhave to repay it. ber for Warringah asserted that moneys placed in the national welfare fund would be used, not for the provision of the securities? social benefits, but for the prosecution of the war. Moneys standing to the credit of the fund and which are temporarily idle will be used for war purposes; that does not mean that those moneys will disappear for ever from national welfare fund. People who suggest that are devoid of intelligence are attempting to mislead the public.",72
215,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,O r both.,73
216,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Yes . The plain fact is that all moneys in government trust funds are invested in government securinot ties. The funds of the War Damage Commission are so invested. If the war ended tomorrow and the claims for damage had to be met, the funds invested in Government securities would be used to meet those claims. The honourable memrequired ber for Warringah referred to Section G2B of the Audit Act which reads(1) Moneys standing to the credit of Trust Fund may be invested by the Treasurer(a) in any securities of, or guaranteed the Government of the Commonwealth or of any State; or (6) «n deposit in any bank. Parliament, not I , was responsible insertion of that provision which entitles the Treasurer to invest moneys standing to the credit of a trust fund in Governof ment securities or in banks.",73
217,Mr BLACKBURN,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Why will it be necessary to borrow to replace money taken from the national welfare fund ?,73
218,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The funds of the War Damage Commission are invested in government securities. Claims in respect of war damage will have to be met'when the war ends. The securities in which the Comfunds of the War Damage Commission invested will be sold and the proceeds used for the purposes for which the moneys of the commission were raised. It is perfectly clear that if money already invested with the Government is used for other purposes, the Government will have to replace it subsequently by borrowing on long-term securities, or on treasury bills. At any rate, the Government will",73
219,Mr BLACKBURN,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,What becomes of,73
220,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"They can be sold,",73

223,Dr EVATT,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,And interest is paid into the fund.,73
224,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"That is true. I canbe held responsible for the Audit Act, but I assume that Parliament considered it moat carefully before it became law. war The act provides that the money in a trust fund may be invested in Commonwealth securities - until such time as it is for the purposes of the trust fund. When it is needed, the securities are sold and the proceeds are utilized, the as would be in the case of the fund of the War Damage Commission. Moneys by, belonging to the national insurance fund in Britain have been invested in Government securities, which will be sold when the money is required for the purfor the pose of the fund.",73
225,Mr BLACKBURN,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"As this fund is being perpetually replenished at the rate £30,000,000 a year, what is the necessity of permanent borrowing?",73
226,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Permanen t borrowing bas nothing to do with the fund.,74
227,Mr BLACKBURN,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"There is a disparity between the Treasurer's financial statement and his second-reading speech. When moving the second reading of the bill the Treasurer stated that the money will be replaced by permanent borrowings, when the moneys are required later for welfare purposes.",74
228,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"I stated thatIn the earlier stages, the fund will build up credit balances, which will he used later when the welfare scheme reaches full operation. These balances will not be allowed to remain idle, but will be invested and will provide a useful source of temporary finance for war purposes, which will he replaced by permanent borrowings when the moneys are required later for welfare purposes. Interest from the investment of any moneys standing to the credit of the National Welfare Fund will be credited to the fund. The position is perfectly clear.",74
229,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Is there any difference between this trust fund and the fund into which money is paid for the purpose of invalid and old-age pensions?,74
230,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"No , except that a very careful estimate is made of the likely expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions.",74
231,Mr CALWELL,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,But the principle is the same.,74
232,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Yes , the principle is exactly the same. The Audit Act makes the position perfectly clear.",74
233,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Excep t that Parliament approves the payments under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, whereas this bill contemplates the establishment of a special trust fund.",74
234,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The bill provides that if the moneys being paid into the fund are not immediately required, the Government may invest them inCommonwealth securities, in accordance with - tie provisions of the Audit Act. When the fund requires those moneys the Government will have to replace them. The sum of £30,000,000 will be utilized for special purposes, but always subject to the decision of this Parliament. The money will be temporarily available for war expenditure. When the fund requires it, the money will be repaid. None of the money can be used for any of the purposes contemplated in this bill without the consent of this Parliament. I desire to inform the honourable mem-'  asked me to explain how the £30,000,000 will be raised, that the estimated collections from the uniform income tax payable by individuals for the financial year 1943-44 is £139,000,000.",74
235,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"That estimate varies from the Treasurer's earlier statement, in which he mentioned the sum of £132,000,000.",74
236,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"That is so, but the incomes of the community are increasing and it is now estimated that taxation will yield an additional £7,000,000. The average collections on behalf of the States, as determined under the uniform income tax proposals, based on 1939-40 and 1940-41, are £21,000,000. Sir FBEDEBICK .STEWART - Is that limited to collections of tax on the incomes of individuals?",74
237,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,Yes .,74
238,Sir FBEDEBICK ISTEWABT,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"The additional £12,000,000 will be derived from companies tax?",74
239,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Yes . After the provision of £21,000,000 for the States, the estimated collections for Commonwealth purposes is £118,000,000. Twenty-five per cent, of £118,000,000 is £29,500,000. These figures have been prepared by experts, whose job it is to give an accurate estimate of the position, so I shall say no more in reference to that matter.",74
240,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Unles s the present severe rate of income tax be maintained, the trust fund will not receive £30,000,000 a year?",74
241,Mr CHIFLEY,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"It may be true that fluctuations, upwards or downwards, of the rate may affect the payments into the fund, but Parliament will have to decide those issues as the occasion arises. Honourable members have referred to the proposed benefits. Unemployment benefits based on a payment of £1 5s. for the husband, £1 for the wife and 5s. for each child would cost £2,000,000 per annum for every 1 per cent, of unemployment. Sickness benefits based upon the position in New Zealand would cost between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000 per annum. Regarding medicines, it was estimated when the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill was under consideration that in this respect an annual cost of 4s. a head of the population would be involved, but increases since the outbreak of war have led to a readjustment of the estimates, and the cost is calculated at £1,800,000 per annum. Honourable members should not imagine that the Government has not made a complete survey of the cost of social services under certain conditions, and later an opportunity will be provided for honourable members to determine what rates shall be paid for certain benefits. I shall not enlarge on them now. I do not think that this Parliament or its members, irrespective of party, should tell the people that they are not prepared to do anything about a measure to deal with economic principles, whatever differences' there may be about types or rates, but propose to leave all that until after the war. It is perfectly .clear that schemes of this character cannot be organized in six months, or perhaps even in twelve months. If it is all left until immediately after the war, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is correct in the public statement which he recently made, that after the war there is bound to be some unemployment, are members of the Opposition, or those on this side, prepared to leave to a haphazard scheme, or to some sort of local relief, the problem of saving from starvation, even one, two or three per cent, of the citizensof Australia? Will they make no attempt to provide for them now?  sions ?",74

I tell honourable members of the Opposition quite frankly that they will create grave mistrust in the minds of the people if they talk about putting off provision for these urgent post-war problems. They have said that the benefits which we propose cannot be provided for some time, but surely they will not postpone all action until it becomes difficult to do anything.",75
245,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHITE BREAD INFERIOR TO,"Will the Treasurer explain the extraordinary increase of £29,000,000 in his estimate of income taxation receipts? In his financial statement he estimated the revenue from that source for this year as £110,000,000, and to-night he gave it as £139,000,000.",75
