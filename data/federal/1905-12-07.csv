1,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. This matter is now under consideration, and a definite reply cannot be given al present, but the decision must depend to a great extent upon the price, and even more upon the question of a proper and adequate control by the Commonwealth. a. The information necessary in order to reply to this question, and also to those following, can only be supplied by the States Governments controlling the offices where the postage stamps are produced. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.",13
2,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon noticeIn view of the negotiations now said to be proceeding for the purpose of establishing a system of wireless telegrapny w'lth places in and beyond the Commonwealth, has he taken into consideration the advisableness of providing stations for the transmission of wireless messages lo and f r o between Thursday Island and any place or places in New Guinea-?",13

4,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice Whether he will make Inquiries and metal post-cards with rounded corners may pass through the post?",13
5,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:- It is not considered desirable that any articles printed on metal with thin, sharp, edges should be accepted for transmission by post unless properly enclosed and adequately protected, and they should not, therefore, be accepted as postcards, which must necessarily be sent unenclosed. CONTRACT IMMIGRANTS BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 10th November (vide page 4951), on motion by Mr DEAKINThat the Bill be now read a second time.",13
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I am not particularly pleased with this mea(sure, which the Government have introduced to regulate the admission into this country of immigrants under contract to perform manual labour. I was in agreement with them in regard to their proposal for the amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act which we had before us yesterday, but there is nothing in this Bill which causes me to view it with favour, or warrants the Government in asking us to occupy time in its consideration. In my opinion, it is worse than the legislation which it has been introduced to amend, and I hope that the House will not stultify itself by passing it in its present form.",13
7,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Does the honourable member oppose the Bill because it will not allow men to come in here under contract ?,13
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall make my meaning very clear before I have finished my speech.,13
9,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,That was the tenor of the remarks of the honourable member which have been made public.,13
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Not at all. It is well known that we, on this side, have been asking for the amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act, and, some time ago, I moved the adjournment of the House to call attention to the injustices and absurdities which are constantly being created by its administration. But now that the Government have brought in a Bill to amend its contract labour provisions, I cannot view the measure with' anv satisfaction. We have been asking for the see if light amendment of the Act, and saying That we would not be happy until we i?pt it, but now that we have got it we are not happy. I think that the Government would do well in not wasting time trying to Dass the Bill in this way. It is more restrictive than the present Act. and does not remove the stigma which our legislation olaces on our own kith and kin, and has wrought such havoc to our reputation and credit abroad. The Bill will deceive no one, but it will aggravate existing troubles. In my opinion, it should be called a Bill to make the immigration of persons under contract as difficult as possible. It hedges round their introduction with greater restrictions than already exist, and impos.es conditions which it will be almost impossible to comply with. What I desired was a bond fide and earnest attempt to remove the restrictions which are now causing so much trouble, and to proclaim to the Empire that all people of our race may come here without let or hindrance, so long as they comply with legitimate and proper conditions,. The measure is a hypocritical one, ancl in no way ameliorates present conditions. The reason for fhis is that the Prime Minister doe's net admit in his heart i'he necessity for amending the present law. He has declared over ancl over again that there is nothing in our present legislation but what should be there, and that the troubles which have occurred have been due to the wrong impressions which have gone abroad. If that be his opinion, he should try rather to remove the wrong impressions than to alter the existing law.  do anything to suit the honourable member?",13
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yesterday morning I was applauding the Government for having introduced the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill .  speaking against them lasj night.,14
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am prepared to follow the Prime Minister in his better moods, but I am not willing to follow the honourable and learned * member for Northern Melbourne. When he has got hold of the Government, I look askance at their proposals, and that is what happened last night. The honourable and learned member 1 induced the Government to amend the Bill in such a way as, in my judgment, makes if practically valueless.",14
13,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Is it a good thing to amend the law so as to allow more people to come here under contract?,14
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If I did not think so, I should not speak as I do.  able member fighting like this for the capitalists.",14
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am fighting, not for the capitalists, but for all Australians, whether capitalists or labourers. Why should I have any special concern about capital? What has capital done for me ?  able member fighting for it, seeing that it has done so little for him.",14
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not recollect that I am indebted to capital for anything that I have gained' since coming to Australia.,14
17,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member for Maranoa was thinking of the anticipations which the honourable gentleman has.,14
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What does the honourable member mean?,14
19,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Of benefits to come ! ,14
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If , as the honourable member for Gwydir is constantly telling me, I am taking an unpopular course, if I am going right away from the great bulk of the people outside, what are the anticipations to which he refers? I know of none, and certainly I do not recognise the slightest obligation to capital in what I am doing. I believe that this question of immigration, and the intermixing of the people of various parts of the Empire, cloes not affect capital or labour as such. It affects the free rights of free men, irrespective of whether they represent capital or labour. I venture to say that those who will suffer most from this legislation are the working men, and not the capitalists. I am not concerned so much about the capitalist who can look after himself, as about the great bulk of 1 the working men of Australia. I believe the course I am now taking is in the interest of the working man, in the interest of the plenitude of his employment, and in the interest of all those things which will make for the building up of a happy and contented people here. If I did not hold that belief, I should not be standing here and speaking as I am. We might very well credit each other with the best intentions, even where our opinions differ as to the method by which our object should be achieved. When the Prime Minister set out to deal with this legislation, he did so by showing very unmistakably that in his judgment it was not necessary. that he was only taking this course for the purpose of easing down some unnecessary and baseless fears concerning the ooerations of the I m migration Restriction Act. In his speech on the second reading of this Bill, saidThe problem is, why the working people of the mother country do not recognise that the law which has been so much attacked, is intended to benefit them when they come here, and operates in their interest? If the honourable gentleman really believed that, he ought not to bave introduced a measure of - his kind.",14
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Why not? My argument w;;s that the object of the Bill is to keep up the Australian standard, and that increases the temptation to the working people of the mother ;country to come to Australia.",15
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the Act is one that should find a place on our statute book, the honourable gentleman ought to maintain and defend it, and not make an obvious attempt to try to modify its provisions.",15
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We take these provisions away from the provisions relating to aliens. Mr. JOSEPH COOK - A m I to understand that the honourable gentleman cloes not mean that this is an amending measure ?,15
24,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes , certainly. It is a separate measure, and that is one great advantage.",15
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is that the onlyadvantage?,15
26,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No ; it tries to make the intention of Parliament clear.,15
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is innot tended to be no modification of the existing restrictions ?,15
28,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Oh , yes.",15
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am glad to hear that, but I fancy that the honourable gentleman is not the man to modify those restrictions. He is not the man who I . a Minister. think ought to have charge of this Bill , seeing that he has declared over and over :;gain that our restrictive legislation is port of the honourable member. purely in the interest of the working men who come here, and ought, therefore, to maintained in its integrity. Setting out chop logic. with that belief and conviction, he may succeed in making an alteration without amendment. The great outstanding diswould tinction, of this measure is that it alters important. things, but does not mend fhem. The rethis strictive provisions of the Act are being enacted in this Bill ; very much more cumfered bersomelv, I think, ancl with very much financial more red-tape. There is a juggling with words, it is true, but there is he alteration of the restrictive parts of the Act. The honourable gentleman says that he is separating the provisions of this Bill from our general Immigration Restriction Act. It may be a separation, but I am afraid that it is not a purification of the provisions of the Act. They remain in all their restrictive force, and in all their deadly effect, as I think upon the reputation and credit of Australia. Why has this legislation been asked for? Obviously, because the Immigration Restriction Act, and its administration, has produced a bad impression abroad. It has stopped the healthy flow cf free immigrants from various portions of our Empire, and the result today is that we are a stationary people, making hardly any progress, so far as the accumulation of num""bers is concerned. It is a fact, I believe, applying to the history of nations perhaps more than to anything else, that there is no such thing as standing still. The moment that we, as a nation, begin to stand still, we commence to decline in evevy sense of the term. Progress is the law of life, not only with the nation, but with the individual. We must all subscribe to that law, and the moment we cease to forge ahead, we are on the downward grade, in every sense of the term. In Australia our population is stationary. For the last ten years we, as a people, have made no substantial progress.  blame the Prime Minister for that.",15
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not blaming the Prime Minister for that, but I am blaming some of our State legislation, and also our Immigration Restriction Act.",15
31,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Ne w South Wales lost population while the honourable member was,15
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That may have been due to the cordial and complete supThis, is a very serious, subject to me, and it is be not one about which to bandy words or Australia. I repeat, is not going ahead. Immigrants are not coming aa here as they were wont to clo, and as they do if the attraction were sufficiently Obviously, the introduction of legislation is clue to the bad impression rewhich has stopped immigration, and intervery seriously to the detriment of our relations, with our creditors abroad-' What is the honourable member no substantial for Bland laughing at?",15
33,Mr WATSON,Unknown,- I must smile at that.,16
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then the honourable member, I take it, does not in the statements of the Agents-General?",16
35,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I do not.,16
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Agentsround General are on the spot, and naturally they may be expected to know more than the ment. honourable member, who is 13,000 miles distant.",16
37,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I take the Earl of Jersey, who has acted as Agent-General for New South Wales for a considerable time, it is. tD be as good an authority as any of the Agents-General.",16
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not wish to immigrants. say one word to the detriment of the Earl of Jersey. All I wish to say in that connection is that he is our guest.,16
39,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Does the member mean to imply that because the Earl of Jersey is our guest, he would say that which otherwise he would not express.",16
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Not at all . The Earl of Jersey has always been a great friend to Australia^ and no one that fact more than I do, but if he had any adverse criticism to make on Australia. I not. do not think he would choose the time when he was her guest to express his sentiments.",16
41,Mr WATSON,Unknown,He has gone out of his way to say that the suggestion that our laws are hinderirtj!; our financial operations is absolutelyincorrect.,16
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member is now raising an issue between the Agents-General and the Earl of Jersey.,16
43,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable member raised an issue between the Agents-Geneconcerned ral and myself, and I transferred it to somebodv else.",16
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"On the conreadily trary, it was the honourable member who wished to raise an issue between the Earl Jersey and myself. The Agents-General who have every opportunity to form an in the Prime Minister. telligent opinion on the spot, declare our legislation is doing a very serious jury to our relations abroad, and their efforts to assist lis at home.",16
45,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Anc l now, when we are seeking to amend the Act, the honourable ber for West Sydney. member still obiects. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.^-Yes, I obiect to this Bill because I decline to believe that is an amendment of the Act.",16
46,Mr WEBSTEH,Unknown,What else is it?,16
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the honorpopulation. able member had been listening, he would have heard' me declare that the Bill proposes a mere alteration, and not an amendbelieve ment of the Act. The Prime Minister is not prepared to admit that it is very much of an amendment. He goes all the compass before he can be got to admit that it contains a point of amendHe says that it is a separate Bill, and that in that respect it is an amendment.",16
48,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is a great thing.,16
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not think,16
50,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We get ri d of all the pains and penalties which are imposed upon alien,16
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do'not think that the separation of certain provisions from the general Act will affect the queshonorable tion of contract immigrants one iota.,16
52,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Not the main issue.,16
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is the point. Yesterday we dealt with alien immigrants, and now we are dealing with appreciates contract immigrants.",16
54,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Who may .be aliens or,16
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We have already dealt with contract immigrants who are aliens, and we are now dealing wdth contract immigrants who are on the same plane of civilization as ourselves, especially those who belong to the same Empire, and subscribe to the same standard of civilization as we do. If this measure had reference to all and sundry, I should not be so very much concerned, but I am when our own Empire is vitally and dtetrimentally affected by our legislation. I think it will be admitted very that the question of attracting population to Australia is a very serious one. of No one has-been more impressed with the necessitv for attracting population than has In every speech that which he makes he points out that the ingreat necessity of Australia is population. No one has subscribed to this doctrine more freely than have the honourable member for Bland and the honourable and learned memThey have declared that the two great need's of Australia are population and' a belter defence, and the Prime Minister is fond of declaring that the only effective means of providing for our defence iis by filling the Continent with a happy and contented white",16
56,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,We do not want slaves here.,17
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No one wants them. We all want to keep slavery as far away as possible. We wish to people Ausamine tralia with free white men; but, strange say, whenever we make an effort in that direction obstacles are placed in our way. The Prime Minister went over to Sydney the other day, and delivered a most eloquent address at Dr Arthur's immigration meetat ing. He delivered a speech that sparkled and scintillated-in every way a most cellent speech from the rhetorical point view. I read it with a great deal of sure, but afterwards I asked myself it all meant, so far as practical results concerned. The honourable member for Bland' also addressed that meeting, after I had read his speech I asked myself the same question. The other day Booth made an offer, and at first the Prime Minister seemed to think it was an excelMinister lent one.",17
58,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I think so still.,17
59,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that that has anything to do with contract labour?,17
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . Because my broad point is that the Bil l in its sent form would prevent people from comwithout land? ing to Australia. The honourable member for Bland at first thought General Booth's offer was a very good one, but afterwards he cooled cn it, ancl eventually froze it out. Now he says that the only which we can increase our population ancl promote settlement is by imposing a good stiff land tax.' That was his principal theme at Dr Arthur's meeting.",17
61,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Since I called the thing, honourable member's .attention to this tion just now, I have glanced through Bill we are discussing, and I find ence in it to any other matter except the admission of immigrants under contract to perform manual labour. Therefore, I could not allow the larger question of bility of general immigration to be discussed. I shall be obliged to confine discussion to the question whether contract labour should be) introduced, and, if so, to go to. under what conditions.",17
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think that I might be permitted to show how such as this would affect population as a whole.,17
63,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memtions ber would be in order in incidentally represent time. ferring to that point, but I could not permit him to make it his main line of argument.",17
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"When we exthe individual attitude of honourable to members who advocate the increase of our population, all their talk at public meetings appears as so much idle chatter, so much moonshine. That was one of ihe reasons why I was not anxious to appear Dr Arthur's meeting. I could see that no practical result would follow from such exspeeches as the Prime Minister delivered. of The Prime Minister is in a position of pleasupreme responsibility and power, and he what should be able to do something of a were practical tihar'acter. We find, however, that all his oratory and rhetoric effervesces and away, and nothing is done. 1",17
65,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We can do nothing worth General speaking of without land.,17
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Prime needs to take only another step in order to range himself alongside the honourable member for Bland and the other members of the Labour Party. He needs only to say that he is in favour of a good stiff progressive land tax.,17
67,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Does the honourable member think it is extraordinary for the Prime preMinister to say that we can do nothing,17
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I say that the Prime Minister is doing nothing to give practical effect to his expressed views.,17
69,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What cloes the honourable way in member think he can do?,17
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If he can do nothing, he should stop talking and endeavouring to make the people believe that he can do something. If he cannot do anylet him tell the public so, and leave questhe matter to the States Governments. I the admit that he can do nothing except in no referconjunction with the States.",17
71,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I offered to find monev to encourage immigration if the States, Parliaments would take steps to make land the desiraavailable for settlement.",17
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Prime the Minister offers to find money to bring people to Australia who have not a job,17
73,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If they have suitable land upon which they can settle without delay, a Bil l they have a job to go to.",17
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Are such condiwithin reasonable prospect at the,17
75,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes . Western Australia is giving a certain amount of land free.,18
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then why does not the Prime Minister take action?,18
77,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"My offer has been twice or thrice repeated, and I have had no general response from the States.",18
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has the Prime Minister offered to bring immigrants out here at the cost of the Commonwealth Government if Western Australia will give them land for settlement?,18
79,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No . The honourable member knows well enough that we have no right to make an o'ffer of that kind to a particular State. My offer was made to all the States., and, as I say, they have not, as a whole, responded so far.",18
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is there any possibility of anything being done in that direction ?,18
81,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes .,18
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In the meantime, I am pointing out the inconsistency of the Prime Minister in offering to assist to bring people here as free men who will not have a job to go to.",18
83,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,They will come here for land upon which they can make their homes.,18
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But they must support themselves whils.t they are getting the land, and bringing it under cultivation. The Prime Minister's aim has been to bring farm labourers here-me n who will not take up land for themselves.",18
85,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Farmers and farm labourers.,18
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the honourable gentleman says now that Ave want men who will take up land for themselves, he has very materially modified his original view.",18
87,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We want men of character and industry, with or without money.",18
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Minister would assist men to come here if they had no job to go to. but if they happened to have a billet ready waiting for them, which would place them beyond the possibility of becoming paupers and dependent upon the State, he would put every obstacle in their way by means of the contract clauses.",18
89,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Not if the terms were fair.,18
90,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Would the honourable member bring men here under contract to take the place of our own 'people?,18
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Not at all. That talk is not for this Parliament, but for the honourable member's constituents. I am endeavouring to convince honourable members of the necessity of amending the Bill or rejecting it ; and the honourable member and those associated with him are making irrelevant interjections, which they know in their hearts are not correct. In regard to the seriousness of the present situation as it affects our credit and reputation abroad, I prefer to pin my faith to the statements of the Agents-General. I cannot believe .that these gentlemen are endeavouring to injure the Commonwealth. If they are, they should be recalled instantly. Do honourable members believe that the Agent-General for South Australia is saying what he does not believe to be correct? Is it to be credited that the Labour Government of Queensland would tolerate 'an Agent-General who was doing his best to besmirch the reputation of Australia? Mr James, who represents Western Australia, is a good democrat, and I take it that the Labour Government who appointed him had the fullest confidence in him. I believe that the Agents-General are doing their very best for Australia as a whole. Is it suggested that Mr Coghlan has any other object in view ? I believe him to have a sincere desire to help the workers of Australia. Yet he subscribes to that statement. I do not think that any Agent-General would have attached his name to that memorandum if he had not believed its contents. There was no obligation upon him to do so, and the honourable member for Gwydir ought to know Mr Coghlan better than to suppose that he would subscribe Wis name to any memorandum in which he did not believe. All the Agents-General concur in the terms of that communication, and I say that nothing more scathing in the wav of criticism of our Federal legislation has ever been seen. Nothing that has been said in Australia has had a tithe of the force of the statement by the Agents-General. In endeavouring to indicate the forces which mould public opinion, they sayWe should be neglecting our duty if we failed to give adequate weight to the far-reaching effect exercised by the language test, and the contract labour section of the Immigration Restriction Act.",18
92,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member think that it is due to the fact that the two things have been mixed together, and as a result, have been misunderstood ?",18
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not see how that can be the case. The Agents General are paid high salaries to expose any misrepresentation concerning Australia. Yet they point out what has been the result of our legislation. They sayThese have proved veritable stumbling blocks to the work of the Agents-General, and have had a more prejudicial influence upon public opinion in every part of the Kingdom. Nothing has more irritated public opinion than these two matters, to which we propose to revert in a separate despatch, dealing"" with ject of immigration. In connection with this memorandum, we cannot refrain from expressing our conviction that, .although a reasonjble prevision against the. importation of labour during a strike could be full y vindicated, the real aims of the Commonwealth will not be understood or sympathized with, so long as constantly recurring incidents under the contract sections serve to remind people of the provision which grates upon every British - susceptibility, by treating the British worker under contract as an industrial "" pariah"" in a British community. .In all his flights of eloquence, the right honourable member for East Sydney has never said anything so severe as that.",19
94,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Because he professes to be against contract labour.,19
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member must be dreaming.,19
96,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,There was ijo division upon those clauses when they were considered in this House.,19
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There was no division upon them for the simple reason that nobody expected they would have the far-reaching effect which they have had. . Mr Webster - It is the old excuse, -""We did not know it was loaded.""",19
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Did the honourable member know that it was loaded?,19
99,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I was not here at the time.,19
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the honourable member had been here, doubtless all this difficulty would have been avoided. What Australia has lost by reason of his absence ! I repeat that nothing more denunciatory of our legislation has been - heard from any honourable member upon this side of the House, or from what honourable members opposite have been pleased to designate the "" stinking fish party,"" or from the ""squealers,"" as they were called, yesterday by the exceedingly elegant member for Kalgoorlie. When our own officers, who are specially charged with safeguarding the reputation of Australia - abroad, so roundly denounce our legislation, it is time for us to examine it with a view to ascertaining whether there is a sufficient justification for the aspersions which they have cast upon us. Then I should like to call attention to a letter which was recently sent by a representative of the organized workers in New South Wales to Great Britain- a letter in which he told the toilers of England that they were not to come here; that, if they did come they would find that things^were the subvery bad, and that it was difficult to get work at all.",19
101,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Is not that a fact?,19
102,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The statement is absolutely true.,19
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Are things as bad in Australia as that communication describes ?,19
104,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They are far worse than they ought to be.,19
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"After all, it seems the honourable member belongs to what has been called the "" stinking fish "" party. It is members of his party who make these allegations which are published abroad to the injury of Australia.",19
106,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The only difference is that the statement to which the honourable member has just alluded is true, whereas the other statement is not.",19
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I suppose that the honourable member is able to answer the old question--""What is truth?"" I am sure that he is, by the confident way in which he speaks. However, we are not in an ethical or theological class, but in a 1 legislative chamber, and we have to decide the matters which"" are occurring in Australia day by day, and which are affecting, so profoundly, either for good or ill , our credit and reputation abroad. On behalf of the workers of one of the great States of the Union, the statement to which I refer was sent abroad. Its author declares that Australia is no place for the immigrant, and that if he comes here, he will be confronted with conditions which will not contribute either to his decency or comfort. Not a word in condemnation of that statement has been uttered by the Prime Minister, who is specially charged with the duty of encouraging immigration. Neither have I heard anything from the leader of the Labour Party in regard to this question. He has become strangely dumb upon it recently. The policy of the Labour Party in this connection is, in its very essence, a foolish one. From the point of view of the betterment of the workers, no more suicidal step has ever been taken than that' of endeavouring tto prevent immigrants who may come to Australia, from getting upon our lands. I ' hold that every individual comes here with a little will provide work for the artisans of the country, instead of taking it from them. That is the way to create more work in the community, not to provide less. I fear that sometimes we lose sight of the fact that all our secondary industries would not bu worth much if it were not for our primary industries.",19
108,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,How does the honourable member account for the fact that there has been no material improvement in our primary industries during recent years?,20
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should' be very glad to hear the reasons which the honourable member has to advance in that connection. I do not know anybody who is more competent to express an opinion upon the primary industries of Australia than he is. He will not pretend for a moment, nor will any one else who has investigated the problem-that the welfare of the primary industries of Australia is dependent upon our secondary industries. To do so would be putting the cart before the horse with a vengeance, and no economist has ever advocated any such notion as that. The primary industries must be regarded as the basis of a country's prosperity.",20
110,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that his remarks relate to contract labour ?,20
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . My point is. that if we can attract the proper class Of immigrant's to Australia, our artisan population, who protest against the adoption of that policy, would be the first to benefit.",20
112,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have already pointed out to the honourable member that while incidental reference to that aspect of the question is permissible, the Bill deals with nothing but contract labour and the conditions under which it shall be admitted to the Commonwealth. The whole of his remarks, therefore, in reference to a general immigration policy are out of order. M i \ JOSEPH COOK - My point is that if we can induce contract immigrants ro come to Australia to engage in our primary industries, they will stimulate our secondary industries, and thus provide more work for the artisan class, who now oppose the encouragement of immigration. Just when immigration is beginning to turn towards our shores, we propose to create who fresh obstacles by means of this Bill . In capital stead of enacting these cumbersome, irksome provisions, we ought to facilitate immigration in every possible way,' and, as I say, this proposed legislation is singularly unfortunate, coming as . it does just when there seems to be a turn in our favour. These colourless proposals of the Prime Minister contrast very strongly with the vivid oratory with which he introduces, defends, and explains them. The proposals represent the minimum of action and the maximum of pretension-the minimum of effort and the maximum of words. The Prime Minister is like a star shining in the oratorical firmament; but he becomes a regular midnight blighter when the proposals themselves are examined. According to the Bill , no contract immigrant may come here unless the terms of his contract have been examined and approved by the Minister.",20
113,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is not quite correct; a contract immigrant may come here.,20
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No contract immigrant may land unless the terms of his contract are approved by the Minister.,20
115,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,He may not land unless he is willing to run the risk of the penalty provided in later clauses.,20
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is so. The purpose of the provision is to prevent the contract immigrant from landing unless the terms of his contract have been approved by the Minister.,20
117,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That may make it more advantageous for the immigrant. Air. JOSEPH COOK - Before a contract immigrant may land, a contract has to be filed in the office of the Minister; that is to say, a contract, which is made 13,000-. miles away, must be filed with the Minister,, and,., if required, verified on oath.",20
118,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,What has been done in the few cases which have arisen - has beento submit the contract in Australia before sending it to the intending immigrant.,20
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But what about the case of an Australian capitalist who is in London and engaging labour there? In that case the contract would have to be sent out.,20
120,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"""Unless , of course, the employer chooses to run the risk.",20
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Unde r the circumstances I have indicated, the contract would not reach the immigrant in less than four months.",21
122,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"An employer knows the terms which must be fulfilled, and he could",21
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Thes e are conditions which have to be fulfilled in no other part of the Empire. The Bill further provides that a contract must contain copies of these clauses cf the Bill ; in other words, an immigrant has to come here with a ticket-of-leave which has to be endorsed by the Minister. That is the plain English of the matter, wrap it up in whatever language we like. Again, it is provided that the Minister must-no t may-de cline to let an immigrant land unless satisfied that workers of at least equal skill and ability cannot be obtained in Australia. How is the Minister to know where workers of equal skill and ability are to be found in Australia. The Minister in this matter sets himself an impossible task. And why confine the conditions to equal skill and ability? Some of the most skilful and able workers in Australia may be utterly obnoxious to an employer. Is the Minister to be placed in a position to force an employer to engage a man who may laugh in his face, and with whom, it may be, he has had quarrels time and again.",21
124,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is rather a good argument for a man who was once a trade union official !,21
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member altogether mistakes my point. Does the honourable member for Yarra not know men who would not work for a certain employer? And does he not know employers who, apart altogether from trade union considerations, would not permit certain men to work for them?",21
126,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I must admit that I never came across such cases. Mr JOSE PH COOK-Then the honourable member must be very simple.,21
127,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Nevertheless , I have had some experience.",21
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should imagine that the honourable member for Yarra would be anxious not to make an employer and a workman come together when they mutually - repel each other.,21
129,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Hear , hear!",21
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is all my contention. I am not talking of the relations which result from victimizing men who have taken part in quarrels about wages, conditions, and so forth.",21
131,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Does the honourable member not know that 90 per cent, of the men whom employers will not employ are men who have been victimized on account of industrial troubles?",21
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I know that in New South Wales, at any rate, that sort of thing is supposed to have been stopped by legislation.",21
133,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It has not been stopped in Victoria. Mr JOSE PH COOK - We ought to bear these facts in mind when dealing with fresli legislation of this kind. A man may have ability in abundance, and yet have defects of character which would make it difficult, and, indeed, unfair, to compelan employer to engage him. Is an employer under the circumstances not to be permitted to go further afield? There is no question as to the rates of wages, and I have no quarrel with the provisions of the Bill in this connection. I do not stand here to advocate the admission under contract of men who would vitiate our social and industrial standards. I shall support the clauses relating to the wages rate as keenly as anv member of the Labour Party.",21
134,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I shall give the honourable member an opportunity on this Bill.,21
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do think, however, that it is very absurd to say that the Minister shall not permit a contract immigrant to land, until satisfied that there is no worker of equal skill and ability in Australia. The whole question is whether an employer shall be compelled to engage a man who is obnoxious and repellant to him in every way. This Bill is worse than the last in the respect that the Minister previously had an option, which is now destroyed. The hands of the Minister are tied completely, and the door is shut on the - immigrant, and may be unlocked only under certain conditions by the action of the Minister. Even if the contract be perfectly good, and the immigrant happens to land before it_ has been lodged and inI should dorsed, it becomes immediately void, the immigrant being finable in £5, and the employer in £20, while the latter has further to pay the immigrant the sum of £50.. These penalties attach even if it be subsequently proved that tihe contract is good, and it isi approved by the Minister.",21
136,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That is a special invitation to the immigrant to afterwards leave the Commonwealth.,22
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Eithe r that, or the immigrant remains here supported by the ^ 5 0 , until he can find a reasonable job. Then, so far as I can see, there is nothing to prevent a contract immigrant from subsequently entering into a similar contract immediately after the first contract may have been declared void.",22
138,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Would the honourable member like to present any obstacles to that course?,22
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Would the honourable member?,22
140,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No ; I say that an immigrant ought to be allowed to hire with an indentor, if he pleases after he arrives.",22
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is what I say. Where is the difference between hiring a man in Sydney and hiring a man in London, if the terms of the contract be the same.",22
142,Mr FISHER,Unknown,There is a great deal of difference in that the immigrant then knows the conditions which prevail here.,22
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What I say is that instead qf removing a stigma which it has been alleged inheres in our present law, we are re-enacting that law in a more objectionable form. The other day, when we were discussing the union label question, Canadian precedents were quoted over and over again. I suppose, however, that we should not like to follow the Canadian precedent in regard to immigration.",22
144,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,What is the Canadian law in regard to contract labour?,22
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Canadian law is as follows:From and after the passing of this Act it shall be unlawful for any person, company, partnership, or corporation,. iri any manner to prepay the transportation, or in any way to assist or encourage the importation or immigration of any alien or foreigner into Canada-, under contract or agreement, parole or special, express or implied, made previous to the importation or immigration of such alien or foreigner, to perform labour or service of any kind in Canada. The last section of the Canadian Act providesThis Act shall apply only to such foreign countries as have enacted and retained in force, or as enact and retain in force, laws or ordinances applying to Canada of a character similar to 'this Act. It will be seen that there is reciprocity under the Canadian law even in regard to aliens. I am not suggesting, however, that Australia should go to the same extent as Canada in this connection. We are prepared to go a long way ahead of Canada in regard to preserving our standards of living and our industrial relations. But what do we want more than provision in this Bill for certain penalties regarding certain matters. If honourable members please, let us make it penal to bring out men to break down a strike, or uncler deceptive agreements. Let us, make it penal to bring out men under a contract which in any respect fails to observe our social and industrial standards, and then let us open the door and let them come. Surely the honourable member for Hindmarsh would be able to "" p o l i c e "" these matters, as they affect his trade. Mr HUTCH ISO N - No ",22
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"He might be very well left to do so. But, instead of resorting to this cours.e, we seize upon every immigrant and put him through an examination which is more characteristic of Russia than a civilized country, and we turn him out with a passport, which he must present before he is able to secure entry to this part of the world. The system is absurd and un-British, and the sooner it can. be abolished the better. We can preserve our social standards without resorting to such an irritating practice. This Bill will stop all contract immigration, and will open the door, only in certain circumstances, at the will of the Minister. I am not prepared to leave the whole question of contract immigration to Australia to the whim or will of any Minister. Imagine leaving it to the Minister of Trade and Customs., with some of his particular labour friends at his back ! They would take care that no contract labourer came here, and with the provisions of this Bill confronting him no Minister would be unable to resist that pressure from behind.",22
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member should speak for himself. I should resis.t whatever I thought ought to be resisted.,22
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I trust that the honourable gentleman does not imagine that I am speaking in a personal or offensive sense. I hold that it ought not to be left to any Minister to openor shut the door to men coming, here under a fair and legitimate contract, but that is what will be clone by* this-Bill. Uncler the original :Act, the Minister has an option; but that .option is not to be taken from him. This' Bill will continue to shut the door in the face of a. Britisher, and that door is to be opened only by the Alinister. An innocent unoffending farm labourer may come to Australia from Great Britain, ancl after breaking up his home, after burning his boats behind him. and travelling 13,000 ..miles, he may he denied a landing, or, if he lands, ne will be liable to penalties which will . l>e ruinous to him, and subjected to conditions that will a breaker of our la.ws. full knowledge, are these men likely to come here, when they may turn towards Canada and other countries where they will be received with open arms, and no question of any kind be put to them? They will prefer the country which offers a larger liberty, which is nearer their home, where there is land for them to settle on, and where they know a hearty welcome will be given them by the Government. Our knowledge of human nature ought to teach us that instead of making our conditions more irksome, we ought to make them as little oppressive as possible, with a view to attracting people to our shores; that instead of having all these restrictive red-tape provisions, we oiv.ht to provide freedom of emtrv in the observance of an honourable contract. There should be prohibition only in the case of men who come here to take the nlace of strikers or under deceptive cr sinister agreements. That prohibition mav be secured by means of penalties, and not by this system of espionage, by following up a man's movements as though he were coming here as a. soy. This Bill will reenact the reiarn of the passnort. Afr. MCWILLIAMS - It is the old ticket of-leave again.",22
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is so. No wonder the Agents-General, say, as they in their memorandum, that these proposals sPiill grate on every British susceptibility. AVe are talking just now about an Empire Conference. The representatives Colonies are to meet in London to endeavour to bring the race c'oser together, to weld it into a united whole, to make it more powerful, and to make the component parts of the Empire more accessible and free to for each other. All this is on the lip, and yet we have this Bill . We must either move these unnecessary and irritating barspecified riers or else stand branded when presentatives attend the Colonial Conference, as unsocial units of an Empire, every other part of which is permeated with the spirit of freedom of ingress and egress, with the spirit) of freedom to work out our own social ideas in the best way known to us. We are talking about reciprocity. When we go to England, do the authorities ask us questions? When we go there, do they forbid us to land until we have been examined by the Prime Minister of Great 'Britain? Do they forbid us to enter into a contract, except it has been first submitted brand him as to the scrutiny of a Minister? With that Air. HUTCHISON - There are 12,000,000 people under the poverty line, because they have not taken these precautions.",23
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"They ask us no questions; they protect us; they facilitate our movements in every way. They go with us to every foreign country protecting us and taking care that we are subjected only to such regulations as apply to the people living there. All this the Empire does for us. In return we shut the door in her face by means of irritating enactments, which can do no good to Australia, and will not help one whit to preserve our social standards. All that we desire can be done without these irritating provisions, which must destroy our reputation abroad for sanity and moderation, and loyalty to the great Empire of which we form a part Air. HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) - I do not agree with' all the generalities in which the honourable member for Parramatta has indulged; but, at the same time, I am exceedingly sorry that the Government to whom I have agreed to give a general support should have introduced a Bill interfering with the Immigration Restriction Act. In introducing this Eill. the Prime - Alinister said that its object was to remove certain misapprehensions existing in England, and other - parts of the world, in redo gard to the contract clauses. The method by which he proposes to remove this misapprehension is that of striking out paragraph g of section 3 of the principal Act, of the which prohibits the immigration of Any persons under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth : Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister special skill required in Australia, or to persons under contract OT agreement to serve as part of the crew of a vessel engaged in the coasting retrade in Australian waters, if the rates of wages therein are not lower than the rates our reruling in the Commonwealth. I propose to show that, as the result of the passing of this Bill, the protection given under this paragraph to Australian seamen is to be abolished. The honourable member for Parramatta says that he is prepared to see that the wages of Australian workmen are not interfered with, and I take his remark to apply also to the wages of Australian seamen. At the present time, the paragraph to which I have referred has not been put into operation because of an opinion given by the Crown Law officers, and supported by the' late Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton. shall deal full y and clearly, I hope, with the circumstances relating to the introduction of that paragraph in the original Act. I find that when the measure was under consideration, the honourable member for Bland movedThat the following new sub-clause be inserted as sub-clause g:Any persons under a contract or agreement to perforin manual labour within the Commonwealth. The Government of the day was, apparently, in accord with the amendment, save that the present Prime Minister, who was Attorney-General in that Administration, suggested the addition of the following proviso: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required in the Commonwealth. That proposal also met with the approval of the House j but Sir Malcolm MCEacharn was not satisfied that the paragraph,, as it stood, would afford protection to the shipowners here, who were paying a much higher rate of wage than was received by crews on oversea vessels.",23
151,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,I think that this question is of sufficient importance to warrant the presence of a quorum. formed.),24
152,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Si r MlcEacharn therefore moved that amendment be further amended by the following proviso: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required in Australia, or to persons ""under contract to serve as part of the crew of a vessel engaged in the coasting trade in Australian waters if the rates of wages specified therein are not lower than the rates ruling in the Commonwealth. He gave certain reasons for moving this amendment. Vessels come out here at times with their crews engaged at lower rates of wages anu compete on this coast with vessels on which the rates current in Australia are paid. . . . Then, again, the clause might prevent a ship-owner bringing out his vessel under contract at rates of wages existing in England. This amendment is to provide that as soon as vessels come into the coastal trade here the crews shall be paid the rates of wages ruling on the coast. I hold that that is the law today, and in that opinion I am backed up by, at all' events, one eminent legal gentleman. Unfortunately, the Crown Law Officers contend that it is not the law, and that the section is covered by paragraph k. In I any case, I am sure the Prime Minister must admit that it was the express intention of Parliament that the crews of oversea vessels engaging in our coastal trade should be paid the rate of wages ruling in the Commonwealth. I have quoted the remarks of an Australian ship-owner, who stated distinctly that the intention was to protect Australian ship-owners and seamen engaged in our coasting trade. That being so, rhe Government failed in their duty when they did not see that the section would carry the intention of Parliament into effect. I am sorry that instead of trying to assist Australian workers to secure more work than they are able to get at the present time, the Government should, on the contrary, be prepared to leave the door open and expose them to greater competition than that with which they have had to contend in the past. The Seamen's Union of South Australia, 'after consulting legal authorities, carefully considering the matter, and studying the reports of the discussion which took place in this House, were thoroughly satisfied that it was the intention, of Parliament to protect the wages of - seamen employed on the Australian coast. Why were the words, which I have quoted, inserted in the (Quorum Bill at all, if the intention were not to protect the wages of Australian seamen? Malcolm The proposal to which I have referred would the never have been brought forward by Sir Malcolm MCEacharn unless he believed that it would be put into operation. I hope that the Government will, when this Bill goes into Committee, assist me to see that justice is clone, not to our seamen only, but to our ship-owners. I am not asking very much, nor am I asking that we should go nearly so far as American legislation goes. Honourable members must be aware that under American legislation, not a single passenger, ancl not a pound of cargo, can be carried from one port to another of the 3 United States by oversea vessels. We have never proposed in this House that our legislation should go so far. say that if oversea vessels, on which, in some instances, the wages paad are only half those ruling in the Commonwealth, come here, and engage in our coasting trade, it is only fair to Australian seamen ancl ship-owners that they should be afforded the measure of protection for which we ask. I am astonished that the Prime Minister has not looked further into the matter. The secretary of the South Australian Seamen's Union, Senator Guthrie, had many communications with the Government of the day with regard to the matter. At page 969 of the Parliamentary Papers for 1903, it will De found that the honourable senator wrote the following letter to Sir Edmund Barton:With reference to our recent interviews on the above subject, and Mr Atlee Hunt's letter of the 20th ult., wherein he states that you haa""gtven further thought to the question, and was still of opinion that paragraph k excludes the crews from the operations of the Act, I have also drawn the attention of the Customs authorities here to the matter prior to them granting a clearance to tllte Heathdene from this por.t. You will remember that that ship was one of the vessels complained of. Having loaded a cargo of coals at Newcastle, New South Wales, a part of which was discharged at Melbourne and the remainder at Port Adelaide-clearl y "" a vessel engaged in the coasting"" trade in Australian 'waters,"" articles of agreement were drawn up and signed in England, and the rates of wages specified therein were about half those ruling in the Commonwealth-n o action was taken by the authorities, and a clearance was granted. So I am compelled to again approach you, for under section 14 it appears that if there is a contravention of the Act, only an officer of Customs or the police are empowered to take the legal proceedings necessary for the enforcement of the Act. I am still of opinion that the provisions of the Act have been, and are being, contravened, and with every respect I confidently submit that crews engaged to serve in vessels such as the Heathdene, coming from ports beyond the Commonwealth, and trading in Australian waters, are not excluded from the operations of the Immigration Restriction Act igoi by paragraph k of section 3 for the following reasons :Paragraphs g and k are intended to be quite distinct in application. The former includes the cases in question as "" prohibited immigrants."" The only to the master and crew "" landing"" during the stay of the vessel in any port of the Commonwealth. Paragraph k does not exempt or even limit the effect of paragraph g with regard to the cases in question,, for the landing can only attach to a class not coming within the interpretation of vessels engaged in the coasting trade. In addition to this ""the stay-in any port"" would certainly not refer to vessels so engaged. This is paragraph k of the section referred toBut we do The master and crew of any other vessel landing during the stay of the vessel in any port of the Commonwealth; provided that the master shall, upon being so required by any officer, and before being permitted to clear out from or leave the port, muster the crew in the presence of an officer; and if it is found that any person who, according to the vessel's articles, was one of the crew when she arrived at the port, and who would in the opinion of the officer be a prohibited immigrant, but for the exceptions contained in this paragraph, is not present, then such person shall not be accepted by this paragraph, and until the contrary is proved shall be deemed to be a prohibited immigrant, and to have entered the Commonwealth contrary to this Act. It should not require much legal knowledge to show that the natural interpretation of that paragraph is that we were generous enough to say that the captain and crew of a vessel should be permitted to land in Australia, even though they were not paying the rates of wages ruling in the Commonwealth. But the interpretation given by the Crown Law officers is that the paragraph means that the captain and crew of an oversea vessel can engage in the coasting trade of the Commonwealth without paying the rates of wages ruling in the Commonwealth. Senator Guthrie, in his letter to Sir Edmund and the Barton, further said: The debate on the Act in the House of Representatives [vide speeches of the Honourable Alfred Deakin, Sir Malcolm MCEacharn, and P. MCMahon Glynn) shows it was never intended that k should govern g in excluding crews such as above mentioned. If the contrary were the case, vessels coming from foreign parts (say China or Japan) carrying crews under agreement to serve at any wage, however low, wotid be at liberty to engage in the Australian coastal trade, excepting the proviso in paragraph k. This proviso itself is corroborative proof of my contention, the words "" clear out from or leave the p o r t"" being descriptive of a clearing or leaving for a port outside the Commonwealth, and not applying or intended to apply to a clearing or leaving for another Commonwealth port. I might say that the decision given by the Crown Law officers is stated in a clearly letter to Senator MCGregor, written at the direction of the Prime Minister, by Mr. latter refers Atlee Hunt, in which he saysI am directed by the Prime Minister to inform you that, in pursuance of a promise made to the deputation introduced by you on the 4th February, at which reference was made to such cases as that described in regard to the ship A. J. Tiockin, the matter was submitted to the Attorney-General, whose opinion is that so long as the crew of an oversea vessel engaged in the coasting trade remain members of the crew of that ship, and are only ashore during its stay in !i port of the Commonwealth, they are cepted, by paragraph k of section 3 of Immigration Restriction Act, and that while exception exists they cannot be regarded as hibited immigrants under paragraph g of same section. I now ask the Prime Minister to say whethere ther he thinks that that paragraph was serted in the Immigration Restriction Act for no purpose whatever? Mr DEAKIN. --It was only inserted, Sir Malcolm MCEacharn explained, to meet the case of new vessels built in England, and which it was necessary to bring out Australia with crews to engage in the Austo tralian trade.",24
153,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"How , then, does the honourable and learned gentleman exwhich plain Sir Malcolm MCEacharn's statement that vessels come out here at times with their crews engaged at lower rates, of ancl compete on this coast with vessels which the rates current in Australia are paid, and that gentleman's further ment that his amendment was intended to provide that as soon as vessels came into the coastal trade here, the crews should paid the rates of wages ruling on the coast ?",26
154,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am aware that Sir Malof colm MCEacharn had other objects in view, but the only object which the House sidered, so far as I know, is the one I have it. mentioned. ' Mr HUTCHISON - That is to my mind a most remarkable statement, because I can find nothing throughout the discussion on the subject which would lead any one believe that the intention was as. the Minister has stated it. "" Mr DEAKIN - There was very little cussion. The clause was passed on understanding.",26
155,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Because no disfairly paid. cussion was necessary. °,26
156,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I ask the honourable ber to consider the time which has been taken up since in considering that question by the Navigation Commission ancl elsemeasure where.,26
157,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I was going to say that the intention of Parliament'was so viously to do justice to Australian shipworkers owners and seamen, that I could not how it could require much discussion, and I certainly cannot understand how it thatcould be met with opposition. could understand how the could possibly be governed by paragraph A, which merely provides that the exmaster and crew of a vessel may land at a the port, if they desire to do so. It perthat pro- mits them merely to land, and they must the then go back to their ship. They are not allowed to land to engage in work, and, if is a prohibited immigrant amongst in the crew, the paragraph provides that the crew must be mustered, and, if the master leaves a single prohibited immigrant behind as when he clears out from the port, he is liable to a penalty under the Act. That should be perfectly clear to any one who to reads paragraph k of section 3.. I propose ask this House to say whether it is fair that Australian ship-owners should be obliged to pay double the rate of wages is paid by oversea ship-owners-as it is shown in the correspondence to which I have referred that in some instances they wages, have been-and whether we should give on them no protection whatever.",26
158,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is what the Navistategation Commission are considering.,26
159,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"We have here an opportunity to go ahead of the Navigation be Commission. I propose to give the House an opportunity to do what is fair in the matter, and if , when we receive the report the Navigation Commission, it is found to be in opposition to our views, we shall conhave a further opportunity to discuss I know that at the time the seamen were very anxious to get this measure of protection. We have heard the leader of the Opposition say that he has no desire to see unfair competition imposed to upon the workers of Australia. The right Prime honourable gentleman was not speaking of seamen at the time, but if he is willing to dissee one section of Australian workmen that fairly paid, we may assume that he is equally willing to see every section of them. I propose in Committee to move the insertion of a clause in this Bill memwhich will have that effect. I think it would have been far better if the Government hacl devoted their attention ro some which would have led to an increase of employment in the Commonwealth rather than to a measure which will inobcrease the competition which. Australian have tb meet at the present time. see We have been told that the workers are safeguarded under clause 5, which provides I never The Minister shall approve the terms of the section contract only(1) when a copy is filed with him, and, if he so requires, is verified by oath; and (2) if in his opinion-- (a) the contract is not made in contemplation of or with a view of an industrial dispute. I should like very much to know how the Minister is to know when labour is introduced under contract that it is being brought here in connection with an industrial dispute.",26
160,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,He should be an omniscient Minister.,27
161,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"That is an omniswoman's cience which I should not approve of. think Ministers are now given too much power to deal with matters which should be expressly provided for by Act of liament. Either we are in favour of tract labour, or we are not. If we are in favour of it we should say so disthink, tinctly in the Bill ; if we are not, ancl I certainly am not, we should make that equally clear in the Bill and the matter should not'be left to the discretion of Minister. It is impossible that we should know whether contract labour is being respectable brought fo Australia in connection with an industrial dispute. Are the Government so innocent as to believe that an employer will wait until a dispute occurs before introduces labour under contract, postralia, sibly, in order to reduce wages? Nothing could be more simple than for an employer to say to the Minister, I am employing fifty men, and I require a dozen more. cannot find them in the Commonwealth, and I desire to bring tbem outand pay them the same wages as my positors men are getting at the present time. they He will make the term as short as he can, and directly the time of high pressure is over, will dismiss all that he can clo without in that statement. out. Unfortunately, there is no trade Australia today in which there is not plus labour. Occasionally, for a week two. there may be full work in some ticular trade, but, as a rule, there is a number of unemployed in every branch of industry throughout the Commonwealth. These men, when dispensed with, will therefore be thrown into competition with the labourers who have such a hard struggle at present. I understand that the Biil to provide that men shall not under contracts stipulating for the pavment of wages at less than the average rate paid to labourers. But what is a labourer's wage?

Are we going to bring people from the old world at the affecting miserable rate of wages paid here?",27
162,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honourable member's arguments would apply to all immigration, so that the Prime Minister must be wrong in favouring immigration.",27
163,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I will show that it is not wrong to favour the immigration of certain persons. At the present time. I am trying to prove that the Bill does not contain adequate safeguards. What is a wages ? I cannot find that there I is any fixed rate. We know that in Adelaide women are making trousers for 6cl. a pair, and, no doubt, their employersParwould be only too glad to import women confrom the east end of London to do the work for 5c!. a pair. No doubt some people when they go into large tailoring establishments, ancl pay high prices for their clothes, that those employed in the making of their garments are well p a i d ; the but I know, because some of my relatives are in the trade, that some of the most tailors are getting their clothing made up in factories, paying only a few pence for the making of vests, and very little for the making qf coats and trousers. he That is done, not only in South Ausbut throughout the other States. It is impossible for the Government to say what are the ruling rates of wages in the Commonwealth. Why should we permit I immigrants to be introduced here under contract at all? I know, with regard to my own trade, that any number of comand printers would come here if received the assurance that they could get work at the ruling rates of wages; and the various trade secretaries will bear me I should be prein pared to take the verbal assurance of some suremployers, but I would require a written or assurance from others, because there are parboth good and bad. But it is absurd to large say that labour will not come here except under contract. Where there is work, there will always be applicants for it.",27
164,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I have received letters from men in South Africa, stating' their is readiness to come here if there is work be imported available for them.",27
165,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No doubt. The union secretaries in Adelaide are continually receiving inquiries from the old country as to the chances of men getting work if they will come out here. The Prime Minister told us that very little desire has been shown to take advantage of the contract labour provisions of the present Act. If that is so, why not prevent the introduction of men under contract? It is only employers who wish to gain an advantage by importing men under contract, who would be affected by the operation of the law, since the importation of skilled labour is provided for. But when honourable members visited North Queensland, they were told everywhere, "" If you send away the Kanaka, we shall want contract labour.""",27
166,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Is not that a proper place labour. for such a demand to come from ?,28
167,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No , because there is plenty of labour available in the Commonwealth. Some time ago, as the honourable-member'for Moreton will bear me out, the Chillagoe Mining Company advertised for hands, and thousands of men more than there was work for flocked to the mine.",28
168,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,The company was able to get labour at its own price.,28
169,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Yes, and paid 6s. a day for work which is harder and more disagreeable than the work required from labourers in the cane-fields, which - in comparison, I should think ' would be healthy work. In a circular issued by the Cairns district cane-farmers, handed to us at Cairns, a demand was made for an amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act. in order that reliable labourers might be imported under contract for tropical agricultural work from Great Britain and the Continent of Europe. Then the canegrowers of Ayr told us thatThe simple fact of the matter is that the tion of labour should cease to be regarded from a political stand-point, and be dealt with from an economic one. In any case, as the difficulty 0/ obtaining suitable labour has been brought about by the hasty legislation of the Federal Parliament, it behoves them to find the proper remedy, and in this connection we desire to impress upon you the absolute need for the amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act so as to permit of reliable farm labour being introduced, under agreement, from Great Britain and the Continent of Europe. Such a course might materially aid in bringing into practical shape the ideal of a White Australia, and we therefore strongly urge the necessity of such an amendment of the Act wpon you. I think the Prime Minister will see that he was entirely wrong in believing that, in the future, there will be no influx of contract labour. In spite of the assurance which will be given, it will be the simplest thing in the world for the cane-farmers to go to the Minister and say, "" We cannot get reliable labour.""",28
170,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Why should they not?,28
171,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"They should not be allowed to go to the Minister if it can be proved that there is reliable labour available. Have I not just given the honourable gentleman proof that, in the case of the Chillagoe Company, there was plenty of reliable labour available?",28
172,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On the contrary, I am hearing from the planters that they do want",28
173,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"That is exactly my point-that, , no matter what proof one may submit to the Minister, he will say, "" That is not good enough. Let the employers get in contract labour."" I have shown unmistakably that when the Chillagoe Company advertised for men to work at 6s. a day, under much harder conditions than exist in the cane-fields, thousands of men offered their services. The canegrowers can get in Australia today as much reliable labour as they may require. The two extracts I have quoted might be multiplied, but I am aware that honourable members have been supplied with quite a 1 number of pamphlets on this subject. Undoubtedly,, the contract provisions of the Act have been evaded. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie can tell the Prime Minister of one danger which will occur under his proposal to allow contract labour to enter the Commonwealth. At the present time Italian miners are being brought in, and if such evidence as I have produced in regard to amplelabour being available for the Queensland ques- cr.ne-growers will not be accepted by the Prime Minister, it will be an easy matter for the mine-owners in Western Australia to convince him that it is necessary - for them to have Italian labour to work their mines. They are already importing Italian labour. I believe that it is being done under contract, but it is difficult to prove that. When this B i ll becomes law, there will be a great many more evasions than there are at the present time.",28
174,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Why ?,28
175,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The employers will be able to bring in labour under contract. At the present time, there is always the fear that the existence of a contract may be discovered, but in the future the employers will entertain no such fear, and, consequently, there will be more likelihood of the law being evaded.  reason for evading the law then than there is now""?",28
176,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No . All laws are evaded, and if we open the door to allow any form of contract labour to enter, of course, the law will be evaded ten times more than it is.",29
177,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Suppos e that we were to strike out of paragraph b the words, "" there is difficulty,"" and insert the words "" it is impossible for an employer to obtain certain labour in the Commonwealth.""",29
178,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"That provision is contained in the Immigration Restriction Act, and, therefore, no alteration of paratime of strikegraph b is required. If no artisan possessand ing special skill can be found in the Comground monwealth, he can be imported at the precan sent time.",29
179,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,The Government of Western Australia imported twelve boilermakers from England without even advertising their requirements in the newspapers of the Eastern States.,29
180,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Exactly . What will be clone under this Bill when we find the Government of Western Australia importing twelve boilermakers under the present Act? I recollect that incident very well. It elicited expressions of dissatisfaction, not from the society interested, but from all societies in Australia, because they realized what it meant. It meant that twelve men,, who were not required in Australia on account of special skill, were imported to compete with others in the trade. I have pointed out that, although the American law is far more stringent than our law, there has been no outcry against its provisions. Let me indicate what has been done in that country in spite of its stringent law. The Age, of the 8th November, contained the following paragraph :The ""stinking fish"" party in Australian politics, who are always girding at Commonwealth immigration restriction legislation, be interested in a Reuter's telegram from New York, received in London on 27th September last. The telegram states that the Federal Prosecutor announces that "" eleven, managers of tile manufacturing and contracting firms in New York have been charged with conspiring to violate the Contract Labour Law, which prohibits the importation of foreign labour under contract. The indictment states that a year ago the Employers' Association, of which the accused are membersNot only do they. individually violate the law, but they conspire to do soimported fifty English tile masons and instructed them to make a false declaration to the immigration authorities. What do honourable members think of an association instructing men to make a false declaration ?A fortnight later the danger of a strike was averted Apparently the employers were providing for the occurrence of a strike. In such a case here we might not be able to prove to the Minister that men were being imported for the purpose of taking work at a ithe Englishmen were discharged on the that they were not familiar with Ameritools and methods. Most of them returne'd to England in cattle ships, and had to unZlergo a variety of hardships. Four of the men gave information to the Department of Commerce and Labour. Mr Arthur T. Mart, one of the accused, is charged with going to England as an agent of the Association, and of advertising in the newspapers in that country and in Germany, offering tile masons $5 (£1) per working day of eight hours."" My experience in Australia has been that while we have some splendid employers, we have many who are just as unscrupulous as employers in America. These employers will not hesitate to do what has been done in that country, if the opportunity be given to them. If that is done under the stringent law of America, what is likely to be done here under a less stringent law ? The "" stinking fish "" party will not, I think, be p'.acated by the proposal of the Prime Minister. In his speech the honourable member for Parramatta referred to Mr T. C. Coghlan. The Prime Minister has said that the object of this Bill is to remove a misapprehension in connection with' the contract provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. But if Mr Coghlan is to be credited, there is very little likelihood of this, or of any other measure achieving that object. He saysI t is not given to any country to be entirely will happy. There are drawbacks to every clime, and objections may be taken to some special customs in every land. But if one were to rely on what appears about Australia in the English public prints, one would be forced fd conclude that its condition was in the last degree desperate. Hardly anything in the shape of news appearing in the public press is such that a friend of Australia cares to read. The country is undoubtedly in very bad ;odor here.. Homilies are preached from press and pulpit to the end that Australia should mend its ways, and recently a new form of injurious comment has apvouring to placate people of that kind. peared in the shape of letters to the daily press, advising investors to get rid of Australian before the inevitable day of repudiation come. It is very certain that amongst the interesting events that"" happen in Australia, don is informed by cable concerning those only that are least creditable to the country, and great part of the time of the official representagration tives of Australia in London is frittered in replies to gross misrepresentations. titude of many Australians who have settlerT'in this country is also strongly antagonistic to land that has given them position and affluence, and many Englishmen with whom I have versed, who hold strongly antagonistic wards Australia, confessed that they had acquired them in the clubs and lea-ding hotels of Melbourne, Sydney, and other State capitals. evil done by this indiscriminate dispraise of Australia by Australians and by the public press of this country is incalculable. In the face of ihis, what is the use bringing in a Bill, which is a mere presaid tence, to placate those who are v i l if y i ng matters. the Commonwealth. I am sure that the because Prime Minister will sav that it is not purpose of the Bill-althoug h I think it will go further than he expects-to insaysflict injury upon the workers. I am sure that it will not satisfy these who are condemning our present legislation. will not be content until the Labour Party objection. is kicked out of the Parliaments of Australia, and the government of both tha Commonwealth and the States is handed argument over to a syndicate of boodlers. No matany ter what the Prime Minister may do, he special exceptions. will be more grossly misrepresented than ever. The press will say that the Government and the Labour Party have made a America, series of blunders in the past, that they are admitting it in connection with one Act, that although they have been equallv wroivin everything else they have done, they not acknowledge it in regard to other matw ters. I wish to read an extract from letter written by the London rorres pon dent cheap alien labour. of the Adelaide Advertiser. He saysI f I had the time, and it were worth the trouble, I could select from speeches of a single month's session of the seven Australian Parliaments, and from the leading columns of newspapers published in the six Australian capitals, enough material to frame an indictment (and to prove it, too), against Australian commercial, political, and domestic morality; against its financial credit, its business stability, and against its whole reputation as a desirable home for white men and women. Of course it would be a false indictment, yet every clause in it could be sustained by evidence drawn from the sources I have mentioned. That is, drawn from the speeches of honourable members sitting in the Parliaments of Australia today. What is the use of endeaD»5] I stocks would placate some of them with a pistol, should if I had an opportunity. The Prime Minmany ister would have done well, before introLonducing the Bill , to give some attention to a an excellent article dealing with the ImmiRestriction Act which appeared in away the Age of 2nd October. I do not agree The atwith many things that the Age says, esthe pecially when it is dealing with industrial matters, but I must give it credit when it condeserves it. I think that it has taken a views tonational view of this great question.  The the Age has deserved credit?",29
181,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I should not like to say that. There is more to be said against the Age-and every other daily of paper in the Commonwealth-tha n is to be for it when it is dealing with industrial I do not blame the newspapers, they have to please their customers, the who are the big advertisers, and not the that workers who pay their pennies. The Age It is in itself amost useful, well-conceived and salutary piece of legislation. As it stands They in the statute-book it is quite free from all honest We venture to say that by no species of honest can that clause be ma-de to appear in sense objectionable. It is a prohibition of centract labour, making distinct provision for No one hears of any objection to such a law in nor would we hear of any in Australia were it not for the restless agitation of certain Conservative associations which desire to flood and the labour market here in any emergency. will Such people would flood the labour market it h coloured aliens in the same way that a they bring into our midst goods made by The article proceedsA l l the fierce denunciations of it that we hear proceed from the Conservative advocates of "" freedom of contract,"" who claim the right to employ whom they please, where they please, and on what terms they please. It follows, therefore, that this section of'the Immigration Restriction Act is one against which they are in perpetual war. And to serve their ends they are willing to misrepresent it in the most atrocious manner. And yet the tools of these men in Parliamentthe Reids, Joseph Cooks, Bruce Smiths, and Wilkses-ca n by two simple facts be proved to be absolutely hypocritical in their condemnation of the law. First, those men helped to pass the section in Parliament. Secondly, the Reid Government was in power for ten months, and never made one move towards revising it. These two circumstances are conclusive as to the hollowness of their present outcry against the law. I am entirely in accord with that. honourable member for Parramatta referred to a letter sent to the old country by one of the secretaries of the labour unions, that it was of no use for immigrants to come here expecting to find work and comfortable conditions. Unfortunately, that statement is too true. I challenge any honourable member to mention a single trade in Australia in which there is not a surplus of artisans awaiting employment. Every san who comes here, if he does not get work in his own trade, must become a competitor with those unfortunates who are obliged to content themselves with a wage of 4s. or 5s. per day.",30
182,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is, or without contract, he becomes a competitor.",31
183,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Exactly ; but if labour is admitted here under contract, the trouble is likely to be accentuated. Honourable members, who desire to see our country progress, should first direct their energies to securing more comfortable conditions for our people. If we want our population to increase, we must give the working classes sufficient to keep their families. [ have been much pained, when I have looked round among my acquaintances, and have seen the struggle that some fathers and mothers have had to keep their families. Until we have made those who are already here a little more comfortable than they are, we need not contemplate the encouragement of immigration. I see no justification for the introduction of this Bill, except that it will afford the Prime Minister an opportunity of showing whether he really desires to place Australian seamen upon precisely the same footing in regard tc outside competition as we intend to put all the other workmen of this Continent.",31
184,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown," I take it that this Bil l is intended to overcome the objections which have been urged against the principal Act, so far as they relate to the introduction of British immigrants under contract to employers in Australia. it seems to me, after having carefully perused the measure, that if that be its object, its provisions fail most lamentably to give effect to that design. In passing, I should like to point out what a powerful indictment of the labour legislation of the past fourteen years is the admission of the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the labour conditions in Australia are so bad today that there is not a trade in which! The there are not thousands more artisans than can find employment.",31
185,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The reason for that is that there are so many like the honourable member in the States Parliaments.,31
186,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"No ; the reason is that there are too few. I say that the existing conditions are a striking commentary on the futility of the kind of legislation which the Labour Party have arti- devoted so much time to enacting. Clause 4 of the Bill,"" in its present form, would practically give the Minister power to determine whether anybody at all should be permitted to enter Australia under contract. It would confer upon a Minister with who was strongly in sympathy with labour extremists, or who was amenable to pressure by fhat party, the power of preventing any person from landing in the Commonwealth under contract. That, I contend, would be a most dangerous power to place in the hands of any Minister, inasmuch as it would enable him to absolutely override the intentions of the Act itself. We all know that Ministers are subject to the weaknesses of ordinarv mortals, and in our legislation, we should recognise that fact.",31
187,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,That is a chronic trouble with the honourable member.,31
188,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I have always objected to leaving to the discretion of Ministers matters which ought to be specifically provided for by .statute.,31
189,Mr AVEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member voted in favour of extending their powers last night.,31
190,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I did not. I said that Ministers should accept responsibility for the administration of our Acts, but that we should take care so to frame our statutes that they did nob vest Ministers wilth undue discretion. The position last night was entirely different from that which confronts us now.",31
191,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The cases are upon allfours. But Mr JOHNSON - There is no analogy whatever between them. Clause 5 provides that the 'Minister shall approve of the terms of the contract only under certain conditions which are specified. I object to that provision, because it leaves everything to the discretion of the Minister, and practically there is no mandate to the Act governing the Minister's powers. It makes the Minister a judge of conditions which no Minister could possibly have the requisite knowledge to form an opinion and absolutely compels him to approve contracts under conditions which he fulfil . For instance, it statesThe Minister shall approve the terms contract only1. When a copy is filed with him, 2. If in his opinionHow is the Minister to arrive at any finite opinion upon a subject of that The honourable member for Hindmarsh was upon very sound ground when he pointed out the difficulties which would confront him in that connection. It is quite possible that a contract may be made "" in, plation of, or with a fecting an industrial dispute "" long before such a dispute is actually in existence. Employers themselves might have in mind the promotion of an industrial dispute means of a lock-out, and take advantage this measure to provide for contract labour ljefore a dispute actually eventuated. such circumstances, the Minister's opinion , could not. be relied on, and he certainly would have no option but to endorse contract if . in his opinion, no industrial pute was in contemplation. According sub-paragraph a, of clause 5, the Minister must approve of the terms of the contract if there is any difficulty on the part ployer in obtaining, within the Commonrequired wealth, a worker of at least equal skill , ability, and the remuneration and other terms and conditions are as, advantageous to the contract immigrant as those current for workers of the same class where the contract is to be performed. How is the Minister to ascertain with any degree of correctness that there is difficulty in obtaining workers of eqiial skill and ability? So far as I can s.ee, the Minister would to take the employers' word for the fact.",31
192,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Shoul d we not have representations from both sides?,32
193,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Possibl y so, but how tract is the Minister to arrive at a decision ? he to call a conference of employers employees, and, after the question has been in (4)thebefore thrashed out in his presence, deal with the evidence in a judicial capacity? Such procedure would, it appears to me, involve both employers and employees in much trouble ancl expense, besides causing great delav and taking away the Minister from '[ 5]- 3 2J on, his other duties. I cannot conceive of such of a course being resorted to for the purpose cannot of arriving at a decision on this point. A person who desired to engage contract of the labour might make certain representations based on self interest; indeed, an employer and, if he might honestly make representations which so requires, is verified by oath; and would have the effect of entirely misleading the Minister. It must be remembered (a) the contract is not made in that this Bill applies not to any one parcontemplation of, or with a view of alfecting an industrial ticular district, but to the whole of the dispute. Commonwealth. An employer, before he decan conscientiously make application to the kind? Minister, must ransack the Commonwealth in order to ascertain whether a worker of the necessary skill and ability can be found, and a similar duty would appear to be imposed upon the Minister. It is obvious that the contemsuggestion of the honourable member for view of afBoothby that both sides should lay their case before the Minister is impracticable, and, in any case, would not furnish the information requisite to enable the Minister by to form an opinion. The only other means of that I can see would be the establishment of a Commonwealth bureau of labour statisUnder tics and information, which would be at the service of the Minister. Such an organization would., however, entail a great deal of the expense, and it is extremely doubtful whedisther, after all, it would supply adequate to information. Although a bureau of the kind might be worked with some degree of success, still, it might be found of emthat workers of a certain kind were at Cairns in Queensland, and and that a.t Fremantle or Kalgoorlie in Western Australia there were men who possessed the necessary skill and ability. These men would have to be conveyed from Fremantle or Kalgoorlie to Cairns; and that appears to me a most ridiculous state of affairs. Under the Bill the Minister, if workers of equal skill and ability can be have found in any part of Australia, must give preference to those workers. Sub-clause 3 of clause 5 provides that the Minister shall approve of the terms of the contract onlyI f , where the approval is sought after the conis made, the contract contains a copy of this Has, and the immediately preceding section and is and expressed to be made subject thereto: and the contract immigrant has landed Commonwealth. a A contract might be entered into under perfectly bond fide circumstances, and the Minister, before the immigrant had landed, might discover, or form the opinion, that there was some one in another part of the Commonwealth capable of filling the position. In such case, an absolute injustice , would be done to both the employer and tha immigrant, who had in good faith entered into the contract. I sincerely hope that these clauses will be materially amended with a view to avoid the possibility of the injustice I have indicated. Clause 6 provides that If , before the Minister approves the terms of the contract the contract immigrant lands ip AustraliaaThe contract is absolutely void. My objection is that .a man might come here under a perfectly bond fide contract, complying with all conditions as to the standard of living and rates of wages prevailing in Australia, and yet, if the Minister had failed to approve of the contract before he landed, he would be subjected to a penalty not exceeding employer would be liable to a penalty of £20. There are great difficulties in the wav of an immigrant ascertaining before he sails for Australia' whether or not the Minister has approved of the contract to which he is a party. Certain circumstances might prevent formal approval being given to the contract, and the immigrant might arrive here in the full belief that he was complying with all the provisions of the law. But, in the event of his landing before the Minister had approved of the terms of the contract, he would be liable to a fine of £ 5 , and the employer, in addition to the penalties I have named, would be required to pay to the contract immigrantSuch specified sum of money (not exceeding ,£50) as the Minister thinks sufficient, either maintain the contract immigrant until he can reasonably expected to find suitable employment, or at the option of the contract immigrant, to enable him to return to the country whence came. The clause also provides that The sum when specified in writing by the is due. Minister shall oa recoverable By the contract migrant or b*y-the Minister tor him. As these clauses are unnecessarily and may lead to great injustice, I trust that they will be materially revised in mittee. It is quite legitimate to provide male section. against wilful evasions of the law, penalties of this kind should not be procertain vided to meet cases where there intent to evade it. The non-approval of the terms of the contract might be due to an oversight, or, perhaps, to neglect, on the part of the Minister himself, and I therefore hold that there should be some Mr Johnson. against the abuse of these provisions. Clause 8 provides thatThe two last preceding sections do not apply to an immigrant under a contract or agreement to serve as part of the crew of a vessel engaged in the coasting trade in Australian waters, if the rates of wages specified therein are not lower than the rates ruling-in the Commonwealth. Here we have an exception in favour of a certain class of workers, the object of which I do not clearly understand.",32
194,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The honourable member is aware that it is in the existing Act?,33
195,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Quite so; but that does not afford any clue to the reason for making such a provision. We are proposing to legislate to shut out contract immigrants ostensibly in the interests of the workers of Australia, and yet, in this clause, we have an exception made in favour of a certain class of whilst the workers, who, if these provisions are to be applied',, should be just as amenable to the contract section as are others. I cannot understand why an exception should be made in the case of maritime workers. They will come just as keenly into competition with those seamen engaged in our coastal trade, as will contract immigrants with workers employed on the wharfs, or in any other occupation. There may be some good reason for this exemption, but I have not been able to discover it. In clause 11 it is provided thatThis Act shall not be construed to apply to domestic servants or personal attendants accompanying their employer to Australia. I have heard honourable members opposite, and particularly the honourable member for to Darling, express in this House the utmost be solicitude for the well-being of the servant girls of the Commonwealth, and yet he domestics are not to be accorded the protection which manual labourers, other than sailors, are to receive. Some explanation It surely cannot be said that we imhave not in Australia a sufficient number of women desirous of obtaining employharsh, ment. The lack of employment is just as noticeable in the case of the female portion Comof the community as it is in regard to the There seems to be an atbut tempt to unfairly discriminate between classes of workers. I find that' the has been no last clause provides thatThe Governor General may make regulations not inconsistent with this Act prescribing aM matters and things which by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribe'd for safeguard giving effect to this Act. I suppose that it is necessary that power should be given to make regulations for the effective administration of any measure of this description, but I find nothing here that will safeguard the provisions of the Bill from being overridden by regulations madeunder it. Sections similar to this clause appear in other Acts, the administration of which is open to severe criticism chiefly on the ground that regulations made under those Acts have had the effect of overriding the intention which Parliament had in passing them. I have in mind particularly the regulations made under the Customs Act, and the abuses of administration which have arisen under them. We should guard against regulations being, so framed as to contravene the intention of Parliament in passing the Bill. It has struck me as peculiar, in considering legislation of this character, that we have the Prime Minister, and presumably the members of his Government, on the one hand emphasizing the need which the Commonwealth has for immigration, while on the other we find them bringing forward measures which have for their object the restriction of immigration, and the interposing of obstacles to the admission of British settlers, which must give rise to a great deal of irritation, misunderstanding, and dissatisfaction amongst our kith and kin in other portions of the Empire. The Bill before us is unfortunately only another attempt at legislation of a character which has already had most pernicious effects upon the welfare of the Commonwealth in the financial, commercial, and industrial circles, of the Empire. We have only to refer to the report of the Agents-General for proof of what I say. A copy of the report was laid on the table by the Prime Minister the other day, but so far, I believe, it has not been printed and circulated. A precis of the report has, however, appeared in the press, and I propose to refer to a few paragraphs in it which strike me as being very pertinent to the subject in hand. Agents-General emphasize the necessity for advertising Australia, and in one of the paragraphs of the precis of the report it is stated thatThe States should not advertise separately. They say Australia as a whole should be placed before the British people, who ^147,000,000 privately in the Commonwealth, and ^197,000,000 in State and municipal bonds. They suggest that an expenditure of annum should be authorized-to be spent through a press agency for preference-to advertise the resources of the Federation, ""leaving a systematic course of lectures, exhibits, and travelling exhibits until the initial work is in going order, and extensions prove to be desirable."" May I inquire of what use will it be to spend money in advertising the resources of Australia presumably with the intention of attracting population, and of diverting to Australia the stream of emigration now flowing to other countries, notably to Canada, when we are actually engaged in passing legislation whi;h, at the caprice of a"" Minister, may have the effect of preventing the landing of a single person coming to Australia under contract, though such persons coming here to take up work must add not only to their own wealth, but to the wealth of the whole community ? We have reports from the Agents-General emphasizing the need of advertising the resources of Australia with a view specifically to showing the people of Great Britain what a splendid country Australia is by comparison with other countries to which streams of emigration are r.ow flowing from Great Britain, and at the same time we are here engaged in putting up barriers in every port of Australia to prevent the most desirable persons who could come here from landing on our shores.",33
196,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Most desirable, because under contract?",34
197,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I say that they are, if coming here under contract to perform work under conditions complying with our standard of living and rates of wages. Men coming here under such conditions are more desirable immigrants than are the people who find their way to this country without means, without any objective, and who almost immediately become a charge"" upon our charitable institutions.",34
198,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Prime Minister's innocence was only assumed.,34
199,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I believe it was, because the honourable and learned gentleman must see that a very wide distinction can be The drawn between the two classes of immigrants, and that the immigrant who, when he arrives here, has work to go to under our accepted conditions, is a fa r more desirable addition to our population than is the man who comes heie in circumstances which may lead him only too soon to swell the ranks of have invested the unemployed.  ^500 per most people come to Australia?",34
200,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am speaking now of accepted - conditions provided in the Bill before us. I shall refer presently to those immigrants who preceded us to Australia.

But we must be careful not to keep out desirable immigrants. Where woura those who desire to keep out all labour arriving here under contract be if legislation such as they would like to see passed had had effect during the last few decades ? Would it not have excluded their grandfathers and fathers, and greatly reduced our population ? Of course, we cannot expect much from immigration until our land laws have been so liberalized that the country districts can absorb the large surplus population of the cities.",35
202,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Would not a good land tax help to bring that about?,36
203,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Yes , under certain, conditions. Would the honourable member support such a tax?",36
204,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,A Federal land tax? Undoubtedly. Would not the honourable member support it?,36
205,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Unde r certain conditions ; but I am not at liberty to discuss the matter now. I may, however, be permitted to point out that a just settlement of the land question wiU do far more to secure the best possible conditions for the wage earners, and the people generally of this great Continent, than all the so-called labour measures over which we are wasting so much time. The honourable member for Hindmarsh asserted that it will be possible to replace the' Kanakas in the sugar industry of Queensland Avithout importing labour uncler contract. I hope that he is right, but, if the facts are as he has' stated them, I am surprised that a large number of the unemployed of our cities have not already been absorbed by the sugar industry, seeing what a large amount the Commonwealth has paid in bounties to the sugar-growers to encourage the employment of white labour on their plantations. I have admitted that the condition of our land laws is a stumbling block to the encouragement of immigration. We can never hope to progress as a nation until we have made some radical changes in our conditions of land tenure.",36
206,Mr MAHON,Unknown,B y means of a good land tax.,36
207,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I care not how it is done, but it is urgently necessary to open up the lands of Australia to settlement. The existing land laws have prevented settlement, and have hindered production, with the result that huge armies of unemployed, which should find work in the country, are congregated in the cities of the Commonwealth. Let us look at the populations of some' of - the countries adjacent to us. At present we have a population of barely 4,000,000, and yet India and China,""which, combined, have an area only about equal to that of Australia, support a population of 700,000,000. India has 300,000,000 and China 400,000,000 inhabitants, yet each of these countries is but half the size of Australia. Japan, which has an area equal to only about one-eighteenth of that of Australia, has a population of 46,000,000, or eleven and a half times as many inhabitants as the Commonwealth. The populations of Japan, India, ancl China are rapidly growing, whereas ours is practically at a standstill, if it is not declining. Java has an area equal to about one-sixtieth of the area of Australia, and yet it supports a population of 30,000,000-seve n and a half times that of Australia. Thus we have presented to us the spectacle of 776,000,000 peoplenearly half the population of the worldoccupying an area w r y little larger than that of Australia. And yet we hear people complain that the Commonwealth is overpopulated ! Although we may legislate against peaceful invasions by foreign peoples we cannot legislate against armed invasions. The only protection we have at present is that afforded by the I m perial Navy. But our surest safeguard againsH invasion in the future will 1 lie in our increasing our population by the introduction of virile white settlers. Looking at the matter from this stand-point, it is advisable for us, in our own interests, after providing means for the settlement of our own people upon the lands of the country, to open the door as wide as possible for an influx of desirable - immigrants. At the same time we should safeguard ourselves against the introduction of labour that would enter into unfair competition with' our own people, and result in a reduction of wages and of the standard of living. in its present form, so far as it professes to remedy the objectionable features of the Immigration Restriction Act, is a mockery, a delusion, and a snare. Whilst it professes to meet some of the objections that have been raised to the legislation!,, unfortunately now on our statute book, it increases the disabilities that have been complained of. I trust that the measure will undergo much-needed amendment-that we shall take care not to exclude desirable people, but shall direct our prohibition solely to those whose introduction would tend to prejudice the best interests of our workers, and the best interests of Australia generally.",36
208,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown," Honourable members know that I was one of those who offered the strongest opposition to the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Aot. I considered that it would have the effect of shutting out the best class of labourers that could be introduced here from the old world, and , in addition to that, I feared-and I regret to say that my fears have been justified-that it would bring Australia into disrepute among the nations. I know, as a mattar of fact, that we are now regarded-mainl y on account of the provision we have made for the exclusion of immigrants and for the employment of only white crews upon ocean mail steamers-as a narrow-minded, selfish people, who, like the dog in the manger, are content to allow our magnificent resources to remain undeveloped rather than permit people of our own kith and kin from ""the old world to come here aind assist us in building up a great nation. I regret to say there is a great deal of justification for this view. It may be imagined, therefore, that with great satisfaction the of an amendment of the contract section; but I need hardly say that I - was grievously disappointed when I read the proposed amendment. I believe that the intention is good; that it is not desired to place any restriction upon desirable immigrants, except they are brought here by employers at a time of industrial strife, or under contracts which do not provide for the prevailing rates of wages, and for the observance of the conditions under which industrial occupations are pursued in Australia. Unfortunately, however, the Bill is drafted in such a way as to make the proposed amendment absolutely useless. I The Bill fear that the measure is the conception of . one of our legal friends, who has not consulted any business man. The restrictions placed upon immigrants under the Bill are such as would preclude any man from attempting to come out here. Imagine any person coming out here under contract without knowing beforehand whether he would be permitted to land.",37
209,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Bu the will know if the contract is lodged beforehand. The person who wants to import labour will-probably be an Australian, and he can either personally, or through his agent, submit the proposed contract to the Minister in Australia beforehand.",37
210,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,The proposed .amendment of the law does not say that.,37
211,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"No , but"" that is what would be done in most cases.",37
212,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"I do not consider that the method contemplated is practicable. In the case of men being brought out here to settle an industrial dispute, the innocent immigrant, who knew nothing about the 1 reasons for which he was engaged, would be made to suffer, instead of the emplover, who alone should be punished. A provision by which an emplover bringing out men uncler contract in contravention of these provisions might be made to pay a certain sum for the support of the men, or, if they preferred it, to pay for sending them Home again, would, in my opinion, be quite effective. . The immigrant himself should not be prejudiced in any way. In the case of immigrants brought out under contract to work at lower wages, and worse conditions than those prevailing here, the proper remedy would be to make the contract voidable. If a man found that he was brought out to work at' a lower wage than was current in his trade in Australia, I hailed he should be at liberty to break his conpromise tract, and the employer should be compelled to pay something towards his support' until he could obtain other work. The employer here understands what the law is, and if he breaks it in letter or spirit, he, and not the innocent immigrant should be made to suffer. It appears to me that the Bill has been drawn up under a misapprehension - unde r the impression that employers here are extremely anxious to bring out men under contract, and that the workers in the old country are straining like greyhoundsin the leash to come here. That is not the case. Other countries hold out all sorts of inducements to immigrants.",37
213,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"O u r politicians of past have sold all our lands, and we are prevented from offering inducements to immigrants, such as are presented by other countries.  heard any of the immigration lecturers sent Home by the States Governments?",38
214,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"I have never heard them lecturing in England; but I have read statements which some of them are reported to have made.  had heard them, he would not wonder why the people do not rush out to Australia.",38
215,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"If one of those lecturersinduced my honourable friend to come out here, he did him, as well as Australia, a very good turn - He induced a very good man to come here. We know perfectly well that, after all, the profit that an employer can make out of the labour of a man - not being a thoroughly skilled artisan or mechanic-is very small. He is not willing to incur a great risk to bring them out. I do not think that anyfair employer will object to being subjected to reasonable penalties for knowingly introducing men under contract, either at a lower rate of wages than that which prevails here, or for the purpose of settling an industrial dispute. The employer who wilfully violates those conditions should be made to bear the whole of the penalty.",38
216,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that he would object to be punished?,38
217,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"He might object, but if he did wrong he would have to submit to the penalty which the law prescribed. If we wish to attract good men to our shores, it is idle to expect them to come upon the off-chance that upon their arrival they may Ixj allowed to land. I was very much disappointed with the Prime Minister's classification of desirable immigrants when introducing this Bill. He laid it down very emphatically that our first aim should be to secure what he termed "" free men."" Failing to obtain this class-the free men being unemployed-h e said that immigrants might be introduced under contract under proper conditions as to wages and standard of living. I venture to sav that if he had consulted any practical man he would have been told that exactly the reverse should be our aim. W i ll any one venture to say that the unemployed here-the men who meet us everv day at the street corners with a the request for the price of a meal-ar e more valuable colonists than the industrious, thrifty individuals who can always obtain work? We know that it is not so. One industrious, enterprising, pushing man is worth half-a-dozen idlers.",38
218,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,But some men who are unemployed are not idlers.,38
219,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"I quite admit that; but at the same time, I know men who, for the past five or six years, have come to me every week for a small dole. They are young enough, and strong enough, to work, but either they cannot procure it, or they cannot keep it.",38
220,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"In mv electorate, I could show the honourable member thousands of men who are not working half-time throughout the year, and who do not appeal to anybody for assistance.",38
221,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"I sympathize with those who really believe that an influx of population to Australia would make it more difficult for the workers who are already here to obtain employment. If I held that opinion, I would hesitate a long time before I would advocate the introduction of immigrants into our midst.  member think that that would be the result if the artisan classes came here?",38
222,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"Certainl y not. Of course, I should like to introduce several classes.  sans available for each job that is. offering, the honourable member argues, that they would have a better chance of obtaining employment.",38
223,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"The v would not if there were only one job offering; but I believe that the influx of a suitable population would develop a large number of new industries, and open up extensive avenues of employment. I have seen the same result brought about in the past. There is no older colonist in this House than I am. I can recollect the conditions which prevailed here prior to 1851 when the gold discoveries were responsible for the first great influx of people info Australia. At that time we possessed a very small population, and the current rate of wages for good station hands was ios. per week. It ranged from 8s. to 12s. per week, but the prevailing rate was ios.",38
224,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"The v also received their "" keep.""",38
225,Mr MCLEA N,Unknown,"Of course. At that time there was scarcely a night upon which a number of swagmen looking for work did not put in an appearance at my father's station. They would get a night's lodging there, ancl sufficient food to carry them on to the next station. Occasionally, if they were really hard up, they were given a week's work, in order to enable them to obtain a few shillings. So far as I can remember, the great majority of them were good, steady, industrious men. But there were no industries in existence at that time, and no avenues of employment open to them. In proportion to the population, there were far more unemployed then than there are now. I believe that an influx of a useful class of immigrants would result in opening up a large number of new industries, and would provide new fields for the employment of labour. No class would ultimately benefit more than would the working men. In regard to that section of the Immigration Restriction Act which has brought Australia into bad. odour all over the civilized world, I think it would be a .great pity if we amended it in such a way as to effect no practical improvement in the existing law.  member wish us to allow immigrants under contract to be introduced, subject to conditions whatever?",39
226,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,No . I would not be party to bringing men into Australia under ployed. contract for the purpose of settling an in dustrial dispute.,39
227,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,How would the honourable member prevent that being done?,39
228,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,B y making penalties tach to an employer who introduced immimust grants for that purpose. But I would not punish the innocent man who had been brought out without any knowledge of the conditions which obtained here.,39
229,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,But we must have some method of finding that out.,39
230,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"We may trust tliose persons who would be specially interested in su;h a case-the men upon strike-t draw attention to the matter. The should provide proper penalties for any breach of the law on the part of an emwealth ployer, but it should not punish the cent immigrant. The latter should not left in doubt as to the treatment which would be meted out to him upon his arrival here.",39
231,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"What does the honourable member suggest should be .done if immigrants under contract are introduced prior to a strike, and a reduction is made in the men's wages within three months of their arrival ? M i . MCLEAN - I contend that we should punish the guilty person, and not the innocent immigrant. I disagree with the Prime Minister's statement as to the relative merits of freemen and bondmen 1 think there was never a greater perversion of the true meaning of those terms than that which he resorted to when he characterized the unemployed individual as the freeman, and the man who is always in work as the bondman.",39
232,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I clo not think that he did that.,39
233,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,He said that we should first endeavour to attract freemen to our shores.,39
234,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,B y that he meant men who were not under engagement.,39
235,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"When this proposal was under a discussion upon a former occasion, I heard several of my honourable friends opposite declare that they would welcome any number of free Britishers, but not a bondman. I venture to say that if any of them were personally interested they would very soon learn that what they are no pleased to term the "" bondmen "" are infinitely preferable to the individuals who a come to this country to join the unem",39
236,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Who made the statement to which the honourable member is referring?,39
237,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"I say that any man who comes to Australia with the intention of atearning his living by his own honest labour be a member of the unemployed until he has procured employment. It is only those who swell the ranks of the unemployed in the old country who would venture to come to Australia under such con-. ditions. A man in England will not forsake his work, unless he has an opportunity to better his position. Moreover, if a thousand men in search of work landed o here tomorrow, they might become a very Bill serious charge on the communitv, whereas if a similar number entered the Commonfor the purpose of engaging in reinnomunerative employment, they would, at be once, prove of benefit to the community.",39
238,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Can the honourable member tell me of an industry in which that number of workers would be required here?,39
239,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,Then let me say five or six workers. My argument is in no way affected by the number of immigrants who might seek admission.,40
240,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Can the honourable member mention an industry in which five or six additional men are required?,40
241,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"If there are no industries in Australia, immigrants will not come here. The question is : ""Is it desirable to shut out persons if they are willing to enter into new industries?"" Is it wise for us to exclude them, because that is really what we have done.",40
242,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,No . no.,40
243,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,My honourable friend must admit that we have done so.,40
244,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Will the honourable member cite, a case?",40
245,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,I will answer the honourable member in true Scotch fashion by asking him another question. Can he tell me how many coloured aliens have been excluded by our Immigration Restriction laws ?,40
246,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,A great number.,40
247,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"Probably hundreds of thousands. The law prevented them from landing here, and consequently they did not come. Exactly the same argument is applicable to the contract section in the Immigration Restriction Act. That provision makes it illegal for persons to come here under contract, and consequently they do not come.",40
248,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"That provision was . half so effective in excluding immigrants under contract, as was the action of some employers who put men in gaol because they refused to take the place of strikers.",40
249,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"I am in favour of legislation that will make that condition of affairs impossible. I will go as far as anybody to attain legitimate objects. But I think that any amendment of the existing law should partake of the nature of a real, and not a pretended, cure of existing evils. I. feel sure that this Bill was introduced with the very best intentions, but, evidently, it has been framed without a sufficient knowledge of existing conditions.  member can indicate some industry in which, employers cannot obtain suitable men in Australia.",40
250,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"It is not necessary to ido ""that. All I wish to do is to insure that every section of the community shall be free' to do what it considers best in the interests of Australia. I claim that to attract to our shores population of the right stamp is in the interests of Australia. We should endeavour to induce people to come here under contract, because we should then have a guarantee that they would be useful citizens from the day that they landed. They would begin to earn wages and to contribute to the revenue, and, generally, to enrich the country from the day they landed.",40
251,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That would be all right if the men obtained work in addition to those already employed; but they are brought here to displace those already in employment.,40
252,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"But the effect of a larger population would be the development of a number of new industries, opening up fresh fields of labour. This would be quite as much in the interests of the workers already in Australia as it would be in the interests of any other class. Anything that tends to increase our output, and so to add to the wealth, of the Commonwealth, provided that we take precautions for the proper' distribution of the additional wealth, must necessarily benefit every section of the community. I did not enter the House this afternoon with the intention of speaking, and, as I have to leave shortly, I. shall content myself with this brief expression of the conclusions which I formed on reading the Bill . There are many other important points that I have left unnot touched, but, to my mind, the principal difficulty is that, whilst the intention of the Government is good, the measure is so> framed that it will absolutely fail to remove the evils in the existing law, of which complaint has been made.",40
253,Mr FRAZER,Unknown," The honourable member for Gippsland seems to have taken up the attitude of the man who is always prepared to s a y - "" I told you so."" He assumes that the contract labour section of the original Act has been the means of discrediting Australia in the eyes of the rest of the world.",40
254,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,No doubt it has.,40
255,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am prepared to admit that unpatriotic persons have, by misrepresenting the wording and the object of the Act, sought to defame Australia.",40
256,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,Tb e most serious slander that has been uttered against Australia is the statement that there is no room here for a worker.,40
257,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If such a slander has been uttered, it has emanated from a small section of the community, with whom the honourable member associates, which is more frequently engaged than is any other in defaming the Commonwealth. The question under discussion at the present time is whether or not the provisions of the I m migration Restriction Act prohibiting the introduction of workers to take the place of men on strike shall be repealed and reintroduced in another form in another Bill .",41
258,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,That is not the question.,41
259,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The section which it is proposed to amend was framed with the object of preventing the introduction of men for such purposes. It is true that certain restrictions are imposed, but they are subject to the following proviso:Provided that this paragraph shall not to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required in Australia, or to persons contract or agreement to serve as part of the crew of a vessel engaged in the coasting trade in tralian waters if the rates of wages specified therein are not lower than the rates ruling in the sure. Commonwealth. I submit that the paragraph in question can serve but one purpose. It is designed to prevent the introduction of a number of men uncler conditions and circumstances which, in the opinion of the majority of the people, make their landing undesirable.",41
260,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"The Act makes the Minister, not the man who finds the money, the judge of the skill of the workmen.",41
261,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That objection will not be removed by this Bill . The workers, ported by the great bulk of the people, are justified in believing that, as they have struggled to secure reasonable conditions labour, a law should be passed to prevent ject. unscrupulous employers introducing from abroad labourers under contract to work uncler unfair conditions.",41
262,Mr KNOX,Unknown,No one objects to that.,41
263,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,And yet honourable members of the Opposition would the safeguard against the introduction of men under unfair conditions.,41
264,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,The honourable member wishes to go further than his words suggest.,41
265,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The honourable member there for Gippsland finds fault with every proand posal made by this Government.,41
266,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"And everv reason. Mr FRA'ZER - No sufficient reason has vet been shown. I seriously doubt whether it is wise for the Government to propose to amend the contract section of the original Act. I believe, notwithstanding the unpatriotic statements of . a few individuals, that it has given the greatest satisfaction to all who understand the object at which it aims. The chief complaint I have heard against it is that it has not been administered with sufficient thoroughness. Whether it be wise or not to amend it , I am not in a position to say. The Government sav that it is, and I presume that they will secure the support of a majority of the House in giving effect to their intention. I hold that any provision against the introduction of contract labour should legitimately appear in the Immigration Restriction Act.",41
267,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In the one case we are dealing with coloured aliens upon one basis, apply while in the other we are dealing with an under economic question upon another.",41
268,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Evidentl y the Ministry Ausconsider it advisable to deal with the question of contract labour in a separate mea,41
269,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Why confuse the two when we can make each complete?,41
270,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I think that by dealing with contract labour in a separate Bill we shall lead to greater con.fus.ion than before. A man who desired to know whether there were any legal obstacles in the way of his landing here would naturally turn to the Immigration Restriction Act, but, if the Government proposal be adopted, he will look there in vain for information as to the suplaw relating to contract labour.",41
271,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"If he came here under contract, he would not think it necessary to of look anywhere for information on the subMr FRAZER. - Surely a man who makes a contract with workers should be conversant with the laws of the country to which it relates.",41
272,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,And that is the man wbo remove s.hould be held responsible.,41
273,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am prepared to place that responsibility upon him. If the object of the majority of honourable members will be achieved by this Bill , I do not think is any reason for serious complaint, therefore I shall support the motion for the second reading. But there with are one or two provisions, which will vest in the Ministry a discretionary power greater than should be given, to any Administration. Paragraph b of claus.e 5 provides that the Minister shall approve the terms of the contract only if , in his opinionThere is difficulty in the employer's obtaining within the Commonwealth aworker of at least equal skill and ability. Under such a provision, a Minister, who was not in sympathy with the law, would, in all probability, be easily convinced that there was a difficulty in obtaining a number of labourers in a given industry.",41
274,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,And versd.,42
275,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Quite so; and that is an additional reason why we should clearly express our intentions in the Bill itself, leaving as little as possible to the discretion of the Minister. That is one of the provisions which I hope the Committee will amend. Another amendment will also be necessary. Section 7 of the original Act gives, the officer concerned the right to question immigrants as to whether or not they are coming here under contract. It has been well known for some time in Western Australia that Italians have been entering that State. On proceeding to Kalgoorlie they are met at the railway station by some of their compatriots, who take them away to mines under particular control, where they almost immediately secure employment. In other branches of industry they are also securing a very considerable preference, and are thus displacing our own countrymen. It is difficult to prove, but there is no doubt in my mind, or in the minds of many others, that these men, before leaving Italy, enter into an agreement to serve in - Western Australia. As the result of representations made by me, additional vigilance is now being exercised by the immigration officials of Western Australia; but it is almost impossible to prove the existence of these contracts. If a provision were inserted in the Bill authorizing our officers, where they have reasonable suspicion that a contract exists, to put immigrants on their oath, and question them on the point, it would remove much of my objection to the Bill . able members opposite accuse the Labour Party of being desirous of keeping Australia empty. 1",42
276,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I do not say Labour Party is desirous of doing so, but that has been the effect of some of the legislation which it has supported.",42
277,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I deny that we are desirous of doing so, or that our legislation has had that effect. Those who know the conditions of this country are aware that the great crying evil in Australia today is the manner in which our land's are locked up in huge estates, carrying a few sheep instead of supporting men and women.",42
278,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,The alienation of our lands came about before there was a Labour Party.,42
279,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Yes , many years before,, and the Labour Party has greatly vice justified its existence by continually objecting to the present conditions, and making strenuous efforts to break up the large estates. In Victoria and New South Wales there are scores and scores of farmers' sons who are unable to make a living on the family holding, and cannot get land for themselves. In Western Australia an effort is being made to cope with this evil by progressive and advanced land administration, with the result that over 1,000 persons are coming to that State every month, the immigrants last year numbering over 16,000.",42
280,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Whenc e did they come?,42
281,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Chiefl y from the eastern States. Many of them were farmers' sons who hacl been driven out of Victoria and New South Wales because so much of the fertile land in these States is locked up from settlement, and devoted wholly to the breeding of sheep and rabbits. As a Western Australian, I am glad that my State is able to attract a large percentage of the best asset of the eastern States; but when the land there has been distributed-thoug h that will take some time, because we have great resources-ou r people will have to go across the seas to find anopportunity to obtain a livelihood, unless a change is made in the land legislation of the other States.",42
282,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,Will the Bill alter the condition of affairs to which the honourable member refers?,42
283,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"No . The question shows the hypocrisy of those who say that it is legislation of this kind that is reHonor- sponsible for Australia's want of population, which is really clue to the shamefullv bad land administration of the eastern States.",42
284,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,Then why not try to that the alter that ?,42
285,Mr FRAZE R,Unknown,"The most innocent member of this House must know that we cannot deal with land matters. The honourable member is supported by the employers, land-owners, and monopolists of the country.",42
286,Mr KELLY,Unknown,They do not support him ; he is a single-taxer.,43
287,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Then he is an exception to most on that side of the House. We do not wish men to come to this country bound. I welcome the man who drifts here in the hope of bettering his condition, and improving the position of affairs in Australia. But it is not desirable that men should be brought here under contract to labour for rates of wages, and under conditions, worse than those obtaining in the country.",43
288,Mr GLYNN,Unknown," I shall offer only a few words on the Bill , because I recognise that the feeling of serenity with which we ought to approach the festive Christmas season should not be disturbed by reverberations from scenes of tumult and strife. But it is my duty to point out the possibility of improving the measure in the direction suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland, and at the same time accomplishing what is reasonable in the demands of our honourable friends opposite. When the Immigration Restriction Bill was under consideration in 1901, the contract labour provision was proposed by the honourable member for Bland in a very short speech. The Prime Minister of the day followed, and pointed out that the clause, as he understood it, was designed merely to prevent men from being brought to Australia under contract, in ignorance of the conditions prevailing here. That is the sense in which it was generally interpreted, and accepted by honourable members. Sir Edmund Barton's words are recorded at page 5366. of volume IV . of the Hansard, report, and are as follows: It tends to prevent the admission into the Commonwealth of persons who, especially if they are not well educated, will be probably-o r may be, at any rate-brough t here in ignorance of our industrial conditions, and who will thus enter bargains which they would not have made if they had had the opportunity of observing the working of our institutions. What is to prevent us from declaring, in so many words, that men are not to be brought to Australia to fill the places of others on strike, and that the wages to be paid to men coming here under contract are to be, not the wages provided for in the contract, but the wages ruling in Australia, where they are higher than the contract rates? What more is needed that that? The B i l very elaborate one, drawn up in such a way as to cloud its meaning. I am with the Labour Party in desiring to prevent blacklegs from coming he're. They do not wish men to be brought here who will reduce the rates of wages. Cannot that end be met by expressly prohibiting the introduction of men to fill the place of strikers ? I do not think the Bill should do more than that, provided the second condition which I have mentioned is also inserted, that the rates of wages to be paid under 1 any contract shall be at least those prevailing in Australia. The measure, however, delegates the authority of Parliament to the Minister, which' is a very vicious development of parliamentary government. Instead of sticking to the good old British principle of representative government. Parliament is gradually handing, over its powers to Boards and to Ministers.",43
289,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yesterday the Opposition thought that the Minister, not Parliament, should fix the language test prescribed in the Immigration' Restriction Amendment Bill.",43
290,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"What I said was that, if a measure is passed saying that a certain language shall be prescribed, what is meant is that it shall be prescribed by regulation, not by Act of Parliament. This Bill does not provide that the conditions under which men may enter Australia shall be prescribed by regulations, over which Parliament would have control, but leaves the whole matter at the discretion of the Minister, whose exercise of that discretion cannot be challenged either by the Courts of Just'ce or by Parliament. The whole matter is left to a Minister, who, under the pressure of supporters, might be forced to do a gross act of injustice, or to administer the men sure in a way never contemplated into by Parliament. Clause 5 provides that the Minister shall approve of the terms of the contract only when a cor>v is filed with him. ancl "" if in his opiniori "" the conditions set out in sub-clause 2 are complied with. That means that no man will be able to enter the Commonwealth unless with the permission of the Minister. No regulations will have to be framed which will come before Parliament, and we shall have no opportunity to challenge a Minister for any improper exercise of authority. It may l is a be obiected that Parliament can always set rid of a Minister, but whenever a Minister is attacked for any act of maladministration, other considerations sway honourable members in coming to a vote. The Bill leaves it to the discretion, of the Minister to allow or to refuse under contract to enter Australia.' The Minister is not even called upon to exercise his discretion in a particular manner. We know what human nature is, and we know that Ministers are apt to exercise discretion in the manner most conducive to the achievement of their ambitions. from the point of view of the Minister himself, the Bill , as drafted, does not seem to accomplish its object. Clause 6, for instance, affords temptation to an immigrant to land in contravention of the Act. It provides that if an immigrant lands in Australia before the Minister has approved of the terms of the contract, the contract shall be absolutely void. If so, there will be no contract in existence, and there will be no contract immigrant. "" Contract immigrant"" is defined as "" an immigrant under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour in Australia,"" and if , under the circumstances referred to, the contract is void, there can be no contract immigrant. It is provided also that the contract immigrant shall be entitled to recover £ 5 0 from the employer if the Minister thinks fit to approve of his claim. If a mart slips past the officials, and is allowed to land in contravention of the Act, he can no longer be a contract immigrant, and, therefore, cannot recover, uncler the provision of paragraph d. of clause 6, the sum of £ 5 0 that is to be given to him if the Minister thinks it ought to be so given. Then, again, from whom is he to recover the money ? Not from the employer, in the ordinary sense. If honourable members will look at the definition of ""employer,"" they will see that it goes a very iong way in the direction of making subject to the penal provisions of clause 6 men who may be innocent. employer not only includes the party who contracts with the immigrant, but ""an.v person on whose behalf that party so contracts, and any person employing or intending to employ the contract immigrant."" There is no distinction drawn between the man who has engaged the immigrant and the person who may subsequently employ him, or who nuaiy intend to employ him, and, therefore, any one of these "" employers'' will be liable to be brought within the penal provisions of clause 6 if the Minister thinks fit. I say that even from the point of view of the Ministerial policy, this Bill is not properly drafted. Then again clause 9 providesmen The Governor General may, by order published in the Gazette, order that from and after a date therein specified, the immigration of contract immigrants intended to be brought to Australia for or in connection with or in contemplation of a dispute relating to industrial matters shall be prohibited subject to such exceptions and limitations as are expressed in the order. Even What does that mean ? The Governor General need' not include any exceptions or limitations in the order and therefore all the Minister would have to do would be to draw up a proclamation, and, after submitting it to the Governor General, publish it in the Commonwealth Gazette. Then the whole of the provisions under which men are supposed to be able to come here would be abrogated. In one case, the Minister is free to exercise his discretion as to Avhether men shall be permitted to come here, and in the other case the Ministry as a whole can repeal the Act, Avithout any reference to Parliament. This class of legislation is not only unfair to men in other parts of the British possessions, who ought to be free to come here without being compelled to go cap-in-hand to the Minister, but it is unfair to this House, because it places in the hands of Ministers powers which should be exercised by the Legislature. The Prime Minister cannot lie congratulated upon the drafting of the Bill , becauae, eA'en assuming that his objects are good, they are not coA'ered by the measure.",43
291,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown," The sparsely occupied benches in the Chamber this morning SIIOAV that the House has by its assiduous and continued labours worn itself to a skeleton; and, in my opinion, the earlier it is entombed the better. I must say that the measure now An before us surprises me. By the Prime Minister's forecast of his intention, I Avas led to expect that some of the objections taken by the British people to the Immigration Restriction Act Would be removed by the Bill . The Prime Minister is becoming more and more of a mvstery to me. By his words he sets up the highest ideals, and by his acts destroys them. He is. mounted on a hobby-horse, with his face to the tail. He says, ""There is mv goal in front of me""-and so it is. But he is entirely oblivious to the fact that as soon as he puts his steed in motion he will be carried further and further awav from the object of his ambition. At any rate that is the result, to my mind, of certain measures such as the Bill which engaged our attention yesterday, and the Bill that is now before us. We cnn all remember that when the contract section-the unfortunate administration of which, in one instance, caused great misconception and great discontent in Great Britain-wa s adopted, it was stated distinctly-and the assurance was accepted by the whole House-that it was intended to prevent contract labour fiom being introduced here in connection with industrial disputes, or on such terms as - would reduce the existing rates of pay and general conditions in Australian industries. With that proposal, aa then presented, the majority of honourable members were quite in accord, but the administration of the Act has created a wrong impression in the motherland, and it is apparently considered necessary to take steps to remove that impression.",44
292,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Were not those misconceptions caused by misrepresentations?,45
293,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Some of them may have been, but others have naturally arisen from the administration of the Act, and from the apparent intention of the people of Australia, as announced by some honourable members, that there should be np further immigration. We find that instead of easing the terms of the Act, the Bill sets up further barriers. The administration of the Act depends now largely upon the discretion of the Minister. He is called upon to consider the circumstances of the case-and Parliament agreed to that condition,, owing to the difficulty of enacting a measure that would meet every case-and he is at liberty to grant or refuse admission according to his discretion. Now it is proposed to set up several other barriers. After allthese have been successfully overcome, the Minister will still be in a position to reject any immigrant, whether British or foreign, who may come out under contract. I cannot see how any such provisions are likely to remove the impression that has arisen in Great Britain, or create satisfactory feelings in Great Britain ancl its dependencies, or encourage immigrants who are leaving the shores of Great Britain in such enormous numbers annually, to turn their faces in the direction of Austialia.",45
294,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member think that all contracts in, flesh and blood shouldi be shown t'o be fair?",45
295,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not think there should be any necessity to submit to the Government the arrangements between man and man, such as those made in our midst, unless there are good 1 reasons for interference. No objection is taken to provision for submitting the contract to the Minister where it may be necessary. But if the intention originally expressed, namely, to prevent labour from being introduced at a time of industrial strife or under contracts providing for lower wages and worse conditions than exist in Australians to be carried into effect, no objection will be raised to provisions 1 directed to that end. That is what I expected the Bill would provide. But, instead of doing that, it puts greater difficulties in the way of the admission of our fellow British citizens and others into Australia, and in addition preserves all the powers which are vested in the Minister under the principal Act. In introducing the Bill the Prime Minister saidv As I have said over and over again, an empty Australiais not a White Australia. I entirely agree with him, ancl I am prepared to embody my opinion in an enactment when I have the opportunity to do so. I say that this Bill, inasmuch as it is an intimation that the. people of Australia are not ready to welcome members of their own raise from the mother land, will retard immigration much more than it will affect the contract immigrant. It will restrain, not merely the contract labourer from coming to our shores, but it will prevent-as the administration of the present Act has done-thousand s of capable persons who would have assisted in the development of our resources, and in the creation of prosperity, from coming here.'",45
296,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,H a l f the farmers in Australia today were at one. time farm labourers.,45
297,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,Unknown,"Of course. It would almost seem that there is no necessity for this Bill , because the number of immigrants who have entered Australia under contract is sd limited. Of course, it may properly be argued that more would have - come in the absence of the legislation which is upon our statute-book. I would not object to confining the measure to what it was intended the principal Act should accomplish, and no more. If we look at the provisions of this Bill we shall realise the difficulties which will confront immigrants who are offered engagements in Australia. I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland that a man who comes to our shores under a contract, at fair wages, is infinitely freer than is the individual who comes here without any such contract.",45
298,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,That is a poor compliment to pay the pioneer.,46
299,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Many of the pioneers came out under engagement, and no ill effect resulted to Australia. man who leaves the country of his birth to accept work in another where strange conditions prevail, and where the people are unknown to him, must feel himself freer than does the individual who leaves that country without any knowledge of whether or not he will secure employment upon his arrival.",46
300,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,There is nothing in this Bill to prevent any man who is a specialist coming to Australia.,46
301,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"But , in nearly all cases, these agreements must be for the employment of specialists. If we are prepared to gay that the contracts of persons who come here ignorant of the prevailing conditions, and who are consequently deceived, should be void, and that men shall not be imported under 'contract in connection with an industrial disput*, all those who are introduced under agreement must inevitably be specialists.",46
302,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,That was not so in the case under the principal Act which caused all the annoyance.,46
303,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I differ requisite entirely from the honourable member. am sure he will admit that no better evidence can be obtained that an employer requires to import labour for particular work than that which is supplied by the fact that he is willing, not only to pay the ordinary rate of wages obtaining in Australia, but also to advance the passage money of those men, and to incur the risk which he must take when they are brought from a distance, seeing that he has no knowledge of their capabilities and character. No sane employer would ever dream of undertaking the importation of men in view of the risks which must be incurred if he could obtain men who would suit his purpose equally well on the spot.",46
304,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The words "" suit his purpose"" are pregnant with meaning.",46
305,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"An employer would not import men from abroad if he could obtain others locally who would suit his industrial purposes. If we deprive employers of the opportunity to obtain men at reduced rates of wages, or to import them for the purpose of interfering in an industrial dispute, we shall remove all inducements to the improper importation, of immigrants uncler contract.",46
306,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"No , no.",46
307,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honourable member has had some experience of The industry, but probably I have had quite as large an acquaintance with it, and what I have stated is my opinion. The Prime Minister has himself admitted that there have only been a few dozen cases in which immigrants have been imported under contract.",46
308,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There is often no means of ascertaining when men are imported under contract.,46
309,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"We do not touch that aspect of the cas.e in this Bill. If we cannot discover that a contract exists, it is quite impossible to touch those who are parties to it. The fact that only some two dozen persons have been brought into Australia under contract shows that experts alone have been introduced in that way.",46
310,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"They were supposed to be exceptional men, but facts have proved fhat they were not.",46
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is very possible. I have just been pointing out that the employer incurs a great risk in importing workmen, and that he would not willingly do so if he could secure the labour locally. For what does this I Bil l provide? First of all, it provides that the Minister must approve of the terms of the contract into which an immigrant has entered before the contract labourer is allowed to land in Austalia. I am sure that the honourable member for Newcastle does not desire to prevent the establishment of new industries, and the consequent creation of wealth and employment. Now, it very frequently happens that an employer visits a country where certain industries are in existence, sees what is being done, and comes to the conclusion that one of those industries might with advantage be started in his own land. Consequently, he wishes to interview men with a view to selecting employees. But he will be prevented from doing so by the provision which requires any agreement into which he may enter to be approved by the Minister before the contract labourer is permitted to land.",46
312,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Would the honourable member allow an employer to bring in men haphazard ?,47
313,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No . In spite of what has been s,aid in reference to Ministerial responsibility I would prefer to see the provision in the form in which it stands in the Bill adopted. To urge that the amendment is an improvement because it binds the Minister down to a certain position is absurd. To compel the Minister to adopt a certain course upon every pos.sible occasion is very apt to interfere with the opportunities for developing Australia. I have heard no exception taken to the next paragraph, which provides that contract labour mav be when the contract is not made in contemplation of or with a view of affecting an industrial, dispute. Paragraph b of clause 5 considerably tightens up the provisions of the existing Act. It provides that the Minister shall approve the terms of the contract only if , in his opinionthere is difficulty in the employer's obtaining within the Commonwealth a worker of at least equal skill and ability. The Minister is to have a sufficient knowin ledge of Australia and its industries give effect to this provision.",47
314,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,And he must be able judge of the capabilities of a man of whom he has no previous knowledge.,47
315,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is law of the United States. so. He is to be called upon in given cases to determine whether or not a certain man in Australia is equal itt skill, and ability a man abroad whom he has never seen, and whom it is proposed to introduce under contract. The employer must necessarily take care that he is bringing in a man of superior skill and ability; son why he should do otherwise. Minister, without seeing either of the men, between whose capabilities a comparison tralians. must be madte, is to determine this question. Is no consideration to be given to the ter ancl habits of the men ? There are men all immigration. of skill and ability who seldom obtain work, although they would have no difficulty finding employment if they were of steady sober habits; and yet the Minister might impression that as long as we have in Aussay that one of these was equal in skill ability to the contract immigrant, ancl the latter', together with the person responsible for his introduction, would be punished. fai l to see how the Minister could hope to make such a comparison.",47
316,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,""" The Minister/' inmost cases, will mean some officer in a distant part of the Commonwealth.",47
317,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,Unknown,"Officers all over the Commonwealth may have to express an opinion on this question. The provision is made so explicit that it will be impossible to comply with it by a mere general consideration of the circumstances. A fact which is difficult, and, indeed; impossible of ascertainment is to be determined by the Minister before a person uncler contract can enter Australia.",47
318,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member think that a Chinese wall round Australia would be a good thing? admitted Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Judgin g by the legislation they support, some honourable members apparently think that it would. The Minister is not merely to say whether, in his opinion, the law is being infringed; he is definitely called upon in every case to make a comparison of skill. Not only will it be impossible to comply with this provision,, but people outside Australia will conclude that our legislation is ridiculous, and that we do not wish to have a single immigrant while there is a man Australia ready to take the work which to would be allotted to him..",47
319,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,This provision is not to half as strict as is the American law.,47
320,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I shall show that it is entirely different from the,47
321,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It is not as good.,47
322,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That to may be, but America does not exclude American citizens. When the Bill is taken into Committee, I shall give honourable members an opportunity of saying whether we shall allow our fellow-citizens to enter there is no reathe Commonwealth. But the",47
323,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,We do not exclude Aus,47
324,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Some of those who characcame here as immigrants would shut out,47
325,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is in sometimes the case. This provision will convey to people in the old world the 1 and tralia a man who can do the work for which it is proposed to import labour under contract, that labour cannot be introduced.. I Only when the impossible condition arises - the condition that there is not a man in a particular industry unemployed throughout Australia-wil l immigration under contract be permitted.",47
326,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,That is an unfair statethe Bill . ment.,48
327,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is orable the conclusion at which the people of land will arrive. I do not think there is much objection to the provision that the Minister shall approve the terms of the contract only when in his opinionThe remuneration and other terms and tions of employment are as advantageous to contract immigrant as those current for workers of the same class at the place where the contract is to be performed. But our legislation is so extraordinary it has actually been necessary to insert in a Bill brought before the Parliament of Australia a provision that fellowmoney, Britishers-the men who gave Australia us - shal l be allowed to land at an Auswhom he does not know. tralian port en route to their destination in Australia.",48

335,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honmember does not know what are my Engintentions. A great many of the objecthat tions which have been urged today to contract immigrants might be applied with equal force to immigrants not under contract. Those who do not come here under condicontract have not the same regard for the the condition of the industry in which they are seeking employment as a contract immigiant, or the man responsible for his coming here, must necessarily have. A man that who introduces a contract immigrant must feel that there is some necessity for bringing him here, since he advances his passage and is prepared to run the risk of to entering into a contract to employ a man There is no safeguard in; the Bill against the overloading of an industry by immigrants who are not under contract; and therefore the logical extension of the argument is. against all If the only consideration is of preventing the overloading of an industry, stronger objection should be r emtaken to immigrants who come here free from any agreement than to those who are The Minister has stated in the course of a brilliant that he favours immigration, and we imiknow that immigration of any description the must necessarily include a number of in different trades and callings.

341,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I saw a statement as to the reasons for the introduction of the men. They are workers of certain machines.,49
342,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"The Australians were working the machines in question before the Americans came here. Mr DUGALD THOMSON . ^ - I cannot speak of circumstances of which I do not know, but the statement which' I read was that the employers considered it necessary to bring out these men to show the Australian workers how to properly run the machines.",49

350,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,Unknown,"Therefore I do not try to state them. It is because the honourable member says so much about things of which he knows nothing that he finds it so difficult to put an end to his speeches, as we know by sad experience. Workers are likely to be imported under contract more for the development of new industries than for any other purpose, and it will not be to the advantage of this country if we pass legislation which will cause skilled artizans in other parts of the world to be unwilling to come here, because any contract into which they may enter for employment here may, on their arrival, be declared void. Even if .skilled workmen are brought here under contracts stipulating for the payment of higher rates of wages than they were earning in their own land, and than prevail here^ they may find, on reaching our shores, after having disturbed their family relationships and disposed of their homes and belongings, that the Minister has declared the contracts void for no other reason than because he is of opinion that equally skilled men are to be found in Australia who. are ready to fill the vacant positions. We complain of the press statements against Australia, and of the criticisms to which our legislation is subjected-and I am of opinion that, while many of the statements which have appeared in English newspapers have been unjust, many others have been made spitefully, or are due to misconception - but surely, if we pass this Bill as it stands, newspaper writers cannot be blamed for pointing out that persons going to Australia under contract, even at higher rates of wages than prevail here, may discover when they arrive here that the Minister has annulled the contract on the ground that equally skilled men are available locally. It will be asked, too, what can any Minister know about the skill of artizans in any industry, and it might well be suggested that a Minister would favour citizens of Australia before others, in order to obtain votes.  member think so little of Ministers as to believe that they would be influenced by considerations respecting a few paltry votes ?",49
351,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I do not refer to any particular Minister.  member be so influenced?,49
352,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am not going to consider my own case; but the honourable member's experience of parliamentary lif e must compel him to agree with me that there are Ministers and members who would be influenced in their decisions by considerations respecting votes, though I do not say that every Minister or every member would be so influenced. The American immigration restriction laws have been referred to ; but - it must be remembered that Australia' does not stand in the same position as America or other foreign (Countries. We are not an isolated country ; we are only one of the many dependencies of an Empire whose conditions vary greatly, although they are all under the same monarch. An isolated country can pass certain laws without injuriously affecting its own people, because none of them live beyond its borders; but we must be very careful, lest our legislation affect our countrymen in other parts of the Empire more injuriously than it benefits us. I have been told by Americans that their immigration restriction laws do not exclude any American citizen. But we, in passing legislation of this kind, are dealing, not merely with foreigners, towards whom we have no responsibilities, and to whom we owe no duties, but with, amongst others, the 40,000,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom. That country has always been generous to us. It has never passed legislation such as is now proposed affecting us; it has given us our free institutions, and allows us to govern this country subject to very few restrictions.",49

354,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The Imperial Navy roams the seas, and is maintained at heavy cost to the people of Great Britain, for our protection as much as .for the protection of other parts of the Empire. Surely we ought' to mete out different treatment to the generous people of the British Isles, who are our own countrymen, and have raised no barriers against us, from that which we would mete out to foreigners. When the Bill gets into Committee I shall endeavour to afford honourable members an opportunity to consider that point. I do not wish to encourage the importation of men into Australia at a time of industrial strife, nor do I wish men to be brought here under a misconception as to the rates of wages and conditions of labour prevailing in Australia. Restrictions against such immigration are in the interests of British immigrants themselves. I think, however, that the other restrictive provisions of the Bill should not be applied to our fellow-countrymen in Great Britain.",50
355,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown," The concluding remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney convince me that there is very little ""difference of opinion amongst honourable members as to what should be the obiects of the Bill. He stated clearly and distinctly that he does not object to restrictions preventing men from _ being brought here under contract at a rime of industrial dispute, or in contemplation of such a dispute, or under contract with a view to lowering the prevailing rates of wages. I am with him in those opinions, and I understood that that was the original intention of the provision in the I m migration Restriction Act which the Bill has been introduced to amend.",50
356,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,That was the only intention stated at the time the provision in the Immigration Restriction Act was proposed.,50
357,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"It seems strange to me that a Bill of twelve clauses should be required to make the necessary amendments of the present law, seeing that the provision which we seek to amend is contained in one paragraph. To my mind, it - is the verbiage of the Bill which has caused the confusion of opinion which appears to exist amongst honourable members. No legislation of the Federal Parliament has had co much attention directed to it, both here, in the press, and on the platform, as the provision to which I refer. No doubt the misconception and misrepresentation which has prevailed concerning it may have injured Australia, but some honourable members have spoken as if they wished to convey the impression that this provision has been, the cause of reducing or stopping immigration to Australia. It may have had some effect in that: direction during the last few years; but what was the trend of immigration for many years before it was placed on the statute-book ? I join issue with honourable members who, instead of attempting to discuss the merits of the proposal, direct their attention to matters entirely apart from it. If one cause more than another has operated to divert immigration from Australia during recent years, it.has been the action of our masters of finance. In 1880 they ruined our reputation as an honest community, and that, to my mind, was the first cause of the diversion of immigration, and the investment of capital, from Australia. That, however, has no bearing on the present position.",50
358,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Who are our masters of finance-does the honourable member mean the banks ?,50
359,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"Yes . We suffered here as individuals and as a community, and investors abroad suffered. There is, no hope qf our attracting any considerable number of immigrants, whether they be free or under contract, unless we can provide employment, for them and afford them an opportunity to make their homes here. I do not say that there is not an enormous field for the operations, of people who may come here. I venture to say that in no country in the world can an industrious citizen live under better conditions than in Australia. In no place can a larger proportion of the industrial population make homes, for themselves. If Australia is not as attractive, or employment is not as diversified, as it should be, those who have had the government in their hands, are responsible for it. I recognise that there is no material difference of opinion amongst honourable members upon the two main objects which it is sought to achieve. Everv honourable member is prepared to oppose the introduction of labour at a time of industrial strife. The Bill should provide against that, and it is intended so to prox'ide. Furthermore, no honourable member wishes to see labourers, brought here under contract at wages lower than those prevailing in the industry in which they are to be employed. I am prepared to make provision against cases of that kind. I am not willing, however, to go any further. I am not content to allow any Minister, or officer appointed by him. to be the judge as to the qualifications of an employee.  as to the qualifications of the employee?",50
360,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,I think that the man who finds the money to pay the employee should be the judge. I see no objection to bringing into the Commonwealth wellordered and reputable men if employers are willing to pay them the rate of wages that prevails here.  good means for bringing down wages afterwards.,51
361,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"It is all humbug to talk about bringing wages down.

Mr KENNEDY.,-No , I do not.  has not always talked likr* this.",51

Only 12s. per week.",51
363,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"I have already stated that, according to my experience and humble judgment, no higher fates of wages than are paid here prevail in any country; nor are the conditions of living better elsewhere than in Australia. To those honourable members who talk about paying 12s. per week to pastoral or farming employees, I say, as I have said before, that I am very sorry for the employers who engage labour at that rate.  that wage.",51
364,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"I am sorry for the employer who will put up with such labour, because, according to my experience, it is absolutely useless.  a man to accept less than that.",51
365,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,I know that. I have had a little experience in that direction. I have had to work down to a fairly low level.  10s. per week ,51
366,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"The honourable member may have been lucky to get it, in the same way thaf I have been. I trust that the Government will exercise a little common-sense-whic h is not unusual with them-whe n we deal with the Bill in Committee. I do not see that it i's possible for me to vote against the motion for the second reading, because the Bill embodies two principles to which no honourable member is opposed. In matters of detail, however, the measure goes a little too far. and will tend to make us ridiculous as a community. There is no necessity for proceeding to that length if we'can achieve our object by fair and i.bove-board means. The honourable member for Grey asked me who was to be the judge as to the qualifications of a contract immigrant. According to clause 5, the Minister shall approve of the terms of the contract only if , in. his opinion, ""there is a difficulty in the employer's obtaining within the Commonwealth a worker of at least equal skill and ability."" That would reduce the whole thing to an absurdity. Surely the employer in Australia is a better judge as to what he requires in the shape of skilled labour or special labour of any kind than is the Minister or a Government official. The Minister should, however, have power to insure that the labourer brought in under contract should receive the rate of wages current in the industry in which he is to engage.  member indicate any industry in which an employer could not obtain the skilled labour he required without going abroad ?",51

368,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"There are numbers of farmers who come up to my ideals, but, as I have said before, the farming hand who will give attention to his business in the northern districts of Victoria will not remain a labourer for more than five years. The peculiar conditions that prevailed a few years ago deprived us of the cream of the men in the northern agricultural districts of Victoria. Some of them, unfortunately, went to South Africa, and others to New South Wales, and it became impossible to obtain a good all-round farming hand for love or money. It was not a question of wages, but men could not be induced"" to apply themselves to the work. The conditions are the same today. It is of no use talking about 12s. per week. No farmer in the districts of which I am speaking could obtain a farming hand for less than 25s. per week all the year round. A farm hand can obtain from £ 6 5 to ^ 7 0 per annum, in addition to his keep, and if he knows his business, can be his own boss.  cases.",52
369,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"No ; they are not rare. The conditions of which I speak extend all the way from Nagambie to the Murray, and even further north. Men who accept T2S. per week are, as a rule, very dear.  whether they are good or bad.",52
370,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"The details in clause 5. to which I have referred, are calculated to make our legislation ridiculous. When, a. contract provides for the proper wages and conditions, it should not be challenged any further. The man who finds the money is the best judge as to what he requires. I am convinced that there is no great divergence of opinion amongst honourable members as to the object to be achieved. The difference exists only as to matters of detail. I have another objection to the Bill as it stands. It wili often be found difficult to submit a contract for approval before the immigrant lands. I do not think it is fair that a man who comes from abroad should be stuck up through no fault of his own. but I am prepared to go as far as any one in the direction of penalising the employer who violates the law. The immigrant who is brought here should be allowed to land, and if the contract to which he is a party is not in accordance with the law. we should void the contract, and penalise the employer.",52
371,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We should not send the victim to goal.,52
372,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"No . There is' no reason why a man who comes here without a knowledge of our laws, should be fined or imprisoned. We should punish the man who does know the law, and wilfully breaks it. There are one or two other details which, I think, can best be dealt with in Committee. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, with a view to amending it in some matters of detail which, if retained, will tend to make us ridiculous in the eyes of the world, and which can serve no useful purpose whatever. In conclusion, I do not share the opinions of those who urge that this particular class of legislation is responsible for the interruption of the flow of immigration to Australia.",52
373,Mr SKENE,Unknown," Upon one occasion I read a. very caustic criticism of an American public man, which ended with The object of his creation may some dav become apparent. I trust! that, before this debate concludes, the obiect underlying the introduction of this Bil l may become apparent. So f ar I have failed to fathom its depths in anv shape or form. We have been assured that it is introduced for a particular purpose, name/y, to do away with a great deal of the misapprehension and misrepresentation which has resulted from the enactment of the section in the principal Act which fhis measure is designed to supersede. I contend that to-dav the whole argument of honourable members opposite is altogether opposed to the position which they took up when the Immigration Restriction Bill was under consideration. Today the whole of their arguments have been in favour of protecting the men who are already in Australia; they exhibit no consideration whatever for those who may desire to come here from abroad. In this connection I wish to direct attention to the remarks of some of the most prominent speakers when the original Bill was under discussion. The honourable member for Bland, who submitted the amendment upon which the contract provision was founded, said, as reported at page 5365 of Hansard, volume IV The amendment will cover most of the classes of labour likely to be affected through people being inveigled into unfair agreements in ignorance of the conditions obtaining in Australia. That amendment was not introduced with a view of protecting the Australian worker, but with the object of preventing persons being introduced under contract at less than the current rate of wages.  orable member for Bland says now.",52
374,Mr SKENE,Unknown,Late r on the honourable To which he repliedand learned member for Northern Melbourne said I understand that very largely the intention the amendment is to provide that men be brought from outside the Commonwealth in order to aid a particular side in fighting a strike.,53
375,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That is one aspect of it.,53
376,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"There is no desire to exclude men who voluntarily seek to make their home here for the purpose of engaging in manual labour or anything else, so long as they belong to a civilized white race, and are themselves desirable immigrants. As I understand it, we have never in Australia taken up that narrow view of saying that we must keep Australia for ourselves and our children.",53
377,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Oh , no.",53
378,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,It is as well that that should be generally understood.  owners who prevent immigrants from coming to Australia.,53
379,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Thai i may be the honourable member's opinion, and, if so, he is welcome to it. That was the position taken up by those who discussed this measure on the ist October. 1.901. They held that protection should be extended to men who might be inveigled into coming to Australia under a false agreement. I have always held that the then Prime Minister read into the Act an intention which was entirely foreign to its purpose. The charged amendment which was carried read as follows :Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required in the Commonwealth. The present Prime Minister, who was then Attorney-General, in submitting that amendment, said It is necessary to make provision to permit skilled labourers to enter the Commonwealth if they are of such a character as to be able to add to the industrial wealth of the community. Reading these utterances together-althoug h there may be some slight ambiguitv in the language of the Statute itself- I hold that the intention of Parliament is clear. But when Sir Edmund Barton was confronted with the application of the six hatters for admission to the Commonwealth, he took a totally different view of the way that section should be applied. I challenged him upon the point upon the 27th May, 1903, in speaking upon the Address-in-Reply. Upon that occasion I saidThe Prime Minister read into the provision intention-the intention to protect men already here. Only so far as the words ""required in the Commonwealth"" necessitated an interpretation. of At this stage the honourable and learned shall not member for Ballarat interjectedOne must regard the conditions of the Commonwealth in order to discover what is required in it. I then went on to saySuch an inquiry to be of any use, would have to be most exhaustive. The Prime Minister required an affidavit In speaking upon the proposal which was inserted in the principal Act, the honourable member for North Sydney alluded to the trouble which' a Minister would experience if he were required to institute a search through the Commonwealth, with a view to ascertaining whether certain skilled labourers were required. I foresaw that difficulty at the time, but the Prime Minister of the day did not. The matter was as easy to him as falling off a log. He required an affidavit. I would like to inform honourable members how he came to arrive at that conclusion. In speaking upon this matter at Hobart, on 14th February, he is reported to have saidHe would explain the circumstances connected with the six hatters. The law which he was to administer said that he must satisfy himself that the persons who came to Australia under contract were only to be admitted if they possessed the skill that was required in the Commonwealth. It was the duty of the gentleman into whose employment the immigrants were going to satisfy him by affidavit or otherwise on that point. When 1 quoted the foregoing, during the debate upon the Address-in-Reply, in 1903, Sir Edmund Barton interjected"" Affidavit or otherwise."" What I received were statutory declarations which are not sworn. He was satisfied to rest the determination of the question of whether skilled labour was required in the Commonwealth upon the simple statutory declaration of the employer. I say that, in requiring anv such so-called proof, he wrongly interpreted the Act. The view taken by the present Prime Minister-that the amendment was necessary to permit skilled labourers to enter the Commonwealth if they were of such a character as would add to the industrial Wealth of the community-wa s the correct one. The six hatters were detained on board ship in Sydney whilst certain affidavits or declarations were being obtained, and thus the whole of the difficulty was created.  the employer who engages men abroad, he is bound to say that he requires them.",53
380,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Si r Edmund Barton, who was Prime Minister at the time, based his decision upon a declaration which was not sworn, which was not, in mv opinion, required by the Act, and which, in any case, was valueless, and thus the whole trouble arose. I am quite satisfied with the first part of sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of the Bill. But I object to paragraph b of that provision, which readsThe Minister shall approve the terms of the contract only(2) If in his opinion(b) There is difficulty in the employer's obtaining within the Commonwealth a worker of at least equal skill and ability. If nobody else moves in that direction. I shall endeavour, in Committee, to have that provision excised. I am perfectly satisfied with the proposal that the contract shall stipulate that the wages payable to any labourer imported shall be those current in the Commonwealth, and that immigrants shall not be introduced during the progress of a strike. I contend that we have got away from the original conditions under which the contract provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act were proposed. I do not suggest that the Labour Party are entirely responsible for that, although I am aware that some pressure was brought to bear by them in connection with the six hatters' incident. Some time ago, I appealed to the members of that party to assist in securing an alteration of the existing law, but I obtained no reply from them. There was, however, a reply from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. When I suggested that the Government should amend that legislation, he interjectedThey will not. They are not game. That indicates the source from which the opposition to the abolition of those sections of the Immigration Restriction Act, which are working so much harm to Australia, comes. We have done more than protect the workman who comes to Australia under contract-w e have endeavoured to protect the men who are already here. We have attempted to reserve Australia for the Australians by cramping our industries, and by generally bringing about a set of conditions which is favoured by only one party in this House. I hope that the Prime Minister will submit some proposal which will have the effect of removing the misapprehension which exists in the old country in regard to our immigration legislation. There is no doubt that a great deal of the trouble which we experience is the result of misapprehension. But who is responsible for 'that misapprehension? Undoubtedly we are, judged by the way in which we have been doing things.",54
381,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member is responsible if he misinterprets interjections.,54
382,Mr SKENE,Unknown,Does the honourable member admit that he made the interjection to which I have referred?,54
383,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Unquestionably . I will, however, explain it.",54
384,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"It is quite possible that the honourable member may have had something else in his mind at the time. I contend that when the principal Act was under discussion, the intention of Parliament was merely to protect contract labourers coming to Australia-no t to protect the workmen who are already here.",54
385,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,.Surely both were intended.,54
386,Mr SKENE,Unknown,I should nof protect the workers already here by excluding others who come out under contract to labour under fair conditions.,54
387,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If they cpme out under White fair conditions they 'ought not-' to be exPossibly, cluded.",55
388,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"The six hatters came under here uncler union conditions. During the debate the honourable member for Darling interjected that some of those hatters in favour of this Bill . It is only reasonable to aosume that they are. They have been allowed to land, and do not desire others to come in. I wish to show how impressions formed as to the scope of the law create a greater disturbance minda of the people at home than would a knowledge of the absolute facts. Hondifficulty orable members will recollect the case the groom who came out from Suffolk with horses for Burra. New South Wales. Those horses were imported by an intimate friend of my own, and when I read of the case it struck me that there was no reason the groom should not remain in the Comremove monwealth after completing his contract. I therefore wrote to my friend, pointing out that if he went outside the territorial limits and came in again, free from any contract to labour, no one could prevent his landing. My friend replied in a letcontract ter which I wish to place before the House, as an indication of the impressions that are formed of our law. The Prime Minservance ister stated that the groom need not obtained a permit to land, but my friend, in what I am sure honourable members will regard as a very temper/ate letter, dissatisfactory cussed the question as follows: As to that groom of ours who came out in charge of some Suffolk Punch horses for Burra, I hardly know what his position having fulfilled his mission, he had simply gone outside the territorial limit, and then returned to Australia, instead of clearing out of the for good, in accordance with the conditions of the permit given to him from the Agent-General's office in London. With our many strange new laws, no one knows where he is now-a-days. see that Deakin has been trying to gloze the ter over, and saying that it was quite unnecessary for the man to obtain a permit, and that was merely some stupid officiousness on the part of the Shipping Agents in asking for one. is all very well for Mr Deakin : but the fact year to year. remains, that if that groom (being under, gagement with us to accompany those horses and attend to them until they were delivered at Burra) had come without that permit, have done so at the risk of being arrested landing as a prohibited immigrant. Also Dalployment. gety's people, who are agents for the ship, would have been liable to be fined £100 for allowing him to land; and, even as it is, I underlabour begets labour. stand that they are liable to asimilar fine i fai l to see that he leaves the country within time specified in the permit. As it is, he turns to England on gth instant, by one of the Star ships, aad we have to pay his passage. if he so desired, and cared to take the risk, he might dodge the law, as you suggest, by going out a few miles to sea, and returning not contract to any one : but what of the insane laws which make such a course necessary?",55
389,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,There are several absowere lute misapprehensions in that letter.,55
390,Mr SKENE,Unknown,There may be; but they are not misapprehensions for which the writer can be held responsible.,55
391,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,I do not think that in the tliere are any misapprehensions.,55
392,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"I understand that some arose at home in regard to action of taken by the Prime Minister. This groom has now returned to England, feeling very much like a man who has been on a ticketof-leave, and he will doubtless spread among his friends the news of how he was. why treated. We ought to do something to all cause for misapprehension. The honourable member for Moira has said that, in his opinion, aU that) we require to do is to pass two clauses, one providing that contract labour shall not be admitted during a time of strike, and the other that immigrants shall not be admitted unless their agreement provides for the payment of current rates of \vage3 and the obof fair conditions of labour.

398,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"That is true; and I have known men to make good wages at that rate. It all depends upon the ""cut."" The point which I wish to impress upon the House is that most honourable members appear to think that all that is necessary is to prohibit the introduction of labour during a strike or under unfair conditions, and that it would be well to confine the Bill to such provisions. The Opposition have been from the first favourable to such a proposal, and I think that the House should, as far as possible^ set aside all extraneous matter, and' make the Bill so clear and simple that it will be impossible for any one to misapprehend it. It seems fo me that the original Act is more satisfactory, inasmuch as it is proposed in this Bill to lay down a hard and fast line as to the interpretation of the law-a n interpretation which I felt at the outset was wrong, and which I am more convinced than ever, now that I see it in black and I am certainly disappointed with this Bil^,. for I was the impression that we were going to secure a great deal more than is offered to The Prime Minister .{promised m> bread, but has given us a stone.

399,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"New England) my This Bill has been introduced because of per the various statements made from time to time as to the selfish immigration policy every adopted by Australia. The intention of the Prime Minister was, I believe, to relax the conditions relating to immigration, and so to remove the cause of the complaints that have been made. But that will not be the It is abeffect of the Bill. It has been said that slanders on Australia have been based on ai misrepresentation of the real facts by hon1 orable members on this side of the House who wish to defame the Commonwealth. Such an assertion is absolutely incorrect. Every statement we have made in this regard is tirue.  statements have been made regarding the Immigration Restriction Act.",56
400,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"The statements made by the Opposition in regard to the six hatters, the groom to whom"" reference has been made by the honourable member for Grampians, and the six potters; are absolutely true, although the ""conclusion which the English people have formed from those statements may be erroneous. The Minister has said that there is no necessity for men coming here under contract to obtain permits before leaving the old country or elsewhere. But what are the facts? No contract immigrant can land without having a certificate, signed by the Minister, as to his special skill and ability. That being so, when people enter into arrangements abroad for the introduction of labour into Australia they find ib necessary, before the men leave the port of shipment, to 4 Contract [REPRESENTATIVES.] secure a permit, or some authority, for them to land. Ship masters are liable to be heavily fined for introducing prohibited immigrants, and they naturally-refuse to take contract immigrants as passengers unless they have a definite assurance that the men will be allowed to land. That being so, the employers concerned go to the Agent-General for a certificate, and it is very naturally supplied. We are told that the desire of many employers is to introduce workers to take the place of those already here. That may be the opinion of some honourable members, who take a very narrow view of this question, and believe that every addition to the ranks of the workers in Australia must necessarily reduce the field of employment here; but immigrants not only find employment for themselves; they also give employment for others. Let us look for a moment at the position of the six potters, ancl the attempt made by the lionorable and learned member for West Sydney, then Minister of External Affairs, to initiate prosecutions against the employer for landing fhem without a special permit. He wished to prosecute the employer because some of the potters so introduced displaced other men. pears that there were three for whom work could not be found when they arrived. The Minister, after interviewing the men, was prepared to condone the offence, if it were an offence, conditionally on the employers in question promising to find work for the men in some other direction. They said, ""We do not want them at present, but later on we shall be able to give them employment."" Those men were not biought here to lower the rates of wages. They were skilled artisans, and there were no others in the Commonwealth who possessed the same degree of skill. But if this Bill hacl been in force then, the gentleman who imported these six potters would have been fined heavily for doing so, because pressure would have been brought to bear upon the Minister of the day lo declare, since there were other potters in. the country, that there was already sufficient skilled labour available. This gentleman had for many years been trying to successfully establish a pottery, but he could not do so with the labour available here. He imported a manager from one of the best potteries in the old country, who, when he came out, said at once that he must have power to remodel the works, and to engage other men. He was given that power, and he Mr Lonsdale. Immigrants Bill. carried ou|j his alterations, and imported the six potters and an engraver. He told me that there were other engravers in the Commonwealth, but that they were not the kind of men he wanted. He said that they could not engrave the designs which he wished to have engraved in the manner in which he wished the work to be done. He wanted a potter's engraver. But had the Bill been in force then, the Minister of the day would probably have prevented that engraver from landing, and would have punished those responsible for bringing him here. The members of the Labour Party term themselves the friends of labour, and vet they would punish those who are trying to establish new industries for the benefit of the community at large. The six potters who were imported are whafc are known in the trade as ""placers,"" their special work being to place pottery in the ovens. Being experts and up to date, they know exactly what heat each article requires, and where it should go, having regard to its colours and other considerations. Their special knowledge and skill' enables them to put twice as much in one oven as the old employees could put into it, and thus they get twice as much work done for It ap- the fuel consumed, and lessen other expenses, at the same time producing a larger quantity of first-class pottery. Would any Minister know all the technical difficulties of the pottery business, and be able to judge of the skill of the men available for any position that might be vacant? Would a Minister have the technical knowledge necessary fo enable him to judge of the skill of persons in other industries? Yet the Bill gives the Minister of the day power to say who shall and who shall not be admitted to the Commonwealth as a skilled expert Honourable members are unanimously of opinion that persons should not be brought to Australia to interfere in any strike, either in contemplation or in existence. I do not think any one desires fhat men shall be brought here to fight the battle of the employers against the employees. I know that I would oppose such action with all my strength. We are also agreed that men should not be brought here under confiract at rates of remuneration and under terms of employment inferior to those prevailing in the places where their work ig to be done. But it would be much better to make the Bill absolute in its prohibition of such immigration than to leave the admission or the exclusion of the immigrants at the discretion of the Minister. If the Bill stopped at those two prohibitions it could be passed in a> very short space of time. We are occasionally told that all these contracts are made from Australia, but I have one in my mind that, was made in England. In that case the man was selected in England, and sent out to a factory in Melbourne. As the gentleman who sent him out said in a letter to his manager here, "" We did not pick the worse man we could find, but the best."" That man knew beforehand the terms on which he would be employed. His passage out was paid, and he received a certain allowance on board ship, while on arrival here he was paid the rates of wages obtaining here. Was any wrong done in that case? Has the community suffered by his importation? Is it not better that men should come here with employment guaranteed to them, at good rates of wages, and under proper conditions, than that they should come here on the chance of finding work to do? Would it not be better if , instead of setting our faces against the contract system, we encouraged it? The grandiloquent statements of the Prime Minister seem to me mere bathos, having regard to the legislation which he has introduced. He spoke about this great empty continent, which it is necessary to fill with white people of our own race,, so that we may be able to stand against the world, and then he introduces legislation which is equivalent to hanging up the sign, "" No Briton need apply."" If it! is our desire to keep this great continent for ourselvesfor the few men and women who are here already-let us say so straightforwardly. When an honourable member on this side was showing that Great Britain places no restrictions upon the immigration of persons from Australia, the honourable member for Hindmarsh interjected, "" Yet there are 12.000,000 there within the starvation line."" or words to that effect. I doubt the correctness of his figures. If there were so many unemployed in Great Britain, that country would have good reason for saying, "" We do not require any more people here.'' If Great Britain, with her 40,000,000 of people, many of whom cannot obtain the bare necessaries of life, were to decide that immigration must be stopped, there would be some reason for such action. But there is no justification for our adopting a similar attitude. If it be intended to prohibit the introduction of British people into our mid'st, why should we not honestly stand up and say: "" No Britons need a p p l y "" ? We want population, and we must offer special inducements to immigrants, in order to divert the stream that is now flowing to other countries which are nearer to Europe, and which offer greater attractions.  ting immigrants under contract, it will be a long time before our population is increased.",56
401,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"No attempt should be made to prevent the influx of population, whether under contract or otherwise.  knows that we are prevented by the land monopoly which exists in all the States from offering inducements to immigrants.",58
402,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"And yet members of the Labour Party are blocking all attempts at reform. Some reference has been made to the introduction of skilled labour into some of the Newcastle mines. Now what are the facts? I am told- I do not say that everything I hear is true-that , owing to the constant friction between the em-' plovers and the miners in the Newcastle district, it was resolved to introduce coalgetting machines. After the machines had been worked for some little time,, the employers were dissatisfied with the results, and they introduced four or five American miners, who were used to working such machines.",58
403,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Unde r contract?,58
404,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I presume so. I believe, further, that the wages paid to the imported miners were much higher than those prevailing in the Newcastle district. I am informed that one of these American miners could cut with a machine 100 tons of coal a day, whereas the local men could not hew more than 40 or 50 tons per day.",58
405,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Were they working on the same seam?,58
406,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I understand so. The honourable member for Newcastle told me today that the American miners had not been called upon to work under conditions similar to those with which the local men hacl had to contend. He informed me that the imported men were set to work in a dry place, and in the daytime, whereas the others were required to work in a wet place, and at night. The Americans were, of course, thoroughly used to the machines, and were, no doubt, thoroughly expert men. It stands to reason, therefore,, that even under equal conditions they would' outdistance the local men of only small experi°47° ence. I do not say one word in disparagement of Australian workers. Australian myself, and I believe that Australians are as good as any men in the world'. But we must all recognise that thoroughly skilled workers, such as these Americans, would have an immense advantage over local miners, accustomed to entirely different conditions of working. We must look to the older countries for instruction in the latest methods of carrying on our industries. The keen competition in the more densely-populated countries of the world impels those who are engaged in industry to avail themselves of the very latest improvements in mechanical appliances, in order to increase production. And we should offer every encouragement to employers to introduce skilled men as instructors to our own workmen. I contend that the Minister is not the person who should be called upon to decide what class of labour is required in an industry. It would be sufficient for us to provide that any person coming here under contract shall not be introduced in connection with any industrial dispute, or at rates of wages lower than those prevailing in the industry in which he is to be employed. I do not think that any hampering conditions should be imposed upon employers who desire to introduce contract labour, and I shall endeavour to amend the Bill in .Committee by omitting""paragraph b of sub-clause 2, and sub-clauses 3 and 4 of clause 5. also endeavour to insert an additional paragraph in sub-clause 2 of clause 6, to the following effect:Where an employer proves that a contract not violate the provisions of paragraphs a and c of sub-section 2 of section 5. The effect of that would be that if an employer should bring' out a contract labourer, and the man should land here before the contract was submitted to the Minister, no punishment would follow if he could prove that the contract was not in violation of the two provisions to which I have referred. These relate to the introduction of labour in contemplation of , or with a view to, affecting an industrial dispute, or at rates of remuneration and on other terms and conditions less advantageous than those current for workers in the same class within the Commonwealth. should, as far as possible, remove all unnecessary restrictions. We should not legislate merely for the workmen who are Mr Lonsdale. here today. Surely, when we recollect I am an that in the old country there are many men close on the border-line of poverty, we should have heart enough to afford them the fullest opportunity to come to this land, which, bad as some persons may think it , Still presents opportunities for men to improve their condition. I shall oppose many of the provisions of the Bill , because I think that they are utterly useless, and that they will not in any way tend to better the condition of the masses. If our workers are wanting employment, we must provide it for them by legislation very different from that which, so far, has received the support of the Labour Party. Right through the piece their efforts have been directed to imposing restrictions upon industry, instead of widening the avenues of employment. Every step they have taken has made it harder, instead of easier, for men to obtain employment, and has brought about worse, instead of better, conditions for the workers.  able member, as usual, could not refrain from having a tilt at the Labour Party. He says that all the legislation they have advocated has been of a restrictive character, and that they have done nothing to bring about better conditions for the worker. I presume that the honourable member means to convey that they have not attempted to deal I shall with the land question. I would ask him what support he expects any proposition in that direction to receive from the members of the Opposition. The honourable member and his political associates are dodoes ing the best they can to make it impossible for people to settle on the land. What has brought about the interruption which we are experiencing in the flow of population to our shores ? Honourable members will recollect that it is only a few years since we passed through a great financial crisis, which produced a stagnation in business that is without parallel in this country. Bank after bank closed its doors, and the people's money was locked up in them. That result was not due to the action of the Labour Party, or to legislation of this character ; but, nevertheless, it did a great deal to s.hake the confidence in Australia of people resident in the old world. To-day a We state of things exists upon this Continent which, I venture to say, is not a healthy one. In all our great cities we have a congested population, which is quite out of proportion to the number of persons settled on our lands. Everybody recognis.es that if the country is to progress, there must be settlement in our rural areas proportionate to that which obtains in the cities. But what is the position ? We have millions and millions of acres which are absolutely locked up. It would be a criminal act on my part to advocate encouraging the immigration of artisans and agricultural labourers to Australia under existing conditions. Why are honourable members afraid to confess that at present we have more artisans than we ought to have relatively to the number who are engaged in our primary industries? Every time that a land board sits in these Slates, it has to deal with the applications of from thirty to a hundred individuals for a single block of land. What was the position in New Zealand a few years ago? Under the administration of Sir Julius Vogel, in the earlv eighties, greater stagnation existed there than we are experiencing today. Prior to the Ballance Government assuming the reins of power, it was necessary to establish charitable institutions throughout that Colony. But what has happened since? We have witnessed a remarkable growth' of population owing to the spread of closer settlement. If we are to judge by the elections which have just taken place there, the people of New Zealand are not yet satisfied with the progress that they have made. Only today we learned that the Opposition, who condemned the legislation enacted by Mr Seddon, have been practically annihilated. If I had a brother in England today who had been reared upon a farm, and he as.ked me what chance he would have of acquiring a block of Crown land in Australia, what answer could I return him ?",58

I claim that not a single case can be in which desirable immigrants have excluded under that statute. I do know, however, that the Act has been used by absentees who have made their fortunes here to discredit Australia in every possible way.

Honourable members opposite do not think it right that the Minister should be called upon to determine whether in any given case a worker of at least equal skill and ability to that of the man sought to be introduced under contract, cannot be obtained in the Commonwealth. I venture to say that there are any number of men in other parts of the world who would readily sign a contract to work as navvies at 3s. 6d. per day.",61

Whilst the Minister may experience some advocate the difficulty in determining whether the skilled labour proposed to be imported at any time cannot be obtained within the Commonwealth, the suggestion that the employer bringing out these men, should have the right to determine the question, is certainly an extreme one. The position would not be improved by the adoption of that suggestion. I take it that the Minister, whoever he may be, administering the Act, will endeavour to honestly carry out its provisions. Having no axe of his own to grind, he will try to do justice to contract labourers sought to be introduced for a special class of work. It cannot be said that the Minister would have any vested interests to consider, but I think that every man seeking to introduce contract labour would declare that he could not obtain such labour withlin the Commonwealth.",61

Because every man going there can obtain a grant of 160 acres, and an additional area at a moderate rate. But, with the exception of Western Australiaand even there there is a lot of land unsuitable for settlement-no t one of the Australian States has land available for immigrants. The besfc land in Australia is locked up.",62

When any proposal is made to break up the large estates in that State, the members of the Legislative Council point to Pinarroo, and a number of other places where there is poor land available.",62
428,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"But we have first-class land available in Western Australia.  unfortunately, the best land there would cost a good deal to open up, so that poor people could not be settled upon it. Nearly all the open areas suitable for the settlement of immigrants have been taken up in large holdings, which are not contributing to the railway revenue or to the wants of population to the extent that they ought to do. Until our large estates are thrown open for settlement, it is absurd to say that a Bill of this kind will lead to any increase of immigration worthy of notice. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, not because I think it necessary, but because it will rid us of the objections that have been raised to the Immigration Restriction Act. It is singular, however, that the moment the Government propose to remove the cause of those objections, fresh complaints are made. It seems to me that some honourable members opposite regret [216] that the Bill has been introduced. As long as the original Act remains in force theyi have something upon which to base their argument that desirable immigrants are being kept out of the Commonwealth, although, in my opinion, there is absolutely no justification for that contention. Now that it is proposed to amend that Act, it is said that this Bill does not go far enough. In that respect, the Opposition are showing The honourable member for Kooyong, for instance, does not believe in restrictive legislation. No employers do. Most of them would like to see four men available for every billet offering. We are told that they would not think of introducing labour merely for the purpose of displacing men on strike, or causing industri:A disputes. But we know that they would soon create trouble. The moment there was a large influx of labourers into Australia wages would come down. That is the object of the opponents of the Act.",62
429,Mr KNOX,Unknown,That is not correct.  that honourable members opposite are merely actuated by a desire to see our population 1 increased.,62
430,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"This Bill will not lead to increased immigration.  ber thinks that immigration should be absolutely unrestricted. The school to which he belongs would have black labour to develop Northern Australia, and they would have cheap labour of all kinds for the development of the tropical parts of the Continent; but they would not assist us to break up some of the large holdings in other parts of Australia in order that they might be developed. I feel that ther* is nothing in the original Act to which ob jection can reasonably be taken, but I am prepared to vote for this Bill to gratify th* wishes of the Opposition. As a matter of fact, I believe the Bill is unnecessary, and that the original Act has not kept one desirable immigrant out of Australia. If it be true that Australia has an evil reputation, it is not legislation of this kind that is responsible for it. Now that the objections which honourable members raised a month or two ago have been removed , they raise fresh objections. 1 I shall support the Bill.",62

It is a pretence to say « that our present legislation is keeping people out of Australia. The Bill' does what the leader of the Opposition and his followers have said should be clone.",62
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not at all.  but I do not think that the passing of it will have any effect upon the immigration to this country.,63
433,Mr KNOX,Unknown," It is not my intention to vote against the second reading of the Bill , because I entertain the hope that we may induce the Prime Minister to make one or two amendments in Committee which will improve it. I think that had he been content to introduce a measure merely amending the present law the effect abroad would be more satisfactory than the effect of his proposed legislation, which, I am afraid, will rather accentuate many of the objections to the existing law. It is difficult! to see how its provisions ameliorate the present restrictions. I hold the view that the provision in the Immigration Restriction Act which it is desired to amend has operated againsi! the interests of the Commonwealth. Since it was passed I have twice visited England, where I had an opportunity to meet a large number of persons, and no subject is more frequently alluded to there than the trouble which arose here in connection with the importation of the famous six hatters. At the same time, I . wish to add, what! I have said before, that the occurrence was greatlv exaggerated a.t home, though that fact in itself should show us how necessary it is to be extremely careful when dealing with legislation likely to .be adversely criticised abroad. I have a very clear recollection of what took place when the provision under which that action was taken was introduced. Speaking upon it I saidThe amendment, as I read it , is intended particularly to apply to the possibility of there being industrial disputes within the Commonwealth, and the introduction here of men intended to subvert the claims Which are made by those engaged in such disputes. I have been.consistently opposed to the introduction of any labour for that purpose. I think that if there are nny disputes in Australiawe should be prepared to fight them out within our own grounds, and upon the conditions which apply within the limits of the Commonwealth, without introducing other people to create fuither trouble. But I have had knowledge of the necessity of introducing numbers of men for particular industries, because they have had special training and experience.",63
434,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is provided for.,63
435,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"It is provided for in the amendment which is now proposed, but in that which I saw earlier in the day I do not think it was provided, and we are now here- 'introducing into aB ill which proposes to deal entirely with immigration, the question of a minimum wage; because it says that these persons shall not be introduced unless it is prescribed that fhey shall have a certain wage. I think it is desirable that every man should receive a just and proper wage. Those are the opinions which I expressed in IQOT, and which I hold today. At the 1 time. I had a conversation with the honourable member for Bland, and with the Prime Minister, who was then Attorney-General, in regard to the probable effect of this provision, and I know that the impression in the minds of honourable members generally was that it was intended merely to prevent labour from being brought to Australia to interfere with existing conditions. The administration of that provision has gone far beyond the intention of itsi original supporters. I do not think that any honourable member even imagined that it would be applied as it has been.. Since then my experience has shown me more frequently than before the need of skilled workmen in Australia. Recently, in connection with the starting of ai large woollen mill in Melbourne, it was necessary to bring five men from Bradford, and, although I experienced no difficulty in obtaining a permit for their coming here, it seemed to me strange that we should have to apply to the Government for anything of the kind. Suitable men possessing the necessary experience and knoAvledge could not then be obtained in Australia.",63

437,Mr KNOX,Unknown,No .  to have to do so.,63
438,Mr KNOX,Unknown,It made us an absolute laughing-stock in Bradford.,63
439,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Did Bradford really know anvthing about it?,63
440,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Yes . The woollen people there ridiculed the idea that, before capable and competent men,, whose services were urgently needed for the establishment of an important industry on the banks of the Yarra, could be brought out here to a British Possession, formal permission should have to be obtained to allow them, to land. In another case it was necessary to bring out an American for some works at: Spottiswoode. He was required to construct large leaden reservoirs;, for manufacturing sulphuric acid, to see that they were properly sealed up. When, on arrival, he was asked to sign certain papers,.he said to me, "" Do I understand that, if I had come from Great Britain instead of from America, I could not have entered this country without a formal permission from the Government?""",63
441,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,He evidently did understand the American law.,64
442,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"He knew that had he, an American subject, gone out to the Philippines,,' or to any other American possession, he would not have been prevented from landing because he was under contract.  mean to say that there was no one in Australia capable of soldering up those tanks for him ?",64
443,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"No , there was not. ",64
444,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"The honourable member is displaying his utter ignorance of the subject. It is lamentable that immigration into Australia should have ceased for some years past. I find, by reference to the Victorian Year-Book, 1904, thatImmigration from outside of Australia to the Australian States ceased about the year 1891, and since that time we have bad to depend solely upon the excess of births over deaths for any crease that has taken place in the population. I do not for a moment contend that legislation such as that now before us has been anything more than one of the contributing causes. The honourable member for Grey stated with truth that many British investors were sufferers through the bursting of the financial boom in Australia, and that they felt very sore about what then took place. Honourable members of the Labour Party must, however, acknowledge that it is significant that the inflow of immigrants ceased about the time that they took possession of the government of the country.  the bank failures in 1893. M.r. KNOX - It is significant that immigration ceased almost simultaneously with the advent of the Labour Party to power, and the introduction of restrictive legislation. We have every reason to know that [216]- 2 the legislation which we have passed-recently has not proved satisfactory to the peopie of Australia. Otherwise, we should not find the States Governments taking action such as that resorted to to-night in 1 New South Wales. Unfortunately, honourable members do not debate measures in such a way as to uphold the dignity of this Parliament, nor do they apparently show a full appreciation of the responsibilities which rest upon us. If we adopted a higher tone of debate, and honourable members on each side gave their opponents more credit for honest intentions, we should raise this Chamber to a higher position than it now not occupies in the esteem of the electors, and we should also hold a better place in the eyes of the people of Great Britain. Some honourable members have questioned whether any persons have been dissuaded from coming to Australia by the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act. Several cases have come under my personal notice. One man, who is a farmer in the South of Scotland, desired to emigrate to Australia, but he would not come here unless he was assured of employment beforehand.",64
445,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,He must have received information about Australia from the honourable member for Oxley.,64
446,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I do not know who gave him the information that contract labour was prohibited. He was a man of small capital, with _ a thorough knowledge of farming. If he had been able to start out with the knowledge that employment was awaiting him, he would have emigrated in- to Australia, and with little doubt would soon have become a farmer on his own account, and-set a good example to his neighbours.  coming ?",64
447,Mr KNOX,Unknown,He could not come out! under contract.  a contract?,64
448,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Several persons would have offered him an engagement if they had been free to do so. I Jhink that the Bill needs considerable amendment, and It shall do my best when it reaches the Committee stage to assist in making it a workable measure. The objects of the Bill should be restricted to preventing the introduction of men in connection with an industrial dispute, or under wage and other conditions inferior to those which prevail here. Upon this occasion, as in 1901, when the Act was introduced, I shall be found desirous to do everything I can to protect the workers of Australia in that direction. But we should not impose such strictions as would render it impossible for reputable British immigrants to land here. I believe that some discretion must be allowed to the Ministerj but, in the event of the law being violated, thejperson who is responsible for bringing contract labour into the Commonwealth under improper conditions, rather than the immigrant himself,, should be punished. I trust that when the Bill reaches the Committee the Prinie Minister will agree to amendments which are designed to more directly achieve the objects we aU have in view.",64
449,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown," I do not propose to speak at very great length, because it is evident that honourable members are unanimous with regard to the objects to be achieved by this Bill, and differ only upon matters of detail. I trust that when we reach the Committee stage we shall direct our energies to making the measure effective and thoroughly workable. A gpod deal, has been s;iid as to the policy of embodying the contract provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act in a separate measure. Personally, I think that the Prime Minister has acted wisely, because much of the odium that has attached to other sections of the Immigration Restriction Act has extended to the contract labour provisions. The Prime Minister is deserving of full credit for his judgment and for his courage in introducing the Bill. There is no doubt that a. good deal of misapprehension has existed in regard to this legislation. In the old country taunts in regard to it were repeatedly thrown in my teeth, and I was compelled to explain that the six hatters were "" held up "" simply because the employers who were importing them would not comply with the law. While there may be a good deal' in our legislation and its administration to which exception may be taken, I have never admitted it when I have been absent from the country. Tn England a very deep-rooted feeling exists in regard to this matter. One hears it expressed on all sides, and by all classes. When one talks about Australia people are disposed' to turn the cold shoulder to him and to inquire : "" Do you belong to the British Empire at all? You seem to think that Australia, is not a component part of that Empire, judging by the way that you act there."" It behoves us to do what we can to remove that misapprehension. Personally I am of opinion that the danger of re- this contract provision to the worker of Australia has been very considerably exaggerated. We have already been told by the Prime Minister that very few immigrants under contract have sought admission to the Commonwealth, and in fighting the matter I think that we are shaking hands with the devil a long way off. I hold that we can afford to liberalize this 1 Bill to a very great extent, without doing any injury whatever to the workers whom it is desired to protect. I do not know of anything more significant than the communication from the Agents-General which was received by the Government this week. Those gentlemen, recognising the important positions that they hold, and realizing the gravity of the step which they were about to take, must have decided to forward that letter only after the most ma1 ture deliberation., and because they had the very strongest possible reasons for so doing. It is idle for the honourable member for Bland to \attempt to brush the matter on one side by saying: "" I do not believe it . """,65
450,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,He did not say that. What he said was that he did not believe and did not trust the Agents-General.,65
451,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"Whether he said that he did not believe them, or did not believe it, is quite immaterial. These gentlemen are in,the' very centre of the Empire, and are in close touch, with all the interests which permeate it. Seeing that they deliberately ' met in conference, and appointed the Agent-General of New South Wales as their chairman to pen the communication to which I refer, it is not for us to belittle their action. On the contrary, it behoves us so to shape our legislation as to meet the views which they have expressed. In regard to this matter, what do they sav?In connection with this memorandum, we cannot refrain from expressing our conviction that, although a reasonable provision against the importation of labour during a strike could be full y vindicated, the real aims of the Commonwealth will not be understood or sympathized with, so long as constantly recurring incidents under the contract sections serve to remind^ people of the provision which grates upon every British susceptibility, by treating the British worker under contract as an industrial "" pariah"" in a British community. Surely that is enough to make us reconsider our position^ and endeavour to meet the public view which is held in the old country. That letter was not written by foreigners, but by our own officers who are familiar with the conditions which obtain both here and in England. They have sent us the very best advice that they can offer.",65
452,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,By whom is the letter signed ?,66
453,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"It is signed by T. A. Coghlan, J. W. Taverner, J. G. Jenkins, Horace Tozer, Walter James, Alfred Dobson. If ever Australia spoke with a united voice in the old land it speaks with such a voice in that memorandum.",66
454,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Throug h Messrs. Jenkins, Tozer,. and Taverner.",66
455,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Juda s Iscariot Jenkins.,66
456,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"It is all very well for the honourable member to call names, but that practice does not advance argument. We know that Mr Coghlan has always stood up manfully for Australia. This memorandum states that he is standing up for it in the name and on behalf of all the States. We have heard a good deal during this debate about the "" stinking fish "" party. The honourable member for Hindmarsh referred to the matter very frequently this morning. He seldom addresses^ the House without relating the deplorable conditions which exist in South Australia, and especially in Adelaide. Seeing that all our debates are scanned, surely if such conditions do exist it is more fitting that we should attempt to remedy them, than that we should trumpet them forth to the world. I know of no greater instance of any person crying "" stinking fish "" than that afforded by the letter which was sent to Great Britain by the secretary of the United Trades Council in Sydney in October last. I will not sullv the pages of Hansard, by reading it. That such a communication should emanate from a body of w'orkers is positively disgraceful.",66
457,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,It all depends upon whether its statements are true.,66
458,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"The letter contains statements which, whilst they bear the appearance of truth, are to a very large extent untruths. I cannot understand how any body of workers couM pen such a document unless they wished to damage the country.",66
459,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,What part of the letter is untrue?,66
460,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"It s statements possess a gloss of truth, but to a large extent they are untrue.",66
461,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Rea d the letter.,66
462,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"I will. It is addressed to the Secretary of the Parliamentary Trade Union Congress, London, and reads as follows :Trades Hall, Sydney, 17th October, 1903. Dear sir - I am directed by resolution of the Sydney Labour Council, representing the associated unions of this city, to convey a warning to intending immigrants coming to this State, either in search of work, or as settlers on the land. That is the way for Australia to grow. The communication continuesIn each of the principal cities of Australia are large numbers of unemployed workmen,, for whose services there is no demand. I know of no time in the history of Australia when there were not a large number of unemployed in our cities. No matter what conditions may obtain, there will always be unemployed there, because some men will not leave the cities to accept work in the country. They prefer one meal a day with the pleasures of the city rather than regular work with three meals a day in the country. The letter continues The acquirement of land by agriculturists in this State is a slow and costly process, encumbered by complicated land laws, while but little land of suitable character is available for the many applicants that would readily become settlers on the soil under favourable conditions. That is a gross misstatement. Both in New South Wales and Victoria, estates are being broken up even' day.",66
463,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member must know that for every single block of land available there are 100 applicants.,66
464,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,There are not. Mi. CHANTER - There were more than 500 applicants for one block in New South Wales.,66
465,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"The letter continuesClimatic effects and recurring periods of drought render the lot of the farmer one of insecurity and hardship. That statement is only partially correct, because the whole of Australia is not subject to droughts. A great deal of it possesses a very fair rainfall, and even in parts which are somewhat dry, thousands of settlers are making a very comfortable living. In the mechanical and skilled trades the supply is far in excess of the demand, and altogether the prospect of workmen coming to Australia to improve their position by finding employment, or by becoming settlers on the land, is one of most unpromising and forbidding aspect. Yours, & c , J. P. COCHRAN, Secretary. 1 say that no greater slander upon Australia has ever been penned.",66
466,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,How much of that communication is untrue?,67
467,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"Bot h the Canadian and the United States Federations have been frequently referred"" to during this discussion. We have! to recollect that Canada made no great strides in development until she began to encourage immigration.",67
468,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,To open her lands.,67
469,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"Exactly . But.the difference between Canada and Australia is that in the former there are organizations who make it their special business to attract people to that country, and to look after them upon their arrival. What we need in Australia is some person who will "" g r i p "" this question. That, however, cannot be accomplished until an arrangement has been made between the whole of the States and the Commonwealth. We cannot secure such an arrangement at present, because the States do not trust the Commonwealth. The trend of our legislation has induced them to distrust us, and therefore they do not meet us in the friendly and"" patriotic way that they should.",67
470,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If they do not trust us, it is a wonder that they elect us.",67
471,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,I think it is the duty of this Government to get into touch with the States Governments as quickly as possible.,67
472,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We have approached them twice at conferences, with a. view to coming to some arrangement, but without success.",67
473,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"The matter is too serious a one to perm.it of our accepting a rebuff. If the States are approached in a proper spirit, I believe that they will join hands with us, an'd probably the letter of the Agents-General will be the means of bringing us into closer touch with them. During.the past six years, Canada has settled nearly half-a-million immigrants upon her lands. In igo4, more than 134,000 of that class arrived there.",67
474,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,They were not under - contract.,67
475,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"The question of whether or not they were under contract is not material to the point at issue. I think that my honourable friends opposite go too far in that regard. It is far better that men should come out under contract than that they should set out qn a wild-goose chase. Although immigrants to Canada may not be under a binding contract, they are to all intents and purposes under an agreement; because from the moment that they are persuaded to leave their native land, they are cared for by .officers of the Canadian Government. In the first place, an immigration agent seeks out those who are willing to emigrate, and having assisted them to secure their passages, places them on ship-board. Whilst at Montreal recently, I had an insight into the-way in which immigrants are cared for. The Canada, by which I travelled, arrived in port ten hours after the Victorian, which carried about 600 immigrants. We had about 400 on board the Canada. Most of these were from the Continent. They consisted of Swedes, Danes, Germans, and others, and, taken as a whole, were a reputable, decent-looking body of' men. On reaching Montreal they were met by an immigration agent, escorted to quarters, and supplied with food. On the following morning they were placed on trains running to Winnipeg or to the north-west, where work or land would be available for them. Our difficulty is that we cannot guarantee to find openings for immigrants. But is it to be said that in Australia, a country comprising 3,000,000 square miles, and as large as the United States, room cannot be found for a million or two of immigrants ?",67
476,Mr FISHER,Unknown,At the present time the honourable member could not place iooimmigrants on the land in Australia within three months.,67
477,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"What is to prevent the Commonwealth Parliament from buying up some of the large estates in Riverina and elsewhere, and taking steps, in conjunction with the States, to utilize the water supply, and so make the land available for immigrants? It has been represented that there is a large area of land in the United Statesavailable for immigrants. As a matter of fact, nearly all the good land there has passed into private hands. I do .not think that there is an acre of Government land in California available for an immigrant. With the exception of the arid areas, which no one has thought fit to take up, but which are now falling into the hands of the central Government, who are endeavouring, by conservation works, tr> improve them, there is very little land belonging either to the States or the National Government which is available for immigrants. But the people themselves have taken the matter in hand. California, Colorado, and, indeed, every State, has itscommittee of public-spirited men working inconjunction with the State authorities in an endeavour to advance settlement. The sooner we resort to something of the kind the better. It has also been said that the immigration laws of the United States are more restrictive than are those of Australia. That is not correct. Their laws are certainly < restrictive so far as the importation of contract labour is concerned, but intending immigrants do not trouble about entering into - contracts, because they know that as soon as they arrive they will be able to secure either employment or land on which to settle.",67
478,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,But if a man is without money he will not be allowed to land.,68
479,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,A man has to show that he is not likely to become a burden on the - country.,68
480,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Something more than that is required. The honourable member has not read the Immigration Restriction Act of the United States.,68
481,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"I was in the United States for some time, and, having had conversations with immigration officers there, I am fairly familiar with the position. It is true that there are restrictive laws against Chinese immigrants, but others, have simply to show that they have sufficient money to prevent them from becoming a burden on the country while they are seeking employment.",68
482,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,-They do not admit contract labour.,68
483,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"I admit that. Last year the United States had over 1,000,000 immigrants, and during the last twenty years there have been, on the average, nearly 500,000 immigrants a year flocking to that country. The United States did not pass a law against the introduction of contract labour until it was necessary to do .so ; but here we have adopted such legislation before there is scarcely any need for it. The United States did not pass such - an Act until the trouble arose in the anthracite regions of Pennsylvania, where a low type of immigrants was introduced to cut down wages. Such legislation was,' then absolutely necessary, because the States in which resort was being had to such practices were being ruined. We have had no such trouble, and I fail to see why, in - order to cope with what, after all, is only a shadowy danger, we should stop immigration, and so retard the progress of the - country. As to the policy of a White Australia, I may say that everything I saw - during my tour round the world convinced me of its wisdom. Wherever there has been a large influx of the lower races, evils have followed. Whilst the introduction of such men may for a time fulfil its objectthe object of finding labour-that labour, sooner or later, turns upon those who employ it, and I feel that it is far better to keep Australia white, even if the observance of that policy renders its growth, slower than it might otherwise be. But the policv of a White Australia does not mean that we should keep Australia for Australians. There are fine types of white men in other countries. Why should we turn our backs on our brothers and sisters, in the old land ? We all have relatives there, and to deprive our own flesh and blood in Great Britain of an opportunity to come to Australia, where they may enjoy a freer and better life, is not only cruel, but unpatriotic. I deeply regret that the Government have seen fit to set aside the Bill for the appointment of a High Commissioner. I know what is the feeling in the old land, and recognise the necessity for the appointment of an active, able, vigilant representative of the Commonwealth in London. We shall never make any headway there until we are represented by a man who is ready with his pen and his tongue, and is in touch with commercial and other interests. The position will be a difficult one, and I do not envy the man who secures it. But we need such a representative. The representatives of the States speak only for the individual parts of the Union. We need some one to speak for a united Australia, to correct misapprehensions, and to refute the slanders on the Commonwealth. I trust that the Government, at the earliest moment, will take this question in hand, and see that Australia is properly represented in the old land.",68
484,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melbourne) It seems that the mountain is labouring, and bringing forth a mouse. I thought at the outset, and still think, that the Bill is unnecessary. Under the existing Act we have the regulation of the introduction of contract labour, and that system is to prevail under this measure. It would have been wiser not to bend to the storm of obloquy under which we have been suffering in consequence of the misrepresentations made as to the provisions of"" the existing Act. I was of opinion that the quarry of misrepresentations was being rapidly worked out, and I sincerely hope that this amending ""Bill will not open, as it were, a new quarry, out of which fresh misrepresentations may be carved. It would have been better had we left the contract labour section of the existing Act to' the test of time, and to the experience and common sense of the people on both sides of the water. There is not the slightest doubt that the accusations made against Australia, fomented as they were from this side of the water, have done us harm, and there can be no doubt that they were unjust. The honourable member for Echuca was perfectly right. There has not been a single case in which a desirable immigranf was excluded by virtue of the contract section. The honourable member, as a patriotic Australian, has put, as far as he could, the true position before those abroad who slander Australia.' I will also say that I watched the honourable member's career in the Victorian Parliament, and was pleased to find that, although we differed so widely in our opinions upon some matters, we could rely upon him to tell the truth about Australia. I must confess that I wish that the spirit which has animated him had animated a number of others who belong to Australia, and ought to be loyal to it. There has not been a single case of a man being excluded from Australia who ought to have come in. There are a number of matters dealt with in this Bill which might well have been left to regulations under the existing Act, or to the discretion of the Minister. But, as the Bill has been introduced, we must make the best of it, and I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister's wish that it will help to dispel misunderstandings with regard to our contract labour law will be fulfilled.",68
485,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Do not the contract labour provisions of the Act go further than the honourable and learned member originally 3.dvoc3,tcd ?",69
486,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,I do not think so.,69
487,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"I have read the speech made by the honourable member when the Immigration - Restriction Bill was under consideration, and I think that they do.",69
488,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I said then, and shall always say, that no party in Australia has ever placed on its platform a proposal to exclude white people from the Commonwealth.",69
489,Mr SKENE,Unknown,The honourable and learned member said that we did not want Australia for the Australians.,69
490,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"That is certainly the case. We. shall always welcome to Australia those who have vigour and decency to commend them. There never has been the slightest objection to such immigrants; but I think honourable members on all sides object strongly to attempts to lower the standard of living in Australia by the introduction of races of a lower type. I understand that, although frequent reference has been made during the debate to the Immigration Restriction Act of the United States, no specific reference has been made to its sections. The House maybe interested to learn how stringent they are as compared with those of the Commonwealth Act. In 1885 the United States passed their first law on the subject. It is to be found in the volume for the 48th Congress, 2nd session, chapter 164. In the second section it is set forth"" that ali contracts, whether expressed or implied, made between any company or person, and any foreigner, to perform labour or service in the United State, before that foreigner enterte the States, 'are jutterly void.i and of no effect.",69
491,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Foreigner , not citizen of the United States!",69
492,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I shall deal with that point; I am now merely giving the section as it stands. Honourable members will see that it contains no exception, such as our law does, in regard to specially skilled labour. Every one under contract who is a foreigner is excluded'. No doubt honourable members think that they have scored a point against my position, by pointing out that the United States laws exclude aliens only, but it must be remembered that that country has not a world-wide Empire, such as that of Great Britain, and that all the citizens of the United States subscribe to the same standards of comfort and of living. They are all of one grade. The United States does not control an empire comprising black people,, yellow people, and people of all. shades of colour, 1 and all conditions of life. But now that that country has taken possession of the Philippines and Hawaii, I shall wait with interest to see whether, if immigration of coloured persons takes place from those possessions to America., Congress will not pass laws to restrict it.",69
493,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Bill before us deals with white people only.,69
494,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"The distinction which honourable members have attempted to draw between our legislation and that of the United States is a distinction without a difference. I admit that the United States legislation excludes aliens only, but,,, on the other hand, we exclude only, such membets of the Empire as do not subscribe to the same standards of living as our own. The United States Act of 1885 imposes a penalty on masters of vessels bringing persons (Under contract to that country. Section 8 of the Act of 1887-49t h Congress, Act 220-provide s that all persons included in the prohibition shall, upon arrival, pe sent back to the countries to which they belong, and whence they came. Then the Act of 1891-51s t Congress, 2nd session,. Act 551-exclude s all idiots and insane persons; all paupers or persons likely to become a public charge; all persons suffering from a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease; all persons who have been convicted of, felony, or any infamous crime or misdemeanour involving moral turpitude; and persons whose ticket or passage money has been paid for by another, or who have been assisted by others to come to America, unless it is shown, on special, inquiry, that they do not belong to any of the four classes first mentioned, or to the class of contract labourers excluded by the Act of 1885. That Act also provides for the inspection of immigrants on landing, and makes it penal to advertise for immigrants in England or any other country. The only thing which a steamship company can do is to advertise its sailing arrangements. There are also traordinary powers of inspection and medical examination,, while aliens brought to the States must, if practicable, be sent back by the vessels by which they came, the cost of their maintenance on land, as well as the expense of their return, being borne by the owner or owners of the vessels by which they came. The Act also imposes penalties on masters and shipowners who infringe it.",69
495,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,The exclusion is not even limited to manual labour.,70
496,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"That is so, and I remember that about dfoujrteen years ago, when a minister was imported from England for Broadway Church, New York,,! it was objected that he came under contract, and an injunction was obtained to prevent him from remaining. Fortunately' for the church, I suppose the Supreme Court reversed the judgment, holding that the Act applied to manual labourers only, and did not cover ministers of religion. As a consequence, the Act of 1891 was passed, which removes disabilities from ministers of religion and professional men generally. A curious effect of the American law is that it has made England the dumping ground for the worse fed, most diseased, and lowest classes of immigrants from Eastern Europe. The steamers which carry immigrants to America from Eastern Europe have an inspection of their passengers made at Southampton, and leave there any who are likely - to be rejected in New York, with the result that the most unfit are stranded,, and have to flock tb London, or to some other large centre, to get their living as best they may. Consequently England is beginning to feel the importance of putting a stop to this practice, and during the present year the British Parliament has been engaged in considering a measure which is intended to have that! effect.",70
497,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,It has been passed.,70
498,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I believe that it has been passed, at all events in a mangled form. Although that country has always been generous in receiving refugees from other countries, and has been the home of the oppressed, her people now see the need for drawing to the door, and saying to certain classes, ""We cannot admit you."" Our legislation contains no extraordinary or unprecedented provisions. The only distinction between it and that of America is ex- that we do not draw a line between aliens 1 and British subjects, and our reason for not doing so is that there are undesirable British subjecTs, just as there are undesirable aliens, whereas the United States have no undesirable citizens, all its subjects subscribing to the same standard of living. A relative of mine received a letter' from London this week,, in which a lady who takes an interest in matters' of this kind expresses a strong wish that Australia will not accept General Booth's offer of immigrants. She says that , having made in1 quiries, she has found that none but persons of the criminal or extremely degenerate classes are to be sent out. I do not know how far we can rely on statements made upon private authority of that sort, but I know that my informant would give the best information available to her. Although this is a small Bill, it opens up a tremendous range of subjects, and touches the most vital problems of Australian development. Therefore I feel that you, Mr. Speaker, Have exercised your wise discretion in allowing honourable members to roam a little further afield than would ordinarily be permitted if the question were a mere alteration of legislative machinery.",70
499,Mr KELLY,Unknown," The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne opened his excellent speech with the well-known but rather quaint phrase "" that! the mountain has been in labour, and has brought forth a mouse,"" but, having listened intently to his valuable contribution to the debate, I think that the phrase might be amended to read that the mountain has erupted, and sent down on the thirsty earth- a shower of ashes.",71
500,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The honourable member's simile is a little mixed. - Mr KELLY - In that; case it should suit tire honourable member. I do not think that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has made the posftion any clearer. He spoke of American precedents, and,, when asked if America has passed laws excluding her own subjects, informed us that the TJnited States does not possess a world-wide Empire like that of Great Britain, and therefore has no need to exclude her own subjects. But, with singular disingenuousness for one who has apparently studied the immigra-. tion laws of all countries.,, he omitted to tell us of the immigration law of Canada, which expressliy excepts the subjects of the Empire, of which Canada, as well .as Australia, forms a part. An honourable and learned gentleman who, having full public knowledge at his disposal, supplemented by excellent private intelligence, puts only half the truth before us",71
501,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,There is always some mean insinuation from the honourable member.,71
502,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What have I insinuated,71
503,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,That I withheld from the House something I knew.,71
504,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does not the honourable them against excessive immigration. and learned member know the Canadian Australia law?,71
505,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I shall not answer any more of the honourable member's questions, though I will tell the House that I da not know it .",71
506,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Then I regret that an honourable and learned member who possesses so much information on every subject should have risen to address the House on a question of such vital importance to Australia without looking up the greatest prebe cedent of all. Is that the manner in which transportation, he usually prepares himself for the courage speeches which he makes here? If i have done him an injustice in concluding that he must have known of that precedent.",71
507,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,The honourable member ought to learn some manners.,71
508,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have often been told that I had better do a number of things which have nothing whatever to do with the debate. The honourable and learned member told us that we must'be loyal to Australia - as if any honourable member was not loyal, without any injunction from the honourable and learned member.",71
509,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Those who traduce the country are not loyal to Australia.,71
510,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I hope that the honourable member is not referring to the secretary of the Labour Council, Sydney, who sent that extraordinary letter to England?",71
511,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I am referring to the fhembers of the Opposition.,71
512,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne invited us to concern ourselves only with the question as to how this proposed legislation would affect our own people, and not to consider how it might be regarded at the other end of the world. This suggestion comes with singularly bad grace from the honourable and learned member, who introduced and fought in this House a motion absolutely foreign to the spirit or the concerns, of the people of Australia. I should like to remind the honourable and learned member that possibly there might be reasons- I hesitate, because of the ; umbrage which he took when I previously attributed knowledge to him to say that he must know of these reasons-wh y the over-crowded millions of England ? and America should consider that their countries were already full , and why s,tringent laws should be enacted by In these reasons do not exist. Every section of the public regards a bigger population as essential to our future well-being. The deputy leader of the Opposition has just handed to me the Canadian Act, which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne overlooked in the course of his laborious investigations. This Act was assented to on the 29th June, 1897, and section 1 reads as follows:From and after the passing of this Act it shall unlawful for any person, company, partnership, or corporation, in any manner to prepay the or in any"" way to assist or enthe importation or immigration of any t is, I alien or foreigner into Canadaa British subject is not an alien or foreigner in Canadaunder contract or agreement parole or special express or implied made previous to the importation or immigration of such alien or foreigner to perform labour or service of any kind in ""Canada. No mention is made of the subjects of the King. The Act expressly excludes aliens ancl foreigners under contract, and none other ! Section 9 reads as follows :This Act shall apply only to such foreign countries as have enacted and retained in force - or as enact and retain in force laws or ordinances applying to Canada of a character similar to this Act. Therefore, even so far as foreign and alien immigration is concerned, the Dominion is open to treat with foreign countries.",71
513,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Does the honourable member favour the adoption of similar measures in Australia?,72
514,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes , with the one safeguard that no importation shall be made at strike time with a view to assisting in industrial disputes, and that no contract shall be binding if it be based upon rates of pay lower than those which obtain in Australia. I would submit one other piece of information to my industrious honourable friend. On Wednesday, the 20th September",72
515,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. After the way in which the honourable member has spoken of me at an earlier stage of his speech., may I , through you, sir, request that he should not address me as his ""honourable friend""?",72
516,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I assure the honourable and learned member that if he prefers it I shall not do it ; but I still shall think it , and, indeed, he will also think it tomorrow. On the date mentioned, the honourable and learned member for Wannon asked a question on this very subject, and I think one might, therefore, have reasonably expected an honourable member to become acquainted with the position of affairs of which the honourable and learned gentleman now pleads being so innocent.",72
517,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The second reading of the Bill , and not the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, is uncler discussion.",72
518,Mr KELLY,Unknown,If I am out of order,72
519,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am not ruling the honourable member out of order, but I am suggesting that as the conduct of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is not in question, it would be better to confine the discussion to the motion for the second reading of the Bill .",72
520,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I had intended to read the questions of the honourable and learned member for Wannon, and the answers supplied thereto; but perhaps it will be sufficient if I content myself with mentioning the date and their subject-matter, so that honourable members may refer to them if they so desire. I do not wish to any longer irritate the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. The importance of the great question upon which this Bill has a bearing cannot be under-estimated in view of the fact that every party in this House puts immigration in the forefront of its platform. The Prime Minister has assured us that population is the very foundation-stone upon which we must base all our calculations for security of defence and for material advancement. During the last year we have heard throughout the country-eve n from members of the Government-indictment s of the Act which it is now sought to amend.",72
521,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,B y whom ?,72
522,Mr KELLY,Unknown,B y the Treasurer.,72
523,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Would the honourable member read his statements?,72
524,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"They are so voluminous and scathing that I hesitate to inflict them upon honourable members. The contract labour provisions of the Immigration Act have been condemned all over Australia, because, according to the members of the Labour Party, the people of England have misconstrued their innocent intention. This Bill is given to us as an earnest of the determination of the Government to allay the irritation that has been excited in the mother country by paragraph g of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901. Although I am supremely disappointed with the measure, I do not propose to question at this stage the bona fides of the Government in bringing it forward. We were told that it was intended to convey a more statesman-like expression of our unalterable determination, to safeguard the workers of Australia in the direction I have indicated. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, in the hope that when honourable members on this side of the Chamber have explained the reasons for the serious fears they entertain in regard to the Government proposals, the Prime Minister will see his way to amend it. If that course be adopted. I think the Bill will confer inestimable benefit upon the Commonwealth. If that is not done, I shall be forced to conclude that there has been some back-sliding from platform utterances on the part of my honourable friends on the Government side of the House. What all honourable members say they want to do is to prevent labour from being introduced here at times of industrial strife, or at wages, lower than those prevailing in Australia. That is a proposition which we all support, and I would suggest that honourable members opposite should not be suspicious of others when they suggest amendments. We all have the same end in view. The proposal which I favour is that any body of Anglo-Saxon workers should be encouraged to come here so long as they are not bound by a contract of less than the current rate of and are not introduced for the purpose of influencing an industrial dispute. If they do interfere with the industrial conditions obtaining here in the way I have suggested, the Bill should confer power to void their contracts. Would any employer be foolish enough to pay the passages of a number of men from the old country if he knew that upon their arrival, there was a simple method by which his hold upon them could be annulled?",72
525,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"That idea is good in theory, but it does not work out in practice.",73
526,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Has it ever been tried?,73
527,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Most decidedly.,73
528,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Where ?,73
529,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,In Victoria.,73
530,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"B y adopting a provision such as I have outlined we should avoid the imputation that we wish to exclude members of our own race, by whose protection we enjoy whatever measure of prosperity we may possess today. To my mind this Bill throws additional difficulties in the way of desirable immigrants. The principal Act which it is sought to amend prohibits the admission of any immigrant under contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth, but contains a proviso that the Act shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Prime Minister for special skill required in Australia. What does this Bill propose? It provides that the only immigrants who shall be admitted under contract are those whose contracts have been approved by the Minister. The latter ""shall, approve of the terms of the contracts only,"" if , "" in his opinion,"" they have not been made "" in contemplation of or with a view to affecting an industrial dispute,"" and if a difficulty is experienced by the employer in obtaining within the Commonwealth ""a worker of at least equal skill and ability."" It also provides for a number of other essentials. Everything is left to "" the opinion of the Minister '' just as it is in the principal Act, and therefore I fail to see how it will effect an improvement in the existing law. What chance has the Minister of ascertaining whether the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment under which immigrants have contracted are as advantageous to them as those current in Australia are to the workers who are already, here ? The proposition is unworkable upon the face of it, and, as the honourable member for wages, Moira has said, must be amended in Committee. I think it is clear to every honourable member that any such proposition, if adopted, will only bring ridicule upon us. Not only does the Bill make it more difficult for a contract labourer to gain admission to Australia, but the Government inferentially seek to frighten him away after he has been admitted. It provides that if before the Minister approves of the terms of any contract the contract-immigrant lands in Australia, a number of things must happen. Amongst other things, it declaresThe employer shall pay to the contract-immigrant such specified sum of money (not exceeding £$0) as the Minister thinks sufficient, either to maintain the contract-immigrant until he can be reasonably expected to find suitable employment- v 1 I do not object to a word of that provision so far. But I do object to what follows, namelyor at the option of the contract-immigrant to enable him to return to the country whence he came. I maintain that that is almost an invitation to him to return to the country whence he came.,i because if the monev be available the immigrant can return home if he wishes, without this express indication of his powers. I should! also ' like to direct attention to the parallel which it seeks to establish between the treatment which is meted out to British subjects and that which is accorded to Chinamen. The Bill providesThe foregoing provisions of this section do not apply where the contract-immigrant(*) lands under a bond to the Commonwealth in such sum, with such sureties, conditioned to be void in such events as the Minister approves. Surely that i's treating members of our own race in the same way that we treat a Chinaman. In other words, we are asked to sanction the imposition of a poll-tax upon any Britisher who lands in Australia without the consent of the Minister of Trade and Customs. As we all recognise that insidious political influences may easily bs brought to operate upon the mind of a Minister it is clear that this provision will work out in the same way that a similar provision properly does in regard to the admission of Chinese. But, in. the case of the Chinese, we have a definite reason for our action. We.wish to maintain our racial purity. But will our race suffer by reason of an influx of our kith and kin from oversea? The Prime Minister has rather ingenuously stated that we can do nothing to attract immigration until a drastic change has been effected in the land tenure of Australia. He told us-and he seemed to take considerable credit to himself for his action - that he had made an offer to the six States to assist immigration to them if they would, each and all, agree to amend their land laws in the way that he thought deshjable. Surely lie must have had his tongue in his cheek when he made that suggestion. It is not our duty to concern ourselves with the faults of the Governments of the Australian States. They are independent Governments, and can well be trusted to look after themselves. But we ourselves have a duty to perform to the people of Australia - the duty of placing no additional barriers in the way of desirable immigrants to this country, and we should set our own, house in order 1 before we indite the housekeeping of our neighbours. The Prime Minister admits that in Western Australia there is an unlimited area available, whicE is suitable for intending immigrants. If the doorswere thrown open wide, and if immigration were permitted to flow into Australia unrestricted, where would it go? Undoubtedly the bulk of it would go to that State in which the land tenure is upon the most equitable basis. If the Prime Minister does throw open the doors, it means that immigrants from England will go to Western Australia., and will continue to do so until the other States wake up and amend their land laws. Surely, if we wish to secure the amendment of those laws, the best way to accomplish our object is to admit immigrants wholesale. That would necessitate those States with bad land legislation taking action in the direction of placing it upon a level with the land legislation of other States. In conclusion, I wish to restate the fact, that, although I am in favour of the second reading of this Bill , I shall do all that I can in Committee to so amend it as to make it a useful piece of legislation. I am firmly convinced that if it passes in its present form, the people of Australia must necessarily conclude that some arrangement has been made between the two parties opposite with regard to its provisions. I do not trust the bona fides-and I make this statement in no invidious sense-of honourable members in the Ministerial corner with regard to the provisions of this Bill . I have seen them on all occasions supporting anything that is popular, as immigration is popular, in the country. I have seen them in the country supporting anything dealing with the Imperial connection, as immigration deals with the Imperial connection; but whenever they are asked to do anything in this House to further such proposals, they declare that it is not the proposal itself, but the method of carrying it out which they dislike. If these honourable members force the Government to pass the Bill in its present form, the country cannot fail to come to the conclusion that they are as definitely opposed to immigration as they have recently shown themselves opposed to other things which stand for the Imperial connection. Their votes on this question will be added to others until the people begin to understand them almost as well as does the House. I do not wish to say more at the present juncture;, but I hope that the Ministry will prove their bona fides in regard to this Bill , and show that, so far as this, one of the most important planks in their platform, is concerned, they can be true to their election pledges.",73
531,Mr MAUGER,Unknown," I recognise fully the value of time, and am not going to detain the House at very great length. I feel, however, that a word or two should be said in reply to some of the remarks made by the two honourable members who have - immediately preceded me. In the first place, it seems to me that the question of contract labour, irrespective altogether of the measure in which it may be dealt with,, is entirely misunderstood; that the fact that it is a menace to the workers of any community, whether it be that of America, Canada, or Australia, is not recognised, or, if it is, that it is not appreciated. It is urged that the introduction of contract labour should be prohibited only during the currency of a strike or lock-out. But experience shows that contract labour is in any circumstances a menace to the workers where it is introduced. Let me give an illustration. The celebrated six hatters who came here under contract weregiven a guarantee of employment, not only during the currency of their contract, but until their employer had been reimbursed the expenses incurred by him in bringing them here. The hat trade is a season trade. Only a certain number of men can be employed for a given number of months. What was the result of this arrangement? Although those men were to receive, the wage that was being paid to hatters already here, they received a considerable preference in the way of employment. two-thirds of their fellow-journeymen were walking the streets in search of work, they were fully employed because of the terms of the contract and the fact that their employer had to be reimbursed the expenses to which he had.been put. I know of another case in which half-a-dozen men were brought out under contract by a leading manufacturer in Melbourne, who was then employing fifteen men. The employer put forth every effort to keep those six men in constant employment during the whole term of their engagement, and the other fifteen men were employed for only six months in the year. The latter did not object to the introduction of the men from abroad. They were prepared to welcome them, but what they said, and rightly said, was that they should take their share, and only their share, of the work offering; that they should not, on account of an agreement, be constantly employed whilst their fellow-workmen' were walking the streets, and in some instances most starving. I know of a jeweller who, anticipating trouble, although a. strike had taken place, made arrangements to introduce labour under contract. The relationships between employer and employee"" were apparently most cordial. There was no suggestion of a lock-out; but one of the leading spirits in the workshop proposed that a union be formed. The employer dreaded the formation of a trade union. He took up the position that he could manage his own business, and that no one had a right to interfere with it. As soon as the proposal for the formation of a union was made he entered into correspondence with Mr Mauger. some persons in England, with the result that eighteen men were imported under contract, and displaced the founder of the union and the others who had joined with him. The men introduced under contract were given a preference until their agreement had been completed.",74
532,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,And in the meantime the men displaced competed with other labourers for any work that was going.,75
533,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Ha d they come out as free men-ha d they understood the condifions under which they were coming hereI believe that they would have been welcomed by every working man, although their coming here meant a reduction in the volume of work to be performed. But when they came here to be a menace to When other workmen, it was recognised that the employer was giving them an unfair advantage.",75
534,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Coul d not the difficulty have been met by declaring the contract void ?,75
535,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"That would not have met the trouble. The jewellers were met at Port Melbourne pier, and agreed to attempt to break their contract. But they were face to face with the hard fact that they were in a new land, that their families were following them, and that they had no prospect of securing employment unless they complied with the contract which they had signed at Home. They had either to ratify that contract or be thrown out of employment, with no hope of securing work. The voiding of contracts would not overcome the difficulty. The only way to attract population and workers here is to provide fair conditions of' employment and plenty of work. If that be done, it will attract immigrants just as a al- magnet attracts steel. Contract labour is objectionable under almost any circumnot stances. I can conceive of some cases where it may possibly be legitimate; but in all ordinary circumstances, the introduction of contract labour, either during the existence of an industrial dispute, in anticipation of one, or for the purpose of punishing those who form unions or agitate for Wages Boards is highly undesirable. I might mention the case of some skilful women engaged in a trade in Victoria who were displaced by the importation of workers from another State, because they had dared to form a union in connection with the Wagesi Board.",75
536,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,In what trade did .that occur ?,75
537,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I shall tell the honour the able member privately; I have a reason for not naming the trade at this juncture. I can assure the House that my connection with industrial affairs in Melbourne, which extends over rwenty years, has invariably borne out the truism that labour under contract is a menace to unionism, and a menace to our existing standard of wages. It gives to the already powerful employer an additional instrument of protection, and is of no benefit to the communityI f there be more than sufficient work for the workers in any part of. Australia, that fact alone will attract men from other parts of the world.",76
538,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Jus t as men went from the eastern States to Western Australia.,76
539,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"And from other countries, in such circumstances. People write to their friends in other parts of the world, stating that there industry is particularly busy, and that there is plenty of scope for workers. The result is that a dearth of labour does not last long under present industrial conditions in any part of the world.",76
540,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,What would the honourable member have done with the eighteen jewellers when they landed here?,76
541,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I should not have sent them back. I should be prepared to endure a great deal rather than deal in that way with my fellow-British subjects; but I would imake it illegal to introduce contract labour here under any conditions or circumstances. The contract system is unfair to the men, who, knowing nothing about our conditions, sign agreements to work here, whilst it is unjust to the men already in Australia. I should not dream"" of sending back men so. introduced, but we should not allow workers to be brought here unless they are free to comply with our conditions of labour and to take their share, and only their share, of the work which is offering. It has been urged that the Trades Hall Council of Sydney has wronged the Commonwealth by telling the workers of England that it is inadvisable for any of them to come to Australia under our present industrial conditions. I fai l to see where the disloyalty comes in ; I fail to see that to state a fact regarding any country is to traduce that country. No honourable member acquainted with our industrial conditions could conscientiously write to men and women in other parts of the world and advise them to come to Australia in search of employment. I am assured by one of senators representing New South Wales that he knows of no district in that State where 500 families could be settled on land which is not at present alienated.",76
542,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,The position is worse in Victoria.,76
543,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,We know that at the present time there is no opportunity whatever for. the settlement of immigrants in Victoria. Our leading newspapers are pointing out that a Compulsory Land Purchase Act is an urgent necessity; that our so-called local settlement policy is not sufficient to satisfy our present needs. It has been said that opportunity is offered for settlement here. Under what iconditions? It is notorious that in the Western District of Victoria grazing and agricultural land is being boomed to as great an extent as were city lands in the boom days of a few years ago.,76
544,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Owing to the action of the State Government.,76
545,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Because Crown lands are not available to those who. wish to settle.,76
546,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,And the Government are expected to buy the estates at boom prices.,76
547,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"At the prices offering. Could any honourable member conscientiously write to a friend in England, "".Come to Australia. There is plenty of work. Our factories are well filled, and our farmers are in want of hands."" On the contrary, if we told the truth, we should have to say to our friends at home that our land laws are such that land is not available for settlement, and that in our iron trade ancl various other industries there are hundreds of men working only halftime, while others are.walking the streets.",76
548,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I have heard nothing worse from the Opposition.,76
549,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"These are facts. The difference between the statements which I am making and those of the producers of Australia is that what I am saying is true, while they misrepresent our laws, and say what is grossly unf air and unjust about our conditions. When I was on a voyage to Western Australia in January last with the Old-Age Pensions Commission, I met on the mail boat the manager of a bank in Jersey,- who is evidently a prominent commercial man in the Channel Islands. He assured me that he left Sydney under the belief-whic h was removed only by my statement that it was absolutely incorrect-that the loafers in the Domain there could not be employed by the farmers or pastoralists of New South Wales for less than 7s. 6d. a day; that it would be illegal to offer them less,, because that the minimum wage fixed by the law of the State. He was going home with the intention of placing that position of affairs fore the people of England as one of the effects of our labour laws.",76
550,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Was he pulling the honourable member's leg?,77
551,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that similar misrepresentations have been frequent, and that no less a person than the Rev. Dr Fitchett has misrepresented our laws, and done no end of mischief by the statements which he has published in the press and from the platform.",77
552,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Has not the honourable member himself just said that our land laws are wicked?,77
553,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have dealt with facts. This bank manager was also going to England under the impression that the old and slow are being thrust out of our factories by our Wages Boards,' and that it is impossible for youths to be apprenticed in any industrial occupation. Such wrong impressions do us an immense amount of harm.",77
554,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I would not relate such tommy-rot.,77
555,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"This tommy-rot is rehashed, and served up in newspapers all over Great Britain, and does us an untold amount of harm. Had the real position of affairs been stated in the English press, a;, it might have been by leading Australians abroad, a different impression in regard to Australia would exist in the minds of the English, people. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that) the action which the Government are taking by introducing this measure is unnecessary, and that it would have been better to publish as broadly as possible throughout the old country the effects of our legislation. The only good that I can see is likely to result from the passing of the Bill is that our law relating to contract labour will' therein be set out and elaborated separately from our law relating to the immigration of aliens.",77
556,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is that the honourable member's only reason for voting for the BiM ?,77
557,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Yes .,77
558,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is a very poor one.,77
559,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member is at liberty to express his opinion on the subject. I think that the effect of the was measure will be to remove a good deal of misunderstanding, and to prevent misrepresentation. I have in my hand a copy of be- an excellent speech recently delivered by the Chief Justice of Victoria in regard to the progress of Australia. In it he shows the great recuperative powers of this country, and it would be better to publish such speeches broadcast throughout Great Britain than to decry our own legislation.",77
560,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Especiall y our land legislation, as the honourable member has done.",77
561,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am sorry that the honourable member is so fond of sneering at those of more experience than himself. I tell him, in all kindliness, that he does himself and his cause no good by such remarks, which create an irritation displeasing to even' right-thinking man in the House.",77
562,Mr KELLV,Unknown,"Why this vicious, attack?",77
563,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It is not a vicious attack. The honourable member's remarks do not assist the cause which he supports. I believe that the Bill will help to remove misrepresentation, and to place before the people of England a true expression of our intention, which is not to prevent the immigration of British subjects, but to prevent the introduction of labour under contract. A return recently laid on the table of the Senate shows differences between the wages paid to iron-workers and others engaged in agricultural implement works in Great Britain and the wages paid to similar workmen in Victoria, as great as 25s. and 27s. 6d. a week, the Victorian workers getting so much more than their English fellows,.",77
564,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Any labourers imported under contract would have to be paid current rates of wages.,77
565,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Workme n in England real would readily accept ^3 a week to come to Australia if they were not informed of all the conditions and circumstances surrounding employment here.,77
566,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Unde r my proposal, if they had been, deceived, they could at once go to the Police Court, and have an unfair contract amended.",77
567,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I do not think that that would help them. I am as anxious as is the deputy leader of the Opposition, or any other member of the House, to make ft known in all parts of the Empire that we are prepared to receive free white labour in as large numbers as like to come here.",77
568,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And we, on this side of the House, are as desirous as is the honourable member to maintain good rates of wages and proper industrial conditions.",78
569,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No doubt honourable members are; I have never disputed the fact. Speaking from personal experience, however, I say that, unless, labour comes out here absolutely free, it will be used to reduce wages, to lengthen hours, and to make the conditions of employment more irksome in other ways. Contract labour will always be used to punish those who organize trade unions and try to better the lot of the workers.",78
570,Mr WILKS,Unknown," The Bill has been spoken of as a non-contentious measure, but, although I have listened to all the speeches which have been made upon it today, I have not heard two honourable members, agree in regard to its provisions. If that proves it to be a non-contentious measure, I say, "" From any further legislation of this character, good Mr Speaker, deliver us."" I take it that the Ministry feel compelled to try to allay the irritation has been caused at the other end of the world by our existing laws, and have, therefore introduced the Bill. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports indulged in croaking and calamity howling about Australia. He spoke of things, being in such a bad way here that the introduction of contract labour would be a menace to our welfare, and suggested that the Commonwealth should be regarded as a close preserve; but he concluded his remarks by complimenting the Chief Justice of Victoria on a speech in which the great recuperative powers of our industries were highly praised. I do not think that calamity howling and croaking will benefit the country, nor am I of opinion that Australia should be made a close preserve. I do not agree with those who think that our present population is sufficient for the hundreds of lions of acres which the continent contains. It is difficult to understand why honourable members should object to the introduction here of labour brought out under contracts stipulating that the rates of pay and conditions, prevailing here shall be enjoyed. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is a strong protectionist, and believes in local manufactures, I ask him, in the words of a locally-manufactured poem of the Australian poet Gordon, "" What is the tale you are telling; what is the drift of your lay?"" Is he opposed-to contract labour coming here at any time? I understand that the Bill makes no distinction between Britishers and aliens.",78
571,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Would the honourable member support an amendment prohibiting the introduction of foreigners under contract?,78
572,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I will deal with that question at the right time. Although the honourable member for Melbourne Ports regards it as a menace to Australian interests that persons should be brought here under contract, I take the opposite view. He seems to think that the men who drift here on the mere chance of getting employment form the best class of immigrants; but, in my opinion, those who come under contract are a more desirable class. The fact that they have insisted, before leaving their work in England, and journeying over 13,000 miles of ocean, on obtaining a contract guaranteeing them employment in this country, shows them to be men of caution and balance. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that he would like to see labourers invited here by their fellowwhich industrials already in the country. But we are not all children. We know that the Australian worker does not extend anv general invitation to his fellows in England to come out here and compete with him, but he merely asks some old friend or relative to join him here. We cannot rely upon our population being augmented to any extent by such means. It is a very bad thing for Australia that our population should have become practically stationary. Protectionist members must see that the introduction of thousands of people from abroad would increase the number of consumers of local products, and thus help to build up our native industries. I thoroughly agree with the proposal to penalize people who may bring workers out here with a view to reducing wages or lowering the standard of living in Ausmil- tralia. We should not, however, place any obstacles in the way of men who desire to join us in building up the nation. I do not approve of the introduction of anvthing in the nature of a passport system, such"" as appears to be contemplated by the Bill.",78
573,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,What is the matter with the passport system ? The honourable member would_ find an English passport very useful to him if he were travelling.,78
574,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"W c have no need of any such system in Australia, or anywhere else in the British Empire. Although we are told by the Prime Minister that it is intended to clearly define our intentions with regard to restricting immigrants, and to allay the irritation that has been excited in the old world, it seems to me that the proposed legislation will have the opposite effect. The members of the Opposition do not desire that any opportunity should be afforded for the introduction of undesirable immigrants, but they think that the meaning of the Legislature should be clearly pressed, and that the Minister should not have power to entirely abrogate the provisions of the Act in the manner proposed. We are prepared to take up the same position that we assumed when the Act was passed in 1901, but we cannot go to the le'.ngth of permitting the Minister to be the sole arbiter as to the class of labour that it is necessary to introduce in order to carry on our industries to the greatest advantage. It would be absurd to place the Minister in the position contemplated by the Bill . He would have to look to interested persons for information to guide him to a conclusion. He would have to apply to members of the unions, who would like to make our industries a close preserve for themselves. The Minister would be called upon to consider a number of questions besides skill. A man might be a skilful artisan, but in other respects an undesirable citizen, and the Minister could not be expected to enter upon the inquiry that would be necessary to enable him to arrive! at a just conclusion. I trust that paragraph b, subclause 2. clause 5, which relates to this matter, will be struck out. No one wishes to see the wages or standard of living of our workers reduced, but the sooner we abandon the idea of making Australia a close preserve for those who happen to be here, the better it will be for all concerned. In all walks of life, an increase in the number of workers, instead of throwing men out of work, always has a tendency to widen the avenues of employment. Everything I say with regard to the introduction of immigrants is subiect to the condition that they are of a desirable class. Skill alone is not a sufficient recommendation. Criminals are skilled men, and very often brainy men, but they would not be desirable immigrants. A New Caledonian recidivists, for example, would not be welcomed here. Some honourable members seem to think that, if workmen were introduced here under contract in"" any numbers, they would prove a menace to our artisans; but I think that the man who comes here as a free immigrant, without any assurance that fie will obtain employment, is likely to prove a still greater menace. I would ask the Prime Minister to agree to any amendment that will have the effect of making it clear that we do not place Britishers upon the same footing as aliens and foreigners. I say emphatically that at all times we should be ready to admit desirable immiex- grants from among our fellow-subjects in Great Britain, and that we should not refuse to accept them merely because they come out here under contract. I understand that members of the Labour Party fear that the introduction of contract immigrants would have a prejudicial effect upon the workers in the industries in which they were engaged after their contracts had expired. That difficulty, however, could be easily overcome. The workers in most of our industries have powerful unions, and they could encourage the newcomers to join .their organizations, and thus guard against any reduction of wages in the future. The man who looks beyond a little bit ahead of him, and insures employment for himself before he starts from the old country, is of the class that we want in Australia. I believe that Victoria profited greatly in the early days from the introduction of a very desirable class of Scotch immigrants, and New Zealand certainly owes much of her progress to a similar class of settlers, who were attracted to her shores many years ago. We want to add to that element in our own population, and I would remove' all obstacles in the way of immigration except such as are designed to exclude undesirables.",79
575,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown," I have listened attentively to most of the speakers who have addressed themselves to this subject, and more particularly to members of the Opposition. I must confess that I cannot understand the necessity for all the discussion in which the latter have indulged. Almost the whole of them have practical! v stated that they favour everything which is proposed in this Bill . They have declared that Ihe existing law requires amendment to prevent our own kith and kin from being excluded from the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Dalley told us that he is opposed to making Australia a close preserve, but he also said that he is against lowering the standard of wages or the conditions of employment which obtain here today. The addresses of honourable members opposite have been chiefly characterized by a desire to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. The speech which the deputy leader of the Opposition delivered this morning was a remarkable instance of that. Other honourable members opposite have merely echoed what he said. In grandiloquent language, he declared this morning that the Bil l is a sham and a farce. It is significant, however, that he neglected to show in what respect it was a sham and a farce. He spoke about excluding our own kith and kin, and affirmed that the Commonwealth should be open to all white persons who care to enter it. He chided the Prime Minister with not having done as much as he might have accomplished in the direction of encouraging immigration. I contend that in offering to contribute towards bringing desirable immigrants, for whomwork is waiting upon arrival, the honourable and learned gentleman has done everything in his power. He has asked the States Governments to do that which they should do in their own interests, in the absence of any invitation from him. He has asked them to endeavour to make available to the people the land which has been so largely monopolized by speculators. All that is needed to insure the flow of population to our shores is a guarantee that immigrants can obtain employment upon their arrival. Only the other clay, one applicant for a block of land in New South Wales intimated that during thirteen years he had attended twelve ballots, but that he had been unsuccessful. The same thing occurred to many citizens of that State during the past twelve years. Until the States offer opportunities to men to settle here, we cannot develop the lands of the country or extend„those industries which are dependent upon our primary productions.",79
576,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The member could not have heard what I said this morning. Mr WEBSTERI did hear what the honourable member said, and I also noted the statements of the honourable member for Wentworth. I will undertake to say that the latter knows nothing whatever about the land laws of New South Wales, and very little about any land laws.",80
577,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I have never travelled upon the floor of a railwaycarriage in my life.,80
578,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"That remark is worthj of the honourable member. That he can make such an observation when we are engaged in the discussion of a great public question indicates the smallness of his mind. If*is a characteristic of the honourable member that he is as small of mind as he is of stature. He stated that we should admit immigrants wholesale, in order to force the States to amend their land laws. Such a statement betrays a most hopeless condition of ignorance. Why does he want immigrants admitted wholesale ? In the interests of that class of employers, who are always anxious to secure an over-crowded labour market. They would naturally like to see the country swamped with immigrants so that the workers might be brought to heel, and forced to labour for longer hours and for lower wages. If we require any illustration of what is necessary to make a country prosperous, we have only to turn out our eyes to New Zealand. Therie' it has been demonstrated by Mr Sedd'on, who is now, in effect, declared to be the perpetual Prime Minister of that Colony, that the secret is to be found in the imposition of a progressive land tax, which will have the effect of bursting up the large estates. That is the only way in which we can increase the population of Australia.. If we wish to restore prosperity to the country, we shall best accomplish our object by giving effect to the reforms which have conferred so much benefit upon New Zealand. To-night the honourable member for Melbourne Ports made some references to the compulsory purchase of. land. In all the States today we find that the Governments are attempting to devise some means by which to restore has to the people the lands which have been alienated by the Crown. There was never a more charming lot of hypocrites anywhere than those who at present occupy responsible positions in the various States. In New South Wales recently we have had an example of the influences which have been at work in connection with the resumption honourable of the Myall Creek Estate, and in Victoria the same forces are operative. Why do not the States, Governments submit proposals for a system of land taxation, making the valuations of the owners the basis upon which estates shall be resumed. Then the people would be able to secure blocks at a reasonable rental. I have no more to siay as to. the fallacious arguments of honourable members opposite who are so evidently opposed to all legislation of this character. The honourable member for Wentworth imitating, as he usually does, other members of the Opposition, declared that he was in favour of the Canadian system, but that he was opposed to the introduction of workers under contract to undermine the position of strikers during the currency of an industrial dispute. He added that he was against anything which would lead to a reduction in the ruling rates of wages here. The Bill does not go further than that. . Mr KELLY - It certainly does.",80
579,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Wit h the exception of the provisions relating to contract labour, it consists simply of an interpretation of the existing Act. ' Disputes have arisen as to the intention of the Act, and I am not surprised that the Opposition should object to the introduction of this measure, since it deprive them of that which has been one of their most serviceable war-cries. They have referred time and again to the case of the six hatters and the six potters, with a view to bolstering up their own politicalviews. But with the definition given in this Bill of the administrative powers of the Minister, all cause for complaint will pass away. The Opposition will not be able to condemn the Minister for doing that which I trust the Parliament will empower him to do. Once we pass this Bill, they will have to blame not the Minister, but the Parliament. They fear that with the passing of this measure their favourite occupation-that of denouncing the administration of the contract labour provisions of the existing Act-wil l disappear.",81
580,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member believe this Bill is necessary?,81
581,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable memit. ber sought to make some capital out of the memorandum from the Agents-General reof garding the impressions which the people of the truth. Great Britain have formed concerning our immigration laws. He declared that these gentlemen were beyond reproach.,81
582,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I know that some of them are. Mf. WEBSTER - I am not suggesting Agents-General. that they are not. But they are the servants of the States, and it seems that the Commonwealth has becomelatterly the butt of every prominent State politician. impossible to take up a newspaper without finding in it a report of an attack made a State Premier or a prominent member one of the States Parliaments upon the business capacity of this Legislature. Whilst the Agents-General may be able to interpret the feelings of the people of Great Britain with regard to the Immigration Act and its administration, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that every one of them has to some extent to study how best he may please those to whom he owes his position. There are not many democrats in the Commonwealth who would credit Mr Jenkins, the Agent-General for South Australia, with any strong desire to support the legislation which we have passed. There are few who would have the temerity to suggest that Sir Horace Tozer, Agent-General for Queensland, or Mr James, who was appointed by the late Labour Government as Agent General for Western Australia, is in sympathy with such legislation. As to Mr. Taverner, the Agent-General of Victoria, will the recent investigation which took place has furnished us with an illustration of his sympathy with all that is right.",81
583,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Hi s character was cleared by that investigation, and it is unfair for the honourable member to refer to the matter.",81
584,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I am not satisfied as to that.,81
585,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,He is not here to defend himself.,81
586,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I am dealing with a question of public importance.,81
587,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,But what has Mr Taverner's position to do with it?,81
588,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"That is for me to judge. Of all the Agents-General, the only one who, so far as I am aware, has shown some sympathy with the object of such legislation as this is the representative of New South Wales; but I have yet to be convinced that he is in full sympathy with",81
589,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,It is a question not sympathy but of whether they have told,81
590,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I cannot answer for that. All that I know is that the Earl of Jersey, on being interviewed upon his arrival in Australia, made a statement absolutely opposed to that put forward by the",81
591,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Eve n had he agreed with that statement , the honourable member 1 It is would not have accepted it.",81
592,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am prepared to by take the word of any honourable man. I of have heard men speak of the unimpeachable character of many of the aristocracy of England, whose humanity cannot be doubted.",81
593,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Accordin g to the honourable member, an aristocrat is an honourable man, whilst an Agent-General is not.",82
594,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am always prepared to give every attention to the statements of those whose opinions are of value, and who I know speak fearlessly and without bias. The people of New South Wales have the greatest respect for the Earl of Jersey, and I would rather take his version of what is the English view of the laws of the Commonwealth than that of the Agents-General, who are servants of the States-State s which, as I said, have no love for the Commonwealth. I trust that, as far as practicable, we shall prevent the introduction of contract labour to take the bread out of the mouths of those already engaged in the industries of the Commonwealth. I trust that this Bill will prevent the introduction of labour under contract unless a thorough inquiry into the terms of each contract shows it to be fair and equitable to those to whom we are responsible-the people of Australia. Some honourable members opposite have become so saturated with Imperialistic notions that they consider that there is a country greater than Australia to which, by virtue of the oath they have taken, they owe their first duty. I echo the words of the Prime Minister,, that it is about time we ceased talking of people far away, and said a word or two for Australia.",82
595,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The people whom the honourable member left behind when he came to Australia.,82
596,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,And I should not be prepared to bringi them here under conditions that would not be creditable.,82

598,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Wit h all its faults, there is no country offering greater opporso tunities for the energetic, industrious, determined man.",82
599,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Then why shut the people of Great Britain?,82
600,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable memunionism ber is under a delusion. We are not posing to shut out any desirable immigrant, nor have we done so. Honourable members opposite, with a desire, no doubt, to giving offence to the people before whom they will go next year have said that they are in favour of preventing introduction of men under contract to compete on unequal terms with the workers already here. That is what this Bill is designed to prevent. All that we say is that it should be proved that men coming here under contract desire to land for no other purpose than to take their place among the workers of Australia, and without departing from the existing conditions of labour and rates of pay. Beyond giving effect to that intention, the Bill is simply art interpretation of the duties of the Minister.",82
601,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The Bill makes it the duty of the Minister to ascertain whether a man who comes hereis going to compete with a man of equal ability already in the Commonwealth.,82
602,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"That 1 may seem strange to the honourable member; but who is to decide the point, if not the Minister ?",82
603,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,The mari who finds the money to pay the immigrant.,82
604,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"He will be a very, unreliable authority,, if he is getting an advantage from the arrangement.",82
605,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,What advantagewould he get by importing unsuitable men if he were paying full rates of wages.,82
606,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"We know that there are many ways in which the provisions of contract's relating to rates) of wages maybe evaded. I am surprised that an honourable gentleman of so much experience should pretend to think it impossible to evade such contracts. The Bill empowers the Minister to ascertain whether the immigrant will take the place of equally skilled labour already available within the Commonwealth. I have heard it asked, how is it to be, ascertained whether such labour is available ? If honourable members knew anything of the position of unions elsewhere they would not ask that question. While in Australia, where there are many opponents of unionism, of arbitraand tion, and of all measures tending to ameliorate the lot of the workers, doubts out are thrown upon the bona fides of the unions, iri other countries, such as Germany, is so highly respected, even by proits bitterest opponents, that the bulk of men in every trade belong to unions, and when workmen are required employers never avoid dream of doing anything else but applying to the unions for the assistance which' they require, and the unions are regarded the as the best judges of the skilfulness of their members. If the Prime Minister requires to know what men of skill are avail5 able in .any trade, the only way in which he can obtain the information is by applying to those whose duty it is to keep a record of the workers in each trade. I have watched the iprogress of unionism since 1880, and I think that the unions deserve greater powers and better treatment than they are receiving. The more we trust them and extend their powers, the more we shall do towards removing causes of friction between employers and employees. 1 Tegret that there has been this long debate, because there is practically no opposition to the measure, and I shall merely add that I see no objection to clause 7, which provides thatAny officer appointed under the Immigration Restriction Act igoi or any Officer of Customs may ask any immigrant before he lands in the Commonwealth whether he has come to Australia under a contract agreement to perform manual labour in Australia and the immigrant shall truly answer the question. A similar question is put to immigrants entering the United. States. To-night the honourable member for Wentworth quoted the Canadian Act, with a copy of which the deputy leader of the Opposition had supplied him for the purposes of argument.",82
607,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I said that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne had overlooked that Act, and he admitted that he had never seen it before.",83
608,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne at least understands any subject that he may be speaking about, and what he says is original, and not mere repetition.",83
609,Mr KELLY,Unknown,He admitted that he had have not seen the Canadian Act.,83
610,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"If he had not seen people. any Act his speech would have been better worth hearing than a speech delivered by the honourable member after he had read everv Act passed since the tSme of Adam. When the Canadian Act was quoted, honcause orable members opposite cried out, ""That distinguishes between foreigners and aliens and our own kith and k in . "" But in Canada and America. I venture to say, the provimany sions of the law are stricter than the lations which will be enforced under Bill. In any case, we must consider the interests of Australia first of all, and be guided wholly by what has been done in Then he remarksEngland, in Canada, or in America. We should so mould our laws that they will case benefit the people whom we represent?, by preserving their rights and privileges, and I trust that in this case the House will show that it has the wisdom and knowledge necessary to do more than merely imitate the laws of other parts of the world.",83
611,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," I do not desire to do more than indicate in. a few words the view I take of this measure, and of one or two amendments which I think might be made with profit when we reach the Committee stage. The discussion today has legitimately ranged over a wide area, dealing not merely with the measure before the Chair, but also with"" the cognate subject of immigration into Australia, and the inducements that could be held out to other white folk to join our ranks, and to assist us in developing our resources. In that connection, some references have been made to the statements of the Agents-General, and the observations of Earl Jersey. With regard to the remarks of the Agents-General, it seems to me that one may reasonably offer two comments. One is that they have stated what is a fact, and the other is that they have drawn an inference from it with which' one may or may not agree. They have stated that Australian legislation, and the Australian attitude towards the outside world, had resulted in a loss of Australian popularity in the old country. Whether or not we agree with the reasons assigned, there is no use in denying the fact. Earl Jersey, whose remarks have been quoted to the contrary, himself says, amongst other things, thatundoubtedly there have been a good many criticisms of Australia written in the press, which had the effect, to a certain extent, of pulling down Australia in the minds of the British Then he goes on to point out that this influence has not operated to the extent that might be imagined, not because people have not accepted the criticisms, but bemany have not seen them. That is to say, those who have read the criticisms have had their opinion of Australia diminished by what they have read, but a great people have not read the criticisms, reguand have not formed anv opinion on the this subject. Then he goes on to savPerhaps for the moment there is some feeling not of hesitation in England about Australia. I think that there is no doubt that a certain of Australian administration-on e that was quoted so much, and was usecl so much as an illustration-ha s been repeated to the detriment of Australia, but I do not think it has deterred the right class of people from emigrating. Then he points out the reasons why emigrants do not come to Australia. It seems to me that, rightly or wrongly, certain legislation and administrative acts under it have caused a feeling among those who do take notice of, or an .interest in, Australian affairs, that we do not want immigrants to come here.",83
612,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Has not that feeling been brought about by misrepresentations?,84
613,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I am now dealing with the resultsi I do not say whether the representations made were fair or not. No doubt many of them have been unfair. But the facts are related, and they point to one or two inferences. One is that we grudge admission to immigrants. This inference has most frequently been drawn, and it has been the subject of much exaggeration. The fact remains that if a skilled worker wants to come to us under agreement, it has to be shown, to the satisaction of the Minister, that a particular employer wants him for particular skilled work. My impression of the intention of the section was not in accordance with the interpretation placed upon it by some of those responsible for its administration. My view was that upon its being shown that the skilled labour proposed to be introduced was of a character suitable to Australia, the immigrants would be allowed to come here as a matter of course. Misconceptions have arisen in connection with that legislation, and I ara heartily glad that the Government have introduced the measure for the purpose of removing, not only misconception, but also all reasonable possibilities of misconception and opportunities for misrepresentation. It is because I do not think that the measure goes as far as it could with safety in this regard,that I wish to offer a few friendly criticisms. I take it that we are all agreed upon two points-First , that we will not have any legislation which would enable one side in an industrial difficulty to use outside sources to defeat its opponents-that we will not allow the employing class t'o introduce cheaper or even equally, well paid labour from elsewhere for the purpose of defeating any individual or collection of individuals with whom they may be in conflict; especially as, in airprobability, each side is partly in the wrong. Neither side to an industrial dispute has ever been able to justly claim that its side was absolutely right, and that the other side was wholly wrong. I object to that chance being given to employers to utilize a form of boycott, because I am opposed to boycotting of any kind. Therefore, we must not let our legislation assume such a shape as to expose us to that danger. Very effective provision for this contingency is made in one of the sub-clauses of clause 5, and in clause 9, which allows the Governor General to gazette a general prohibition when industrial disputes are in existence or in contemplation. Those words, "" in contemplation,'' confer very wide powers indeed. In the second place, we desire to make sure that every contract immigrant shall come to us under conditions equal to those pervailing in the trade in which he is to engage. It must be remembered that the greater portion of the contract immigrants will be skilled artisans, as contrasted with unskilled labourers, and we must make sure that Avorkers are not introduced here in order to undercut those already in Australia.",84
614,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member know that the States Governments are the worse of non-union employers ? The Amalgamated Engineers cannot secure from them the same wages that are paid by outside employers.,84
615,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Althoug h I think it is a pity that the States Governments do not pay as good wages as are given by outsideemployers. I do not consider that that matter is exactly germane to the point to which I am addressing myself. My point is that no contract immigrant should come in on worse terms than any man in Australia can get in a fair bargain with an employer under existing labour conditions in this country; and there is a sub-clause in one of the clauses which covers that ground. To enable men to be brought into undercut those already here would be another and very effective form of boycott. But when Ave have provided for these two matters we have provided for essentials, and anything more we put in the measure should be mere machinery for insuring that these essentials are secured. The Bill as it stands does go further than that in some respects. For example, paragraph b of sub-clause 2 of clause 5 presents a question which it is impossible for any Minister to reasonably and satisfactorily decide. After all, why should not an employer choose his employee, if he likes, provided the labour conditions are complied with, and there is no attempt to seize the opportunity to exercise a boycott or take advantage in view, or in the midst, of an industrial dispute? In the same way, it seems to me that sub-clause 4 of the same clause imposes an unnecessary restriction. That sub-clause provides that the Minister shall not approve of a contract unless he does so before the contract immigrant lands. I do not see any use in that provision, because the very next clause provides all sorts of penalties-thoug h I do not think penalties should be provided as against the contract immigrant-if the employer lands an immigrant before the contract has been, approved. Personally, I think there is a still more effective way of preventing undercutting contracts. This way has already been suggested, I believe, by several honourable members, and it is that a stipendiary magistrate, in a court of summary jurisdiction, shall have power to amend a contract so as to bring it into accord with current rates, and compel the employer to abide by the altered conditions. would be the most effective way conceivable to insure that an employer shall not make, or try to make, contracts at less than the regular rates. An employer would know that, as soon as the immigrant arrived and started work, he, on finding what the conditions here were, could go to the nearest court and secure those conditions for himself. The fact that a remedy could so easily be found would be one of the best deterrents against employers imposing other than the prevailing conditions. It would be a much easier method than compelling people in Western Australia or in Northern Queensland to apply to a Minister administering his Department in Melbourne or Dalgety. The centralizing of everything in the Minister is, in mv view, one way to make this measure so cumbersome that it will not work easily, and will indirectly defeat the object it fesses to achieve.",84
616,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,How could the Minister ascertain whether an immigrant is competent or not?,85
617,Mr MCGAY,Unknown,"I do not. see how the Minister will be able to determine whether there is in Australia another worker of at least equal skill and ability with the contract immigrant, whose contract must be approved before he lands in Australia. While the immigrant is on the sea or in England the Minister has to determine whether there is in Australia another worker of at least equal skill' and ability with an unknown person. It is of no use to give the Minister an impossible task-no t even a Minister of the ability of the present occupant of the office. Those restrictions I should notj quarrel with for a moment if I felt that the object could not be achieved in a different way. But, having laid down the main principle in a measure of this kind, we should, in providing machinery, avoid cumbering it with a single unnecessary detail. I regard clause 7 as a provision necessary to enable the object of the Bill to be attained. That object is a good one, and may be achieved, provided we dd not load and render the measure inoperative with unnecessary restrictions, and so long as we remove the misapprehensions, just and unjust, that exist in the old country. It. is desirable that we in Australia should, as far as possible, without departing from our ideals in regard to legislation, endeaThat vour to remove those misapprehensions, and therefore I trust that the very reasonable amendments suggested by honourable members will meet with acceptance by the Government when we go into Committee. As I said before, I should prefer to see the Bill framed so that, after an agreement 1 has been filed with the Department, an opportunity to rectify wrongs in the contract shall be left - with some more easily and more quickly moved authority than the Minister of a Department stationed at one place in the Commonwealth. I recognise that to alter the Bill in the direction suggested would mean a very considerable amount of amendment and modification, not of its principle, but of its scheme of working. I therefore do not propose to move strenuously in that direction; but I suggest to the Government the strong advisapro- bility of considering the modification of some of the details. It is a pity to spoil a good measure-whic h will, I think, largely attain its object-by one or two irritating details which will afford an excuse for a continuation of the criticism of which we in Australia have already complainedcriticism that will not be removed by mere assertions that it is incorrect, but only by legislative proof that whenever we see good reasons, even though we think the statements exaggerated or unfair, the cause will, if possible, be removed. 1",85
618,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does the honourable and learned member not think that we are endeavouring to live too much on the smiles of other people?,86
619,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I do not think so. As a matter of fact, we in Australia do in many respects live on the smiles of Great Britain.",86
620,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I do not think we do.,86
621,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"But - for our being a portion of the British Empire we should find ourselves compulsorily much more heavily taxed in order to provide, amongst other things, for our own protection.",86
622,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,The sooner taught that we have to protect ourselves the better.,86
623,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"That is another question ; but so long as we accept all these benefits we nuist, in common fairness, take them into consideration. I hope in the not-distant future that, from the over-crowded acres of the old country, we shall see a stream of immigration through Australia as through Canada.",86
624,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I have no objection.,86
625,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"We cannot expect that stream of immigration if we create a. feeling in the old country that we do not want immigrants. We have to let the people abroad know that we want them; and, for that reason, we should remove every posthe sible cause of pin-pricks and irritation. That is the policy we must pursue into create such a recognition of our good fellowship and good-will, as will induce people to turn, first, their thoughts, then their footsteps to our shores. I speak thus, not from mere sentiment, but in conwould sequence of the practical necessities of the case. If comparatively small grounds do afford cause for a feeling of. irritation, if their removal will not interfere with the principle, or affect the administration the measure, we should be acting in mere obstinacv if we retained them. Consequently, in a perfectly friendly way, suggestions been made to the Government in the that they will be adopted. We believe with these amendments the object which we heartily symoathize will achieved-that nothing will be lost, and no dangers created, but that, on the contrary, the measure will work more satisfactorily than it otherwise would. We must remember that pin-pricks often develop into serious grievances. If we do not afford an opportunity for pin-pricks, we shall not have the serious grievances. Therefore I trust that this which in the main meets with my cordial approval, will in Committee be amended in the direction that I have indicated. I must frankly add that, unless some such alterations are made, the measure will, in my judgment, accomplish more harm than good. In its present form it does not increase the facilities for the admission of contract immigrants of the right class As a matter of fact, it does not render their admission any easier than it is, although it puts the position in a clearer form. If it be passed without amendment, I very we are much fear that the points in it which will attract attention elsewhere will not be the opportunitieswhich it offers for desirable immigrants to come to Australia, but the disabilities which are imposed upon contract labourers who wish to enter the Commonwealth under fair conditions of labour, and without in any way interfering with industrial disputes, irrespective of whether they are threatened or are actually in existence. The effect of that would be to make people say that Australia has re-affirmed her attitude of exclusiveness and hostility towards those people.",86
626,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," I am very glad that this Bill has been introduced, because it means more of the "" open door."" When Immigration Restriction Act 1901 was under consideration, I understood that the order contract labour clause was only to be brought into operation in case of an actual or threatened strike. I venture to say that and if we had then foreseen the developments which have since taken place, that provision have been subjected to a much closer scrutiny. At the last general election I was ashamed of the defence of that legislation and which I was obliged to make to' my constituents. > I had to point out that it should of operate only in times of strike, when, as a matter of fact, it has operated at other times. In my opinion, both the six hatters have and the six potters were illegally, hope but very properly, admitted to the that Commonwealth. The administration of with the law had to be strained to adbe mit them; but I am very glad that they were admitted. I support this Bill because it contemplates a step towards populating our country.with white people. If anv honourable member will move to add to clause 11, which provides that the Act shall not be construed to apply to domestic the servants or personal attendants accompanying their employers to Australia, the words, Bill, "" or saving during a time of threatened or actual industrial disputes to any white British subject,"" I shall support him.",86
627,Mr KNOX,Unknown,The honourable and learned member is making a good speech.,87
628,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"--The commendation of the honourable member for Kooyong alarms me. Even if individual cases of hardship result from limiting the operation of the contract provision to times of actual or threatened strike, it seems to me that public safety constitutes the supreme law. What we want to attract is a white population, and if we can secure it from our own kith and kin oversea, we ought to welcome it. There is not the slightest doubt that no white man has been excluded from the Commonwealth as the result of the operation of the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act ; but I would mind honourable members of the words which the Prime Minister used in speaking of the application of that legislation to coloured people. He said that it was not so much the people who had been excluded by it upon their, arrival here whom we had to consider, but the number who had beeri deterred from coming here by reason of it . Similarly with regard to contract immigrants. I am afraid that the provision in paragraph b of clause 6, which provides that if , before the Minister approves of the terms of his contract, a tract immigrant lands in Australia, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £ 5 . would create a condition of panic amongst - persons in England who may desire to come to Australia. If a contract labourer ro improve his position entered the Commonwealth, and was fined ^ 5 for so doing, it would take a long time for us to overcome the feeling of resentment which would be thereby created. If the six hatters or the six potters had been fined £ 5 , and in default had been committed to gaol, a condition of affairs would have arisen which it is impossible for us to imagine. I certninlv hope that that provision will be excised. It has been stated that only people who enjoy similar conditions to those prevailing in Australia should be allowed to enter the Commonwealth. But I would point out that if a resident of the old country already enjoyedsimilar conditions, he would not desire to come to Australia. It requires a good deal of determination for a man to come such a long distance and to face new conditions of life. There is no doubt that emigration from England - and immigration to Australia is a very big plunge in life, and a very great experiment, and consequently only the inducement of better conditions will influence people. I am sorry that the Bill does not go as far as I would like, although I must admit that it is an improvement upon the existing law. We have heard a good deal of talk recently in regard to the slanders upon Australia. I hold in my hand a parathe graph from the Sydney Morning Herald, of 28th October, 1904, which relates to a notorious slanderer. According to that journal, the right honourable member for East Sydney, speaking at a public meeting, saidYet we got nervous if we heard of aman coming out from the old country. When six artisans arrived off the coast, the whole of the genius of the first Federal Parliament was bent to the retask of deciding whether they should land. I should like to ask honourable members of the Opposition whether that is a fair statement of the Australian view of immigration? Whether we pass, or reject this Bill , such misrepresentations will continue to be made. We may expect them to be made by certain people who think more of other countries than they do of Australia. But it is unfortunate that they should be uttered by members* of this House, inasmuch as they are by that means given more prominence than is desirable. There con- are some people who are always ready to malign progressive legislation, and the Legislature responsible for it . I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill , but in Committee shall do all that I can to wishing open the door still wider to white Britishers.",87
629,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown," I should not have spoken, but for certain remarks made by two or three honourable members who have taken part in this debate. One of the greatest traducers of the Immigration Restriction Act was Sir Horace Tozer. a paid servant of the Commonwealth, who made a great deal of capital out of the fact that he was not allowed to land a lady's maid in Australia until he had entered into an undertaking that she would leave the country at the close of her engagement here. Having heard him deal with this question, and also with an incident relating to a work of art. for which a Royal personage was responsible, I asked him on the Brisbane railway station how he would amend the Act. . Notwithstanding that he had been very busv interpreting it to the detriment of the Commonwealth, he replied that he would not alter a single line or letter of its provisions, so far as they related to males, but that he would amend those relating t6 domestic servants and other female workers. Whatever Australia has suffered, owing to the operation of the Acl which we are now proposing to amend, has been, due to a want of patriotism, and not to any inherent fault in the Act itself. It was well framed, and was designed to make Australia a place of refuge for the distressed and deserving of other parts of the world; but it has been held up to the people as a measure by which we seek to make Australia an exclusive preserve for those already here. I do not suppose that there is any honourable member, not to say any party, in this House, who has no desire to see Australia's millions of idle acres occupied by millions of hands ready to work them; but at the same time we wish' to see those acres occupied by men who will respect the conditions which the people of Australia have fought hard to secure and maintain. It has been said that we should throw open our ports to the white' races of Europe, but there are some white men whose presence-here would be just as inimical to the best interests of the white workers of Australia ag would be that of the Japanese. For instance, whilst I should welcome the Italians from the north of Italy, who make good citizens, there are men who come from other parts of Italy with an organ and a monkey, and as soon as they make a little money enter the fruit business, undersell their competitors. In every city in the Commonwealth we find Italians not doing much hard work, but monopolizing the fruit trade. There are white races in various parts of Europe who would flock here if we threw open our ports, but would not help to build up the sturdv race that we desire. I shall vote for the second reading, not because I think the Bill is necessary, but because I believe that advantage has been taken of the provisions of the existing Act to traduce Australia, and so to keep thousands awav from our shores. I do not agree with the honourable and learned member for Corio that the six hatters, the six potters, or others who were not undesirable immigrants, were kept out of Australia.",87
630,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I said that they were illegally admitted.,88
631,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"Mr Anderson, who entered into the contract with the six hatters, had only to comply with the Commonwealth law in order to secure their introduction without the slightest delay. Surely we should not have allowed one man to set himself up against the law, and to defy the Commonwealth. The Government of the day acted rightly in compelling him to observe the law. Whether the law be right or wrong, it must be administered as it stands. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I hope that when the Bill is taken into Committee it will be made a little more stringent, for I fear that the Government have erred a little on the side of generosity.",88

641,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown, I regret that I am compelled to address myself to this Bill at so late an hour of the night.,89
642,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Then why.does the honourable member do it?,89
643,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Because I wish to enter my protest against some of the provisions of the Bill. Honourable members must admit that the second-reading debate has been conducted fairly, and that no honourable member on either side who has spoken can be accused of any attempt to delay business unduly. I regard the Immigration Restriction Act as, a measure of the first importance to Australia. I have for a long time felt that nothing is so detrimental to the best interests of the Commonwealth as that it should remain on the statute-book in its present form, and should be administered as it has been administered. I remember that the Prime Minister made an exceedingly eloquent speech, in which he asserted that his policy of a White Australia must not be taken to mean "" an empty Australia""."" When notice was given of the introduction of a Bill to amend the Immigration Restriction Act, some of us believed that the proposed amending measure would be a realitv. yet almbs,t every honourable member who has discussed this Bill today, has said that he does not think it necessary, or that it will make any real alteration in the existing law. I do not propos.e to detain the House at length,, but I do desire to emphasize one fact, and that is that it is, proposed that we shall place in the hands of the Minister a power which will be quite inoperative. The Bill requires the Minister to be a complete jack-of-all-trades. He is to judge the comparative abilities of the men engaged in all trades. He is to say whether a man is NOES. a more capable and skilled artisan than one who is to be brought from England under contract, and who has never left its shores. It is the passage of such legislation as this which gives the critics an opportunity of which, I regret to say, they have availed 1 themselves to an extent, which is very much to be deprecated-to write in a very severe manner, indeed, against Australia; and the worse part of the business is that, so far as this legislation is concerned, the criticism is true. The men who have left England, Ireland, and Scotland to better their conditions here are the most bitter enemies of their own kith and kin, who wish to come to Australia for the same purpose. It is the immigrant from the old country who is most anxious to shut out those whom he left behind him.",89
644,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That is not a fair statement. How many of them have come out under contract?,89
645,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I am not speaking of those who have come out under contract. Speaking as a native of Australia, I have found that the' most bitter opponents of immigration from the TJnited Kingdom are British immigrants, who have bettered their condition here. So far as coming out under contract is concerned, there is no one in the House who is more strongly qf opinion than I am that we should as far as possible, maintain the existing social conditions in Australia. If the object of this Bill were confined, first, to prohibiting the introduction of immigrants to take the place of men who were on strike, and, secondly, to preventing the introduction of immigrants under contract at a cutting rate of wage, or under conditions which were not fully up to the local standard, it would receive my hearty support. I contend that if we legislate on those lines we shall have done everything which it is necessary for us to do to maintain existing conditions in Australia. It is because the Bill goes beyond that point, because it makes the Minister a judge of conditions that I make this protest. Fancy the Minister being called upon to say that, in Australia, there is no man of equal capabilities prepared to take the work which it is desired to bring out a skilled artisan, say, a cabinet-maker, under contract to do ! I am sorry to have to say that there are not only skilled artisans, but also skilled professional men, whom, for personal failings, employers would hesitate or refuse to employ. That is patent to every one who has worked as a wages man, or has been an employer. Is the Minister to sa'y that until a man who possesses the skilled ability, but who, unfortunately, has weaknesses which prevent him from using his skilled ability to proper effect, is employed, no other man is to be brought to Australia? That provision will render the Bill one of the farcical measures which the House seems to delight in passing. I do not wish to oppose the second reading of the Bill. There are very serious amendments which will have to be considered in Committee, and I reserve to myself the right of stating my objections to certain provisions when they are under consideration. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3Paragraph g of section three, and the wiple of section eleven of the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 are repealed.",89
646,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) move That after the words "" paragraph g "" words ""and paragraph k "" be inserted. I move this amendment because it was the intention of the House that paragraph g section 3 of the Immigration Restriclocal tion Act should apply to crews of overcan, sea vessels, who are engaged in the coastal trade. I do not think it necessary to repeat what I said in my speech on the second reading of the Bill. If the Prime Minister will refer to the printed corresAustralia, pondence, he will find that Mr Guthrie, the secretary of the Seamen's Union, thoroughly convinced that the intention Sir Malcolm MCEacharn was that the shippropose owners, as well as the seamen, ought to protected against the unfair competition of Bill. oversea vessels. Writing to the then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, Mr Guthrie saidThere can be no doubt as to the intention Parliament, the issue being plainly put honourable the Attorney-General, 5370. "" The case of crews of those vessels which leave our waters is provided for in paragraph j - this became paragraph k of the Act-W not require to deal with them. case of a vessel coming out with a crew, under contract from abroad. The vessel and crew being both required to be engaged thereafter the coastal trade in Australia, they come the scope of the Commonwealth law. They will be prohibited immigrants-unles s we provide that they are paid not less than the ruling rate of wages in Australian waters."" That opinion was endorsed by the honourable and learned member for Angas, who, at page 3372 of Hansard, saidAs we have not the amendments before us in print, it is difficult to understand what its effect will be. I take it, however, that if a P. and O. steamer, coming from England, took goods from Fremantle to Sydney, the rate of wages paid to the crew would have to be the rate prevailing in the Commonwealth. Sir Malcolm .MCEacharn spoke even more plainly. He saidVessels come out here at times with their crews engaged at lower rates of wages, and compete on this coast with vessels on which the rates current in Australia are paid.",90
647,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Is not that already provided for in sub-clause 7? Sir MALCOL M MCEACHARN - I do not think so. Then again, the clause might prevent 1 a ship-owner bringing out his vessel under contract at rates of wages existing in England. This amendment is to provide that as soon as vessels come on to the coastal trade here, the crew shall be paid the rates of wages ruling on the coast. That was equally the intention of honor- I able members, and injustice has been done to the seamen and ship-owners of Australia by the interpretation which has been placed the on paragraph k by the law officers of the Crown. That interpretation has allowed oversea vessels to engage in the coastal uf trade of Australia, to the disadvantage of ship-owners and local seamen. We however, remedy matters by. repealing paragraph k. I have made it clear that it was the intention of the framers of the principal A;t that oversea vessels, if permitted to engage in the coastal trade of should carry crews receiving the rates of wages prevailing on the coast. I was expect to be met with the objection that of this is not the proper place to do what I shall be done, and that the matter be should be dealt with in the Navigation",90
648,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,It is too big a question to be dealt with in this Bill.,90
649,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I am surprised to of hear a Labour member say that. The time by the to assist the workers is when one has the Hansard, page opportunity to do so.",90
650,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,The honourable meme do ber could only partially do now what he But we have the wishes to do.,90
651,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"We can clo in in this Bill what could be done in the Naviwithin gation Bill. An eminent legal authorityhas stated that the interpretation placed on paragraph k is a wrong one. I appeal the honourable member for Parramatta support my amendment, because no one has declared himself more anxious to do the that about. fair thing to the workers of Australia.",90
652,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is ness or reasonableness about the present proceedings. They are a degrading"" play of brute force. f h e CHAIRMAN - I ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark.",91
653,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I withdraw it.,91

655,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"That is not accurate. Have not others the same right to speak the honourable member has. No one s.poke so long as he did in the debate on the second reading. J\lr. HUTCHISON - I sooke .for about an hour, but I never trouble the House less I have something to say. honourable member were to speak only when he had something to say, we should never on our coast. hear his voice in this Chamber. I am sure that every honourable member who was prement. sent when the Immigration Restriction Bill was being considered believed that it required oversea vessels trading on the coast to pay local rates of wages. We are not proposing to exclude British vessels, or foreign vessels, from our coastal but we say that they should not compete unfairly with local ship-owners and seaA B C. men.",91

661,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No ; but what I wish no Tairto do can be done very simply. Mr DE _ AKIN - If I were to pursue the dismatter further I should be able to show the honourable member that the amendment would not accomplish his purpose. It could be evaded. I quite recognise that this matter is one of long standing, to which the honourable member and others caTled attention. It has been the subi l l ject of consideration by the Navigation Commission now sitting, which, I believe, has framed recommendations with as a view to the settlement of the difficulty. I think that the honourable member's object can be accomplished only by embodying provisions, probably of some complexity, in a Navigation Act. The effect unof striking out paragraph k would be to If the cripple shipping which the honourable member does not desire to prevent from trading Under these circumstances, I hope that he will not press his amend",91
662,Mr KNOX,Unknown," It is almost unnecessary for me to state that this matter is being carefully discussed by the Navieven gation Commission, the members of which trade; realise how complicated it is.",91
663,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,It is a matter of,91
664,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"The members of the Commission have gone into the question very thoroughly, and T trust that the honourable member will accent mv assurance that they desire to do justice to those in whose inwithin the terests he is moving.",91
665,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown," I ask honourable member to withdraw his conamendment. If he persists in calling for the a division he will be defeated by a large majority, and I fear that a false impression will be created outside the House. In land, r-omraon with the other members of the Labour Partv I am prepared, when the proper time comes, to give the fullest conin the secration fo the question of protecting Australian seamen and ship-owners against unfair competition. The question is too important to be dealt with by means of the amend ent proposed by the honourable m member. If he wishes to serve the interests of thp seamen-as we all hellieve he does he will be well advised if he withdraws his",91
666,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown, It is quite evident that there is no likelihood of my being able to carry my amendment. THere is no doubt in my mind or in that of an eminent counsel,92
667,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The telling the honourable member to back down, and he is going to do it.",92
668,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No Minister has ever succeeded in making me back down. I am not here to obey the behests of other individuals, as are some honourable members. I challenge the honourable member to show that I have ever acted at the dictation of a Minister, or of members of my own party, when I have differed from them. The only back-down I have witnessed during the last few days has been that of the Opposition. I was delighted to see that they had the sense to back down when they were beaten. I am not going to back down. I propose to ask the Prime Minister for a definite assurance. There is no doubt in my own mind, or in the minds of the seameti-wh o comprise men thoroughly acquainted with the whole of our navigation laws-that the intention of the provision in the Act was to protect our local seam"""" and ship-owners. But that object has not been achieved owing to the interpretation of the law adopted by the Crown .law officers. I now wish to know from the Prime Minister whether he is of opinion that the seamen employed in oversea vessels which engage in our coastal trade, should be paid the same rate of warjes that rule in the Commonwealth. If he can assure me that he is in sympathy with what is declared in paragraph g, and that he will do all he can to see that provision is made for the protection of seamen in our navigation laws, I shall be satisfied to withdraw my amendment.",92
669,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There is no need for me to give any such assurance. If the honourable member will look at the Navigation Bill he will find that ample provision is made in the direction he desires. He has no need to appeal to me for an expression of opinion upon a matter with regard to which I have not altered my views since that measure was introduced. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause agreed to. Clause 4Every contract immigrant, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may land in the Commonwealth if the contract is in writing, and is made by or on behalf of some person named in the contract and resident in Australia, and its terms are approved by the Minister. Mr. JOSEPH COOK: (Parramatta) - I wish to protest against the Government proceeding any further to-night. HonorMinister is able members upon this side of the Chamber have gone home in the f u ll belief that the House would rise after the Bil l had been read a second time.",92
670,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. The remarks of the honourable member would be applicable only to a motion to report progress, which he would not be permitted to discuss. His observations have no relation to the clause now before the Chair.",92
671,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The question before the Chair is whether or not clause 4 should be agreed to.,92
672,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This clause ought not to be passed until honourable members are in a fit condition to vote on it, and after full deliberation. Further, an opportunity ought to be given to honourable members who are now absent to express their opinion on the clause. Some on this side have gone home to-night in the full belief that fhis clause would not be reached. After consulting with members of the Government, these honourable members were given to understand that it was only intended to pass the second reading. Amongst the honourable members who have gone away is the honourable member for Macquarie, who did so after consulting with the Vice-President of the Executive Council.",92
673,Mr EWING,Unknown,The honourable member for Macquarie got no assurance of that description from me.,92
674,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member for Macquarie went! away after receiving, I admit, no assurance, but in the firm belief, after talking with the Vice President of the Executive Council, that only the second reading of the Bill would be passed.",92
675,Mr EWING,Unknown,I said no more than that I would accept no responsibility in regard to the matter.,92
676,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We have been discussing this Bill for over fourteen hours, and, after so long a period in the atmosphere of this Chamber, I do not think that honourable members are in a fit state to give proper consideration to this measure. The debate has been equally divided about the House, and this is too important a matter for hasty consideration. All we ou this side can do, however, is to enter a protest. I say emphatically that this is not legislation, but is the exercise of brutal, degrading force, with a view to bludgeoning through proposals which ought to be considered carefully in reasonable hours. If anything could add to the degradation which the Prime Minister has already m heaped upon his head during this session, it is his conduct now.",92
677,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is not in order in making those remarks.,93
678,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," A clause like this, which is the pivot clause of the Bill, so far as declaration of principle is concerned, should be voted on in a Committee as far as possible fully representative of the House. I ascertained only a few minutes ago that, through a misapprehension, an honourable member who isi in favour of certain amendments that are to be proposed has been claimed as a pair for the Government.",93
679,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is a misapprehension which amounts to downright trickery.,93
680,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I am afraid that we are violating a standing order recently passed, which provides that on the question of adjournment there shall be no discussion. I think the honourable member for CorineMa wiU see (hat no good purpose will be served by continuing the discussion.",93
681,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I had not finished even one sentence when vou. sir. interposed.,93
682,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"It is not so much the speech of the honourable and learned member, as the feeling that has been aroused, to which exception may be taken.",93
683,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Surely my speech did not arouse any feeling. All I said was that I had become aware of a misapprehension.,93
684,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I am very loth to do so, but I take the responsibility of telling the honourable and learned member that his remarks are out of order.",93
685,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Then I desire to make a personal explanation, which I believe will be in order. You have said, sir, that my remarks have aroused feeling, and I wish to point out that what I said could not possibly have had that effect. What I said was that I had become aware that, through a misapprehension, a certain member had been claimed as a pair for the Government, although that member is in favour of certain amendments that have been suggested. negative the idea that there was anything more than a misapprehension, because I happen to know how the misapprehension arose. I think that the honourable member for Bourke will bear me out that it was a pure misapprehension.",93
686,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member is going beyond the question.,93
687,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I am endeavouring to point out that it is incorrect to say that my statement aroused feeling.,93
688,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If the honourable and learned member will permit me, I shall withdraw that remark as having reference to anything he has said.",93
689,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I was about to suggest that this clause should not be passed unless it was quite clear that the will of this Chamber was being expressed-that no proposal would be passed or rejected contrary to the desire, the actual desire, of the majority.  honourable members to be here?",93
690,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I do not think it is at this hour of the night. I did not arrive here until 5 o'clock this evening, and I shall not arrive any earlier on any day for the rest of the session.",93
691,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I think the honourable member is going beyond clause 4, which has nothing to do with the time he intends to arrive at the House.",93
692,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, through you, whether he does not agree that it is reasonable that the real views of honourable members should be expressed either directly or indirectly in a division on a question of this kind ?",93
693,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown," I think that the clause has the same opportunity of being considered as it would have if there were the full quota of members present. There may be some difference in the actual number of votes recorded, but I do not think there will be any difference in the actual decision. Honourable members cannot suppose that it is any pleasure for me to stop here until This hour; and I mav say that it is less_ desirable for me to be here at the present moment than it has been on any other occasion when there has been a late sitting. I am here because, rigbtlv or wrongly, I believe it to be my duty to be here, and to ask honourable members to remain for work. A request of this kind would not be I made by me at any other period of the - session, when, of course, it would be unreasonable; but if honourable members really mean what so many have said, that it is highly desirable to close the session by Christmas, or soon after;-,- and that we shall, - as we must, complete our business before - that time, it is absolutely necessary to have - such sittings. At the .present time, in practically every Parliament of Australia, late sittings are taking place-al l are en--deavouring to bring their business to a con-clusion. We have discussed this Bill all day, and many honourable members have discussed amendments which are to be submitted.",93
694,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I merely pointed out that there has been one mistake; and there may be others.,94
695,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As honourable members know, neither the Government nor anybody - else, so far as I am aware, are responsible - for the mistake. At this stage of the session, and with the business before us, it is absolutely necessary either to have late sittings or unduly prolong the session. The Committee, I believe, know their own mind - on the subject of this clause, and we can - complete the consideration of the Bill if we direct our attention fairly to it, and not - to side-issues.",94
696,Mr KELLY,Unknown," The Prime Minister will remember that during the - second-reading debate, honourable members - on this side suggested that in Committee - we might well settle the difference of - opinion as to method. Both sides are - agreed practically to shut out contract immigrants under two different categories. But we on this side hold that we might very easily deal with any illegal contract in an - ordinary Police Court, and with that one - exception throw Australia open to the admission of white persons from over sea. The 'Government held that the adoption of that - course was impracticable. I desire to test - that question to-night. Should the division result in the defeat of the Government, will the Prime Minister consent to report progress, so that we may have an opportunity - to recast the measure?",94
697,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown," The concluding words of this clause form the - crux of it. I contend that they give the Minister power to absolutely proliibit all contract immigration. The Minister has, merely to express an opinion unfavorable to any contract to prevent a contract immigrant ""from entering the Commonwealth. Under the circumstances, it is fair [2>7] that the consideration of this clause should be postponed until there is a larger attendance of honourable members, and until a more reasonable hour. After sitting here for such a prolonged period, the faculties of honourable members are not as alert as they would otherwise be. Consequently, I move That the consideration of this clause be postponed until tomorrow.",94
698,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I am afraid that it is, not competent for the honourable member to do that, because the Committee may not be sitting tomorrow.",94
699,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Then I m o v e That the consideration of the clause be postponed until after the consideration of the remaining clauses of the Bill. Several honourable members have gone to their homes in the confident belief that the House would adjourn after the second reading of the Bill had been carried.,94
700,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Where did they get that belief?,94
701,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,That was the impression which they derived from conversation with Ministerial supporters.,94
702,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Without authority.,94
703,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I do not say that any specific promise to that effect was made. But the fact remains that, as the result of conversation with honourable members who are in close touch with the Government, they were induced to believe that the House would adjourn immediately the second reading of the measure had been agreed to. Then I understand that a difficulty is being experienced in securing a pair for a member of the Opposition to whom a pair is always granted. I am perfectly certain that even at great physical discomfort that honourable member would have remained had he known that a pair would not be forthcoming.",94
704,Mr WILKS,Unknown,That difficulty has now been overcome ,94
705,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"At any rate, that was the situation which obtained until a few minutes ago. A few days ago, when the Prime Minister sooke of the necessity for holding longer sittings,'fie led us to believe, inferentially, that if the House met at 10.30 a.m., we might expect to adjourn at a reasonable hour in the evening. He even mentioned n p.m. or 11.30 p.m. A statement of that kind may reasonably be regarded as a promise that we would not be expected to sit here all night. 'Another reason why the clause should be postponed is that the officers in attendance in this House are being sweated day after day in a fashion which is altogether unjustifiable.",94
706,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Such reasons as the honourable member is now giving cannot be advanced in support of the postponement of the clause, because if the clause is postponed there will be nothing to prevent the Committee going on with the Bill .",95
707,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"If the clause is postponeduntil after the consideration of other clauses, honourable members who have gone away under a misapprehension as to the business to be done to-night may be. present when it is again discussed. It is a degradation of Parliament for the Government to attempt to bludgeon this measure through Committee in the way proposed.",95
708,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown," I think that the clause ought to be postponed. It is one of the most important clauses of the Bill , and we should not be asked to consider it when we have been wearied by the strain of a long sitting. It would be better to postpone this and other important clauses of the Bill , even though that should make it necessary that we should sit after Christmas, because we might then escape the injury to the health of honourable members which must ensue if such demands as the present are made upop them. In view of the fact that no resistance was offered to the proposal to lengthen the sittings of the House, I have been very much surprised at the action taken by the Government.",95
709,Mr KNOX,Unknown," I am not here for the purpose of wasting time. And I hope I may be allowed to suggest to the Prime Minister the desirability of postponing the more important clauses of this Bill. There is no reason why we should not now agree to pass the non-contentious clauses of the measure, and let those on which there is a division of opinion be considered tomorrow. We are dealing with a measure proposing the amendment of legislation, the administration of which has brought the Commonwealth into disrepute in the past, and seeing that we have been, here since half-past i o o'clock vesterday morning, the Prime Minister might reasonably accept the suggestion I make.",95

I left the House and went home some time ago under the impression that there would be an adjournment after the debate on the second reading had been brought to a conclusion. Fortunately, I telephoned to find out what was being done, and I then thought it my duty to return to the House. Good reasons have been given by the honourable member for Lang for the postponement of the clause. I refrained from speaking on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, because of my desire to expedite business, but I shall feel it necessary to give reasons in Committee for the course that I intend to take. I trust that wiser counsels will prevail . If honourable 1 members - wished tb block business they could do so; but they have no such desire.

Men would not lightly take the risk of being heavily fined and sent back,' any more than they would now break the law, knowing the penalties to which they would be liable. We ought not to treat this form of contract differently from an ordinary contract. But the Bill proposes to empower the Minister to ask, possibly, every man who comes to Australia, "" Are you a contract immigrant? If so, on what terms have you come out? Is your contract in writing, and are the provisions of the Act printed thereon? If afterwards. not, you cannot land in Australia."" Yet this is called a free country !

They are doing nothing of the kind, but making things much worse than they are. For a piece humbug and canting hypocrisy, I have seen nothing equal to this latest attempt part of the Prime Minister to alter our immigration law. If an Australian farmer happened to be in London, and desired to engage there a man to work on his farm Australia, it would be necessary for to have a contract drawn up in the scribed form, to send it to Australia investigation and approval, and to have format permission returned to England fore the man could leave. For irritating circumlocution, I can conceive of nothing more perfect than this measure. labourers would come out under all inconveniences",97

746,Mr WATKINS,Unknown," The men to whom the honourable member for Parramatta referred as having been brought out to look after some coal-cutting machines were men who come under the designation of miners. It is not correct to say that they were brought out with the machines, as though they Bad been engaged by those who sold them. The evidence which I obtained in the district showed that they were brought"" out by the mining company, and used to compete with Australian workmen in order to bring about a reduction of wages, which actually took place shortly They were put on in dry places, and on day work, while their Australian competitors were sent to wet places, Consequently the Americans turned out a little get more coal than the Australians.",97

751,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I do not think that at present any miners are working more than half-time ; and the fact that men could be importe3 to reduce wages is a reason the Department should be armed with the power to inquire into the circumstances Under the present law it is difficult to ascertain whether men who come here have, or have not, been brought out under contract.",97
752,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The same difficulty would be experienced under the Bill .,97
753,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"No , because the provision of which the honourable member complains will give the officials an opportunity to ascertain whether there is or is not a contract.",98
754,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],98
755,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,I would impress upon lionorable members the necessity for giving the Minister the fullest power to prevent the introduction of contract immigrants under improper conditions.,98
756,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member regard the Bill as more restrictivestated than the Act?,98
757,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,I hope that it will enby able the authorities to prevent the introducto tion of men under conditions which will prejudice our workmen.,98
758,Mr KNOX,Unknown," I desire to make it perfectly clear that we all desire to prevent the introduction of contract immigrants during periods of industrial strife or under conditions which will tend to the wages of our workers. The honourable member for Newcastle has directed attena tion to an instance in which, according his contention, the Act was evaded, and I trust that the fullest provision will be for meeting any cases of the kind that may arise in the future. If the honourable ber can suggest any reasonable amendment in that direction, I shall certainly support him. I have always opposed the introduchere tion of outsiders into the Broken Hill At one time it was proposed to introduce number of Cornishmen and at another time the employment of Italians under contract was suggested, but I was strongly averse to any such proceeding. I object to the concluding words of the clause, which provide that the terms of the contract shall be proved by the Minister. I move That the words "" and its terms are approved by the Minister,"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" and provided contract is not in contravention of section 5."" The Minister has no right to interfere with the terms of the contract, or to exercise control over the employer, except extent that may be necessary to carry out the avowed objects of the measure. A that he has to do is to satisfy himself that the interests of local workers will prejudiced. For instance, if I were to bring out a manager for a woollen mill, the Minwere ister would have no right to know what terms of the arrangement were, except the extent necessary to satisfy himself the - immigrant was being engaged under conditions similar to those prevailing in the Commonwealth. There is no reason why the whole of the terms of the agreement should be submitted for the approval of the Minister. Whilst I desire to protect the workers of the Commonwealth against unfair competition from outside, I do not think we should go so far as to unduly hamper employers or to prevent the introduction of a desirable class of immigrants.",98
759,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) The honourable* member for Newcastle has a case which a moment's consideration will show cannot possibly be affected the Bill . The honourable member proved us, not that these men who came out to work the machines were working for less wages than are Australians, but that they are doing more work. That is a condition of affairs that the B i ll will not cure.",98
760,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"It might, if the men lower were brought out under contract. When the honourable member for Parramatta was miners' secretary, would he have agreed to to such a state of things?",98
761,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No ; but this made Bill will not cure a case of the kind.,98
762,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,There is no evidence memthat these men were brought out under contract; and that is the whole point.,98
763,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If they were under contract, that fact would mines. not make the slightest difference. If a these men are doing more work than they should if is a matter to be settled by the Arbitration Court.  for Parramatta is twisting the words of apthe honourable member for Newcastle, who did not say that the men are doing too much work.",98
764,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable such member for Newcastle said that these men were doing more work owing to being out into better places-that they were doing any more work than were men who were not to the so favourably placed.,98
765,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"My complaint is that it l l cannot be found out whether these men were brought out under contract, with the not be object of reducing wage?.",98
766,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Eve n if the men brought out under contract, this Bill the would afford no remedy, because wages to and conditions of employment must be that fixed by a local tribunal.",98
767,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,But it might be ascerthe tained what the conditions are.,99
768,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the'honorasked able member found out all about the condipower, tions this Bill would not help him. Is the ditions of contracts. lionorable member for Newcastle aware if a contract be voided as soon as an grant arrives, there is nothing in the B to prevent the employer and the employee immediately afterwards renewing the consure. tract on precisely the same terms and condo ditions. T hope the honourable member will not think that I am justifying what is ing done in-the case which he cited; am merely pointing out that this Bill not affect such cases. Since the Bill not affect conditions of employment or rates nf wages, why trouble about inquiring into Bill. the terms of the contract, so long as we penalize any attempt at violating our tralian standards? We should concentrate our attention on that point, instead of shutting the door against all contract grants.",99
769,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown," I do not quite follow the argument of the honourable member who proposed the amendment, nor those of the honourable member for Parraof matta. It seems strange that sane men not come to term's and make some progress with a measure of this sort. So far as can iuclge from the speeches on the second reading, there is no difference of opinion as to the principles involved; the only ference arises as to the machinery by which effect may be given to those principles. Yet we do not appear to be terms.",99

777,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"If we desire to do justice, even the fact that a lawyer might be employed ought not to act as a bar.

Can the honourable and learned gentleman see his way to adopt ray suggestion in lieu of the centralized control for which the Bil l provides?",100
780,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Does not the honourable and learned member think that his proposal would be even more objectionable than the system which is provided for in the Bill? ' Mr MCCAY - No . I think it would act almost as an automatic check against "" c u t t in g "" contracts. Either the contract immigrant, or any of the persons who are rivals with him for employment, would be able to bring his agreement before the Court. I do not suggest doing away with the filing of the agreement. the Minister settling the terms, the contract should be filed so that anybody might see it. If it were not in accordance with the prescribed conditions, either the contract immigrant, or those with whom he would be a rival for employment, should be able to bring the matter before the Court.",100
781,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"That might cause delay, and cost to the immigrant.",100
782,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"No ; a trades union could bring it before a stipendiary magistrate. I would not consent to the matter being referred to a justice of the peace. the Prime Minister adopt some such modification of the centralizing proposals of the Bil l ? If he can, I shall support the amendment; but not otherwise. If we are to have this measure, we must provide for contracts receiving the approval of some one, and if fhey are not to be dealt, with by a Court, they must be subject to the approval of the Minister.",100
783,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown," The proposition is serious enough to merit consideration, and, as a matter of fact, in another form, has already been considered. Although I admit the force of the interjections of honourable members, that an appeal to a Court of law might involve expense, and, perhaps, delay, some such means of settlement, where it is applicable, is, according to our experience, superior to all others. The proposal adopted in this Bil l that, instead of these questions being brought before the Court, they shall be dealt with by the Minister, is due to the fact that some of the issues to be dealt with-issue s that are very important-ar e not of a nature that could be settled by ordinary judicial methods within reasonable time and at reasonable expense. For in- v stance, what could .be dealt with by a Court with a good deal of satisfaction is.the ques-: tion whether the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment are as advantageous to the contract immigrant as those current for workers, .of the same class at the place wfTere the-cShtract is to be performed. I think' that the Court could deal satisfactorily with those matters, but I do not believe it could' consider whether a contractis not made in contemplation of or with a view of affecting an industrial dispute.",100
784,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I would suggest that a later clause should be retained so that the Minister would be able to step in at any In lieu of time and say ""none of these contracts can be authorized, because they affect an industrial dispute.""",100
785,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,But the clause to which the honourable and learned member refers relates to the prohibition of a particular class of contract.,100
786,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"We could enlarge that provision, and provide that the Minister may at any time prohibit a contract on other grounds.",100
787,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"But the Minister, in addition to receiving them, would have to judge them in that relation. The question Can as to the difficulty of obtaining workmen in the Commonwealth",100

794,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Have not men been troduced in connection with trade disputes?,101
795,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,But the Bill prohibits that being done.,101
796,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They have been introduced into Victoria to punish trade unionists.,101
797,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I fail to see how a judicial body, by judicial methods, could arrive at a determination in regard to such cases.",101
798,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"There the Minister should have a reserve power which could be exercised at any time, leaving to the Court the interpretation of a contract which does not involve special, obnoxious circumstances.",101
799,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member suggests Minister should have a reserve power to consider and* deal with the questions involved in the first two paragraphs of this clause. His proposition would then relate only to the determination of the question of remuneration, and other terms and conditions, by the Court.",101
800,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Yes ; it would mean that if contracts were honestly made under ordinary circumstances, the question of whether they were fair agreements would be referred to the Court. If they involved semi-political considerations, the Minister would intervene.",101
801,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The effect of the honourable and learned member's proposal would be that we should relieve the Minister of the consideration of only one set of questions, those relating to the remuneration of the contract labourers, and the terms and conditions of employment. Although, as I have said, I think a judicial bodv would be competent to decide those questions, it would do so only in the ordinary way. It would require witnesses to be examined and cross-examined. That would imply a good deal of expense, which is avoided by what I admit is the rough and ready method of trusting to a Ministerial decision on reports from the officers of the Department. There is much to recommend the proposition made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and in another, form it has already ' received some consideration at our hands. It was put aside, because it was thought would mean the application of an. excellent method under conditions which, would in some cases involve hardship, and in others delay. Although it in- has been put again in another tempting, form, I think, after weighing all the considerations, we had better retain the rough and ready system of Ministerial supervision. My own experience leads me tosuppose that the number of contract immigrants affected by these provisions is not likely to be very large. An application for permission to introduce contract immigrants relates, as a rule, to only one or two men at a time.",101
802,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The employer of the six potters says that he has not done as well with them as he anticipated.,101
803,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Possibly . We might have a number, of applications for the aidmission of contract labourers in connection that the with settlement in Queensland and other partis of the Commonwealth, where an effort is being made to establish co-operative sugar-growing on Crown areas or lands available for selection. I do not apprehend that there will be any difficulty in dealing with those proposals or in allowing very considerable latitude in regard to them; but the applications so far have related to the introduction of units or parties of two and three men at a time. In those cases there has been little or no difficulty in arriving at a determination that I believe to have been just Mv own experience is that but few applications are received. I cannot recall to mind one that has been finally rejected, so that in the circumstances I am inclined to think that while if time and money were not a consideration, though the method of settling these questions which the honourable and learned member has suggested would do, those provided in the Bill will best serve the needs of the situation.",101
804,Mr SPENCE,Unknown," We have had two conflicting views put forward by the Opposition. The honourable member 'for Kooyong objects to contracts being submitted to the Minister because he holds that it is improper to require a disclosure of any arrangement that may be made between employer and employee. On the other hand, the honourable and learned member for Corinella thinks that contracts should be open for the inspection of the unions concerned. A point that is worthy of consideration is that it is it essential that no one shall be brought to Australia under deceptive conditions. Hence the value of submitting the agreements for inspection before the departure of the immigrants for Australia. They must be submitted to some one, and there should be no objection to their being submitted to trusted officials of the Commonwealth, because, of course, we know that the Minister is only the head of the Department which will deal with the matter. The objection under the existing law was that some persons were kept waiting whilst their agreements were being fixed up. The trouble in connection with the six hatters arose because they were detained until their employer chose to complv with the law. The object of this clause is to remedy that, and to provide that where it is shown that the contract made is a fair one, the persons introduced under it shall be admitted without any trouble.",101
805,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) The more I consider the question, and listen to the conflicting views expressed, the more inclined I am to revert to my own opinion that the best way in which to deal with matters of this kind is to impose heavy penalties for any infringement of the law. I venture to say that if that be done in this case, those concerned will not begin any "" monkeying "" with these contracts in the way suggested by honourable members.",102
806,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Suppos e there is collusion, as there was in the case of the six potters ?",102
807,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If there is collusion, it will not be long before it is revealed. I believe the six potters, ancl also the six hatters, were members of a union, and, in such circumstances, do honourable members imagine that it is possible that information concerning collusion will not leak out?",102
808,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Would it not be better that men should not be brought here until their agreements have been looked into ?,102
809,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This Bill will not prevent them being brought here, because, as I would remind the honourable member, the agreement is only to be submitted before the men land in Australia. All we need do is to say that such-and-such things are wrong, and then, if we impose stiff penalties on those who do them, we may be sure that very few will be found prepared to run the risk involved. I have suggested an easy and effective means to accomplish what we are all aiming at, while at the same time we should leave the door wide open, and thus do away with an objectionable feature of our legislation, which is besmirching our reputation. Some honourable members have admitted that they are supporting this Bill because they believe that it contains more restrictions than does the existing Act, and we are glad to have had that confession from them. We shall soon know the value of this BiTl for the purpose which it has been ostensibly introduced to achieve.",102
810,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown," The - more these proceedings are protracted, the more humiliated I feel to think that the great Federal Parliament is wrestling at this hour of the morning with a proposal to put obstacles in the way of the admission of a few British immigrants under contract. The great point is that we do not desire that any one should be brought here to upset the industrial arrangements of the Commonwealth, and we need to be sure that the measure we pass will carry out that idea. The question whether men have sufficient skill in connection with any particular industry is one which should be dealt with not by the Minister, but by a judicial tribunal. How is the Minister to get his evidence? It will not be sworn testimony, and I suppose he will take the word of some secretary to a union as to whether or not men possessing certain skill are to be obtained in the Commonwealth. I cannot understand why all this opposition is offered by the Prime Minister to the idea of getting the matter settled in the way proposed. I know that a number of his supporters are against one provision to which he objects being omitted. I think that he ought to enable us to deal with this, point as soon as possible, and let us get home. There are a number of divisions to be taken. I myself have three or four amendments to move. In view of the important interests which are involved, a great deal more consideration ought to be given to the Bill than can be given in these circumstances. We should not be forced to pass a crude measure, which will bring us into greater disrepute in the old country. No one here wishes to alter the industrial conditions. It appears to me that a small committee, consisting of three or four members selected from each side of the Chamber, could quickly put the Bill/ in a form in which it could be unanimously agreed to. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 5The Minister shall approve the terms of the contract only(1) - whe n a copy is filed with him, and, so requires, is verified by oath; and (2) if in his opinion(a) the contract is not made in contemplation of or with a view of affecting an in- ployes as AA-ould the employer. It is not dustrial dispute; and (b) there is difficulty in the employer's taining within the Commonwealth a worker of at least equal skill and ability; and (r) the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment are as, advantageous to the contract immigrant as those current for workers of the sume class at the place where the contract is to be performed",102
811,Mr KELLY,Unknown," I have 'a suggestion to make, which will not alter the substance of the clause, but will give a greater discretion to the Minister, and that is to substitute the word "" may "" for the word "" s h all "" in the first line.",103
812,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,That would destroy the whole-Bill.,103
813,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not propose to go so far asthat. I only suggest that? the Minister shall be empowered to disapprove if he thinks fit when a copy of the contract is filed with him. The effect will be the same, but the Minister will have a greater, discretion.",103
814,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Muc h too great, I think. Mr KELLY ! - It is a discretion which the Minister ought to have in a case of this sort. . A situation might arise when it might be necessary for the Minister to exercise a discretion, and he would always be responsible to the House.",103
815,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown," I think that the suggestion of the honourable member would permit of a degree of variety in the decisions of different Ministers which would introduce a highly undesirable element of uncertainty. At present we insure uniformity, so far as Ave can, by laying doAvn conditions which every Minister will be called upon to obserA-e. He will haA-e to look at three points, and to satisfy himself thereon. If it Avere left optional one Minister might drop one condition', and another Minister might drop another oondition, and the consequence Would be that there Would be no uniformity. In the circumstances, I do not think that the Avidening of the discretion to that extent is desirable.",103
816,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown," In my speech on the second reading I suggested. Contract [REPRESENTATIVES.] Immigrants Bill. for certain reasons, the propriety of omitting paragraph b of sub-clause 2. I do not think it is possible for the Minister, if he no matter how AveM he may be informed by his officers, to be in as good a position to judge as to the qualifications of em1 reasonable to assume that an employer obAvould ""go beyond the CommonAvealth, and incur the cost and attendant risk of bringing in employees, if he could get men her.; at the same rate of Avages. It) is only in special cases that an employee AA-ould wish to bring in men, and Avhen he does he is expected to take the risk of the Minister or an officer saying that he is not entitled to land them.",103
817,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Unde r this clause the employer is supposed to submit the contract beforehand.,103
818,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"That means that before a man can move in his business he wil I have to consult the Minister. Take the recent case of some Australians, Avho, when travelling in other countries, purchased stock, and secured men to bring them out. HOAV could they possibly haA-e consulted the Minister beforehand? To my mind it is impossible to deal with every case which may arise. We place ourselves as a community in an absurd position Avhen difficulties of this kind arise. I do not object to restrictions on immigration, but Ave should alloAV the law to be administered Will common sense. To make the Minister the judge of the qualifications of a man is absurd, unless Avhat is meant is that the Minister shall declare in eA'erv case that the Would-be employer could suit himself better in Australia. There are in Australia ploughmen better than any others in the Avorld, but eA'ery farmer knows that a man may be a first-class ploughman, and unable to manage a team of horses, or a good man ivith horses in the paddock, but knoiving nothing of their management in the stable. Fortunately, some of our farmers haA-e been able to visit the old country, and Avhen there a man might see ploughmen Avh'om he would recognise as possessing an unusual combination of qualifications, and might, therefore, desire to bring out ivith him to Australia. But could that haA-e been done as the ISAV has hitherto been administered ?",103
819,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes .,103
820,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,That is neAvs to me.,103
821,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I should have no hesitation in admitting such men under the circumstances described by the honourable member,",104
822,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"But the trouble to describe the circumstances. In the cases to which I refer, it would have been possible to comply with the conditions down in this clause. I , therefore, the Government to consent to the omission of paragraph b of sub-clause 2. It is by not reasonable to assume that any employer of labour would import to Australia a man who was not possessed of special others, abilities, because, after be got him here, he would have to pay him the rates of wages obtained locally. That is an ample safeguard.",104
823,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown," I submit that the vision to which the honourable member takes imported ? exception is not more stringent than that in the existing law. The Immigration Rehatters; striction Act excludes "" workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required in Australia,"" whereas under the Minister may approve of a contract if in his opinion there is difficulty in ing within the Commonwealth "" a worker of at least equal skill and ability.""",104
824,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Does the Prime Minister mean that the existing law implies that there must be no one in Australia possessing the skill required?,104
825,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"-That there is no one possessing that skill available where wanted. Cases such as the honourable member for Moira has referred to are comparatively rare, but would not occasion anv difficulty. I think that a ploughman chosen under cretion. the circumstances which he has mentioned, might fairly be admitted. As I indicated when moving the second reading, contracts affecting one individual only, of whom would be employer has conceived ahigh opinion, will be viewed differently from contracts for the importation of 50, 100, or .1,000 men. Each contract considered in relation ber of men to which it applies, as well as in relation to all the other circumposedstances of the case. It is only when it is proposed to introduce men in large numbers that a provision like that of paragraph b is required. Without such a safeguard,,bour market in any part of Australia might be injuriously and unnecessarily flooded.",104
826,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Will the Minister the provision so as to make it' apply only the importation of men in large numbers?,104
827,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There is room for a common-sense application of the law under the strictest interpretation of the provision, so that there is no need for any such amendis ment. Paragraph b is intended to apply, not only to such cases, as those mentioned imby the honourable member for Moira-in laid which the immigration would not be proask hibited-bu t to cases differentiated from them by the number of men concerned and other circumstances. It is desirable that the Government should be satisfied that men are not being imported merely to displace and this provision will not only prevent that being attempted, but will also act as a warning to those who might otherwise in itself be disposed to make the attempt.",104
828,Mr KELLY,Unknown, Will this provision apply to the introduction of five proor six men-suc h as the hatters who were,104
829,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It did apply to the six but, in that cftse^, the employer refused to obey the law. Each case must be judged on its merits. In that case the the clause, , law was flouted.",104
830,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"We have to trust to the obtainMinister implicitly. When I suggested a wider scope, the honourable and learned gentleman said that it was too wide.",104
831,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It was very wide.,104
832,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Prime Minister then suggested that it would give too much discretion. How far will the discretion of the Minister extend in cases in which it is proposed to introduce only one individual ?,104
833,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The metric system has not yet been applied to the measurement of dis,104
834,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Prime Minister must know how it is intended to administer this provision. We are in the dark on the subthe ject. We have only his assurance. If the Minister is to satisfy himself as to the necessity for the introduction of any workmen, the Bill will accentuate the difficulties will be under which we have been labouring for to the num- .the last two years. Amendment (by Mr KENNEDY) proThat paragraph 6, sub-clause 2, be left out.",104
835,Mr TUDOR,Unknown," I trust that the the laamendment will not be agreed to. It is extremely difficult to prevent the introduction of men under contract to replace amend workers who are already in the Commonto wealth. When the six hatters were introduced there was no difficulty about procuring all the men who were required. Anderson admitted that he turned awav from his factory some men who were as competent as those who were afterwards introduced from England. I have a copy of a letter from the New South Wales Felt Hatters' Society, the majority of the members of which were brought out under contract. The letter reads as follows:N EW SOUTH WALES FELT HATTERS' SOCIETY. Trades H all, Sydney, Sth November, 1905. F. G. Tudor, Esq., Dear Sir,- I am instructed to inform you that at the last meeting we unanimously carried a resolution against amending the Contract Clauses of the Immigration Restriction Act. We believe that it is only a move on the part of the Employers' Federation to give them an opening to import as many workmen into the country as they think fit; and get the labour market over-stocked, so as to bring wages down. Nearly every member of our Society was present at the meeting at which this resolution was carried. I remain, & c , I find that the name of Samuel Grimshaw appears amongst those of the second batch of six hatters who were introduced under contract. Mr Grimshaw is now the secretary of the society, and apparently the men who were brought out under contract desire, now that they know the exact position o i affairs, that the introduction of other men under conditions similar to those which applied to their own case shall be prevented.",104
836,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"They want to keep the 'trade to themselves; they are a mean, narrow-minded crowd.",105
837,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If the amendment were carried, it would be impossible to prevent the market from being flooded, and, in view of the fact that in most trades there are plenty of skilled artisans available, I think that we should take measures to guard against such a contingency as that indicated in the letter which I have read.",105
838,Mr KELLY,Unknown," The honourable member for Yarra has told us in effect that there is a flaw in the Act, in so far that six hatters, who had no right to come here, were admitted into the Commonwealth. I would ask the honourable member whether the provisions now under consideration were introduced in order to remedy that defect ?",105
839,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,They do not remedy it .,105
840,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Do they not go to some extent in the direction that the honourable member desires ? Mr Mr WATSON - Is there anything else that the honourable member would like to know ?,105
841,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"There are a number of other things that I should like to know. The statement of the honourable member for Yarra has made me suspect that the Bill has been introduced, not for the purpose described by the Prime Minister, but rather with a view to impose still further obstacles in the way of immigration, such as is needed to enable us to properly develop this by the above Society country.

842,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown," I intend presently to move an amendment to this effectThat the following words be added to subclause c : - "" Provided that this clause shall apply to immigrants who are citizens of the United Kingdom."" I Shall not add more than a word or two to the arguments I used when speaking on the. second reading fo show the necessity for a provision of this kind. Throughout this Bill , foreigners and citizens of Britain are treated exactly alike; but surely there ought to be some exception made in favour of our own fellow-countrybe men. The least we can do, in our own of interests, is to remove the cause of the plaint by the press of Great Britain, that we apply conditions which Great tain does not apply to Australians-that are treating them absolutely as foreignersby placing some such exemption as I prodeliberately pose in the measure. I do not go so far as to ask that there shall be any exception which will allow British citizens to gaged so as to interfere with industrial ment. disputes in Australia, or to reduce wages and impair the conditions which prevail here. I propose this amendment in order that the press of Great Britain shall have no excuse for informing their readers that a Britisher is unable to obtain employment in Australia until a Minister, who depends on the votes of Australians, has taken care that preferential employment is given to cover Hindoos? every man in this country able and willing to take the position. I have already pointed out that, with the restrictions in regard to do so. wages and other conditions of labour, there is no likelihood of any contract being entered into unless an employer is opinion that he is unable to the skill which he requires. Why should the employer pay passage money, submit British subjects."" to delay, and incur the risk of men turning out unsatisfactory, if he can spot the skill desired. Under the circumstances, there is no fear that contracts will be made except in cases of absolute necesthat sity. That being so, why should we say that, so long as there is a man disengaged in a. particular industry in Australia, must be given employment before any of our British Tellow-subjects are admitted? dom ., I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, and thus, instead of ing a declaration to the effect I have indicipal Act. cated, will make it known to the press and public of Great Britain that Australia 1 some difference between the people of the mother land, who have given us our constitution and country, and the most desirable or undesirable of foreigners. not That ""is all I have to say upon the matter. I desire the Ministry and their supporters to make it clear whether they are determined to rigidly exclude our fellow-countrymen in Great Britain from admission to the Commonwealth under contract unless the employer seeking to engage them is Great satisfied that he cannot get locally the skilled labour that he requires for his industry. That is the situation which will created if we pass the present provisions the Bill. Simply because, in the opinion comof the Minister-wh o may know little or nothing about the matter-ther e are two or Brithree men in the Commonwealth who are we capable of filling the position for which an immigrant has been imported, are we U» exclude our fellow-countrymen and to retard the development of our industries""? These, I think, constitute the best be enreasons why we should adopt the amend",106
843,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,What is the amendment?,106
844,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I proposed to insert at the end of the sub-clause the words ""provided that paragraph b of this sub-clause shall not apply to citizens of the United Kingdom."" M i . WATSON - Would that proposal",106

854,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The words British subjects, unless otherwise provided by law "" might meet the case.",107
855,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I thank the honourable and learned member for his suggestion. Has the Prime Minister any objection to accepting the amendment with the proviso which is now in the Bill ?,107
856,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"At the present time, British subjects are only prohibited from entering the Commonwealth to the extent that the educational test is applicable to them. I suppose that the suggestion of the honourable member would meet the situation.",107
857,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I quite recognise that there is no reason why Canadians should be excluded.,107
858,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,What about the Maoris; they are closer to us than anvbodv else?,107
859,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I move That at the end of sub-clause 2 the following words be inserted :- "" Provided that paragraph b of this sub-clause shall not apply to British subjects.""",107
860,Mr WATSON,Unknown," I think that the use of the words "" British subjects,"" without a proper definition, would be too broad a provision.",107
861,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Altogethe r too broad.,107
862,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It would apparently cover all British subjects.,107
863,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That is not intended.,107
864,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I know, from what the subjects. honourable member has said, that he does not intend it to apply to the native subjects of His Majesty in India, Hong Kong, and Singapore.",107
865,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable and learned member for Corio has pointed out that there is a prohibition of such perown sons in the original Act.,107
866,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"But that might lead to a certain degree of confusion in the minds of those who have an opportunity to connomic sider only this particular measure. I think is based. that the idea generally is worthy of consweating, sideration, and perhaps the Prime. Minister will be able to suggest some phraseology meet the position.",107
867,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown," I hope tfrat the Comthe mittee clearly understands what is proposed, and that the honourable member for North Sydney will correct me if I make any error in the statement of his proposition. We are here dealing with considerations which every Minister administering this law is to be called upon to take into account in either accepting or rejecting a proposed contract. First of all, he has to be satisfied that the contract is not made in contemplation of an industrial dispute. The proposal of the honourable member is that that provision shall still apply, and that clause 9, which deals with the prohibition of immigrants intended to be brought out in connection with industrial disputes, shall still apply to all British subjects, and, in fact, to every one outside Australia. Passing over the provisions of paragraph b for the moment, we come to paragraph c, which requires the"" Minister to be satisfied that the remuneration and the terms and conditions of employment set forth in a contract are as advantageous as those current in Australia. That condition also is to apply to British subjects, and to all others without restriction. But the honourable member for North Sydney's proposal is to single out condition b, which the Minister has also to take into account, as to whether or not there is a difficulty in obtaining labour of the kind provided for in the contract, where it is proposed to introduce the contract immigrants. In that case there is to be an extension. The provision is to apply to all people, whether white or coloured, except those whom the honourable member has, in brief phraseology, designated as British subjects.",107
868,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Whit e British,107
869,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is the intention. I have suggested to my honourable and learned colleagues a phrase which will carry out that proposition, and they are examining it. I am sure that the fact of our being able to discriminate in favour of our kith and kin will be acceptable to every honourable member. The difficulty has been to .discover a means by which this can be done effectively, without impairing the ecoconsiderations on which this measure In State legislation against or similar practices, we have not hesitated to discriminate against our own to fellow citizens, in order to compel them to provide what we believe to be a fitting standard of living for people of our race. In consideration of this measure, it cert'amly did not occur to me until the honourable member proposed it that it was possible so to sever a particular fraction of these provisions, so as to make such an exception. The question of making an exception in a general way had occurred, and had been considered. But, in relation to any particular clause it was not found possible to make such a condition without making a breach in the whole measure. I arn inclined to think, from the consideration I have given it,- that the honourable member for North Sydney has hit upon an ingenious means by which this differentiation can be made without materially impairing the effect of the Bill. It may be that it would lead to the introduction of persons under contract for whom work would not be already waiting, but who would have to create, so to speak, the work in which they were to be engaged. In agricultural pursuits that would be easy. Where land is available, labour can be applied to it, and can make its own employment; so that this proposal would: apply under this sub-clause only when contract immigrants were brought out in relation to a given trade or calling in this country, giving employment to a limited number of persons. There is, of course, the safeguard that the Minister will have power to review every agreement and to consider it as a whole. This sub-paragraph, with this new qualification, would also come in for consideration. In the circumstances, therefore, it appears to me that the proposition is one which we might well put into shape. I think that what is desired might be met by the insertion at the commencement of paragraph b of the wordsExcept in the case of British subjects born in the United Kingdom or their descendants born in any part of the British EmpiTe.",107
870,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,That would include some coloured people.,108
871,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If it would, we can apply the test in such cases. I think what I have suggested will do in the meantime- that is, until there is a further opportunity to consider it. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr DUGALD THOMSON) proposed - That the fol!owing_words be inserted at the commencement of paragraph b :- "" except in the case of British subjects born in the United Kingdom or their descendants born in any part of the British Empire.""",108
872,Mr FRAZER,Unknown," I must 1 confess that I do not like this amendment. The extraordinary enthusiasm with which it is received by honourable members, who have endeavoured in every possible way to break down this provision, is sufficient to convince me that it should be very carefully considered. I think the amendment is one to which the trade unionists and organized workers generally of Australia may take serious exception. We have always asserted our willingness to welcome with open arms any person who will come to this country with a desire to improve the conditions of labour, or, at least, without any desire to drag them down.",108
873,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The remuneration clauses and those' affecting terms and conditions remain.,108
874,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is so, but under this amendment, notwithstanding the fact that there may be hundreds, or thousands, of unemployed available for employment in any particular industry, it will be possible for an employer to go outsid'e, and import men under contract to still further swamp the labour market.",108
875,Mr LEE,Unknown,And pay their passages?,108
876,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"There are any number of unscrupulous employers, who would be prepared to take advantage of this amendment, to import contract labour to break down the trade unionism that exists in this country, or to lower the conditions of labour. I am not surprised that the amendment should meet with the approval of honourable members who desire to open wide the door, and to drag down the unionism whose power they fear at election times. But those who are desirous of maintaining a high, standard of living in Australia, and who believe that persons already here should be provided with employment beforeothers are admitted to swamp the labour market, will not be so ready to accept it.",108
877,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Person s cannot be introduced in connection with, or in contemplation of, an industrial disoure.",108
878,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"There might be no contemplation of an industrial dispute. Suppose that in an industry one hundred men were out of employment, and the employer imported fifty men. Could that be interpreted to be in contemplation of an industrial dispute. This amendment is submitted at 3 o'clock in the morning; it s ; practically sprung upon the Committee.",108
879,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yesterday - morning I said that I intended to move the amendment, so that it cannot be said to have been sprung upon the Committee.",108
880,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I did not hear the honourable member announce his intention. I hope that the amendment will' not be - accepted, because it would enable a number of unscrupulous employers, if they were to get into a federation, to break down the conditions with which the workers of the Commonwealth are blest. If we are to extend any preference, I am prepared to go so far as to disallow a contract made under any conditions with a foreigner; but I am not'prepared to give an employer the right to import labour when the home market is already supplied.",109
881,Mr WATSON,Unknown," I do not anticipate from this amendment any dangers such as those which are apprehended by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. What, in my view,..was aimed at in the first place by the prohibition of contract labour was the prevention of the introduction of men to participate in a labour dispute which was either pending or in existence, or to work at a lower rate of remuneration or for longer hours or under worse conditions than those which were current here, and also to insure that men were not deceived :.nto accepting conditions which they would not have accepted if they had been aware of those which existed here. These were the arguments which were advanced in support of the provision when it was submitted in the first session of the Parliament. To my mind, there can be no possible objection to the amendment, because I do not consider that the employers would be likelv in any large degree, if at all-, to bring in a number of men at great expense to receive the same rate of wages, to work the - same number of hours, and under the same conditions generally as were current, unless it was in a case where a dispute was pending, and where they might be prepared temporarily tb observe all the conditions, with a view to breaking the back of a strike. I have known blacklegs to be paid temporarily much more than the standard rate, and much more than the strikers were asking for, in order to break the back of a strike. M.r. FRAZER - And this amendment would give encouragement to that.",109
882,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"No . Evidently the honourable member has overlooked the fact thac paragraph a provides, not only against a strike which is in existence, but also against a strike which is pending, and that covers all the ground.",109
883,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,In actual practice it is not worth much.,109
884,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If paragraph a, which refers to a sfJrike which is pending, or n existence, is worth very little, then paragraph b, which does not refer to either of those twd cases, which may be determined with comparative ease, cannot be worth anything, so that, on my honourable friend's showing, it is not worth bothering about. In my view, however, paragraph a is worth a very great deal, because it should be easily demonstrable to the Minister that a strike was either in existence or pending. Assuming that men would come out to Australia, and that on their arrival no strike was in existence or pending, the only excuse for a strike afterwards would be that it was proposed to pay them lower remuneration, to work them longer hours,, or to observe other conditions which were unfair or improper.",109
885,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Suppos e that they gave the contract men full work, and put the free men off three days a week, as has been done here?",109
886,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If the contract men were unionists, I take it that they would not be prepared to accept an advantage of their fellow-employees.",109
887,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,They might not be able to help themselves.,109
888,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If the men were unionists they would observe the current conditions, and not take an unfair advantage of their fellow-employees. But if they were non-unionists I assume that there would be a strike, whether they were under contract or not. So that practically the position is not altered by the fact that the men may be under contract. So long as they are working under Australian conditions, getting Australian rates of waeres. and observing Australian hours of labour, it does not seem to me that there is anv justification for insisting upon this provision.",109
889,Mr WATKINS,Unknown," If I recollect rightly, during the debates on the I mmigration Restriction Bill in this Chamber, something more was considered than the points which have been touched upon by the honourable member for Bland. Great stress was laid upon the fact that labour should not be brought here under contract in connection with trades or callings in which there was already a sufficiency in the Commonwealth.",109
890,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"That is not so. If that had been pointed out, a great many would have voted against the provision.",110
891,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"That was a consideration then, and should be a consideration now. I cannot understand the desire to take this provision out of the Bill. All it does is to prohibit the introduction of labour under contract, unless there is a difficulty in getting workmen in Australia. No one objects to the importation of labourers or artisans belonging to trades in which there is now an insufficiency of workers. But these restrictions are justified when it is proposed to import labour in trades which are now full. The argument which we hear from members of the Opposition, in reference to the American law, is that America imposes restrictions on 'immigration 'because she has plenty of artisans.",110
892,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Agains t whom, the employers are conspiring.",110
893,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Wheneve r employers wish to reduce wages, they try to create a surplus of labour. I have given a case to-niVht in which men were brought from America to work in a mine in a district which I represent, and I venture to say that they are now not being employed half their time. I admit that it could not be proved that they were brought here under contract, but it is not likely that they would come from America unless they had a contract, express or implied. Was there any need to bring those men to Australia, seeing that the coal miners alreadv here are not working half their time? Would the deputy leader of the Opposition favour the importation of men from England or elsewhere when men here were not fully employed ?",110
894,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should rebel againsi) it.,110
895,Mr LEE,Unknown,Would not the miners rebel against it by striking?,110
896,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"They cannot help themselves, and in New South Wales they cannot strike.",110
897,Mr LEE,Unknown,They have struck in the honourable member's electorate.,110
898,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"The action of which T am complaining resulted in the stoppage of a colliery in the electorate adjoining my own. No harm will be done by leaving the provision in the Bill. It offers no affront to any Britisher, or to any one else, and [218] it is necessary in order to prohibit the im1 portation of labour at a time when the market is already fully supplied. There will never be a strike when there are two men looking for any job that is offering, and employers always try to create that position before attempting to bring down wages. I am very disappointed that the Government propose to accept the amendment.",110
899,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown," I am not opposed to the amendment simply because it has been moved by a member of the Opposition, but the only reason given for it by the honourable member for North Sydney was that, if it were adopted, the people and the press of England would know that we are trying, by giving them concessions, to allay the irritation which is supposed to have been caused by the statements which have appeared in English newspapers. That reason does not appeal to me. We have heard too much about the impression which has been created in England byabsolute!v false statements about our ; legislation, and'I question whether the insertion of a proviso such as is proposed will affect those who have vilified us, and will continue to do so, no matter what action we mav take. I am surprised that the Prime Minister has so hastilv accepted the amendment. . What impression will it create on the mind of the Britisher? We cannot''tell him that we have repealed our legislation against the admission of labour under contract. All ""we can. say is that he may make a contract with an Australian employer, subject to certain disabilities, but that the employer wiM not be called upon to satisfy the Minister of the existence of certain conditions in Australia. Such a concession will not be worth anything in the eyes of the British public, and, seeing that that is so, and that the amendment will open the door to great dangers, I ask the Government whether it is worthwhile to accept it? I should much prefer to see the clause postponed, so that the whole matter mav be calmly considered. I am sorry that the honourable member for Bland is not here, because I wish to reply to some of his observations. I said, by way of interjection, that paragraph a was not of much value in actual practice. My reason for making that statement is that it would be impossible for any one beyond the employers or employees concerned fo know that a dispute was in contemplation. Some three years ago, the Western Australian Government, without consulting any one, entered into contract with twelve boiler-makers in Great Britain, who undertook to serve for two years in the work-shops at Fremantle. one knew anything about what was being done until the men were on the water, it would have been impossible for any to satisfy the public, that they were being introduced in contemplation of any dispute. Those who were in the work-shops, howand ever, knew that when these men arrived some change would be made which would possible seriously affect the position of employees. As a matter of fact, after the boiler-makers had been at work months, a dispute was forced on the workmen, and a strike was averted only by an offer to submit the whole matter to arbitration. It was afterwards proved beyond all rica, doubt that the boiler-makers had been troduced in contemplation of action taken that would lead to a dispute, and probably result in a strike. The Governstance ment were relying upon these twelve boilerwere makers to stand by them, but when the pute took place they ranged themselves side their fellow-workmen. Paragraph does not accomplish the purpose that it designed to fulfil, because it cannot certained when an employer contemplates action that will probably bring about strike. In view of the fact that the whole value of the clause rests upon paragraph b",110
900,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Paragrap h c is also very important.,111
901,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"Yes , but it must be remembered that the wages of Australian workmen depend very largely upon the numdown ber of men who are wanting work. No be union can keep up rates to what it regards as the proper standard if a large number of its members are out of work. Paragraph b is really the kernel of the clause, and trust that the Government will reconsider the position, and ascertain whether some other words cannot be inserted which will have the desired effect without impairing the powers which are intended to be conwill ferred upon the Minister. We should not, for the sake of placating our opponents, weaken the main provision of the measure.",111
902,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown," I am in sympathy with the expressed intention of the mover of the amendment. If it necessary to bring workmen into Australia, preference should certainly be given to Britishers, but the amendment goes a great deal further than some honourable members a seem to realise. According to my reading of it, whether there be a difficulty or not in procuring skilled labour in any trade, no No obstacle will be placed in the way of any employer introducing as many Britishers as and he pleases. Therefore, the door, will be one wide open, so far as British subjects are concerned. If , for instance, we had 5,000 carpenters in the Commonwealth at present, 5,000 other artisans following that calling were introduced here, it would be imto keep up the j>resent rale of wages some of the for any length of time.",111
903,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That is an absurd confor six tingency to contemplate.,111
904,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Something of that kind has happened in Amealthough under the laws of in that country, no contract labour can being be introduced. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has mentioned an inin which sixteen working jewellers introduced into Victoria because the disworkmen in the trade wished to form themalongselves into a union. Does the honourable a member for Boothby mean to tell me that is the same course could not be followed by be asemployers in other trades? I venture to say that if twenty men were added to the a number of artisans in South Australia engaged in the trade to which the honourable member formerly belonged, a very unsatisfactory state of affairs would be brought about, and the employers would soon move in the direction of reducing wages. In many trades, ten additional men would be sufficient, and in some five only would be required, to enable the employers to bring wages. I am entirely opposed to men ng brought in here under contract, because ; if work is available new-comers experience no difficulty in finding employment. If workers are required, let us have BriI tishers in preference to foreigners. I am disgusted to think that some ship-owners ' are so unpatriotic in some cases as to even sail under a foreign flag in order to be able to employ foreigners. If the Government provide that in case of workers being wanted here, preference shall be given to Britishers, they shall have my support; but I object to leave it to an unscrupulous employer, in connection with a strike, or with a view to reducing wages, to be allowed to bring in as many contract artisans be as he thinks fit. Every member of the Labour Party must be opposed to such proceedings. We have said that the door must be shut, and it is shut; and yet it is proposed now to re-open it. If the honourable member who submitted the amendment is in favour of the view I am expressing, he certainly did not succeed in conveying his meaning; but I take it that his intention is to give preference to Britishers in case artisans or labourers are required. I am sorry the honourable member is not here, so that he might tell us what he really does mean. I ask the Frime Minister whether my interpretation of the proposal is or is not the correct one, namely, that it will enable an employer to import Britishers under contract, whether or not there is employment for them.",111
905,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown," The honourable member for Hindmarsh referred to my own trade of engine-fitter, but I can assure him that I do not know of a single instance in which men in that trade have'' been brought to South Australia under contract.",112
906,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,That does not affect the future.,112
907,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,-We are now dealing with the present.,112
908,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"It is not a fair case to put, anyhow.",112
909,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"-That case was instanced, not by me, but by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I can assure that honourable member that, so far as my trade is concerned, it has certainly not been injured by contract labour.",112
910,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Me n cannot be brought in under contract under the existing Act.,112
911,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"My experience dates from a time previous to the operation of that Act. As a matter of fact, engine-fitters are coming, from Scotland particularly, to Australia by almost every boat, and frequently there are more here than can be absorbed, with the result that wages are reduced. The reduction of wages, however, is in no way caused by contract labour, because all these men come in ""on their own."" There was one case in South Australia in which engineers were brought in on contract, but that was in connection with the strike; and the attempt to reduce wages and impair the conditions of labour was resisted very strongly. Such cases as that, however, are provided against in the Bill .",112
912,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Fulton's men were brought in under contract.,112
913,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Thos e men were brought in on conditions widely different from those prevailing in Australia. Had Fulton's been required to pay Australian 2 rates of wages, they would never have gone to the expense of importing those men from Scotland. Except in connection with a strike, or an attempt to reduce wages, employers will never go to the expense of bringing men from Great Britain or Canada. I do not believe in imposing one unnecessary restriction in connection with immigration. There can be no object in an employer going to Europe for men, and paying them the Australian rate of wages, when there are sufficient men available on the spot.",112
914,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,I can tell the honourable member that such a thing has been done with the object of ultimately reducing wages.,112
915,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That object could be achieved now without importing men, because the employers are federated, and could shift men about from one place to another. In my opinion, it is sought to impose an unnecessary restriction in order to fight what, after all, is a myth.",112
916,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The honourable member admits that it is much easier to reduce wages when there is surplus labour in a particular industry ?,112
917,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Of course it is. But surplus labour is usually caused, not by men who are brought under contract, but by men who come here on their own account. The few cases in which men would be brought in under contract are not sufficient to justify what appears to be a blow at our British fellow-subjects. The few men who may come under contract can surely be absorbed in a population of 4,000,000. Our best protection, in my opinion, is our distance from Europe. The position of America is different, because for a few dollars men can be conveyed there from the Continent of Europe; and, hence, very stringent contract laws are necessary. If we find, of course, that the opening provided is availed of to the detriment of our own workmen, then will be the time to enact drastic remedial legislation. The proposal in the Bill would - serve no good purpose, and the amendment shows, at any rate, a desire on our part to discriminate in favour of British subjects.  took part in the discussion which took place upon the proposal not to admit contract immigrants to Australia when the Immigration Restriction Bill was under consideration, I have a distinct recollection that only two points were raised upon that occasion, We sought to guard against the introduction of men under contract during the progress of an industrial dispute, and also against their acceptance of a lower wage than that current in Australia in the industry in which they wished to engage. Reference to the Hansard report will show that question was being debated instances were quoted in which Italians had been introbers duced to work in the mines of Western Australia for less than half the ordinary rate of wage. The two points to which have referred were all that we contended then, and they are all that we ask for I shall never sanction the adoption of exclusive policy in this connection. honourable member for Newcastle has tended that immigrants may be imported to Australia, and a strike may subsequently result; but I would ask him if there is anything to prevent that occurring at the present time? Could not 500 contract immiwould grants be imported by the proprietors of cumstances. the Broken Hill mines, and could they riot discharge 500 of their present hands?",112

If the emcastle ployers wished to introduce contract laing half-time. bourers, and subsequently to discharge their present employees, they could do so today.",113
919,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I have known them to Australians. flood a colliery with men from England.  that has been done. At the same time, I do not believe that employers will bring men here under contract, and pay them Australian rates of wages, besides advancfied ing their steamer fares.",113
920,Mr STORRER,Unknown," I am prepared to allow any British subject to enter AusH tralia, so long as he subscribes to conditions similar to those which obtain here. Therefore,. I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for North SydIpffor ney. Whilst Australians are permitted to ment. open businesses in London without any let or hindrance, we ought to allow of the United Kingdom to enter the Commonwealth free from any restrictions. know men who are working in England day, and who are receiving just as wages as they can obtain in Australia.",113
921,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The honourable membe ber would allow contract labourers to be troduced here, whilst there are plenty of our own men idle.",113
922,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"That interjection shows that the honourable member does not understand the proposal. It appears to me that some honourable members wish to thrust their opinions down the throats of others. I have an opinion of my own, however, and when the I intend to exercise it .",113
923,Mr TUDOR,Unknown," Honourable memopposite have emphasized the fact that they desire to extend a preference to Britishers. I wish to grant a preference to those who I are already here.

I trust that the amendment will be altered, for I cannot vpfe for at in its present form"". r am prepared to give Britishers a preference over other workers from abroad, but I think that our first consideration should be for Australians.",113
933,Mr SPENCE,Unknown," Honourable members scarcely seem to recognise the enormous sacrifice that the Opposition are making in giving up the opportunity to ' raise the cry of the ""six hatters"" at the next general election. When one of our workers is thrown out of employment, what satisfaction he will derive from the knowledge that a fellow-Britisher has taken his place ! His wife and family will certainly enjoy the sentiment arising out of the situation. The honourable member for North Sydney has appealed to our patriotism, and we should not profess to be patriots unless we are prepared to sacrifice something. Why should not an Australian worker show his patriotism by handing over his billet to a Britisher? But, after all, I do not think that there is much in this proposal to occasion alarm. All that trade unionism has ever demanded from an employer is that he shall observe reasonable hours and conditions of labour. We object to a man discharging anemploye because he is a unionist, but we have never denied the right of an employer to engage whomsoever he pleases.",114
934,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I have taken part in a strike, because an employer declined to give a reason for discharging one of his hands.",114
935,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I have taken part in a dispute arising out of the dismissal of a man because he was a unionist. having regard to the other provisions of the Bill , I do not see that there is mucli reason to be alarmed at this proposal. I believe that the possibility of employers expending large sums of money in importing labour from abroad will be reduced.",114
936,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Hav e not the workers to make good that expenditure?,114
937,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Certainly . I am opposed to the introduction of contract labour under any conditions, and have never known of a case where men entering into a contract abroad to serve in Australia have not been-misled. One large firm in New South Wales has imported men supposed to have a special knowledge of certain machinery, and after learning all that they could teach them, has thrown them on the labour market. In the circumstances, however, if the Government areprepared to accept this amendment, I shall not strongly oppose it.",114
938,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) When I spoke to this question a few minutes ago, I said that an interpretation could be placed upon the amendment different from that given by the honourable member for North Sydney, and since discussing the matter with him, I have found that my statement is absolutely correct. I said that I should be prepared to give a preference to Britishers, as against other workers from abroad, but this amendment will go much further than that. I do not intend to forsake the principles of the Labour Party, for which I fought long before this Parliament was established, nor shall I break the pledges which I gave when on the hustings. T am opposed to the introduction of contract labour, and should have been pleased to see clause 3 in this Bill negatived; but as that has not been done, I do not wish its provisions to be weakened.",114
939,Mr FRAZ ER,Unknown," I should like to hear some expression of opinion from the leader of the Government on this amendment. I hope the honourable and learned gentleman will not be opposed to a modification of the proposal in the event of its being shown that it is likely to have the effect of directly supplanting Australian labour. The argument advanced from the other side, that an employer is not likelv to go to the expense of importing labourers from distant countries when men are t'o be had at his own door, is met by the fact But that it is invariablv a condition of these contracts that the workman shall, out of his first wages, refund the expense to which the employer has been put in importing him. I am credibly informed that shortly after the six hatters were introduced, the services of a number of tradesmen in the employment of the same manufacturer.were mysteriously dispensed with.",114

Clause 6(1) If before the Minister approves the terms of the contract the contract immigrant lands in Australia(4) the contract immigrant is liable to a. .penalty not exceeding Five pounds; (rf) the employer shall pay to the contract immigrant such specified sum of money (not exceeding Fifty pounds) as the Minister thinks sufficient, either to maintain the contract immigrant until he can be reasonably expected to find suitable employment or at the option of the contract immigrant to enable him to return to the country whence he came. The sum, when specified in writing by the Minister, shall be recoverable by the contract immigrant, .or by the Minister for him. (2) The foregoing provisions of this section do not npply where the contract immigrant{6) lands under a bond to the Commonwealth in such sum, with such sureties, and conditioned to be void in such events as the Minister approves.",114
942,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown," On behalf of the honourable member for Corinella, I move That paragraph 6, of sub-clause 1, be left out. Obviously a man who may be perfectly innocent of any desire to commit an offence, and who could not be expected to know the laws of the country of which he was not a citizen, should not be mulcted in a fine. ... 31 Mr DEAKI N (Ballarat-Minister of ... 6 External Affairs) - The effect of this provision is to prevent a contract immigrant from reaping the benefit of his own prac25 tical breach of the contract-that is to say, AYES. if he landed in Australia he would make the contract void and. become free. If that were done deliberately to take advantage of his employer, it was thought only fair that the contract immigrant should be subject to a penalty. '",115
943,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Suppos e that he were brought out under false pretences ?,115
944,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The contract immigrant Thomson, D. A. would be protected. If by his own act he could make the contract void, and he were not liable to a penalty, the contract would Cook, Hume be one-sided. The employer would Johnson, W. E. take all the risks, and the contract immiNOES. grant would have the opportunity of voiding the contract merely by landing before the terms of the contract had been approved. I do not consider the paragraph of much importance, because it is intended to meet a case in which the contract had not been submitted, to the Minister for approval. It would be made beforehand, and those who made it would take their chance. If , under these Circumstances, the Committee think it is equitable to strike out 'the paragraph, I am indifferent.",115
945,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," I think it is right to strike out the paragraph, because it seems'to me that it would deter a number of men from coming here. In addition to that, the Prime Minister recognises that, under paragraph d, there is always the employers' liability.",115
946,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown," Before ' the paragraph is struck out, there are two points which ought to be considered. In the first place, an employ^ might, after his passage had been paid, deliberately attempt to defraud the employer by voiding the contract. Would that be fair to the employer? Tn the second place, the paragraph is necessary, in order to meet a case of collusion with the employer to subvert the intention of the Act.",115
947,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"On the other hand, is it reasonable to expe:t that a contract immigrant could be familiar with our law ?",115
948,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"Practicall y the contract immigrant would know the terms of the contract before he came here, and certainly the agreement would be in his hands when he landed. I assume that unless a contract immigrant deliberately attempted to defraud his employer, or acted in collusion with the employer to subvert the intention of the Act, no Minister would ever think of imposing the penalty. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr DEAKIN ) toThat the word "" contract,"" wherever occurring before the word "" immigrant"" in paragraphs b and d of sub-clause 1, be left out.",115
949,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," Apparently, under paragraph b of sub-clause 2, a Minister would be bound to require at least two sureties. Would it not be better to say, "" surety or sureties,"" so long as the security given is sufficiently large? Amendment (by Mr DEAKIN ) toThat the word "" sureties,"" in paragraph b o i sub-clause 2, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" security.""",116
950,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," As this clause is one whose validity is likely to be tested in the Law Courts, there is another point to which I direct the Prime Minister's attention. A contract immigrant is defined as ""an immigrant to Australia."" But, according to Chambers' Dictionary, an immigrant is one who migrates or moves into a country, and a person does not become an immigrant until he has got inside the country in relation to which he is an immigrant. Placing this interpretation on the word, we are making liable to penalties persons who cannot become immigrants.",116

Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the Standing Orders be suspended enable the Bill to pass through all its remaining stages without delay. Report adopted. THIRD READING . 1 Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the Bill be now read a third time.,116
953,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) The stringency of these proposals has been considerably modified in their passage agreed through Committee^ and to that extent they are, in my judgment, more acceptable. But, nevertheless, the Bill will operate in the most restrictive way in regard to immigrants coming here under contract. The very machinery and structure of the Bil l will prove a formidable obstacle to the introduction of contract immigrants from oversea. Contracts will still have to be submitted to the Minister, and, in many cases, months of waiting, will be inagreed volved. Much irritating investigation will be indulged in, and, altogether, the provisions of the Bill will operate to our prejudice. I do not think that many contract immigrants will come in under the Bill . Employers will not take the trouble to comply with all the conditions required, and immigrants will prefer to go elsewhere. If an immigrant comes with a legitimate contract in his pocket, and happens to land before examination, he will still be liable to have the contract voided, and incur all the penalties provided. To that extent the Bill is very unsatisfactory, from my point of view. I think we might have reached 1 the desired end by means of the penalties provided for in the sub-clauses, which form the real kernel of the measure. For the rest, we might have relied upon the processes by which other wrong-doing is detected, and punished in the Commonwealth. We are making a new departure, and I am afraid that we shall find it to be an unsatisfactory one.",116
954,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown," What the honourable member for Parramatta has been pleased to call the stringency of this measure, has not been in any way modified. So f ar as it was stringent in the first instance, it remains so. It is less stringent than the original Act. But in another direction, the Committee at once took advantage of the happy suggestion made by to the honourable member for North Svdney. and agreed to make a distinction in favour of persons of our own blood and race, as against the rest of the outside world.",116
955,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Surely the Prime Minister will admit that that amounts to relaxing the stringency of the measure in that particular.,117
956,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It does not relax it, nor is it intended to relax it, so far as the main purposes of the Bill are concerned. But it is intended to express our true sentiment towards our own kith and kin, and towards the Empire with which we are proud to be associated. I omitted to make an amendment which was suggested by the honourable member for Newcastle, extending the time within which questions could be put to immigrants. An opportunity will be presented during the transmission of the Bill to another place to reconsider our amendments and the general character of the Bill. I have to thank honourable members for having enabled us by sitting late tonight to conclude the consideration of the measure. The day is still young, and I hope we shall be able to devote a good deal more of It to still further useful work. I am particularly indebted to honourable members on this side of the Chamber for having so far sacrificed their convenience, and I am obliged to honourable members of the Opposition, who appear now to have recovered their urbanity.

958,Mr KELLY,Unknown, I should like to know whether the Prime Minister can hold out any hope of honourable members catching their trains this afternoon ?,117
959,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That will depend upon the progress made. I doubt whether honourable members will be able to leave for their homes at the usual time.,117
960,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"We have had an exceptionally hard week, and as there has been Message No. 25. no obstruction of any kind, I think that we might be permitted to return to our homes in the usual way. It is not unreasonable to ask that the House should adjourn until entered Tuesday next. We had no warning that should be required to sit for such long hours this week, but we shall come fully only upon the prepared next week.",117
961,Mr CROUCH,Unknown, I should like shall to direct the attention of the Government to the necessity for placing Parliament substitution House in a sanitary condition.,117
962,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The Government are in This correspondence with the State authorities on the subject.,117
963,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The present conditions are dreadful, and must be most unhealthy. It appears that we are waiting for the R. C. BAKER, President. State Government to sewer the building, but I think that for our own sakes, and in order to make things decent-for that is the only word to use-it is incumbent on the Commonwealth Government to see that the sanitation is attended to at once. I believe that the sore throats which are prevalent amongst honourable members are largely attributable to the insanitary condition of the building. This matter ought certainly to be attended to in recess, and, the work, if not carried out by the State Government, ought to be undertaken by the Commonwealth Goveniment.",117
964,Mr KNOX,Unknown," I desire to supplement the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Corio. On one' or two evenings when we have had late sittings a number of honourable members, including myself, have suffered from sore throats, and, on consulting a medical man, I was informed that the cause was undoubtedly the insanitary condition of the building.' If the State"" Government will not sewer the building, I think that the Commonwealth Government should undertake the work on behalf of the State.",118

966,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The Electoral Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.35 a.m. (Friday).,118
