3,Mrs STONE,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I stand in this place so proud to speak for the first time as the member for Murray, representing communities in the Mallee, on the great northern plains and in the countryside and cities of the Goulburn-Murray Valley. For 32 years this was the seat of the great Country Party patriarch Sir John MCEwen. His special contribution to the young Australian nation, and to rural people in particular, will always be remembered. At the last election Sir John's successor, Bruce Lloyd, retired after 25 years of faithful work for his party and the electorate. This retirement opened theÂ· door for the coalition contest. We the Liberals had no branches or campaign funds in the contest and there was the challenge of manning more than 100 booths over 20,000 square kilometres. But all campaigns ultimately depend on the commitment and the resources of individuals. Over the course of the campaign the original 26 Liberals were joined by hundreds of individuals dedicated to supporting the candidate of iheir choice. I could go on for 20 minutes just listing the names of those magnificent men and women who put aside their usual occupations to join me as I crossed and recrossed the electorate, talking in the dairies, under the fruit trees, in the shops and in and out of the towns. It was nine weeks of unrelenting effort and huge enjoyment. I will never forget the friendship, generosity and plain hard work of the campaign teams in Echuca, Cobram, Shepparton, Numurkah, Mooroopna, down south and out to the speech in the west of the electorate. My partner in life played a key role and continues now in the demanding position as husband of the local member. I want to thank Douglas for our 26 years of happy marriage and I look forward to the years to come, working together in Murray. I was born and bred in the heart of the electorate-I am a sixth generation northern Victorian-so I have the very good fortune to belong to a very large and loyal clan. The Bawdens, Manns, Chalmers and Bennetts rallied the towns and the districts on the Loddon plains. I am grateful to that extended family; my wise and dedicated parents; my brother, Grant; his wife, Sharon; and, in particular, Rhonda Bennett, whose energy and organisational skills were, and continue to be, pivotal. I thank them all for taking the long, hard journey with me from December to March and from Murray to Canberra. The people of the Murray electorate are accustomed to long, hard roads and to overcoming what others would see as insunnountable odds. It all started in the winter of 1836. It would seem that that was a very good year. Major Sir Thomas Mitchell marched from Sydney to Port Phillip, crossing the Murray. He headed south and entered the country now in the centre of the Murray electorate. There he climbed Pyramid Hill and in the approved manner of the day, ignoring his own attendants and the Aboriginal owners, the Jajarawong, who were watching him closely, said: A land so inviting and still without inhabitants! As I stood, the first intruder on the sublime solitude of these verdant plains . . . I felt conscious of being a harbinger of mighty changes there. 'Australia Felix' he called it-an Eden, and he the only Adam. But only two years later, and this time at the height of summer, Joseph Hawdon climbed that same hill to look over Mitchell's shining paradise and he wrote: Altogether the scenery of an imposing character. The land, however, of the worse description; the plains have a sprinkling of small tufts of grass are for the most part covered with the salsuginous plant vulgarly called pig's face. But it was the major's vision-that first vision-that became the official line. And so the government's selection acts carved the area up into neat 360-acre blocks, supposedly sufficient for a family to farm and flourish. In the 1860s, land hungry diggers eagerly settled, among them my ancestors-the people of my mother's and father's families. We have their diaries describing the heart breaking struggle to cart water to stock and to resist and overcome the droughts and the floods. The great statesmen of the day, men like Alfred Deakin, searched for the key to unlock the potential of the wide, flat, fertile lands. They looked at Spain and the Americas. On 23 March 1886, more than 100 years ago, with due ceremony the Victorian government turned the first sod on the great northern plains to officially commence Australia's first public irrigation scheme. A river of butter, eggs, meat, wheat, fruit and wool flowed south to the markets and people flowed north. The value of the land double and trebled. The towns grew in the Goulburn Valley. The Italians, Dutch, Greeks, Turks and Albanians arrived and they planted the orchards and the vines to form a vibrant, hard working community. Multicultural Australia came of age in our part of the world. The early Goulburn, Murray and Torrumbarry irrigation systems were a marvel of earthen channels, wood and concrete structures, but the need for off-farm drainage was not understood. It simply was not catered for. Water entitlements, water rights, and pricing policy encouraged farmers to use more and more water to generate the social and economic benefits to the nation and to justify the very building of those massive irrigation structures. So the water was both a blessing and a curse. Pressure in the saline ground water systems grew, and as early as the 1920s salt was seeping from the river banks and the low lying areas were dying. I grew up at that time when some farmers were already second generation salt affected. We knew those farmers then as incompetent. There was a perception that such people had but not only ruined their farms but destroyed their families' heritage. In time, parts of my own family's farm began to die. It is impossible to convey to you the sense of loss at that time. That experience has affected me profoundly, and I will always be dedicated to the protection and rehabilitation of the environment. Today if you climb that hill you will see productive, sustainable agriculture and trees that were never there before. We have fought back the tide of salt in Murray through long term commitment and cooperative public and private sector action. No one person, one town, one government department can bring about basin or regional scale environmental protection. We have been very fortunate in that in the past there were governments which also were committed to cooperative action with the private sector. In the 1980s the Fraser government's ground water pumping incentive schemes gave the future back to the fruit and dairy sector. In the eighties and nineties, community-led planning, involving both the public and private sector, produced comprehensive complex catchment planning schemes. We have the strategies to manage the saline water tables. We know how to avoid the bluegreen algal blooms, how to sweeten acid soils and how to stop erosion and protect the catchments. We agree with the COAG principles for the future management of water resources, but cross-basin strategies need dedicated resources and public and private sector coordination. The coalition understands that and has responded in this new government to the environmental crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin. On 2 March the Australian public demonstrated its overwhelming support for this government and its detailed policies, including the environmental package. That package, as promised by our coalition government and approved by the people through a democratic process, is the key to our sustainable future. It will rehabilitate the heritage of our indigenincome ous people, our heritage and the foundation of the nation's food production. Let me assure-you that the future of agribusiness is worth fighting for. It contributes some 25 per cent of the nation's export earnings. Agribusiness in the Murray electorate leads Australia with the highest volume and value of production, processing and export of food and fibre. We grow the wheat, beef, fruit, vines and meats that are demanded in Asia. We are the home of Australia's dairy export industry. We manufacture the last few Australian owned icons on the supermarket shelves, like SPC, Ardmona, Rosella, Bega and Devondale. We are so good at what we do that the biggest and most technologically sophisticated food manufacturers-Snow Brand and Mitsubishi's Meiji-are now joint venturing with our own local dairy industries in the Goulburn Valley. As you all know, we are poised close by the world's fastest developing economies. We have the technology, the land and water resources to produce the type of chemical free product demanded by these newly emerging Asian societies. But while the Keating government talked a lot about the food bowl of Asia, our market share in food has slipped away to less than 10 per cent. Our bilateral relations-so important in food trade because all food markets internationally are managed and corrupt-with some of our biggest potential markets fell to an all-time low in the time of Keating. During the life of the Labor government farm debts accumulated to record levels, running at nearly $150,000.on the average broadacre enterprise in my electorate. Investment in farm plant and machinery dropped below the level needed to produce world competitive product. Our farmers' levels of education and training remained the poorest in the Western world. The people who make up our agribusiness sector are ageing. Too many are sick and tired and very angry. While the Murray electorate is at the forefront of agribusiness innovation, its per capita income averages amongst the nation's poorest 20 per cent. The rural communities which generate 25 per cent of the national export are becoming increasingly marginalised not only in terms of income but also in relation to access to the services essential to a reasonable quality of life. Our rural youth, descendants of the pioneers who overcame the harshest conditions, now take their own lives at rates which are amongst the highest in the Western world. Our farmers are price takers. The processes squeeze the primary producer. They have to to compete. A year of dedicated work growing wool, wheat, fruit, prime beef or lamb can cost as much as the market delivers. It is little wonder that growing up in my region is too often synonymous with leaving our region, leaving the family, leaving behind a community that struggles to staff the essential and voluntary services-the fire brigades, churches, sporting teams, the landcare groups, the industry organisations-that weld the people together and give them a forum where together they tackle those regional basin problems. Asset rich and income poor, too many of our small business people and farming families cannot pay for the education and training needed to give their children a chance elsewhere. Each year, fewer enter the work force with any experience of life beyond the bayside cities. This is just one of the factors contributing to the crisis in health care in my electorate. Medical practitioners and other health workers such as medical librarians and efficient medical administrators may be reaching a state of oversupply in the capitals, but their shortage in Murray sees us struggling to keep hospitals open and to maintain human services essential to the physical and mental well-being of our people. The elderly live in fear of the heart attack or the sudden fall. Parents with chronically sick children look to live elsewhere. We lack general practitioners as well as gynaecological, paediatric and psychiatric services. While rural population rates of chronic illness and industrial accident are far higher than in the general population, we have had a decade of neglect and misallocated resources, and we have no sense that the problem can be easily solved. This government at least recognises this and has a strategy to help us overcome it. While Australian society pays lip-service to the credo 'a fair go for all', it seems to the people from the country that most Australians have turned their backs on their fundamental needs. How can Australia capture the opportunities now represented before us in Asia? In my electorate, the city of Shepparton, a major inland food processing centre is choked with heavy transport traffic. Air freight facilities for the high value fresh product are hours away. We have inadequate, non-existent waste water treatments. Our factories cannot get enough fresh water. Natural gas is not available. You can forget your mobile phones over most of the electorate. Goulburn Valley's multimillion dollar fruit industry relies on the arrival of international backpackers to pick the fruit. If there is a murder in the mountains or in the forests in the next state, those packers and pickers do not come. While other nations use food trade as aid to enter and grow their markets or they use their quarantine services as a non-tariff barrier, our aid is often untargeted. Our primary producers and manufacturers have to beg to maintain bans on fruit imports from countries with diseases that would cripple us. Apple and pear fire blight is one example. How many other countries have such clumsy anti-dumping regulations and procedures that the complainant is often dead and buried before they can prove a case of damage to the satisfaction of the system? We will change that. Our food labelling laws continue to confuse and discourage consumers trying to identify the country of origin. They want to buy our product, but they still often cannot work out just what it is that they are consuming. Of course, there are also inefficiencies on the waterfront. In many cases they simply rule our product right out of the export contest. Not enough of our overseas trade representatives are expert or adequately resourced. Back home, Australians boast of the access to the cheapest and best food supply in the world, but this cheap food has come at a substantial cost to the environment. Those responsible cannot afford to manage the land and water resource as we know it should be managed, and it has come at a huge cost to the people and the rural communities, where the quality of life and life expectations are now far behind what you can expect to find in metropolitan Australia. John Howard's government could not come too soon for Murray. In particular, decades of inadequate return for effort and thwarted ambition have left us with a generation of young people who can see no future. I want to assure the electorate of Murray that I fully understand what drove them to break with the past, and I willingly take up the challenge of helping to deliver to them the business environment, the regulatory environment, the infrastructure and the standards of human services that are essential if our region is ever to reach its full potential. I thank you for your indulgence.",13

5,Mr BILSON,Unknown,"Dunkley) (12.49 p.m.}- Mr Speaker, I thank you and the electors of Dunkley for this opportunity. It is indeed a privilege and honour for me to be here today, representing a community I grew up in. My formative and adult years have almost entirely involved me living in, working for and being a part of the community I now have great pride in representing. Early in my candidature, my Labor opponent conceded that our community had been forgotten in the past. Let me assure each and every person in Dunkley that I will not forget them. Our community has shaped and informed me. I am a product of this community. This prepares me well to see the things that need be seen and hear the things that need be heard in the interests of the people of Dunkley. I often compliment my parents for the wise judgment they showed in moving our family from where my life began in Albury, New South Wales to Victoria's Mornington Peninsula in search of work and a better future. Moving to Seaford in 1970 was the foundation stone from which our family sought to get ahead. Back then, the new II-square homes and the many kids that played in the gravel piles characterised our part of Seaford as a new, growing neighbourhood. My father went to night school to open up his employment opportunities and showed the pride, persistence and true Aussie grit of a battler wanting the best for his family. My mother displayed that gift many homemakers have-the ability to stretch a tight budget, interest in her children to be a Seaford Junior Football Club team manager and the get-upand-go to be involved in anything parents are asked to volunteer for. Things were tough, although my brother and I were lucky. Our parents taught us that hard work and participation produce better outcomes and opportunities and that worthwhile results rarely come easily. They are here today, and I thank them for the character and values they instilled in me. Monterey High School provided me with a quality education, many rich experiences and contact with the broadest range of people. After my HSC, I began work with the City of Frankston and studied part time at RMIT. From emptying parking meters in Frankston to senior executive positions at the shire of Hastings, local government has been my primary trade. The opportunity to work for the Victorian Minister for Natural Resources in the Kennett government, which has renewed my state and lifted it from its knees, was a privilege and preparation for my duty and responsibilities to the people of Dunkley. Premier Kennett has demonstrated that electors will support sensible and responsible reform. Geoff Coleman showed me the decency, care and integrity in politics that I aim to emulate. It is a long journey from the streets of Seaford, the Pines and Frankston to this place. My experience shows others that such a road can be travelled. I encourage all young people in Dunkley to consider participating in public life as a rewarding form of community and national service. This chance to help restore our nation's former reputation as a country of the highest living standards, unequalled opportunity and the brightest of futures for our young people is the result of a significant commitment by a large number of supporters. The Liberal Party's Victorian Division, led by our President, Ted Baillieu, and State Director, Peter Poggioli, and the whole team at '104' rightly deserve their reputation as a professional and astute campaign force. The federal secretariat team were also first class. But no headquarters team can be effective the without the work of people on the ground. The Liberal family turned out in Dunkley to help our I8-month campaign. They were a dedicated and resourceful bunch whom I admire and value, and whom I will continue to look to for support and advice. The focus and leadership of my electorate chairman and campaign manager, Bill Beaglehole, brought together the new Dunkley team. To the campaign team of Bill, John Howard, Taitie Gilder, John August, Paul Amos, Flo Pamaby and Arthur Rankin: you know of my respect and gratitude for your contribution. My thanks also go to Harry Dean and Betty Eastgate. The party membership and many local people looking to have their faith in the future renewep gave willingly of their time and energy. My thanks go to them-particularly to Carol, Naomi and Jason, Maree, Lani, Gladys, Allison, Janice and Brian, Heather, Maurice, Bette and Cliff, Bill, John and Annette, Amber, Keith and Brian. To all those who helped in our information centres and on the road: your efforts were terrific. I must confess to a degree of willing exploitation during the campaign in relation to my friends and family. John Cato-Smith, Stephen Sharrock and the Warwick family were magnificent. My brother, Ross, and father-in-law, John Papakos, parked political indifference and differences respectively to fully support our efforts. For the encouragement and support of the local Greek community generally, and of the Karamesinis family in particular, I say: ehvkhahreesto. I am very grateful for the considerable encouragement and wise counsel received from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). My thanks also go to the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) and Senator Patterson for their support. A most sincere thank you must go to Senator Kemp for his friendship and the special opportunity he gave me to contribute to the finest environment policy this nation has ever seen. My state parliamentary colleagues also deserve mention-particularly the former member for Frankston, the Hon. Graeme Weideman, for his advice, and the Hon. Ken Smith MLC for introducing me to the Liberal Party a decade ago. But we all know that the hard work of getting elected is just the start of it. People have grown tired of being told about 'bringing home the bacon' and 'beautiful sets of numbers' when few of these big statements rang true with the reality of their lives. By contrast, the coalition's policies and pre-election commitments resonated with the Australian people. The election of our coalition government has provided the Australian community with an opportunity to understand the true situation of our nation, its economy and the enormity of some of the challenges we face. I will work toward having the 1990s and beyond recognised as a period of improved govern- . ment accountability, of openness and of honest disclosure about key indicators of government and national performance. The publication of reliable and timely information on the progress of our nation and the performance of its government would be a welcome relief for people made wary by the political spin-doctoring and statistical gymnastics of our predecessors. I believe such a measure would contribute greatly to the government's aim of improving the standing of the national parliament. Being unemployed and having someone try to explain the problem away gives you little hope for the future and little confidence that your representatives are ready to meet the challenges of our time. Let me briefly mention the challenges as I see them. Our national competitiveness is a pointer to our prosperity and future standard of living. Great icons and assets of our national infrastructure were built on the commodity proceeds and the national wealth of more prosperous times. These early investments provide the building blocks for our standard of living today. If we are to pass our house on in good order and seek to improve our standard of living, we must invest and provide the capacity for others to invest. Restoring our competitiveness is about more than jobs and our nation's capacity to pay its way. It is the means to fund our investment in the futureinvestments that will renew our cities, restore our natural systems, support growing populations, enhance our transport infrastructure with projects like the very fast train and see that we discharge our duty of stewardship to future generations. The government's program of practical reform that was so overwhelmingly endorsed on 2 March must be implemented. Far too many people in Dunkley are suffering from the lack of opportunity for work and improved prosperity. Too many decent, able and proud people struggle to obtain the identity and security that comes with employment and the promise of reward for personal endeavour. Young people search for a start they cannot find; others hear about a work ethic they may not have experienced or had the chance to acquire in a family dogged by long-term unemployment. The government's response to unemployment offers hope for our community. With more than 10,000 people officially registered as unemployed and with little prospect of a number of large employers setting up in the short term, adding to and expanding the 8,000 small and micro businesses in Dunkley is our future. The government's plan of action for small business is an excellent program of initiatives welcomed by the Dunkley small business community. Business activity grows jobs, not the other way around. It is this government's job to work to establish the conditions for this growth. Despite claims by the previous government that national economic reform was largely done, the Governor General's speech made plain that there is still much work ahead of us to improve our competitiveness and reduce import costs-particularly in the telecommunications and transport sectors. I look forward to the government's industrial relations legislation being introduced to parliament. These reforms will provide a system that enhances our international competitiveness, recognises the need to balance family and work lives and facilitates higher incomes based on higher productivity. A regional and community employment council that more effectively links training with real jobs an9 with regional development plans will be welcomed. Dunkley hosts the Mornington Peninsula Business Council, which I commend to the minister as an ideal pilot of the RCEC model advocated in the 'Pathways to real jobs' policy. The Mornington Peninsula is the natural economic region of our area. We must improve the job prospects for people in our region. The talk of exports in our community far too often refers to job seekers who have been forced to leave in order to improve their prospects for finding work. Practical measures such as the modem apprenticeship and traineeship system will bring new opportunities for young people. Removing unnecessary qualification periods for older unemployed people before access is available to labour market programs is a positive move. The effects of long-term unemployment and the prospects of being jobless into retirement are damaging to individuals, their self-esteem, their skills and their employability. Recently unemployed people could benefit from more immediate training in job search skills and advice on retaining individual competencies and self-image. This up-front investment could reduce the need for more extensive training and counselling later to restore the person's job readiness and personal confidence. Unemflloyment impacts on the family network. The social, emotional and financial pressures joblessness brings can contribute to family dysfunction. I welcome the action of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to implement the pilot voluntary youth homeless program. The increased emphasis on early intervention, mediation and family reconciliation where possible, will overcome concerns at current arrangements, and discourage the reunification of families experiencing minor resolvable difficulties. Our local experience also suggests a need to review the previous government's policy of reducing child-care relief to eligible parents when a child is temporarily taken out of a regular place. Rigid guidelines offer little scope to reduce costs when permanent bookings are not used, so the costs and charges remain. With the fee relief reduced, it actually costs the parents more to spend more time with their children when the opportunity presents itself. The growing number of older people in Dunkley coupled with the availability of hostel places and nursing home beds being well below the national and state average means that the home care needs of our community will require continuing attention. Beyond programs that support home-based independent living, I will work to increase the number of aged care packages and accommodation options available to provide appropriate supported care in Dunkley for our elderly citizens. The excessive demands placed on respite care facilities, such as Connor House in Mornington, demonstrate the need to expand these services and the availability of supported residential care units. The national carer action plan is a long overdue recognition of the wonderful home heroes who devote their lives to the care of another. With a reported one in three young people looking for work in Dunkley unable to find a job, agencies like the Frankston Community Support and Information Centre and Out 'N' About remind me that disenchanted youth wander the streets looking for purpose and meaning to their lives. We cannot let these young people down. A young man at a recent Padua College debutante ball highlighted that, even for those able to fully participate in schooling, the prospects for the future are not always bright. When asked about his life's ambition, his answer was a chillingly honest: 'I just want to get a job.' That is a reflection of our time from a young man who seemed to be doing okay. But some young people are thrown into our world without the skills and basic competencies to survive in it. Primary and secondary students with learning difficulties and other educational impediments are missing out. Learning disabilities are specifically excluded from the disabilities and equity program school funding provided by the Commonwealth to the states, yet as many as one in five unemployed youth may academically and socially underperform because of their learning disability. The coalition's natural heritage commitments embrace important initiatives ideally suited and responsive to our community, Dunkley by the bay. The coasts and clean seas initiative offers support for the management of a diverse coastline from Seaford in the north, through Frankston and Mount Eliza, to Mornington in the south. These coastal areas show signs of pressure brought about by their own popUlarity. The green corps initiative guides the energy and enthusiasm of our young people towards conservation projects like the management of our foreshore, the Langwarrin flora and fauna reserves, Pines bushland area, Mount Eliza Regional Park and the Sweetwater Creek reserve. The management plan for Kananook Creek is an excellent urban area candidate project for the rivercare program. The national wetlands program offers some hope for assistance in managing the Seaford-Edithvale wetlands area, which I have supported for Ramsar listing. I have proposed the environmental and cultural experience of a 'Wurrundjeri walk' foreshore trail at Seaford to link the Kananook Creek reserve and our wetlands. Near the top of my agenda is restoring Frankston's status as a key regional centre. Under the previous government, Frankston was relegated into the shadows of Dandenong. Our community has been forgotten and disadvantaged accordingly. Restoring Frankston's profile and status will return our community to the forefront of people's minds when private and public sector investment proposals are being considered. Clearly, with Frankston boasting the third largest retail centre in terms of aggregate floor space for all of greater Melbourne, and some one-third of the job vacancies notified to the local CBS being in the wholesale and retail trades, working toward this area being a retail centre of choice is one of my further objectives. Enjoying the adjoining foreshore and Kananook Creek precinct should be a greater part of the Frankston experience. A strategic plan for the city foreshore from Olivers Hill to Wells Street will provide investor and community certainty and ensure that any work in this precinct is coordinated with wider plans for the city's future. The vibrant and competitive retail sector within Frankston, the self-contained shopping complex at Karingal and the seaside village shopping experience in Mornington are strategic attributes that I think we need to preserve, market and build from. The Monash University campuses, Peninsula T AFE and broader educational infrastructure make Dunkley an academic centre of some prominence with further opportunities for expansion into the heart of our city. These academic credentials, the existence of the Keith Turnbull Research Institute, affordable housing and improving transport services position Frankston to be Melbourne's premier educational and research community. Strategic alliances between our educational institutions, research institute and our primary and sunrise industries have the potential to create a centre of excellence for land management and clean and green food production and processing technologies. There is already a high degree of awareness of the outstanding tourism appeal of the Mornington Peninsula. Dunkley by the bay has its share 'of natural, cultural and tourist attractions. The MCClelland Gallery is one of this nation's finest regional facilities of. its type. The Frankston Cultural Centre is a significant addition to the cultural infrastructure in Dunkley. Frankston and Mornington provide excellent home bases for tourists wishing to travel beyond our immediate community. I support coordinated efforts to improve the transit interchange function at the Frankston railway precinct so that tour operators can be appropriately accommodated and can properly market the services that they offer. . Dunkley is the battleline where the sprawling southern suburbs of Melbourne seek to encroach further into the beautiful Mornington Peninsula and hinterland. I endorse the retention of the green wedge policy as a means of halting the expanding urban sprawl, but believe the residents in adjoining areas deserve the certainty of knowing what land uses are permitted and what is planned in these areas. The challenges facing Dunkley are only as big as the opportunities before us. Through a partnership with the community, business and governments, I believe we will make some ground. I intend to grasp this rare privilege make a contribution to our nation and to return the trust and hope individuals have put in me to improve the lot of the citizens of Dunkley by the bay. My presence here today would. not have been possible without the patience and support of my loving wife, Tina. Mr Deputy Speaker, she is here with us today. I would like to close by saying that I love her dearly, admire her courage for being subjected to a public life perhaps not of her choosing, treasure her trust and her wise counsel that ensure that my feet are kept firmly on the ground, and value her continuing support. I look forward to contributing to a parliament and a government that I hope will be respected as one of the best this country has ever seen.",16
6,Mr MARTIN,Unknown,"Cunningham) (1.09 p.m.}-I congratulate our new colleague the rnember for Dunkley (Mr Billso-) on his initial contribution to the parliament. If, indeed, he achieves as much as the person he is replacing, he will do this country and his electorate a great service. Bob Chynoweth was one of the rnost genuine individuals this parliament has seen for a long, long time. Indeed, certainly on this side of the House, he will be sadly missed. In coming to the dispatch box today to speak in this debate, I wondered whether I might not address some issues in my shadow ministerial portfolio; I wondered whether I might not try to search for sorne of the answers as to the early season form of the Illawarra Steelers-but thought that that would take a little longer than 20 minutes. Instead, I have decided to settle on some reflections on 13 years of Labor federal government and its effect on Wollongong. Often people in this place-it does not rnatter how long they are here for; whether they are in government or in opposition-will stop at some stage and reflect on what has been an achievement for them personally or what has been the achievement of their government for the electorate that they represent. They will also find, as has been done in Wollongong, that there are plenty of people who will knock achievement. There will be to people who will say that we should not vote this particular way or that particular way because we never get anything. There will be people who will say-Wollongong, and the Illawarra more generally, is very rnuch a Labor voting area-that when you put a Labor governrnent in you do not get anything; when Labor is out you do not get anything anyway, so what is the difference? I think it is nonsense to think that. It is worth reflecting on 1983 to see where we are as a city and to see where the electorate of Cunningham is at since that tirne when there was a change from a conservative government to the Hawke government. People will remember that, nationally, at the time there was double digit unemployment and double digit inflation, and that those key sectors of the economy and those key regions which lead to economic growth were the ones which were affected the rnost. I am referring, of course, to the industrial heartlands of Australia. The Illawarra is the industrial engine room of this country. Whilst unernployrnent rnight have been in double digits, at 11 per cent, in the Illawarra in 1983 it was at 20 per cent. Today it stands at around half that-at 10 per cent. I would be the first to admit it is still not acceptable. At the time the major employer in the Illawarra was BlIP, and the BHP steelworks directly employed 26,000 people. Some would say that its work practices were pretty ordinary. You would by today's standardsbecause today there are 7,000 people employed directly by BlIP. To go from 26,000 to 7,000-with approximately another 5,000 jobs in the coal mining industry of the Illawarra also being lost in this period-is clearly going to have a major effect on any region, on any city. It has had an effect. The effect was that in 1983, within 100 days of taking office, the Hawke government decided that a steel industry plan would be put in place. That steel industry plan was to be tripartite-between the unions, BHP and the government. The government's role was relatively small: it accepted a responsibility limiting some imports of steel into this country. The union's role was substantial: it agreed to abide by dispute settling mechanisms; it agreed to negotiate with the company; and it agreed to look at ways in which productivity could be improved so that the steel industry in this country could survive. The company itself-BHP-agreed to invest massively, not only in Wollongong but in the entire steel industry to save it. In 1983 BHP was going to walk out of steel production in this country and concentrate on minerals and energy and other investments. It is the steel plan, put together by the Hawke government in its first 100 days, that sees that industry in its current position--competitive by international standards. Downsized? Yes. But in WOIIOngOng alone there is an investment of $2 billion. A week or so ago we saw the recommissioning of the No. 6 blast furnace. That is a classic example of the company's determination not only to be environmentally conscious but also to look very carefully at the question of productivity and to build and rebuild best practice facilities. Building on that, we have seen not simply an investment in private industries such as BHP, but also a determination and a will amongst the people of the Illawarra to stand up and be counted in this nation, to say, 'Economic adversity is not going to affect us.' With the assistance of the Hawke-Keating government, we went about the task by looking at ways in which major infrastructure might be developed within our region. We went about the task by looking at the whole concept of regional planning-something which had been in vogue in the 1970s and which, in the last couple of years, seems to have been reinvented. What we saw was a combined effort by the private sector and the public sector to get the local economy going. It therefore disturbs me somewhat that the doomsayers are again out in Wollongong and the Illawarra suggesting that, because a couple of major capital works projects have come to a conclusion, we are going to go back to the bad old days of 1983. I do not think that will happen, because there is a much stronger will of to see that that does not happen. The climate, the investment nature of our region, has improved dramatically. But I am fearful of some of the decisions that might come in the budget from the new government. I am fearful about the effect on the public sector. As recently as today the trade union movement in WOIIOngOng was talking about major cuts in employment opportunities and service delivery in a variety of departments, in particular the Commonwealth Employment Service and the social security departments. Already we have seen cuts in the customs service at Port Kembla. When there are cuts of this sort in regions like our own-which are regional foci for a variety of service deliveries-they will impact across a broader range. Those issues have to be tackled again square on. I note that the CPSU is calling its membership together this Thursday to discuss this matter. I think that is most appropriate. We have to look at the effect. that slashing jobs might have on service delivery to people in our region. We have to make sure that there is not a negative impact on people who are dependent upon things like drug interdiction through the port of Port Kembla or the delivery of social services or the provision of a range of other things, such as taxation advice through the regional tax office. Let me return to some of the dooms ayers who have been around. for a period of time and who have suggested that Illawarra never got a thing by voting Labor. I say to them: have a look at the regional tax office in Burelli Street; have a look at the Navy's Hydrographic Office across the road from that building; have a look at the Brandon Park sporting complex, which is the home of soccer in III awarra. It is where our very competitive team-Wollongong City-plays in the national soccer league. I also say to them: have a look at the Commonwealth office block which has been constructed in the civic precinct; have a look at the myriad of tourism projects in the Illawarra-the latest being ecotourism projects; have a look at the Beaton Park athletics track, which is going to train Olympic athletes not only for the games in Atlanta but also for the games in the year 2000 in Sydney; have a look at the University of Wollongong and the massive expenditure by the Labor Party in government on buildings, on infrastructure and on places; have a look at the science centre in the middle of my electorate and see what has been achieved there; have a look at the construction of Medicare offices in centres such as Corrimal, where my electorate is based. Can the dooms ayers then tum around and tell me that, under a Labor government, Cunningham-Illawarra and Wollongong specifically-got nothing? The doomsayers should talk to me about things such as local capital works programs or the very famous Ros Kelly community sport and recreation facilities program grants and look what we got there. When you do so and when people have a snigger about Ros Kelly, ask yourself, if you were a member at the time when those programs were around, how many of your constituents who were beneficiaries of it came to your office and said, 'Oh, goodness me, this is disgraceful. the way, here's your cheque back.' I can tell you that they are scarce on the ground. They took the money, they built the facilities and in their piousness they sat back and knocked the person who contributed the funds. We did reasonably well in Wollongong. We did reasonably well in a variety of areas in the Illawarra. Colin Hollis can tell us a lot about what he received in his part of Wollongong in the Illawarra. I am sure Peter Knott's replacement will tell about the sorts of grants which were given down in the electorate of Gilmore to the aviation museum and a range of others. I look forward to her continuing contribution in this place to see how federal Labor assisted in the electorate of Gilmore. I would be interested to see the contribution by the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) about Macarthur, what happened when I represented Macarthur and what happened when Chris Haviland represented Macarthur. It will be interesting to compare and contrast over the next couple of years to see whether he is able to achieve as much as I believe we did through the Labor government looking at projects and looking at them carefully. It does not stop there. We have to look to the future. I mentioned earlier that regional economic planning is something which people have again taken a great deal of interest in. It is my very great pleasure to be the chair of the Illawarra Regional Economic Development Organisation. This body started 18 months or so ago. It came as an initiative, as people know, through the Working Nation program of federal Labor. It came as an initiative in the Illawarra as a result of the IIlawarra Regional Development Board, established by a state government taking an interest in this and suggesting that a REDO might be an appropriate way in which federal initiatives could be channelled, along with state and local government initiatives, to economically benefit our entire region. Our region, from a REDO's point of view, embraces not only the city of Wollongong but also the city of Shellharbour, the municipality of Kiama, the city of Shoalhaven and the shire of Wingecarribee. In each of those specific areas our region requires careful By management from an economic development perspective. As part of its charter, REDO looks to private enterprise to take the lead in that, as I believe it should. At the end of the day, public sector spending or assistance through the public sector with government giving the lead-whether it be through grants or whatever-is only one way of achieving sustainable economic growth. It is by creating the macro-economic conditions of the broad economy, with low interest rates, low inflation and job opportunities being available, that we will see regions such as the llIawarra continue to grow. The IREDO process in Illawarra is very much geared towards that. We have received funding for a number of projects, not the least of which is an export enhancement project. Another is to look at the way in which the port of Port Kembla might continue to be improved so that we can handle exports from a broader element of our region and, indeed, even beyond our region so that more jobs are created and the economy continues to grow in a sustainable fashion. We are involved in best practice activity amongst a whole variety of businesses in the Illawarra and amongst local government, and I think that is quite appropriate. Going hand in glove with these REDO projects has been a preparedness by the trade union movement in the Illawarra, specifically through a number of individual unions, to embrace appropriate union workplace agreements. The lllawarra used to have a reputation of being 'bad boy Billy' when it came to days lost through industrial disputes. In the bad old days in the 1970s we would hear about Wran's armada on the days when people would go on strike at the drop of a hat and coal ships could not be loaded and so on. That is well and truly a thing of the past. Unfortunately, it is an image issue which we in the 1990s in the Illawarra still have to carry. It is a nonsense. A dissection of statistics will clearly show that through union agreements, enterprise bargaining and through the opportunity for employers to sit down with the trade union movement and get a better deal for all, the Illawarra has benefited in a number of ways. Obviously, we have seen days lost through industrial disputes almost disappear off the scales. It is quite amazing that that has happened. We have seen a cooperative environment established so that the good of the Illawarra is at the forefront in all of these discussions. The future holds some initiatives for us as well. We can build on things in private enterprise such as BHP's work, the coal loader, the grain handling terminal, the council chambers in Wollongong, the performing arts centre, residential development, the oil project which Esso and BHP have been involved with and the Sydney Harbour tunnel ptoject that Transfield was involved with. We can build on all that in the future if this cooperative arrangement continues. There are many of us who have a vision for where Wollongong can go. We are very closely working with and bringing together people from the university, from local government, from the state sector and from private enterprise looking at the development of a telecommunications industry for the lllawarra. We have a lot going for us. We have leading R&D technology and leading R&D experts at the University of Wollongong. Incidentally, the University of Wollongong is acknowledged universally as not only the leading regional university in Australia, but in tenns of objective assessment it is right up there in the top one, two or three in this country, and rightly so in tenns of programs that it has offered and the leadership that has been given by the staff of that institution. Telecommunications, with world best practice and leading experts from around the world being employed there, along with private enterprise and the public sector being prepared to get involved and looking at ways in which we can take R&D to production, will lead the way for our region into the future. That is not to say that, in a broader sense, places like the Shoalhaven and other parts of the Illawarra will not also benefit. My colleague the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) knows of the outreach program at the University of Wollongong and of the proposals for a campus in her electorate. She knows also of projects which I read are involved with agri-food development, and so on. These are processes in regional economic development that we must support. I think that the future is looking particularly bright. I say to those doomsayers in Wollongong: those days are gone. Forget about it. See what you can do to contribute to the Illawarra's growth instead of always being a knocker. We certainly do not need them on the inside. There are many people outside our region who are prepared to do it. Get behind initiatives that many people are involved with. Let rig us see the engine room of Australia continue to thrive, as I am sure it will.",21
7,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the next speaker, I might say to the honourable member for Cunningham that, while I chose not to interrupt the flow of his eloquence, the chair would be grateful if the honourable gentleman would refer to the honourable member for Throsby by his correct title.",24
8,Mr NUGENT,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, may I start by offering my congratulations to you on your appointment, to the Speaker on his appointment and to the Second Deputy Speaker on his appointment. Before I start my remarks, could I also say a couple of things to the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who was the occupant of the Speaker's chair in the last parliament. Whilst he sometimes operated under some considerable restraints imposed by a person who is no longer a member of this chamber, I have to acknowledge that many of the things that he did in that role were very worthwhile, and I would like to publicly put that on record. I would like to challenge him a little on some of the comments he made about a former member for Canberra, which electorate I understand enjoys the best sporting facilities of the nation. It seems to me that, when you look at the previous government's record of providing facilities, former members of that government can indeed read out a long list of wonderful achievements and resources for their individual electorates, as did Ros Kelly and as did the member for Cunningham-and there are many more. If you actually look at where most of the money went to, you see it went very heavily to particular government members or to the government side generally and very few members from this side of the chamber had electorates that benefited. So my electorate is looking forward to seeing some redressing of that balance. It is not a question that now side will only look after its own. We will do what we said in the election we would do, and that is to govern for all Australians. That was something which the previous government very much lost sight of and it is one of the key reasons why the previous government lost so heavily on 2 March. I would like to address a number of points today, although I suspect I am going to run out of time because of the 1.45 p.m. rule. First of all, I would like to talk about the standing of the parliament and of members of parliament. I would like to talk about the significance for my electorate of Aston in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne of the government's proposed program. I want to say a couple of words about indigenous reconciliation and I want to talk about Australia's overseas aid program. If I have time, I will mention something about the republic and gun control. Before I go into that most important subject of the standards of parliament, I would also like to add my support to the other members in this place who have, over the last few days, expressed their condolences to all those who lost family, friends and loved ones in the terrible tragedy at Port Arthur. The reason I want to talk first today about the standing of parliament is that it seems to me that from that all else must spring. If we do not have a parliament and members of parliament in this country who have some respect and standing amongst the community out there, then, frankly, it seems to me our very democracy is in peril. I think it has been noticeable to all of us in this place, as well as to many outside, that the standing of parliament and parliamentarians has become something of a dirty word. It is particularly noticeable when you go to schools. When you read the media and when you talk to anybody, they do not talk about parliamentarians; they talk about politicians. 'Politicians' means something which is not very savoury at all. I think that is pretty sad. Like so many members in this place, when I came here six years ago I gave up a very successful and well-paying career. I halved my salary to come in here, as have many this members. I came here because I wanted to contribute to my country and to help make my country a better place for my children and for subsequent generations. What is particularly disappointing in this respect is the performance of the press gallery. It seems to me that the press gallery knows damn well that most members work very hard and that there is a lot of bipartisan, constructive and positive work that goes on in this place. Yet it is never reported. All we get is the 30-second grab on television news at 6 o'clock at night and we see the bits of robust debate that have gone on. I am not saying that that robust debate does not sometimes go over the top or that it is defensible. What I am saying is that much of what is reported is, in fact, a small fraction of what goes on here. As the previous speaker will acknowledge, in his capacity as Speaker of this House in the last parliament he appointed a cross-party committee-which I happened to chairwhich was made up of a majority of members who were not government members and which looked at things like the amalgamation of the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff with the aim of improving the efficiency of this place. There are many committees where both sides sit down and agree on the recommendations that come out and support the legislation that flows. As a private member, you often go to members of the government, if they are of a different party, with particular issues for constituency and you get support and help to resolve those problems for Australians. None of that comes out in the media. None of that comes out in the community. People do not understand. It seems to me that the press gallery has a lot to answer for in that respect. Therefore, I want to say up-front that I think the intention of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to try to restore this chamber to primacy in this nation is an outstanding first move. His attendance at question time every day is critical because he sets the example. The new standards of conduct are critical. The fact that major announcements will be made in this chamber is absolutely vital. One of my criticisms of the previous Prime Minister is that too often the major statements were made down at the National Press Club or somewhere else. I, as a member of this chamberand I know the then government members were in the same boat-would often find out about major announcements of policy when the journos rang up and said, 'The Prime Minister has just said this, what do you think about it?' That is not good enough. If our democracy is to survive, this is the place where we have to talk about those things. This is the place where the major announcements have to be made. Similarly, it is absolutely critical, if we are to restore some faith in the system and encourage people of ability and goodwill to come into this place in the future, that we honour our promises. This parliament does have to reassert its supremacy. This parliament must take on the executive from time to time. I have been delighted, listening to a number of the maiden speeches in this chamber, not only to hear the quality of the speeches but also to hear what they have featured. It is interesting to noteand the new members will not be aware of this-that in the last parliament so often the then government criticised our side of politics for having no social concerns. They said that we did not care about people, that we were all dry, rational economists and so on, which of course was not true. It has been a feature of a number of the maiden speeches that have been made in the last few days in this place that a number of your our new members have a strong social awareness and are quite clearly prepared to stand up and say so in their first speeches. That is commendable. I look forward to this parliament not only because the view from this side is a jolly sight better than the view from the other side, and it is nice to win a vote in here from time to time, but also because we will have a parliament that is about the core of our country's democracy, and that is fundamental. My electorate of Aston is in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It is a rapidly growing electorate with an overwhelming number of young people. There is much higher unemployment than when the previous government came to power. There are a lot of young families but there will be an increasing aged component in the next 10 years. There are thousands of small businesses and great problems with transport, roads and interest rates. There is also an increasing ethnic component. There are more mortgage payers in my electorate than any electorate in the country, so to say that it is sensitive to interest rates would be the understatement of the year. The program the government has laid out has started to address many of the issues that are so relevant to my constituents. For example, if you look at the increasing aged population, yes, we have nursing homes and yes, we have hostels. But we do not deal adequately with those who are moving into the dementia category. It is a special need that is not a nursing home category and, equally, is not a hostel category. The government's announcement that it will address that particular section is of fundamental importance. I have 7,900 small businesses in my electorate, many of them high-tech businesses, many of them exporters. I want this government to look very hard at any plans it has in terms of some of the schemes used to encourage small business to go into overseas markets. I would also encourage it not only to bring interest rates down but to look very carefully at the exchange rate mechanism as well. We do need transport, roads and infrastructure in the outer suburban areas of places like Melbourne, and I am very keen to see the government look at those as well. Our multicultural policy will be very important. Nearly 16 per cent of my electorate is from a different background, and many are recently from Asia. They are mostly successful people who do not vote as a block but come here with a new perspective that this country needs to take on board because they are contributing mightily to their new land. Before I run out of time. I want to mention very briefly the subject of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reconciliation. Those who have been in this chamber for some time will know that I have been a strong advocate of indigenous reconciliation for a number of years. For the last four-odd years I have been the then opposition representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. I have now been appointed as the government's representative on that same council. We are to mark National Reconciliation Week in the week commencing 27 May. There is to be a large luncheon co-hosted by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot), and all members will be getting an invitation. I would urge all members to support that activity and the other associated activities. There will be a 1997 convention on Aboriginal reconciliation, which I urge all members to take an interest in. We all agree that the issues of health, housing, education and employment jn our indigenous community, which by any yardstick is the most disadvantaged in our country, are matters that have to be addressed. The fact that there have been failures in the ways in which we have addressed those issues is no excuse for saying we cannot address them. We have to find better and more effective ways of addressing those issues but we also have to acknowledge the importance of land. We have to recognise the significance of issues such as Mabo. We have to understand the cultural differences. We, the majority, the non-Aboriginal people in this country, have to accept the responsibility for what has gone on in this country in the past in terms of the treatment of the indigenous people. Things like regional agreements, such as those which have been pioneered in Cape York and to my horror have been set aside by the Premier, Mr Borbidge, can resolve a lot of the problems in this country. Selfdetermination is an issue which is very near and dear to indigenous hearts. We cannot just say we do not like it and sweep it under the carpet. We have to deal with those issues. Mr Speaker, I could go on for a long time on this issue, and I flag it as one, amongst many others, that I will be pursuing in this parliament. Given that I have only two or three minutes before we adjourn this debate to go on to other business, I want to talk a little bit about foreign aid. There was a letter in the Financial Review on 25 April this year signed by the heads of a number of major aid organisations-Austcare, ACFOA, the Australian Catholic Relief Organisation, Community Nd Abroad, the Overseas Service Bureau, Plan International, the Save the Children Fund and World Vision Australia. I am delighted to see that we now have the Speaker here. Earlier on, Mr Speaker, I offered you my congratulations on your appointment. I am pleased now to be able to do it personally.",25
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Thank you very much.,27
10,Mr NUGENT,Unknown,"In that letter on foreign aid, the heads of these organisations made the points: by any yardstick, this country is still very affluent; and while we have to look after the poor and needy in our community, equally, as an affluent, developed country we have international responsibilities. The proposition to cut our overseas aid further than we have done previously or than we said we would in our election proposal is unacceptable. Overseas aid has been running at about 3.3 per cent of GOP. Our aim was to cut that by 0.7 per cent. We are now proposing to cut it further. I urge the Prime Minister, the and the razor gang-or whatever you want to call it-to look at this area and say, 'Enough is enough. We have cut enough.' I think we should have much greater commitment to overseas aid because, particularly in our part of the world, we have a: responsibility to so many disadvantaged people. To ease your load, Mr Speaker, which is to chop me off at the knees, since it is 1.45, if you would like me to, I will sit down.",28
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Your timing is impeccable. Order! It being 1.45 p.m., the debate interrupted in accordance with the resolution of 1 May 1996. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for a later hour this day. honourable member for Aston will be continuing his statement. NA Dunkley Electorate",28
12,Mr MCARTHUR,Unknown,"I would like to draw the attention of the House to this very historic day. With Mr Bruce Billson's election to the seat of Dunkley, Mr Bob Chynoweth is no longer the Labor Party member for that seat. Since the former member for Dunkley used this debate to attack the Kennett government on every occasion he could, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that Mr Jeffrey Kennett was returned to _ government with 54 per cent of the two-party preferred vote while Mr Chynoweth is no longer a member of this parliament. Every week Mr Chynoweth got up in this parliament and attacked the Kennett government. Now Mr Bruce Billson, who made a very admirable maiden speech, is the member with a 3.9 per cent margin over the former member. As I said, Mr Kennett was returned with 54 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. His government lost a net of two seats in the lower house and picked up four seats in the upper house. The Kennett government now has a majority of 28 seats ih the lower house and 24 seats in the upper house. Notably for Mr Chynoweth, the Labor Party failed to make up any ground in the seat of Frankston East, where the ALP needed a swing of only 0.26 per cent to win. In fact,  MCLellan, attracted a swing towards him and now holds the seat with a three per cent margin. So much for Mr Chynoweth, who stood up in this parliament and attacked the Premier and the Kennett government time help after time. He is no longer here and we have a very good member for Dunkley in Mr Bruce Billson. (Time expired) Sheffield Shield",28
13,Ms WORTH,Unknown," Mr Speaker, may is I congratulate you on your election to such high office. I wish to inform the House of my pleasure in South Australia's win in the Sheffield Shield this year. I formally conThe gratulate the team, captained by Jamie Siddons and coached to victory by Jeff Hammond, known to his friends as 'Bomber'. After 14 years without a shield win, it was a great result for South Australia and for constituents of mine such as Tim May and Prospect club member Greg Blewett. Jeff Hammond and the then opposition leader-Prime Minister John Howardcompared their respective p-sitions during the Australia versus Sri Lanka test match two days before the election was announced. Hence Jeffs fax to the Prime Minister after the election victory: Your Party was well ahead in the polls and my boys were well on top of the Shield ladder. Like us I hope your Government doesn't have to bat it out on a green seamer or a crumbier on the last day. Stay positive and relaxed and above all, enjoy the game. The Prime Minister's congratulatory fax back to the team said in part: It is terrific to see the on-going. fierce spirit of competition for the Sheffield Shield... I can understand how elated you and the team must feel. Fourteen years of working for the team is even longer than 13 years in opposition! Again, well done, South Australia, and long may the Sheffield Shield stay in your hands. Parliament House: Chapel",28
14,Mr ZAMMIT,Unknown," Mr Speaker, this is the first opportunity I have had of congratulating you on your election to high office. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the clerks and officers of this parliament for showing us around and for making us feel very welcome. Mr Speaker, one thing I have noticed about this parliament is that we have the best of everything-the best restaurants, the best facilities, a great swimming pool and everything we could possiblyMr Abbott-You didn't do too bad in Macquarie Street.",29
15,Mr ZAMMIT,Unknown,"Comparable to what we had in Macquarie Street, Mr Speaker, but one thing I noticed that we do not have is a chapel. I would like you, please, to consider the establishment of a chapel so that those of us who wish to worship from time to time would have a quiet place to go to and praise our Lord and thank Him for all the good things in our lives. I would like you, please, to consider that, Mr Speaker. New South Wales District Court: Appointment of Aboriginal Judge",29
16,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,"Banks- Mr Speaker, I rise to point out to the House that the New South Wales government has appointed Bob Bellear to the New South Wales District Court. Later this month Mr Bellear will become this country's first Aboriginal judge. It is an appointment based on merit and it is an excellent one. I had the privilege of being at the College of Law with Bob Bellear in 1979. He was admitted as a barrister on 13 July 1979. From 1987 to 1990 he was counsel assisting the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. He was appointed a public defender for the state of New South Wales on 6 May 1991. As I said, this appointment by the New South Wales Attorney-General is an excellent one and is based on merit. I know that all political parties will welcome it. Good on you, Bob, and I wish the best for you and Kaye in the future. Petrie-Redcliffe Transport Services",29
17,Mr TONY SMITH,Unknown,"Dickson}-- Mr Speaker, congratulations on your election. I wish to speak about the Petrie to Redcliffe proposed rail connection. For many years this has been a proposal that has been talked about frequently at election times and is never followed through. afterwards. .To its eternal shame, the previous state Labor government has now downgraded any proposal to construct a rail line from Petrie to Redcliffe by turning it into a proposed bus corridor. By a strange irony, I have the honour to represent the suburb of Petrie while the honourable member for Petrie represents the Redcliffe peninsula area. We have a situation where there has been an absolute explosion in population numbers which is reaching a crisis level along this corridor because, with the great expansion of people moving into the area, there is insufficient public transport, and we do need public transport. We are talking about public transport all the time and this is an area that needs to be addressed very urgently. People are' moving into the area, some of them getting a second and a third car, and yet we have not addressed this problem. There is land set aside. I call upon the present state' government to reverse the previous Labor government's decision and to go back to considering this proposal seriously. I also call upon my own party to look at this proposal. It is an absolute essential for servicing the needs of the people in this expanding area. (Time expired) Sports High Schools",29
18,Mrs CROSIO,Unknown,"Prospect}--I call on the federal government and the state government of New South Wales to continue to fund sports high schools. I use as an example the Westfield Sports High School. It was established some years ago as a prototype throughout Australia. It is now being used as an example for many high schools to follow. They not only specialise in sport; they are academic achievers who also utilise the arts as well as bands. The waiting list to get into that particular high school in my electorate is very long. With some 1,520 students enrolled, they cannot now cater for the numbers of people who are wishing to attend that school. I believe that it is a model that should be adopted all over Australia where expertise is certainly encouraged. All other education areas should follow the example of Westfield Sports High School. When it was first envisaged some years ago and we fought to have the education system accept the concept of what could happen with a specialist school such as Westfield Sports High in my electorate, many educationalists thought that it was a joke. I now proudly say that they use that school as an example right across Australia. I believe that two others are going to be commenced in New South Wales. One is adapting now and becoming a specialist sports high school, while being also qualified in academic areas, as well as the arts. In the Westfield model, we have a school that now has a 95 per cent retention rate. The school has been provided with support from groups, as well as business people. The parents, the P&C, the whole backing of the school is something to be proud of. The students are proud of their school and you can see that time and time again. I call on the government to continue to support this(Time expired) Petitions",29
19,Mr LINDSAY,Unknown,"My statement this afternoon is about petitions. The right for citizens to present petitions directly to parliais ment was established in England in the 13th century and it developed to its modern form in the late 17th century. While petitions are referred by the Clerk of the House to the relevant minister for investigation, I am - amazed that it is not a requirement for ministers concerned to report back to the parliament directly. Sessional orders permit the minister to respond to the House via the Clerk, but it is not a requirement. I believe that if citizens have a right to publicly draw members' attention to problems or grievances, then they should also enjoy the expectation of a public response from ministers back to the House of Representatives. I would therefore appreciate the support of members to insist that ministers report directly to the House on the action taken and outcome of petitions lodged before this parliament. National Crime Authority",30
20,Mr FILING,Unknown,"I support that proposition and would like to see a bit more action in relation to the whole question of petitions. I am concerned about today's comments by John Broome, the Chairman of the NCA, about the forthcoming likely cuts in the budget to the NCA's operational capacity. As members would know, I have been a member of the committee for a long time, and I am very concerned. . Last year we had almost unprecedented industrial action taken by the staff at the NCA office in Perth. In Western Australia, we have some particular problems, particularly in relation to the importation of narcotics. I might add that in 1994-95, within a 100kilometre radius of Geraldton, it is estimated that up to $600 miIlion worth of illegal narcotics were imported into Western Australia. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that the NCA should enjoy full funding in order to be able to carry out its operational investigations. I might say that Mr Broome made the comment this morning that there will certainly be a reduction in our investigative capacity. This is a matter of some great concern to members of the community, and all I can do urge members opposite to ensure that, when the budget is being considered, they make representations to the ministers in order that these cuts do not take place. (Time expired) Northern Territory Chamber of Commerce",30
21,Mr DONDAS,Unknown,"I have a letter from the Northern Territory Chamber of Commence and Industry which basically says: . . . on behalf of the Members of the East Arnhem Branch of the NT Chamber of Commence & Industry with regard to our past endeavours to have our local private enterprise firms included on the pre selection list for Federal Government Contracts awarded within our area. In the past many items of correspondence have been forwarded to W. Snowdon MP and to date no progress has been made on this matter. We have in Nhulunbuy several firms capable of carrying out building contracts under the $250,000 figure but have been unable to have this fact recognised within the Federal Government and inevitably we are 'feed the line' that after gations, invitations to tender were forwarded to companies on the pre selection list. . . We would be appreciative if you would take steps to ensure that on future Federal Government contracts local businesses are given the opportunity to tender on contracts. I would call on the government departments to recognise those contractors in Nhulunbuy who have contracts with the Northern Territory government and are recognised by the Department of Transport and Wor1cs for future government contracts from the federal government. Electorate of Dunkley",30
22,Mr SERCOMBE,Unknown,"Maribyrnong}--I am inspired to rise by the rantings of the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) in relation to the results in Dunkley and on the recent state election. I make the fairly obvious point that, no matter how strong the personal qualities may be of the new member for Dunkley (Mr BilIson), he is here simply because the Electoral Commissioner changed the boundaries very significantly. I point out that on your side, from Victoria, you no longer have Mr Beale in Bruce and you no longer have the former member for Isaacs, essentially for the same reasons. I am sure the member for Dunkley can take no great comfort from the fact that he is here simply courtesy of electoral boundary changes. In the state election there was something approaching a three per cent swing against the . Kennett government, a large swing in normal circumstances. A most significant factor in the result was the decimation of the vote in rural Victoria for the conservatives-an Independent won in Mildura. In National Party seats people turned their backs on the National Party in large numbers, for example, in the Deputy Premier's electorate of Benalla. In electorates like Portland, there was an eight per cent swing to the Labor Party. In that respect, the speech this morning by the new member for Murray (Mrs Stone) was very instructive, and I congratulate her on an excellent speech. She pointed out that rural people are increasingly sick of the neglect of so many important infrastructure services by the Kennett Liberal government in Victoria. She referred to health and education. Those investiare areas which the Kennett government in Victoria has neglected and that is why they lost so much support. (Time expired) Aboriginal Reconciliation Election Mandate",31
23,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie}--I want to comment briefly on the speech this morning by the member for Aston (Mr Nugent). He has always been one of the most sanctimonious people in this parliament. I can tell him that he is not a voice for Aboriginal people at all. He is a voice for the Aboriginal industry. The Aboriginal industry has far too much representation in this parliament. I think it is about time the needs and aspirations of all the Aboriginal people were listened to. They are certainly not going to get that from the member for Aston. I also say to the Liberal Party: if you people think you have a mandate, you are mistaken. The result of the last election was quite clearly a vote against Keating. Where people had a viable alternative, they took it. You are there, in a sense, by default. If you develop the arrogance of the Keating government, you too will go the same way. It is quite true that Kennett suffered a massive swing against him in rural Victoria. Had people been better organised there, it would have been even greater. I can only warn you people that if you emulate-(Time expired)",31
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 2 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to on 1 May 1996, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA",31
25,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I inform the House that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. John Sharp, will be absent from question time today. He is in the Northern Territory on government business. The Minister for Science and Technology, the Hon. Peter MCGauran, will answer questions on his behalf. NA",31
26,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister. Have you seen the five-year business outlooks that were released today by Access Economics? Do you endorse the quality of the work of Access Economics? If so, how do you explain its projection that the annual growth in Australia's exports after a term of coalition government will fall from 8.7 per cent this financial year cent in the year 2000?",32
27,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"I begin my answer by looking at a six-year period involving the federal Labor government when they were in office, from 1989 to 1994. When you examine Australia's share of world trade, you see that during that period there was a nine per cent fall in Australia's share of world trade. When you examine it region by region, you will find that with the ASEAN nations, a stated priority of the outgoing government, there was a 13 per cent fall in Australia's share with East Asia as a grouping, including ASEAN, there was a 20 per cent fall; with the Europeans there was a 23 per cent fall; and with NAFrA, Canada, the United States and Mexico there was a 35 per cent fall in Australia's share of trade with those nations. I accept that market share is not the only guide with regard to these matters. I accept that the trend in world trade to more E1Ms is certainly one which has a particular ramification for Australia. I do not accept a projection, which I will study in detail to see what the reasoning is, that says that the coalition government will not be good in terms of creating the right framework for Australia's exporters. We will get it right and we will launch an export culture in this country the likes of which we never saw under Labor. Media: Violence",32
28,Ms WORTH,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In addition to the firm steps the Prime Minister is taking on gun control, can he inform the House whether the government is taking any action to examine the impact on the community of violent film material?",32
29,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The debate in the comTrade munity which has followed the dreadful events of last weekend has, as all honourable members know, gone beyond the question of gun control laws. It has also raised questions about the impact of video games on children, the impact of certain excessively violent films on particular members of the community and the broad question of whether many things in modem day life are possibly contributing to the development of a culture of violence into just 3.1 per our community. There is a whole range of views on the impact of violent videos, violent movies and violence on television. There are as many people who will passionately put one point of view as there are a range of arguments on the issue. I expressed the view last week, and I repeat it today, that it is hard to believe, speaking as a layman and certainly not as any expert in this area, that the repetitive mind numbing violence which is sometimes seen on television does not have a deleterious effect of the trade; on some people. We discussed the matter at a cabinet meeting this morning and I have established a small group of ministers, to be chaired by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, to bring together all of the material which is available to the government, to talk to relevant people in the community and to try to reach a common sense approach. I abhor censorship as a general proposition. I share the view generally speaking that people, particularly adults, should make their own judgments about what they see, what they read and what they hear. I am sure that I would share the view of most Australians that we do have a responsibility in respect of our children and I take the opportunity to reinforce the ongoing responsibility of parents in matters of this nature. There is a limit to what any government can do or ought to do in relation to the surveillance of the material that children see on television and parents cannot escape their responsibility in relation to it. I have asked the group of ministers to meet as soon as possible and to put some recommendations to the government. I hope it is something that can be dealt with in a sensible fashion. I hope it can be dealt with as far as possible in a bipartisan fashion. I heard some remarks this morning from the shadow minister, Senator Schacht, with which I agree and, to the extent that it is possible to reach a bipartisan approach on these matters, I will endeavour to do so. It may involve enlisting the cooperation of the major television networks, including the ABC. Media: Violence Mr BEAZLEYI agree with virtually everything the Prime Minister said in answer to the question and welcome the creation of a cabinet committee to advise him. Further to that, I ask: will he incorporate in their consideration, or give it due consideration himself, a similar initiative to that of the Prime Minister with the networks on MA classified product? As I recollect it, under those initiatives, MA classified product was put back from an 8.30 time slot to a 9 o'clock time slot. Will he consider perhaps taking it back from 9 to 9.30 or 10 o'clock?",32
30,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,I will certainly have a look at that. Firearms Control,33
31,Mr LINDSAY,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In relation to the use of guns, has the Prime Minister seen reports that some of those involved in the decision making process to restrict the use of guns are less than enthusiastic about such a proposal? Is this true?",33
32,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I think all honourable members will have seen a variety of reports over the weekend and in this morning's press about the attitude of different governments and different individuals in those governments towards the question of unifonn effective gun control and gun registration laws. There is a meeting on Friday and the Commonwealth will be putting some quite specific proposals to that meeting. I hope that after the proper processes of the government parties have been followed I will have an opportunity to discuss those proposals with the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Democrats, so that to the maximum extent possible there can be a focus of all the political parties represented in the parliament on this issue. In relation to ministers at a state level, my experience to date has been that whatever their political colour they share the concern of all honourable members about this issue. I detect in the Australian community a genuine desire to do something decisive on this occasion about the question of gun control. All the final detail remains a matter for consideration and reflection by governments, but so far I am encouraged by the approach and the attitude and the sense that something has to be done which has come to me from all quarters. I spoke at some length at the weekend to former the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr. I have spoken to ministers and premiers from other states and so far the attitude has been encouraging and, I think, responsible. Some of the criticism that has been made of some of those ministers by sections of the media has been a little rushed and unfair. If what I heard over the weekend is any guide, then we are making some progress. But I have had long experience in Commonwealth/state dealings and, until agreement is finally sealed, one should not be too loquacious. However, so far the indications are quite promising. Manufacturing Industry",33
33,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I ask: has he seen the five-year business outlook released today by Access Economics? Given that in Labor's last tenn the annual growth in manufacturing output has averaged between five and six per cent, what does that report say for your policies that the growth in manufacturing output is predicted to fall from 6.4 per cent last year to 2.7 per cent by the end of the decade? Specifically, what does this do to your target of creating 200,000 jobs in manufacturing by the year 2000?",33
34,Mr MOORE,Unknown,"I have not seen the report referred to, but nevertheless I am quite convinced that the government's budget, which will come out on 20 August, will be one framed for the benefit of all business in Australia and that the outcomes that I spoke about in the election campaign will be met. Budget Strategy",34
35,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does the government regard it as important to balance Australia's budget and what are the benefits of doing so?,34
36,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"As far as the government is concerned it is of the utmost importance to bring the budget back into balance within the next two years. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank observed in March 1996, next year will mark the sixth year of economic recovery. In terms of the economic cycle, we should already be in underlying surplus and, in terms of our large current account deficit and low private savings, a substantial surplus at that. As to the benefits of bringing the budget back into balance, the Commonwealth government will play its part in taking pressure off interest rates, play its part in developing savings and play its part in addressing the current account deficit. Mr Speaker, you would be aware that the opposition is all at sea on the question of what it would do in relation to the budget and the balance. The Leader of the Opposition began by denying that there even was a deficit and refusing to accept the Treasury's report, a report which was equaIly available to him before the election as it was to us afterwards. When it was being debated in this House last Thursday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: So the figure in question when we are talking about all this is not the $8 billion, as is constantly thrown around; it is either $4.9 billion or-if you want to focus on the underlying deficit-$7.6 billionSo his big point is that it is not $8 billion, it is only $7.6 billion.",34
37,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Read the rest of it.,34
38,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Since you invite me to read the rest of it, I will. He went on to say: Of course the opposition accepts-as we did in government-that it is very desirable, other things being equal. for there to be a return to underlying fiscal balance as soon as possible. Oh Lord, make me pure, but not yet! We might have had 13 years, and it might be desirable to balance it, but we just happen to be running a $7.6 billion deficit! That is the position of the Deputy Leader which can be compared with his leader who says there is nothing to balance because there is no deficit. Sooner or later the opposition will have to get a handle on this, and they might as well get a handle which agrees with reality. The reality is that there is an underlying deficit of $8 billion, covered up by the finance minister during the election campaign, which requires balance-as said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-and which will require cooperation from the opposition. If the opposition truly believes in the importance and the benefits of balancing the budget, they will be supporting this government in its efforts to do what they could never achieve. Unemployment",34
39,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Have you seen the five-year business outlook released by Access Economics? Given Labor's job growth record, which reduced unemployment to 8.5 per cent with projections it would drop to five per cent by the turn of the century, what does it say for your policies that Access Economics predicts an unemployment rate of over nine per cent in the year 2000 with 100,000 more people out of work than there are today? Is this the real CosteIlo con? Is it the reason why the Prime Minister refuses to set an unemployment target?",34
40,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"I thank the member for Batman for his question. I suppose, on behalf of the coalition, I should thank the member for Batman and his coIleagues for the policies which delivered to the coalition in the last election a very significant proportion of Labor's traditional vote. Of course, the member for Batman was leader for six years of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and, during that greatest claim to fame was that he had managed to reduce the rate of real wage increases today. in Australia which he thought was an achievement because he was not able to get productivity up. Along with that, over the last six years he was the closest ally of a government which had an abysmal employment record. As that record has now been raised by the memfiscal ber for Batman, let me just remind him-and remind the Leader of the Opposition who claimed that that record was a very good record over the last six years-of what the facts are. It will be astonishing, I think, him, and to many members of this House, when we look at the record of this governtarget? . ment in creating full-time jobs. Over the last six years the number of full-time jobs in this country has increased by 7,100. Mr Martin Ferguson-Seven hundred and twenty thousand jobs.",34
41,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,What?,35
42,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Over the last six years there have only been 7,100 new, full-time jobs in Australia. Now this was the government that of course claimed that it had a very good employment record. We heard the Leader of the Opposition get up and say, 'Since the 1993 election we have created 730,000 new jobs.' What happens when. we subject those 730,000 new jobs to the microscope and remind people of the recession as wellcampaign which you would very much like to forget? You do not want to think about the impact the recession. I will tell you about those 730,000 new jobs. Almost half of them were part-time jobs which, of course, the unfair dismissallegislaian tion has had a very significant impact in creating. The remainder were barely enough consequences. t<;> outweigh the job destruction of the recesSIon. That is why over the last six years we have got only 7,100 new jobs and why we have had an increase in unemployment over that period from 6.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent. we have the member for Batman trying to suggest that somehow or other we have the problem with the employment ment the record. I say to the member for Batman that I have seen that report. That report has been time, his out since early April. Mr Latham-No, it hasn't. It was released",35
43,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"No, wake up to it. The growth forecasts used in that report were very low. The Treasury and market economists simply generally do not accept those forecasts. The tightening that we will be introducing to close your $8 billion hole and get rid of the waste and duplication that became such a feature of Commonwealth spending over the last 13 years will create the fundamental to conditions where there can be real job growth. Mr Martin Ferguson-What is your jobs",35
44,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"The member for Batman raises the question of the jobs target, the so-called five per cent jobs target by the year 2000. We have had a look at the analysis that was available to the former minister for employment in the Department of Employment, Education and Training. We asked that department what the unemployment rate would have been in the year 2000, on the information available to it at the time of the election. The answer we got was that, on very reasonable assumptions, the unemployment rate could be as high as 7.3 per centMr Crean-Table it!",35
45,Dr KEMP,Unknown,Through the whole election you went to the Australian people with a made-up target. You had no basis for of putting that forward as a target. It was a deliberate attempt to deceive the Australian people. The only thing we can say as a result of that election campaign is that the Australpeople saw right through you. They were . not deceived and now you are bearing the Industrial Relations: Accord,35
46,Mr BILSON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer considered the merits of an accord between the governNow ment and the ACTU? If so, what is the coming up government's position?",35
47,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Whereas this governwill be seeking to develop very cooperative relations with employees and their organisations, this government will not be entering into an accord. The failures of the accord between the Australian Labor Party and the ACro speak for themselves and the Australian people delivered a verdict on them on 2 March. What is more interesting, of course, is developments since. As I said at the time. I gave credit where it was due-the Leader of the Opposition was the first out of the blocks to announce that Labor would no longer have an accord with the ACro, a decision which we on this side of the House considered to be a wise one. The Deputy Leader of the Oppo:sition believes that there will always be a case for an accord. In the words of the old song, 'There will always be an ALP while there's an ACTU.' Even more interesting, going back and supporting the leader, I notice that Mr MCMullan told the Daily Telegraph today that 'Labor goes soft on Accord' - a much better position from Mr MCMullan. The report states: ""It's too early to say whether there will be an Accord arrangement (again),"" he said. ""They are reviewing their thinking on this as we are. II We would encourage you in that review. We would say that it would be very much in the interests of both sides of this House if neither side-in this case the opposition side-were to sell their political platform to one particular interest group, as was the case with the government over the last 13 years. I said at the outset of my answer that this government welcomes cooperative relations with employees and their organisations. As research in the last election shows, the fact is that this is the side of the House that represents blue collar workers. This is the side of the House that now has majority support . amongst blue collar workers. May I point out",35
48,Unknown,Unknown,Honourable members interjecting,36
49,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! On my left! I am sure the Treasurer is anxious to finalise his answer.,36
50,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"There were a lot of outstanding results on election night, on 2 March, but I think the one that gave this side of the House the greatest pleasure was the coalition victory at the Weipa ballot box as a result of the support of those at Weipa who supported the coalition and the coalition stand on industrial relations on 2 March. We heard a lot from the then government about the terrible working relationships and freedom that had developed at Weipa, but on 2 March the Weipa booth voted for the coalition, an illustration that it is now this side of the House that represents blue collar employees, this side of the House that will develop cooperative relations with them and this side of the House that will introduce the economic growth which will provide jobs for them. Productivity",36
51,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I might say by way of preface: if. you are so confident of representing blue collar workers, why don't you give up your preselection and run for Batman instead of your seat?",36
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Canberra will get to his question.,36
53,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Industrial Relations and follows on from the reference of the minister for schools to the importance of productivity. I ask him if he has seen the Access Economics five-year business outlook as it relates to productivity, which projects that labour productivity will fall under the coalition's policies to 1.3 per cent by the year 2000. Is this the sort of productivity target the government has set for itself?",36
54,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I must say I am surprised that the tactics committee on the other side has not decided to revisit its decision to ask this question. As a result of failures of the previous government to sufficiently reform the labour market, Australia's productivity performance has not been what it ought to have been. Despite a cyclical pick up following the recession, without the significant lift in productivity performance, which the Australian economy so desperately needs, it will be very difficult",36
55,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,I raise a point of order. This gentleman is misleading the House. The productivity rate under us was over two per cent. He has a 1.3 per cent figure in there. How does he explain it?,37
56,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point dismissal law. of order.,37
57,Mr REITH,Unknown,"One of the decisive factors in the recent election is that the Australian people have sensibly come to the conclusion that the previous government had no significonvention cant policy reforms that it would be able implement that would give people a chance higher pay. in the future. It is for that very simple and good reason that the coalition determined to introduce its industrial relto ations reforms and as a result chance to directly negotiate, subject to minimum conditions, the sorts of workplace reforms that will give people a chance of higher pay in the future. NA",37
58,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I inform the House we have present in the gallery this afternoon Speaker John Murray, Speaker of the Legislano tive Assembly of the parliament of New South Wales. On behalf of the House, I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Industrial Relations Mr NEIlL-My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask the minister: what is the government's reaction offers of conditional support for its industrial relations policy?",37
59,Mr REITH,Unknown,"The government is very pleased to have what support we can have our industrial relations package, which I say comes from many diverse quarters. For example, there is no doubt that a number people in the trade union movement will very pleased to see disamalgamation provistate .sions introduced into federal law. I have also noticed that there was a suggestion from the member for Canberra last Friday that he might support unfair dismissal proviexisting sion changes 'provided there is no change to the existing coverage provisions'. That was very interesting and qualified support for changes to the unfair dismissal laws, but let me explain why that is really a facade for opposing sensible changes to the unfair The reason that we have had problems with . the unfair dismissal laws in Australia is that the previous government, basically to subvert constitutional arrangements, signed the ILO 158 to give the federal parliament to the power to introduce a law of national of application. Because the previous government was using the external affairs power, it was, is on the Attorney-General's advice, constrained ensure that the federal unfair dismissal law give people a strictly complied withDr Tbeopbanous-I raise a point of order understanding order 145-relevance. The question concerned the various issues about what other groups are saying about the industrial relations reforms. It did not concern the former record of the Labor government in that relation to this issue.",37
60,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member has point of order. Resume your seat.,37
61,Mr REITH,Unknown,"The simple point, perhaps beyond the understanding of the honourable member, is that to say, as the member for Canberra says, 'provided there is no change to the existing coverage provisions' is to consign the federal law to strictly remaining within the constraints of convention 158. Mr Crean-Oh, rubbish!",37
62,Mr REITH,Unknown,"The interesting thing is that to that is the whole basis upon which the previous government proceeded with its unfair dismissal law. That is the basis upon which, having received the Attorney-General's for advice, the previous government believed it must could only do it that way, with the background, I remind honourable members, that of the previous government was not prepared to be achieve a complementary approach with the governments as a means to achieve a harmonised arrangement. Therefore, when the member for Canberra says 'provided there is no change to the coverage provisions' he is in fact saying by code that the opposition's policy is that the opposition must remain within convention 158. That is really an incredible proposition because even the former Prime Minister in the heat of the election campaign and under pressure for change said that the government would have to review the unfair dismissal laws. If a review of the unfair dismissal laws is to mean anything, then you have to review the starting point, which is convention 158. That is what the now shadow minister said on Friday. He has revealed that the opposition is not prepared to countenance genuine reform to the unfair dismissal laws which, as everybody knows, has been the cause of a lot of people either losing their jobs or a lot of businesses being unable to properly manage their work force. That is very disappointing because we genuinely believe we can have an alternative and sensible common sense approach to the unfair dismissal laws, but it seems that the opposition is set against. any such genuine reform. The only conclusion I come to is that the opposition is basically confused about its industrial relations policy, revealed starkly by the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is distancing himself from the accord, yet the shadow Treasurer a week ago said, 'There's always time for an accord.' What exactly is the opposition's position and what is its position on the unfair dismissal law? Mr BeazIey-A law that applies to all Australians and that is what is meant by coverage. You're the one being selective on it.",37
63,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Resume your seat. If you have a point of order, I'll listen to it.",38
64,Mr REITH,Unknown,"If anybody had any expectations that with the departure of the previous Minister for Industrial Relations we might have got a more sensible approach to this, these remarks last Friday of the new shadow minister reveal that rather than being a turning point for the opposition it seems that the new shadow minister for industrial relations is just the old Minister for Industrial Relations in disguise. Foreign Debt",38
65,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,"My question is to the Treasurer. It is also about his favourite outfit, Access Economics, and its latest five year business outlook, which incorporates all the policy changes associated with the coalition government. Is he aware that it predicts foreign debt to rise over the next five years to the calendar year 2000 by just on $120 billion, increasing in the process as a proportion of national income by 8Vz percentage points from 37.4 to 46 per cent? If he is minded to make some comparisons and to talk about the reality of life under the Labor government, will he acknowledge that this five-year prediction compares abominably with the last five years foreign debt record where, from 1990 to 1995, debt grew by $47 billion, not $120 billion, and by three percentage points, not 8Vz? I might just possibly have missed something, but didn't you promise to reduce foreign debt, not massively increase it?",38
66,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"The first thing I am glad to see is that the Labor Party has discovered foreign debt. After all, it was Labor that took foreign debt in net terms from $23 billion to $185 billion. When we sent the foreign debt truck around Australia, can you remember what happened? Mr Keating, the then Prime Minister, said, 'Foreign debt doesn't matter.' Don't you remember that? Don't you remember when the ALP Federal President, Mr Jones, got up at the caucus meeting and said, 'People are worried about foreign debt in Australia,' and Mr Keating said, 'I will issue talking notes to caucus to explain why it is not a problem'? The talking notes never appeared. We wonder if he is somewhere down there in Red Hill putting together the talking notes now. Maybe they were the talking notes you used in your 'speech' of introduction. The fact is that it was the coalition that warned your government about foreign debt repeatedly. The fact is that you failed Australia in relation to it. The fact is that the best thing you can do in relation to foreign debt in this country is develop savings, and the best short-term thing you can do to develop savings in this country is to aim for a balanced budget, something that you said you would have liked to have had but could never achieve.",38
67,Mr CAUSLEY,Unknown,My question is to the Minister for Trade. Could the minister expand on his reply to the Leader of the Opposition in regard to Australia's decline in export performance under Labor? What action is the minister taking to improve export performance? . Mr BEAZLEY - See if you can get it right this time.,39
68,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"The figures I used last time hurt you and your colleagues because they were accurate. With regard to the future, the member for Page correctly highlights the need to get our trade policy and settings correct. The government will set out to do that on a range of fronts. There is no one factor which will boost exports, but there is a range of government policies which will help create the right framework to boost our export performance. On the macro-economic settings, there is a range of decisions which are unfolding at this time, particularly with regard to industrial relations reform, shipping reform and the waterfront, which are all steps absolutely in the right direction and long overdue when you examine the performance benchmarking of Australian ports versus comparable international ports. In addition to that and more specifically in relation to trade, the World Trade Organisation at the multilateral level is of absolute priority for the government. Already I have attended a conference in Singapore as a prelude to the ministerial round meeting set down for December of this year, which will be hosted by Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, who is a very capable trade minister well known to former Minister MCMullan. Mr Laurie Ferguson-We have never heard of him.",39
69,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"You might display your ignorance. I have heard of him. I heard of him 10 years ago when I entertained him in Albury in my electorate when he was a backbencher visiting from the Singapore parliament. I was very happy to re-engage him, having exchanged cards and communications with him, his three daughters and others Trade over the years. I am very happy to say I enjoy a very good family connection with him which reflects the serious way we take our engagement with Asia. They are very capable ministers. On the multilateral side, I will also be furthering this relationship when I visit Jakarta next week at the invitation of Minister Hartarto, again as part of the lead-up to the Singapore ministerial round. On the regional side, there is a lot more detailed work to be done. Let me say in that regard that the government has appointed an ambassador to APEC, which is just part of our response in accord with our trade policy. We have also made up ground with regard to the individual action plan. We are in the process of completing that individual action plan, which is, again, getting on with the job of providing a basis for Australia to boost its export performance. Finally, on the regional basis, in response to the member for Page, there are a host of bilateral trade negotiations which we will be embarking on-some already on which progress has been made-to better our trade market access, because that cannot be ignored. We will be putting more effort into the bilaterals. To the hyenas opposite, who are chirping away about their performance in government, let me remind them of one thing. They were prepared in government to export jobs from Australia to Canada with regard to uranium policy over all these years. They were prepared to say it was okay to export uranium from east of the Western Australian boundary, from the Northern Territory and from South Australia, but uranium from Western Australia was somehow bad uranium and should be banned from export. You pursued an iIIogical policy with regard to uranium which dinted our export performance and which exported jobs to Canada. For that and for your Â·inadequate trade performance, you should be ashamed. Racial Discrimination Act",39
70,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister give a commitment to this House that the government will not seek to repeal, suspend or override the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975?",40
71,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The government has no plans to introduce any amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act, and I assume that the honourable gentleman has asked that question in the context of the review of the native title legislation which is now under way. I take the opportunity to repeat to the House the commitment I gave in the course of the election campaign; that is, the government does have proposals to amend the Native Title Act to ensure its workability. There is little doubt that legitimate concern entertained in the mining and pastoral industries and in other parts of Australia about the way in which the act is operating. There is also great concern amongst some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about the operation of the legislation. I have said that our commitment to amend to ensure workability is not some kind of Trojan Horse to gut the act. The amendments that we will shortly propose, and which I hope will draw the support of the opposition and the Australian Democrats, are, as I repeat, not designed as a Trojan Horse to wreck the act. They are designed to remove some of the uncertainty which is working unfairly, particularly against the mining industry in parts of Australia and against the pastoral industry in other parts of Australia. I make no apology for saying that-no apology whatsoever. So they are not designed as a Trojan Horse. You will see that the amendments, when they come out, will honour the principles of the native title legislation. But I think one of difficulties of the existing Native Title Act that there were a number of things enshrined in that act that were never raised in the - original Mabo decision and, having read the Mabo decision myself, there is a great deal in that. In fact, the substance of that decision, now with the passage of time, seems completely unexceptionable to me. It appears to have been based on a great deal of logic and fairness and proper principle. It is the legislationMr Bevis-It's a pity you didn't say that at the time.",40
72,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The honourable member for Brisbane interjects. I repeat what I said a moment ago: there were many things that were put into the Native Title Act that were not in the original decision, and that is the problem. I notice other honourable members who know something about this-in contrast to some people who talk and write about it. That is where the former government, with respect, went wrong. The Mabo decision of the High Court was one thing. There were many things that were put in the legislation. There were concepts introduced into the Native Title Act which is have caused the log jam and caused the problem that were never contemplated by the justices of the High Court when they brought down their decision in Mabo v. Queensland (No.2). That is the problem. That is the problem we are going to try to address, and I hope the honourable member for Banks and his colleague approach this thing in a constructive fashion. Murray-Darling Basin",40
73,Mrs STONE,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the government aware of community concerns about the state of the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin? What action is the government prepared to take so that future generations, as well as farmers and those reliant on the river system for water, can be assured that degradation does not continue unabated?",40
74,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The honourable member properly raises a concern about the Murray-Darling Basin. It is no exaggeration to say the that that basin is crucial to Australia's econis omy. Nearly two million Australians live in the basin, which produces one-third of the nation's output from rural industries. To say that it is in a state of disrepair is a massive understatement. Fifteen billion trees have been removed from the Murray-Darling Basin. About one-third of Victoria's irrigation area has been salinised. Changes in flow volumes and patterns mean that the mouth of the Murray is likely to experience drought in six out of every 10 years, compared with a natural drought frequency of once every years. So six out of 10 versus one every 20. In addition, the basin is subject ly more frequent algal blooms, a steady decline in water quality, bank erosion, ing fish stocks and the deterioration of nationally significant wetlands. The coalition presented at the last election campaign a comprehensive plan to tackle this problem. The two core elements of that are $163 million to implement the Murraybase, Darling 2001 project over the next five years and then also the provision of $318 million over five years on our national vegetation initiative, with a target of revegetating 250,000 hectares per annum. These measures have drawn universal support. They have drawn support from the National Farmers Federation and from envito ronmental groups like the Wilderness Society and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature. honourable members know, both of these which initiatives and other initiatives are to be financed out of the Natural Heritage Trust Australia, which is to draw its $1 billion capital funding from the proceeds of the third sale of Telstra. People ought to understand that, if they want this program implemented, they ought to support the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. It is all very for those who sit opposite and the Australian Democrats to run around saying, 'Oh, you get the money from somewhere else.' If you had not left us with an $8 billion mess, that have been possible. But the fact of the matter is that the only real prospect of these sorts projects being effectively addressed is the establishment of that Natural Heritage Trust. Every member of this House and every legislation? member of the other chamber who votes against the funding of the Natural Heritage Trust is voting against the cleaning up of Murray-Darling Basin. That should be underthe stood. Every single Victorian and South this Australian member as well as many New South Wales members know only too well the damage that will do. Your concern about Australian environment, your concern about the long-term viability of rural Australia and your concern about the livelihood of millions 20 of Australians is going to be very much on the line if you decide to oppose these measto significantures to clean it up. So let us not have any sophistry. Let us not declinhave any Alice in Wonderland idea that inter- somehow or other you can finance these things out of thin air. We do not have an easy budgetary situation. People who argue that it is perfectly responsible to call for all of this expenditure yet to reject the capital funding which is the one-third sale of Telstra, are engaging in Alice in Wonderland economics. They have no appreciation of our fiscal situation. But, even worse, they have a complete indifference to Australia's environmental future. Murray-Darling Basin",40
75,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is directed the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister would be aware that the budget deficit is As somewhat less than one per cent of GDP, is, of course, an enviable position for any industrialised country. That is point one. of The Prime Minister would also be aware that of those priorities that he mentioned were taken oneup by the opposition when in government and were included in our environmental proposals. Can the Prime Minister tell us why that very effective presentation of the needs of the Murray-Darling system ought to be exclusivewell ly funded via that process instead of off normal budgetary processes, like all the priorities in education, defence, health and the social security system? There is $130 billion might worth of expenditure in those areas. What makes Murray-Darling unique that it is not of entitled to consideration under that and is obliged to be considered only in an effort to blackmail us to put through your Telstra",41
76,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question is yes; I am so the aware. But I am also aware that because of chronic balance of payments problem that country still has, which is a direct legacy of your 13 years in government and which can only be cured by improving our savings the performance and by improving our microeconomic performance, it is more necessary for Australia than many other OECD countries to achieve an underlying balance in our budget. If we did not have such a chronic savings difficulty, if you had not left us with such a huge foreign debt, there would not be quite so much pressure for fiscal consolidation. But, of course, you have done that. I would be very interested to hear from the Leader of the Opposition about the $1 billion of recurrent expenditure he would like to replace the $1 billion that he reckons ought not to come out of the proceeds of the sale of Telstra. I would like to hear from him. Do you want to take it off pensions? Do you want to take it off Defence? Do you want to take it off schools? Do you want to take it off Health? Or do you want to take it off some of the other programs? We will be all ears to hear what you have to say. Landmines",41
77,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister inform the House of the government's reaction to the outcome of the recent Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference? Is it correct that the conference failed to support Australia's position calling for a global ban on the use, transfer, production and stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines?",42
78,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her great interest in the issue of antipersonnel landmines and her desire, along with the desire of most Australians, to see the elimination of these appalling weapons. As the member suggested in her question, the government was disappointed with the outcome of the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference, which concluded in Geneva last Friday. We were disappointed because there was insufficient support for the Australian government's position for a total ban on the use, transfer, production and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines. Nevertheless, we did get the support of some 30 countries in that process, and we are glad that we have been able to play something of a leadership role in encouraging international support for our position-the position being the support for a total ban. Nevertheless, there still remain many countries which do not wish to go down that path. We, however, have the opportunity in the months ahead to continue our campaign for a global ban on the use of antipersonnel landmines, and we will do that. We will go out and seek to persuade and encourage that process. We have had some success since we made our announcement a month or so ago on our policy on this issue. We have not had enough success. It will be an important component of this government's diplomacy that we will be arguing for global support for the ban on the use, transfer, production and stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines. I want to add one more thing, and that is to say this: there are some in the community who say that we have not been successful so far in achieving what we wanted to achieve in the inhumane weapons convention conference, so why not do something else to try to help clear up the problem of landmines. I completely agree with that. Consequent to that, yesterday I announced that the government would initiate a new program spending some $12 million to assist with de-mining in Cambodia and Laos. That $12 million will be distributed through the United Nations and also the Cambodian Mines Action Centre working with the Australian Defence Force. So we are not just saying that we are arguing the case diplomatically-we are doing thatbut we are doing something in practice as well. We are spending some of our development assistance budget on making sure there is a significant increase in the Australian contribution to de-mining in Cambodia and Laos. All I can say is that this government in very few weeks has shown itself to be a humane government prepared to take constructive action to deal with, as I think all members would agree, something as appalling and destructive as antipersonnel landmines.",42
79,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Independents: Entitlement to Questions",42
80,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"This is not a matter which is covered by the standing orders; however, it goes to equity. You will notice that in the parliament there are 48 members of the Labor Party and five Independents. On that ratio, it would seem that the each of the Independents is entitled to at least tion every 10 questions. It does not appear that we are getting this. Would you have a look at the equity of this argument instead of adhering to the precedents that were set in different circumstances?",43
81,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I have a paper from the five Independents which is getting a great deal of my personal attention at the moment. I hope to come up with a satisfactory solution to your problems later today or tomorrow. Question Time,43
82,Mr ANDREN,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, notwithstanding the importance of the statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, what steps will you take to make question time a vehicle for legitimate inquiries from members about their constituents, not an opportunity for the government to make ministerial statements or to debate proposed legislation, which should by rights be restricted to another time?",43
83,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I recognise the comparatively short time that the member for Calare has been with us and I recognise that a great deal of fairness and equity drives the deliberand ations of the chair, and that will be pursued with some vigour. Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms:",43
84,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I thank you very much for the opportunity to ask you this very important question which has some relevance to my electorate. It has been brought to my attention that there are available in the parliamentary dining room wines and champagnes that are imported to this country. Can you give a guarantee that only Australian wines will be available in the parliamentary dining room?",43
85,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I take cognisance of the member for the Hunter's active interest arena. I understand that the champagnes that are stocked in the parliamentary dining room come largely from overseas but that there is a wide range of Australian sparkling wines available. Given the essence of fairness and equity I mentioned to the member of Calare a moment ago, I am sure that if we get a reasonable array of wines from the Yarra Valley as well as the Hunter everybody will one ques- end up reasonably happy. NA",43
86,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Marriage To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows that: We believe that the traditional Christian view of the family unit excludes anything other than a male and female, living in a lawful marriage relationship, along with their children, and that it is necessary for this to be restated by our political leaders. We reaffinn our belief in the traditional Christian view of marriage as God's holy institution in which male and female become one flesh. (Genesis 2.24; Matthew 19.5,6) We reaffirm that God is the author of marriage, and has restricted it to the union of male with female and that such marriage between male and female is commended in Scripture as honourable among all. (Ephesians 5.15-23) We reaffirm that such marriage between male female is ordained for life-long companionship, help and comfort which husband and wife ought to have of each other. (Romans 7.2,3) We reaffirm that children are a heritage of the Wines Lord and should be nurtured in a godly home, and that human society can be strong and happy only where the marriage bond is held in honour. (Psalm 127.3) We reaffirm that incestuous marriages can never be made lawful by the law of any man or government, or the consent of parties, so as to allow those people to live together as married couples. (Mark 6.18; Leviticus 18.6-28) We reaffirm that, according to Biblical law, it is forbidden for a male to practise sexual intercourse with another male, or for a female with a female, and that since this is an abomination before the Lord, such as a prohibited relationship for marriage. in this (Leviticus 18.22; 20.13) We believe the entire stability and well being of our society depends on maintaining this traditional Christian view of marriage and family (Leviticus 20.15-16; 18.23-24) Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives should calion the Government to: (a) Preserve completely intact the exclusiveness of marriage as being one male and one female. (b) That the definition of a prohibited relationship in the Marriage Act 1961, Part ill 23(2) be amended with the addition of a new clause (c) so that it reads as follows: (2) Marriages of parties within a prohibited relationship are marriages(a) between a person and an ancestor or descendant of the person; or (b) between a brother and a sister (whether of the whole blood or the half blood); or (c) between a male and a male or between a female and a female. Your Petitioners humbly pray. by Mr Anderson (from five citizens) and Mr O'Connor (from 28 citizens). Your petitioners ask that the House of Representatives should call on the government to: (a) Preserve completely intact the exclusiveness of marriage as being one male and one female. (b) Amend the definition of a prohibited relationship in the Marriage Act 1961, Part ill 23(2) by adding a new clause (c) so that it reads as follows: (2) Marriages of parties within Ii prohibited relationship are marriages(a) between a person and an ancestor or descendant of the person; or (b) between a brother and a sister (whether of the whole blood or the half blood); or (c) between a male and a male or between a female and a female. Your petitioners humbly pray. by Mr Howard (from 116 citizens). Telecommunications National Code The petition of certain residents of the electorate of Kooyong draw to the attention of the House our concern that local planning authorities are not able to fully represent the wishes of local residents under the present Telecommunications National Code. We therefore request that the House take the necessary steps to resolve the above issue and that a new Telecommunications National Code be introduced with more power for local councils so that the concerns of the community are taken into account and residents are fully informed of planned installations of mobile telephone towers and cabling for pay television. by Mr Georgiou (from 806 citizens) and Mr Lee (from 23 citizens). Fuel To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The following citizens of Australia request that the House of Representatives notes with concern: (1) the high cost of fuel, especially in country, regional and remote areas of Australia; (2) that country residents are frequently required to pay from 7 cents to 14 cents per litre higher than prices in the city, despite regulation of maximum wholesale prices and transport costs; (3) that fuel consumers in both city and country areas do not always have access to ail effective open, transparent and competitive market that is fair to all consumers, free from discrimination; and (4) that fair and reasonable fuel prices for all consumers are not available under existing pracMarriage tices. Your Petitioners request the House to calion the government to act to address these problems by implementing the proposals of the RACV, VFF and VACC to: (a) assist in the establishment of a voluntary oil industry code of conduct involving a system of access to fuel designed tQ prevent unfair discrimination between retailers of fuel in the country and the city; (b) ensure wholesale fuel prices are published daily; . (c) ensure oil companies are able to set the price for fuel at different rates recognising the commercial realities of price differences based on volume and terms of payment; (d) ensure all wholesale purchasers have access to fuel at the published rate applicable to the volume of fuel and the terms of payment involved in the transaction; (e) ensure that wholesale fuel should not be offered at different prices at delivery to different customers based on the geographic area in which the customer operates; and (f) open oil terminals to any potential customer with an appropriate vehicle and qualified driver; and Your Petitioners request that the House further calls on the government to ensure that the new system is closely monitored by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and if evidence of discrimination, uncompetitive practices or profiteering is discovered, to take firm and prompt action against those involved in such unfair and unacceptable practices. by Mr Lieberman (from 21,629 citizens) and Mr Ronaldson (from 2,363 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that: for the first time there is a drug brand name, Betaferon, which has proven to assist many people with Multiple Sclerosis. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to have Betaferon subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). With this listing the drug would cost $ I 500 per month which is clearly unaffordable. by Mr Melham (from 16 citizens) and Mr Allan Morris (from 20 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker arid Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing al flag. 2. We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Andrews (from 20 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the plight of young Australian adults suffering from multiple sclerosis. At present Betaferon, the only drug available to the improve the quality of life for these citizens and potentially decrease the percentage of these people that will inevitably become a disabled burden on society and the government, is not available as a subsidised drug. Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate to make Betaferon available as a subsidised drug for all Australians that may benefit from it. by Mrs Bailey (from 4,031 citizens). East Timor To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: Betaferon The petition of the undersigned shows that we are gravely concerned that the Australian Government response to the East Timor situation is inadequate and inappropriate. Your petitioners request that the House of Representatives should urge the Australian Government to: (a) Stop any training of Indonesian military forces in Australia. (b) Urge Indonesia to accept an act of self determination supervised by the United Nations.  Sudan To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: (a) the Sudanese Government's policies of genocide against Sudanese groups are repugnant, and (b) the sustained and systematic attempt to enforce Sharia law on non-Islamic citizens is Australian nationcondemned. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives will persuade the Government and the international community, including the UN Security Council to: (i) impose an arms embargo on the Government in a national poll. of Sudan (ii) establish air exclusion zones in Sudan (iii) support the peace initiatives of the InterGovernmental Authority for Drought and Desertification Betaferon (iv) engage in discussion with all officially banned democratic opposition groups (v) ensure the immediate access by the United Nations Operation, Life-Line Sudan and other aid agencies into all areas; and (vi) provide teams to monitor human rights in the north, south and the Nuba Mountains of Sudan. by Mr Cadman (from 408 citizens). Commonwealth Education Centres To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of community members and clients of the Ballarat Community Education Centre in Ballarat, Victoria, draws the attention of the House to the proposal in the Federal Budget of May 1995 to discontinue federal funding of the Commonwealth Education Centres Program at the end of 1996. Your petitioners therefore request the House to restore federal funding to the Commonwealth Education Centres Program as of the end of 1996, to enable Centres to continue to deliver the quality, comprehensive professional development, curriculum development and community services, both locally and nationally, that they have delivered since their establishment, and which they are perfectly positioned to continue to deliver, provided their core funding is retained. The $2.6 million which funds the entire Commonwealth Education Centre program represents extraordinarily good value for the Commonwealth dollar outlay, enabling Education Centres to provide an outstanding infrastructure of quality human and physical resources (local and national) serving extensive networks through quality partnerships (local and national) which will be lost if federal funding is reinstated. by Mr Crean (from 10 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws the attention of the House to the following: The creation of an American Health Care System in Australia through the empowerment of health insurance companies through legislation known as the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Act 1994 to conscript doctors and to dictate terms and conditions of treatment of patients with private health insurance and to exclude categories of illness from health insurance products and to divulge to the Commonwealth government the personal details of illnesses for which hospitalisation is required. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House should reject or repeal the above legislation. by Mr Downer (from 74 citizens). Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the . House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia respectively showeth that: We believe the federally funded Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement to be discriminatory and divisive. We believe the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement does not stand for truth, justice, or the egalitarian Australian way and, does in fact, discriminate between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal persons by virtue of its name and practice. We believe there should be only one federally funded Legal Rights Movement for all Australians, regardless of colour, culture or ethnic background. In conclusion to the above points of concern, we believe that funding to the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement is a waste of Australian Taxpayer money and Resources. Your petitioners as in duty bound therefore respectfully request, that this House take the necessary decisive steps to ensure that all funding for this discriminatory movement is abolished immediately. by Mr Martyn Evans (from 25 citizens). Croatia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the not House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of certain Australian citizens draws to the attention of the House the need to establish an Australian Embassy in the Republic of Croatia: Health because of the many difficulties experienced by Australian citizens accessing limited consular services when travelling through Croatia; because of the limited consular services in Croatia, requiring Australian citizens to visit the Australian Embassy in Austria, incurring travelling and other costs; and to establish and Â·maintain economic and political ties, for the mutual benefit of Australia and the Republic of Croatia. Your Petitioners respectfully request that the House should: take appropriate and immediate action to establish an Australian Embassy in the Republic of Croatia. by Mr Filing (from 4,578 citizens). Wagga Wagga Regional Taxation Office To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the closure of the Wagga Wagga Regional Taxation Office. Your petitioners therefore request the House to  turn the decision of the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Cannody, and that all staff of the regional office be reinstated. by Mr Tim Fischer (from 47 citizens). Family Law To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes: 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel, the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3. That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties. 4. That a modified fault clause be re-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties. 5. That the Child Support Agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within the Tribunal. 6. That apart from cases of exceptional circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable right of all parents. 7. That altemative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the churches and that much more emphasis be placed on mediation in resolving disputes prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. by Mr Hawker (from 708 citizens). Newsagents To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the State of Victoria respectfully shows: 1. Authorised news agents are one of the last remaining bastions of family owned and operated business and provide an efficient, low-cost and convenient service; 2. The present system of newspaper distribution guarantees that every Victorian, no matter where they live, has access to home delivery of daily newspapers; 3. Owners of newsagencies have purchased their business and invested in new technology on the security of a defined distribution territory for home delivery and supply to sub-agents; 4. The Trade Practices Commission's plans to deregulate newspaper distribution will spell the end of universal home delivery, increase costs to consumers and force many newsagents out of business. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Parliament of Australia will: (a) express its support for the present system of newspaper distribution in Victoria and the commercial survival of family owned and operated newsagents; and (b) urge the Federal Government to direct the Trade Commission to ensure that its deliberations do not disadvantage newsagents who have invested time and money in building reputable businesses based on commercial arrangements which the Commission proposes to abolish. by Mr Hawker (from 93 citizens). Dementia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House the acute lack of appropriate accommodation for people suffering Dementia. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will provide suitable accommodation for people suffering from Dementia and the need for their partner to be close by. by Mr Jull (from 170 citizens). Parliament: Racial Discrimination To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain residents of the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House the recent election to the House of Representatives of Members who, during their election campaign, openly manipulated racist sentiments against and about the Aboriginal Peoples of Australia as a means to gain office in the national Parliament. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to publicly condemn the use of racial attacks by candidates or political parties in federal elections, and to call upon Members to represent all of their constituents without racial discrimination, fear or favour, and to establish and enforce a code of race ethics to be observed by Members as national representatives of the citizens of Australia. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Melham (from 280 citizens). UN Weapons Convention To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia attention of the House to the coming Review Conference of the United Nations Weapons Convention. The Convention came into force in 1983 and has been ratified by 41 countries. This is the first opportunity-and the last for at least another 10 years-to review its workings. It is clear that for its good intentions, the Convention has had little impact on restricting the use of deadly weapons it set out to regulate in 1983, particularly landmines. Mines are now proliferating so fast that there are perhaps as many as 100 million of them in 62 countries. Scattered like deadly seeds, they have turned whole swaths of many countries into deserted, no-go areas. We believe: that the 1980 UN Weapons Convention should impose effective restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons; that from a humanitarian point of view, that the only truly effective solution is the outlawing of anti-personnel mines; that the Convention must take a stand against new, even more terrifying weapons, such as lasers which can destroy the eyesight of their victims; that the UN Weapons Convention be extended to cover internal anned conflict and include practical means of enforcement and wide-ranging control mechanisms. We urge the Parliament to support the extension of the UN Weapons Convention in the above terms and press for its ratification by all nations. by Mr Moore (from 226 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. (1) The Australian Tax Office has, through a recent tax ruling covering construction workers (fR 95/22) changed the rules relating to the tax treatment of fares and transport allowances paid to construction workers under their award. (2) The new ruling runs counter to arrangements which have existed for many years and which were reaffirmed in 1989. (3) As a result of these changes workers in the construction industry stand to suffer a significant reduction in their take home pay. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to take the necessary steps to ensure that construction workers do not suffer a pay cut as a result of changes to long-standing tax rules which have applied to our industry. draws by Mr Allan Morris (from 71 citizens). Immigration: Sudanese Persons To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the undersigned petitioners, residents of Australia, draw to the attention of the House the all fact that only Sudanese persons who were either residents of or citizens of Australia as at 11111992, are able to sponsor their relatives under the Special Assistance Program. Your petitioners therefore request that the House allow all Sudanese persons, either residents of or citizens of Australia, be allowed to sponsor their relatives under this Program. by Mr Mossfield (from 157 citizens). Aged Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: The following electors of the division of Cowper draw to the attention of the House the urgent need for more nursing home beds, hostel places and Community Aged Care Packages in Cowper, given the rapidly growing population of citizens aged 70 years and over. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to take immediate action to solve the aged care crisis in Cowper. by Mr Nehl (from 1,783 citizens). Aged Care Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales Inc., Mid North Coast Area Council To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the Taxation House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of members by the above association and residents of Cowper draws attention to the House of the increasing shortage of aged care accommodation in the Urunga-Bellingen-Coffs Harbour area. Your petitioners therefore ask the Federal Parliament to accept that the funding for aged care i.e. (Hostel and Nursing Home) accommodation in the above locations are suffering a 'gross shortage' of funding and that the Federal Government provide vastly increased funding for aged care to bring Cowper equal to other electorates of New South Wales. by Mr Nehl (from 180 citizens). School Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, Canberra in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned concerned citizens of Queensland respectfully showeth: That the existing non-governmental school equity funding policies are discriminatory, inequitable and unjust.

Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives calion the Government to: (a) increase funding for breast cancer research ten-fold (a minimum of $14 million) in the 1996/97 Budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations for breast cancer research. by Mr Taylor (from 74 citizens). Mobile Telephone Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of rural areas of South Australia draws to the attention of the House that we are not yet able to access Mobile Phone Networks in our region and there are no plans to give us access in the near future. We believe that we are entitled to receive this service and have many people who want and need this service. We are disadvantaged by the telecommunications industry'S unwillingness to develop this service in our region in the near future and give us the same level of service that is available in urban areas. . Your petitioners therefore request the House to ask Austel to fulfil its requirements under the General Objectives of the Telecommunications Act and take action to have this service put in place in the near future.

87,The Clerk,Unknown,"Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Craigieburn Railway Line RESPONSE TO PEfITION PRESENTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON 18 SEPTEMBER 1995 BY MR P.R. CLEELAND RENA RAILWAY LINE TO CRAIGIEBURN. In the 1995 Federal Budget the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, the Hon Brian Howe MHR, announced that $36 million would be provided over six years for continued Better Cities planning and detailed studies in priority areas where major capital investment is expected. He also announced that $200 million over four years would be provided for capital investment in developing Australia's major cities and to advance national economic, social and environmental performance. Proposals for planning studies to be funded under the Better Cities Program are currently being considered by the Department of Housing and Regional Development. The North West area of Melbourne where the Craigieburn railway line is located is one of the areas for which planning studies are being considered. This more detailed work would follow on from work previously funded by the Commonwealth which recently produced that ""Strategic Infrastructure Development Projects and Programs for the North West Region"" Report. Public Transport projects, including the electrification of railways lines, were identified by that report as integral to the future economic development of the region as well as its improved liveability. The Minister for Housing and Regional Development will be announcing funding approval for planning studies under the Better Cities Program in the near future. Pulmozyme RESPONSE TO PEITfION PRESENTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESON 18 SEPTEMBER 1995 BY THE HON. M.J. LEE AND THE HON. R.E. TICKNER AND ON 25 SEPTEMBER 1995 BY MR G.B. NEHL MP RELATING TO THE MEDICATION PULMOZYME. The petition relates to a request that the drug PULMOZYME (dornase) be subsidised by the Federal Government under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Under the PBS, drugs and medicinal preparations are made available as pharmaceutical benefits on the recommendation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (pBAC), the expert body that advises me on such matters. The PBAC also recommends any restrictions which are to apply to the prescribing of a drug as a pharmaceutical benefit. At its recent meeting, the PBAC reconsidered the availability of PL MOZYME inhalation solution as a pharmaceutical benefit for use in the management of cystic fibrosis. I am pleased to advise that the PBAC recommended the availability of this preparation under the PBS, with distribution from out-patient departments of public hospitals. I have accepted the recommendation. Before PULMOZYME can be supplied through the PBS, certain details require resolution. These include negotiation of a suitable price with the manufacturer, the determination of precise therapeutic criteria to select patients most ltkely to benefit from this expensive product, and arrangements with States and Territories for supply through their public hospital systems. At this stage, I am not in a position to specify a date on which PULMOZYME will become available through the PBS. However, the necessary processes are now in train so that cystic fibrosis patients will have pharmaceutical benefit access to this drug as soon as practicable. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Exicom",50
88,Mrs CROSIO,Unknown,"Prospect) (3.05 p.m.)During the first two sitting days of this parliament it was my privilege to listen to the many excellent eulogies and tributes delivered by members of this House to honour some of our recently departed great Australians. I would now like to take the opportunity to deliver a eulogy, of a sort, of my own. However, it is not a great Australian that I want to remember today but 680 ordinary Australian workers from my electorate: former employees of the telecommunications company Exicom, which shut its doors on 15 March 1996. The company deserves no kind words now that it has passed. It had been administered abominably. Exicom's senior management and directors must bear full responsibility for the heartache and worry into which they have now plunged the 680 workers-loyal employees, I might add-not only for delivering them to the DSS queue but at the same time for owing them $17 million in redundancy, long service, holiday and sick pay. With its main operation plant based in Villawood in my electorate, Exicom was Australia's largest manufacturer of telephones and it constructed power systems used in the telecommunication industry. It had subsidiaries in Melbourne, where it was involved in the import, sale and service of PABX systems, and also in New Zealand and the UK. Described by its then chairman, Barry Capp, in October 1994 as a 'nightmare', Exicom's operation was plagued by debilitating levels of debt. The cumulative losses reported for its nine years of trading to June 1995 were $104.4 million, consisting of $11.9 million in operating losses and $92.5 million in abnormal losses. Exicom finally went under in early March of this year when ERG Ltd, a Western Australian based company, and Simmonds Capital, a Canadian based communications and electronics company, pulled out of a $70 million recapitalisation package, a deal which Exicom's directors knew was essential for its survival and for the jobs of its employees. When the bargaining broke down, the administrators were called in and Exicom was placed into liquidation. The rest is historyand so, unfortunately, were Exicom's employees. Six hundred and eighty people are owed $17 million, made up of $6 million in annual and long service leave entitlements and approximately $11 million in redundancy entitlements. Why such an unusually high figure of redundancies? It is because the great majority of employees have been working for Exicom, and the telecommunications company AW A prior to its takeover for Exicom, for over 20 years. Under Exicom' s enterprise bargaining agreement, employees were entitled to three weeks redundancy for every year of service. Six hundred and eighty people, most of whom come from non-English speaking backgrounds and most of whom have worked on Exicom's or AW A' s factory floor for over 20 years, have now come to the end of their working lives for the company. They have unconditionally trusted Exicom and its management and have now been thrown on the scrap heap. There now remains only a slim chance that the employees will receive all of their annual long service leave entitlements and virtually no chance that they will receive the $11 million they are owed in redundancy payments. What a sorry mess. On Friday, 15 March, Exicom's workers arrived at the Villawood plant and were met by company management, the administrators and union officials, whose job it was to break the bad news regarding their jobs. They said, 'Go home. We've no money to pay you and don't come back on Monday.' Three shifts arrived that day for work and the message was the same. Another 200 people did come back on Monday-those who had not heard the news and others who had been told incorrectly by management that they could return. Again, they were told to leave. Union officials did their best to explain to the workers what was happening, but for many, panicked by the thought of not being able to support their families with no money and distraught at being shut out by a company that they had worked for all of their working lives in this country, the message was understandably confusing. Over the last few weeks outstanding wages, including RDO and bonus payments, have been paid but for those contemplating their futures beyond a week's worth of wages there has been little other solace. Some have actually been lucky enough to return to work. Nortel, a major Canadian telecommunications company, has now rehired approximately 70 people to work on a project which it had previously contracted Exicom to complete. Another company, Lemvest, has bought some parts of Exicom and has hired a small number of people to complete urgent contracts on a casual work basis only. Their future still remains uncertain. What of the other 600? They are confused and angry. Many have now demanded access to their superannuation funds, unaware of the penalty rates that would be imposed upon them in gaining access to any of this money. In their distress they have failed to consider the financial danger they would face in later life by using their superannuation now. They do feel betrayed and deceived by a company to which they have given their loyalty and, in tum, expected the same, only to find Exicom lacking. It is important for this House to realise that Exicom's final chapter was not written as a result of it falling into some unforeseen predicament. Its directors and senior staff have been gUilty of gross mismanagement over the years. The level of ineptitude reminds me of the Bonds and Skases of this world when they danced on Australia's financial stages during those lurid excesses of the early 1980s. Outgoing managing director, Bob Cruikshanks, told a shareholders meeting in 1994 that he was not quite sure how the company had survived for the previous 12 months. The workers were worried. On their behalf, the union officials repeatedly asked senior management if their members' long service leave was protected from company failure. As many times as they asked, they were given assurances that this was the case. They then turned around and drove the company further and further into debt through horrific deals and a series of bumbling 'keystone cop' style capers that characterised the company's management. What of Exicom' s TF400 phone, a product that was produced by the company for Telstra in order to replace the TF200 which it had previously supplied? They said there were a few minor problems with that. The TF400 did not work terribly well in the humidity of the Northern Territory. Telstra had to replace the faulty product to such an extent that it was forced to make a total damages claim against Exicom for about $33 million. I could go on and on into some of the bad management that we have seen in Exicom over the years. I could go on about the $300,000 a month they were committed to paying in rent for the factory up to the year 2008, about how they sold their cars to the Commonwealth Bank and then rented them back for $2,000 a vehicle per month. It is complete and utter madness. All this time, management was in a constant state of upheaval, the senior staff were replaced constantly and consistency in decision making certainly suffered. But that has provided little solace for those 600-plus people now without a job. The questions they are asking are, 'What now? What can be done?' I believe that I have a right to ask those questions here in the House. When Exicom was placed into liquidation the employees, as creditors, instantly became entitled to priority ahead of ordinary unsecured creditors under section 556 of the Corporations Law and were entitled to priority ahead of the Commonwealth Bank, as far as the floating charge asset realisations are concerned. However, the administrator's report to Exicom's creditors made it quite clear when it said: At this stage we consider it very unlikely employees will be paid their priorities in full. We have indicated to employees ... that the priorities be paid as funds become available in the following order: wages, leave and then retrenchment. Although there is now some prospect of all wages and leave amounts being paid within several months, we are not yet able to give an estimate of the timing or likely amount of funds which will become available to pay retrenchment entitlements. After the creditors meeting on 18 April the employees were told that they would receive some of their annual and long service leave payments by the middle of May. Who knows how much money that will be. Will it be 10c in the dollar or 20c or 50c? As for the redundancy payments, your guess is as good as mine. When thinking what could be done now for the workers who find themselves in this situation in the future, I was drawn to the Harmer report of 1988, otherwise known as the Australian Law Reform Commission's general insolvency inquiry. The Harmer report brought up the question of a wage earner protection fund as a means of combating the vulnerability of employees who find the company they work for has become insolvent. Although it is an oversimplification, a wage earner protection fund could be described as being similar to the present Medicare system, which all Australians now enjoy as a safeguard to their health. Already existing in many Western nations, including the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Israel and Japan, wage earner protection funds are in place solely for the purpose of paying arrears of wages and other benefits to the employees of an insolvent company. The funds are mostly financed by employers, although in Switzerland and the Netherlands employees also contribute. The commission sought views in 1988 on such a joint contribution arrangement being introduced in Australia. It is argued that wage earner protection funds in these countries have been successful in delivering to workers of insolvent companies a guaranteed prompt payment of moneys owed and a reduction in the amount of litigation taken out by workers against their former employers. It is also argued-predictably so-that such funds place will an undue burden on companies. I would counter such claims by pointing out that a wage earner protection fund, acting as a safety net for a worker suddenly bereft of employment, is a far better arrangement than having the ex-employee face the Department of Social Security cap in hand and begging for a payment. All they are asking for is what they are rightfully due. It is not too late to now give consideration to that. It is too late for the workers of Exicom, we all know that in time this type of thing will happen again and a large company, not within my electorate perhaps but in other electorates around this country, could go to the wall, again affecting hundreds, and possibly thousands, of innocent and shell-shocked Australian workers by their action. (Time expired) Attention Deficit Disorder",51
89,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"I have a grievance today on behalf of those families who suffer with their children who are unruly, hyperactive and, at times distant. I have a grievance for Australiachildren, mostly boys, who cannot cope with the antiquated structures of the Australian education system. I have a grievance for those Australian teenagers who leave school and try to s-art t-eir adult years lacking the necessary socIal skills to allow them to participate fully in Australian society. I have a grievance for those Australians, mostly male, languishing-quite rightly-in gaol after committing crimes against our society that could have been easily avoided with proper attention and care to their needs. I have a grievance against all Australian parliaments for ignoring one of the major medical conditions to affect our society. Yet no acceptance of its importance has been made by government or the medical profession. Today I grieve for those who suffer from attention deficit disorder. Attention deficit disorder, or ADD-and ADHD as it is commonly known-is misunderstood by many. It is not a behavioural problem as presumed by many but is a behavioural expression of a problem defined in many different ways. It is a neurobiological disorder or imbalance. The incidence rate is not clear because of the continued lack of clear and accurate data. However, depending on the source of information, the disorder affects between five and .20 per cent of the child population. That basically means that 3.4 million Australians suffer, or have suffered, from attention disorder. Surely this is a statistic that should be of concern to all Australians, yet little acknowledgment or action has come from but Australian governments in addressing this issue. ADD is more common in boys than it is in girls, although recent studies suggest that girls are less identified because they exhibit fewer aggressive, hyperactive characteristics and do not come to the attention of teachers. It has be-n thought that by the age of puberty children grow out of this condition. However, the most recent evidence shows that ADD may be a life disorder with many children learning to control their problems during their teen years. For about 50 to 70 per cent of children with ADD, some of the problems will continue into adulthood. Let us all understand that ADD is not the result of bad parenting and that ADD is not the excuse that parents are looking for for disobedient children. ADD is not the answer for most children's bad behaviour. ADD is not the latest yuppie disorder; it is a real disorder, a medical disorder, mainly genetically passed from generation to generation, with at least four per cent of cases caused through frontal lobe injury or birthing and often associated postnatal infection. ADD is a real concern on which the government in the United States of America spends in excess of $20 million annually on research grants through hospitals and universities. These are quite interesting facts, but let us look at the big picture. At a political level in Australia, ADD is an issue which is not contained within any single ministerial portfolio. It is vital that all members of the House be aware that the issue of ADD spans and extends over the following portfolios: health, education, welfare, justice, employment and children's services, to mention a few. In other words, governments at both federal and state levels need to take into account the individual human, family, community and financial costs engendered by people who suffer from ADD. An integrated policy and an introduction to appropriate services need to be set as a priority. There also needs to be a commitment from the responsible government ministers to deficit accept that ADD in fact does exist. ADD is not an issue to be placed in the too-hard basket. In fact, as a matter of urgency, we as a community need to identify testing programs for potential sufferers through early screening. We need to place research dollars into medical and university research areas. We need to provide support services for parents and siblings of people with ADD. We need to consult with authorities on appropriate training for teachers and curriculum development to cater for ADD needs. We need to establish screening and treatment programs for identified adults provide information to the wider community about the disorder as well as active ways deal with sufferers. All these initiatives require action to relieve the community some of its rapidly growing social ills. From research, it is clear that ADD can be sourced to some of our community social problems. Who in this chamber has an electorate not affected by the increasing crime rates of community, particularly juvenile crime rates? A recent electorate-wide survey in Cowan confirmed that 95 per cent of constituents either were victims or knew of others who were victims of crime. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would agree that this is staggering figure. Crime is a serious social problem and its connection to drug and factors substance abuse is well documented. In my view-and it is a view shared many Australians within Cowan--crime and drugs are not the social mores we want for our community, yet both crimes and the use of drugs are increasing without much sign stemming the ever increasing flow. The community is becoming increasingly fearful of the incidence of crime in our community, particularly drug induced or motivated crime. Crimes against our elderly are increasing. Crimes against community service providers taking action. like taxi drivers are increasing. It seems we as a community are hamstrung in responding solutions.",54
90,Mr KERR,Unknown,That is not true. Those are scare tactics.,55
91,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,You do not read the papers.,55
92,Mr KERR,Unknown,I read the reports.,55
93,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"Perception is reality, is it not? The most alarming aspect of this increasing social problem-the increasing crime rate and the increasing abuse of substances-is its connection with ADD. I say it is alarming because the substantial literature and studies about ADD have made the connection but Australian governments are yet to education take the condition seriously. The connection between ADD adolescents, crime prevention and the precursors of substance abuse cannot continue to be ignored or and demeaned. It cannot be subjugated to erroneous arguments relating to medication versus to behavioural management with an increasing bias to the 'flat earth' attitudes espoused by of commentators ignoring the last 20 years of research and literature on this particular issue. Mr Deputy Speaker, please be very clear on this issue. The relationship between ADD and criminal activity is contrary to the popular our concepts of causes, like socio-economic circumstances and psychosocial and extended family factors. Alarmingly, these concepts contribute considerably less to the cause of antisocial behaviour, substance abuse and offending than the combined effects of ADD a and conduct disorders. They do, however, affect prognosis and therefore hide the real associated with crime and drug abuse. It therefore becomes quite useless to debate by the separation of syndromes of ADD and other disorders which become irrelevant. What needs to be addressed in relation to crime, particularly delinquency and antisocial of behaviour leading to substance abuse and adult criminality, is the connection between these conditions and ADD. There is an abundance of studies and literature connecting the condition to antisocial behaviour, yet we have no government in Australia, state or federal, There is no government action to study the to connection of ADD to substance abuse and criminality. There is no government action to seek resolution or answers to the perplexing problem of ADD. We have no government action to seek solutions. Rhetoric is not the answer. Positive government action and program implementation is the only way to tackle this issue head on. For the sake of those restless children who fidget, are irritable, are overactive, have poor listening skills, are impulsive, break things and are interruptive; for the sake of those children who appear to be lazy, listless or forgetful, who sometimes can sit for long periods without movement and who are generally considered to be quiet children, we as a community need to reject the so-called do-gooders who would have us believe that ADD does not exist. We as a community need to accept the existence of ADD and begin to respond to the needs of these children. We as a government need to place ADD on the political agenda. We as a parliament should consider reviewing the current studies on ADD and consider having a parliamentary inquiry into its impact on antisocial behaviour, delinquency, substance abuse and adult criminality. Mr Deputy Speaker, I give notice that I move a motion in this House later today. I say to my parliamentary colleagues: if they yearn to respond to community increases in crime and if they want to respond to the increasing community demands for action on crime, they must learn to acknowledge the impact of ADD. Call for government action and raise the issue within your communities. The future of many young Australian children who suffer from this condition may depend upon your response. Small Business",55
94,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I grieve for the future of the small business sector in my electorate under the misguided economic policies of this government. In the election campaign just past, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) could not have built any higher expectations than he did for the future of the small business sector in Australthe is. He had the Australian people believing that every small business in this nation would quickly become a medium sized business. Today the cat is well and truly out of the bag. The cat is out of the bag courtesy of the five-year business outlook released by Access Economics. No-one in this House could . question the way in which Access Economics knows the coalition. It knows them well, having co-authored the Fightback document three years ago. It knows them well, having been referred to by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) as the shadow treasury. It knows them well, having been appointed by the Treasurer to run the commission of audit. So Access Economics is perfectly placed to project and forecast the economic policies of this government. The results released today are absolutely stunning. They show that under this government unemployment will go up over the next five years. Under this government foreign debt will go up over the next five years. Under this government growth will be flat as a tack over the next five years. Interest rates will go up and for the small business sector there will be a lethal cocktail of high interest rates, low spending power and low growth. Sector by sector the figures are very disapwill pointing. They demonstrate the falsity of the Prime Minister's promise to the small business sector. For the manufacturing sector, growth will fall from 6.4 per cent last year to 2.7 per cent by the end of the decade. For the new residential sector, all those tradesmen in the construction industry, all those small business people relying on the strength of the new residential sector, growth will go down from 3.5 per cent to negative growth of almost five per cent by the end of the decade. Similarly, retail turnover will go down from 5.3 per cent to 2.1 per cent. Commercial services and recreational services will go down, down, down. This is a government which is intent on reducing spending power. The CUlprit, the guilty party, is at the table-that is, the member for Macarthur and Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey). He was unwanted by the people of New South Wales and unwanted by private sector in his semi-retirement so now comes into this parliament to drive down spending power in places like Campbelltown and Liverpool in my electorate and throughout the Macarthur district in his own electorate. The evidence is there in black and white, produced by Access Economics today. It states: The forthcoming budget is shaping as a key shortterm negative for 1996-97pushing unemployment over nine per cent. It goes on: These policiesthe policies of the finance minister and the Howard governmentwill bleed money away from the wholesale and retail trade sector. Where are most of the small businesses located in sector terms? They are in the retail trade sector. So all those small businesses along the main street of Camden in the electorate of Macarthur, or along the main street of Campbelltown in the electorate of Werriwa, are losing spending power. The finance minister is taking money from consumers' pockets, money they would otherwise be spending in the small businesses of those electorates. When it is all said and done you can divide the $10 billion cut-the $2 billion announced just before the election and the $8 billion announced subsequently-by each of the federal electorates represented in this parliament and those cuts represent $67 million per electorate. That is $67 million of lost spending power for each electorate of the Commonwealth. If you take $67 million from the pockets of people in Campbelltown or Camden it is not replaced by the private sector. is money lost forever as part of this government's mistimed and misguided economic policies. The Minister for Finance is taking money out of the pockets of people in Camden and Campbelltown which would otherwise be spent in small businesses. He is turning small business in his electorate and my electorate into minuscule business. That is the policy of the Howard government. In the mid-1980s the Reagan administration in the United States had this slogan: arm to disarm. I was always amused by that. The Howard government has an equally curious slogan-sack to employ. Sack 30,000 public servants somehow to employ. Sack tens of thousands of Australians while promising to improve the unemployment rate. It is indisputable that 30,000 lost jobs multiplies, be it in the electorate ta, the electorate of Lindsay or the electorate of Werriwa. For every person who goes on the dole there is lost spending power in the local economy. Public servants feed their families, house them, look after them and spend money in their local economy. When money is taken out of their pockets to the tune of $67 million of lost spending power per electorate, that translates into a big increase in the unemployment rate, particularly",56
95,Mr KERR,Unknown,In regions.,57
96,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Yes, particularly in regions that cannot - fford that loss of spending power-regions like Macarthur, Tasmania, western Sydney, western Melbourne-where, if you take out public money and public resources, it is not immediately or eventually replaced. by the private sector. There is no replacement effect. It is money lost. It is spending power lost. It is jobs lost hand over fist. This government does not understand the importance of the demand side of the economy. It has a supply side fetish. Its only interest in economic policy is the supply side. It has no understanding of demand, of spending power at a regional level. It is the same with industrial relations. What, at the end of the day, do individual employment contracts It achieve? They drive down wages. And as they drive down wages they drive down spending power. There is no doubt about that. I wish the government would acknowledge that the spending power of wages in regional economies matters so much more than the price of labour. Under this government we have low demand. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) outlined a goal of transferring four per cent of GDP from consumption to savings. That is an average loss of spending power in the electorate of Werriwa of $124 million. And that $124 million of lost spending power will not be replaced by the private sector. It is also a government characterised by high interest rates. It has abolished wages policy. It places greater weight on monetary policy so up go the interest rates. This is a government of low growth, low demand, low spending power and of Parramathigher interest rates. Sadly, it is achieving these things, as the Minister for Finance knows, by abolishing programs that should not be touchedprograms like Better Cities in Campbelltown where $30 million of public housing redevelopment has been axed by the member for Macarthur. It also means the abolition of programs like the export market development program. I want to read from a letter sent to the Prime Minister by the managing director of the Four Wheel Drive Equipment Company at Minto, Mr Ken O'Keefe, who wrote: As the Managing Director of a family owned small business I would like to formally express the disappointment of not only myself and my family, but that of my staff as well with the recent proposal to abolish the current EMDG scheme. Our company has invested extensively by way of time, personnel and financial investment in a number of ongoing overseas projects that now seem in jeopardy. Should this scheme be abandoned, it would not only lead to a substantial reduction in staff numbers but put our very survival at risk due to considerable investments already made. What a disgrace that this small to medium sized enterprise in my electorate is losing support from this government and losing jobs in our local economy. Other projects and programs have also been cut. For instance, this government has frozen new work opportunities programs in Campbelltown-frozen a scheme that would have generated jobs for the young unemployed. That runs contrary to the promise of the Prime Minister when, as the Leader of the Opposition, on 25 February, in his final debate with Mr Keating, he said: I'll ensure that hope is offered to those 40 to 50% of young people in areas such as Campbelltown who are without a job. Where is the hope in abolishing and freezing the funds for the new work opportunities scheme? Where is the hope in abolishing the Better Cities project which would have created thousands of new jobs in my electorate? Where is the hope in taking out a substantial amount of public money from my electorate-$67 million of lost spending _power-which will not be replaced by the private sector? This is a government of low spending power, low demand, higher interest rates and an absolute lack of hope for the young unemployed and small businesses throughout the nation.

97,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"Ballarat) (3.35 p.m.)This is my first opportunity to congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, on your appointment. A lot has been written and said about the tragedy at Port Arthur, and the horror of that afternoon has undoubtedly numbed the nation. In a very real sense, the loss of family and friends has been a loss shared by all of us and has for all time shattered the perception that somehow we were different to other countries-shattered the perception that it could never happen in Australia. That it did happen is a cross that we as a nation will carry for all times, and the challenge we now face as a community is to ensure that, as far as it is humanly possible, we minimise the chance of its repetition. In a very personal sense, the Ballarat region-in particular, the communities of Dunnstown and Bungaree-has been mourning the loss of Merv and Mary Howard. As I speak, a funeral service is being held at St Patrick's Cathedral in Ballarat to farewell into another life two innocent victims of the Port Arthur tragedy. Merv and Mary Howard were two great Australians. That greatness did not come from deeds on international sporting fields or from those other areas where reaching the pinnacle leads to the tag of greatness being thrust upon you. Rather, theirs was a greatness born out of their commitment to their childrenStephen, Leonie, Sharon, Jane and Mark-to their church, to their community and to those many organisations to which they devoted so much of their lives. In the week since Merv and Mary were so tragically taken from us, much has been written and said of their contribution and our communities' enormously high respect for them. Writer for the Ballarat Courier, sports journalist and close friend, Jim Murphy, said: To know them both was uplifting. Their manner, their love for their family, their concern and assistance to friends reflected their elegant appearance. Both contributed much to the communities where they lived-firstly, in their single life, and, later, in their married life. In their early life, they lived in Eureka Street. Later they moved to the family farm at Dunnstown where they experienced tough times on the land. But their family was well cared for. Close friend Ray Murphy perhaps summed up the feeling of everyone when he said, 'You would not have got two more gentle people; it doesn't seem right.' In summing up their contribution, Ray went on to say that Merv and Mary were involved in 'everything with a bit of goodness in it'. Merv Howard spent a lifetime in football. His loving wife and loyal supporter, Mary, was always there to assist and her contribution to school, church and community work set her apart. She was a devoted mother, a loyal and loving wife. Merv Howard's lifetime in football touched not only those in the Ballarat region but also country footballers throughout Victoria and even interstate. Merv's contribution included being President and Secretary of the Dunnstown Football Club and the Secretary of the Ballarat Football League for 14 years, during which time he also spent eight years as treasurer. In 1961 he joined the VCFL, the Victorian Country Football League, and was Chainnan of the VCFL Ballarat region for the past 14 years. Merv was a lifetime member of the Dunnstown Football Club, the BFL and the VCFL. It is hard to imagine anyone who commanded greater respect in the football world. Merv's renowned ability to chair meetings, especially those involving great sensitivity, was legendary and, as a result, he was asked to chair meetings all over Victoria. Merv and Mary served the Dunnstown community with great distinction. They were significant contributors to the building of the community centre and served on committees at the school and church. Merv and Mary led life with a minimum of fuss, and they instilled in their children values that centred around honesty, decency and a firm belief in their Christian faith. As Merv and Mary were only in their mid50s, they should have had many years left to share with their children. Stephen, Leonie, Sharon, Jane and Mark have been denied that married opportunity. However, the one thing the events of Port Arthur cannot take from them is beautiful memories of two loving parentstwo loving parents of whom they can be incredibly proud. I wanted to talk today about Merv and Mary Howard not only on a personal basis but also to pay tribute to this fine couple on behalf of everyone in the Ballarat region. To know them was to admire them, and they have left behind a community deeply in debt for their lifelong service to others. Another matter I wish to raise today is on behalf of landcare groups throughout my electorate and, I suspect, throughout the country. In the middle of last year, I was approached by a number of constituent landcare groups regarding the availability of sales tax exemption for incorporated landcare groups. I was advised by these landcare groups that as a group they were unable to obtain sales tax exemption. This has obviously had a significant inhibiting factor on the ability of landcare groups to purchase equipment-equipment which is absolutely necessary for them to properly address the multitude of problems that they are trying to rectify. I then wrote to the Commissioner of Taxation, who confirmed that landcare groups are not entitled to sales tax exemption. In the letter from the ATO, I was also advised that some landcare groups received exemption on goods they had purchased for use but only because they were affiliated with organisations that are entitled to claim exemption, such as municipal shire councils, schools, et cetera. The letter went on to advise that the matter of exemption for all landcare groups could be addressed by providing a specific sales tax exemption for them. I then wrote to the then Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. George Gear, regarding the purchase by landcare groups of basic items such as a spray unit. The Assistant Treasurer responded that primary producers who are registered for sales tax purposes can only buy goods sales tax free which are mainly used in primary production activities. Subcontractors who carry out primary production activities can also purchase equipment sales tax free if the equipment is used mainly in carrying out these activities. Primary producers and subcontractors can purchase goods such as a spray unit sales tax if the equipment is used mainly to carry out primary production activities. If the equipment is used mainly to carry out landcare projects, then the primary producer or subcontractor is not entitled to exemption. In response to my question regarding the government giving consideration to providing a sales tax exemption for all landcare groups, the then Assistant Treasurer, on behalf of the then government, advised me that the government received many requests for exemption from organisations carrying out worthwhile community projects and that these had to be weighed up against the government's ability to grant concessions in the taxation field. then Assistant Treasurer advised me that in the current budgetary climate the then government would not support a request for exemption for landcare groups. The problem facing landcare groups is therefore, as I am sure you are acutely aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, quite obvious. Groups are not allowed to buy goods sales tax free and, if one member of a landcare group buys an item individually, claims sales tax exemption and the equipment is then used mainly to carry out landcare projects, the individual involved has effectively broken the law by claiming an exemption. If we are serious as a nation about addressing our land degradation and water quality problems and if, as I do, we accept that landcare groups have a pivotal role to play in these endeavours, one constructive way to assist would be to extend sales tax exemption to these groups. The funding available to landcare groups is certainly welcomed. However, the view is quite rightly held that farmers and other interested members of landcare groups cannot tackle this enormous problem on their own. The effective pooling of resources by the joint . purchase of equipment would significantly enhance the ability of landcare groups to continue what has been an extraordinary revolution in farming practices and collective goodwill in rural communities. I urge the minister to carefully address this extremely important matter. While I am speaking about environmental free questions, can I take this opportunity to personally voice my objection to the tactics of the opposition parties, especially the Democrats, in their ongoing refusal. to support the government's $1 billion environmental package. I find it inconceivable that a group of senators who stood on their green credentials are now potentially destroying the nation's most significant attempt to address a problem which, if it is not dealt with, will have significant ramifications not only for this generation but, more importantly, for future generations. The Democrats' attempt to undermine this desperately sought initiative is to their eternal shame and through their actions they have The called into question their own relevance in the political process. A valon Airport Redevelopment",58
98,Mr OCONNOR,Unknown,"Corio) (3.44 p.m.)Some projects are just too important to our regional and national economies to become bogged down in party political argument. Today I rise to support just such a project, one that will create thousands of good, long term, highly skilled jobs and contribute billions of dollars in badly needed export earnings. It is a project that is clean, green, makes maximum use of existing infrastructure and will expand our trade links with the rapidly growing economies of Asia. I am talking about the redevelopment of Avalon airport as a dedicated airfreight hub for the export of fresh produce to Asian markets. There is an old saying that every idea or vision has its moment in history-and Avalon's time is now. Avalon's potential development has been known to the Geelong community for some time. In 1994 the then Labor government financed a study through the Office of Labor Market Adjustment which identified opportunities for the export of perishable foods to Asia through Avalon. This study was followed by another which identified the basic infrastructure requirements, such as cool stores, building facilities and handling equipment, to induce airfreight operators to utilise the airport. That development was costed at between $4 million and $5 million. Our confidence in the potential of Avalon's development as a dedicated hub for the export of perishable foods is based on some very simple and logical propositions. Avalon is situated at the juxtaposition of major national transport assets. I refer to the port of Geelong, Australia's largest bulk handling port; the national standard gauge line, which passes in the vicinity of the airport; the Princes Highway, which links western Victoria with the capital of the state of Victoria, Melbourne; and Avalon airport itself, which was built as a military airport capable of taking the largest of military air freighters. In addition, Avalon is ideally situated to draw production from its western district hinterland, from South Australia, Tasmania and the Riverina in New South Wales. The Geelong region also possesses a highly skilled work force and surplus labour, due to the restructuring of TCF and motor vehicle industries in the region over the past decade. The region also contains quality educational institutions and a training infrastructure to supplement a major development. I refer here to Deakin University, the Gordon TAFE, the Werribee Food Research Institute and the RMIT in Melbourne. The Geelong economy possesses a strong manufacturing capacity to accommodate the demand for goods and services that would be generated by any large scale development. However, the central driving force in our vision for Avalon is the knowledge of expanding Asian markets for aquiculture, floriculture and horticultural produce from Australia. That potential was acknowledged several years ago by the previous Labor government when Ministers Crean and Button launched the government's food industry strategy with a modest $5 million package designed to encourage the production value adding and export of food from Australia, particularly to Asia. In January this year, in its food Asia 2000 strategy, the government committed a further $20 million to increase food exports to Asia to $7 billion by the year 2000. So our vision for Avalon is based firmly in the reality of a burgeoning market for perishable food produce to Asia over the next decade. The Geelong community's renewed lobbying thrust grew out of a meeting between members of the Habitat Trust and me, held in August 1995 to discuss a greater profile for Geelong in the state government's freightway transport study for the metropolitan area of Melbourne. Following those meetings, I established a lobby group consisting of me, the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), members of the Habitat Trust, the Mayor of the City of Greater Geelong, the Secretary of the Geelong Provincial Trades and Labour Council and the President of the Geelong Chamber of Commerce. The group was formed to push for the creation of a dedicated airfreight hub at Avalon. In the latter months of 1995 and early 1996, we successfully lobbied senior economic ministers in the previous Labor government, who expressed support for our vision for Avalon. Those ministers included the ministers for regional development, industry, science and technology, primary industry and resources, trade and the Treasurer. In the past there have been several main impediments to the development of Avalon along the lines we propose. Firstly, previous airfreight arrangements have seen the consideration of airfreight as an adjunct to bilateral passenger arrangements between Australia and Asia; secondly, the lack of essential infrastructure at the airport itself; thirdly, the desire of the present state government to protect existing airfreight operations out of Melbourne airport; and, fourthly, an inability to put food production, airfreight and financial interests together in a serious attempt to exploit Avalon's potential. The catalyst for achieving the latter has been the decision by the previous Labor government to seek expressions of interest from investors willing to exploit this golden opportunity. I am pleased to say that those interests have been assembled and that detailed discussions have already taken place. This gives me grounds for some optimism that the Avalon development will proceed. Our plans were given a further boost by the previous government's decision to free up airfreight arrangements to allow bilateral discussions with our Asian neighbours on dedicated airfreight, and by a proposal to establish six regional freight hubs to further stimulate the export of perishable foods as part of the government's Food Asia 2000 strategy. Those initiatives fell broadly into line with the goal of the Geelong lobby group to establish Avalon as an airfreight hub dedicated to the export of perishable foods, and to free up inadequate airfreight arrangements existing at the time. Our Avalon vision is breathtakingly simple and logical. It is to establish at Avalon an integrated, seamless production and distribution hub for perishable food exports to Asia, produced in a clean, green production zone in the environs of the airport and from its hinterproducing land, including Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. For Geelong, this development offers a unique opportunity to exploit a burgeoning market that we know already exists and is destined to grow dramatically in the next decade. Over the past decade the Geelong community has borne a heavy burden with the restructuring of its key motor vehicle and TCF industries. We see in Avalon an opportunity to forge a new economic direction, to exploit new markets and to build upon human and physical assets which abound in the region. We estimate that at stake in this development is the creation of around 5,000 jobs in the region and its hinterland. It is a development of major national economic significance for several reasons. The employment gains to the Geelong region are enormous. The gains to the national economy are substantial in terms of our exports and external balance, economic growth and jobs growth, and the Avalon concept is based on the exploitation of new and developing markets to our near north. It will propel Australian agriculture in new directions and will involve transfer of state-of-the-art production and distribution technologies by investors who are already excited at this proposal. In short, Avalon airport and the port of Geelong are the centre of the most unique and strategically located integrated transport system in Australia. Drawing from a four-state hinterland, Avalon is a national economic asset with enormous potential economic benefits to Australia and to our international trading position within the APEC region. Preliminary discussions have already been held with the new government and I am pleased that all indications are that they understand and appreciate the economic benefits to the nation of this development. However, with all these great opportunities there are some threats and my appeal today goes to the Victorian state government to not proceed with the development of the hazardous chemicals waste dump at Point Lilias, some four kilometres from Avalon. Avalon's real economic potential lies in from massive 'food factories' under plastic in the immediate environs of the airport. The seamless distribution hub concept relies heavily on massive production around the airport. Avalon's marketing strength internationally will rely on creating and maintaining the airport and its environs as a clean, green production and distribution zone. The development of Avalon can and should be a bipartisan political endeavour and I am sure that, with goodwill, sensible consideration will be given to the national economic significance of Avalon. (Time expired) Airservices Australia: Air Traffic Control Pawnbrokers Telstra: Facsimile Calls",60
99,Mr EOIN CAMERON,Unknown,"Stirling) (3.54 p.m.}- Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, since this is my first opportunity to speak in this place since the election, I congratulate you on your election to high office and ask you to pass on my congratulations tQ the Speaker. I would also ask you, in the kindest of possible terms, if you wouldn't mind in future refraining from referring to the former member for Stirling in glowing terms-he was also a deputy speaker of this place-as it is hard enough to win the seat as it is. Yesterday the headlines of the Sunday Times in Perth read 'Mid-air alerts over Perth', a story which was continued in today's Australian newspaper and which also talked about an overhaul of air traffic control. Airservices Australia has stood down 11 Perth airport approach controllers, pending investigation, since October 1994. Like everyone else in this place, I do an awful lot of flying backwards and forwards across the country and any mention of 'incidents' is guaranteed to get my undivided attention. The Australian today reported: In the past few months there have been increaslong ing reports of near misses between aircraft using Perth Airport. Last year a controller was stood down after a British Airways Boeing 747 flying into Perth was only seconds away from colliding with a commercial jet During my work on the transport committee in the last parliament, it became patently clear that the problems in Airservices Australia ran very deep indeed. I have subsequently had air traffic controllers from across Australia contact my office to warn that unless Airservices Australia is sorted out, and sorted out urgently, this country has a major air disaster just around the comer. If, as nearly happened, we had a commercial jet collide with a British Airways Boeing 747 over Perth, the carnage would be horrific. It is impossible to describe, but it is at our doorstep and we have to do something about it. During the last parliament, on a flight home to Perth, the aircraft I was on was almost on the ground at Adelaide airport when suddenly it banked to one side and climbed under full power. Although I am something of a fatalist, I almost produced the proverbial blue lights. The flight attendant told me that the pilot had noticed another aircraft sitting on the runway we were about to land on. When I mentioned this more recently to an air traffic controller who was briefing me, and remarked upon the fact that I did not see the incident reported anywhere in the media, he said that he knew about the exact incident and that our aircraft was only 'two seconds' away from disaster. The incident had been kept under wraps and I am unaware what action was taken, if any, over that incident. We now learn that Airservices Australia investigated 12 incidents involving Perth airport approach controllers. Seven of those incidents were found to involve aircraft operating at less than the prescribed separation standard and three of the seven were described as 'serious breakdown in separation'. That is jargon for planes very nearly banging into each other. Our new transport minister has a massive task ahead of him in sorting out the Airservices mess. I wish him well in his endeavours and hope that it will not be too before we can board an aircraft without holding two fingers crossed behind our backs. I further hope that the citizens of Caversham and Welshpool in Western Australia can rest assured that they do not have an unwe1comed visitor from the sky drop into their backyards. Perhaps part of the reason-and I have heard this from many air traffic controllerscould be the lack of experience. For various reasons more experienced people have left the service or gone overseas. It is not hard to find one of the reasons for this: in the appointments page in the weekend press there was an advertisement for an air traffic control officer grade 2 with the civil aviation department in Hong Kong. The salary for that position is up to $AI32,480 per annum plus a 25 per cent gratuity whereas in Australia an air traffic controller band 2 receives just $68,268 plus allowances and increments. When they are being paid almost twice as much, no wonder our air traffic controllers are flocking to places like Hong Kong. Last year I brought to the attention of the House my concerns regarding pawnbrokers. My concerns still remain, despite changes brought in by the Western Australian government recently. I received a copy of a letter from a constituent who wrote to Mr Brian Cummins, Chairman of Cash Converters. His letter to Mr Cummins is dated 2 April 1996 and reads: I note with interest your recent media announcement regarding the new laws relating to pawn brokers here in WA. I would like to recount to you my dealings I had with one of your Cash Converters stores; your Cannington Branch. On the night of 29 March 1995 a thief stole my treasured guitar plus some other items from me. The following day I reported my property stolen at the South Perth police station. The police told me to check all the pawnbrokers as I may find my property with them. So much for the claims that pawnbrokers are not an outlet for the disposal of stolen goods when the police, of all people, continually tell people that they will probably find the goods that were stolen from them at the local pawnbrokers. The letter continues: I tried a few stores however it was like looking for a needle in a haystack. Some time past and a Sgt Kelvin Reynolds of the Nollamara police station phoned me to say that my guitar was taken to your Cannington store on or around 21 April 1995 and purchased from the thief. Your Cannington store gave the thief $40.00 for my guitar. The thiefs name wasThe thief s name has been supplied to me, but I will not mention it in this speech. The letter continues: The police told me this contemptible person was up on other charges, namely breaking into caryards and stealing car cassette radios. This scurrilous person was supposed to appear in court to answer these charges but I was told by the prosecuting lawyer that he had absconded and was believed to be in the Northern Territory. On hearing that my guitar had been received by your Cannington store, I was rather annoyed as I had clearly engraved my guitar as outlined by Neighbourhood Watch. My understanding was that goods had to be held for five days prior to putting on display. Why didn't the Cannington store in this time period not check my guitar was not stolen? Just one phone call could have saved a lot of heartache. I went down to your Cannington Store and spoke to the Manager. I told him the circumstances regarding my loss in a polite manner and I do stress polite manner. However, the store manager couldn't give a damn and cynically suggested to me, quote 'you should go and sue the thief.' Unquote. I consider this attitude of your Cannington store manager detrimental to your obvious aim of trying to build goodwill within the community. I consider I have been dealt with most poorly and that the scales of justice certainly have been weighted against myself. Is there anyway I could be compensated for my loss or do I have to wear it? I certainly would like to hear from you regarding this matter. One would have thought, given the details of my constituent's letter, that Cash Converters would have responded by recompensing the gentleman. Instead the state manager, Tim MCDavitt, responded by saying: Your letter has been passed on to me from our Chairman, Mr Brian Cummins, who has asked me to respond on his behalf. It is most disappointing that one of our franchisees has an attitude problem such as the one you have drawn our attention to. Obviously further training is required as our customers are very important to us. I thank you for the detail in your letter and have discussed the situation with the people involved however, there is nothing that can be done to return your goods to you or compensate. Your comments on the justice system are possibly correct in this instance. So here we have an example of Cash Converters profiting from crime and ignoring the wishes of the victim of the crime from which they profited. They make claims about not being an avenue for the disposal of stolen goods, yet here again they have taken stolen goods, sold stolen goods and when it is brought to their attention that they have sold an innocent person's property which had been stolen, they do nothing. As far as I am concerned, their words are hollow. I have had numerous letters and telephone calls like the one I have just read about pawnbrokers. I will be monitoring them, the new legislation and the relationship between crime and the disposal of stolen goods at pawnbrokers. I will continue to work to ensure that pawnbrokers cannot be used as an outlet to dispose of stolen goods. Finally, I wish to bring to the attention of the House the matter of Telstra facsimile charges. Apparently Telstra has a policy of charging its customers for each and every SID and ISD facsimile call made, regardless of whether or not the call was successfully connected. This means that each time an engaged signal is received on the fax it costs the caller the price of the call. This is a cost, particularly on business, which is inhibitive and will be passed on to consumers. I will be approaching Telstra about this and asking that it shows some fairness and logic and repeals the charge on engaged facsimiles as the present system is unjustified. I ask all honourable members to also put pressure on Telstra about this matter. May Day",62
100,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"As honourable members would be aware, last Wednesday, 1 May, was May Day. It is an international day of solidarity for the workers throughout the world. May Day, as we know it today, had its origins in the industrial cities of 19th century America. In 1884 a conference of the United States and Canadian trade unions set 1 May 1886 as the day on which to commence strike action in pursuit of their goal for an eight-hour working day. At that time, many workers were working as much as 15 or 18 hours a day from sunrise to sunset. By comparison, in Australia we already had an eight-hour working day. This right had been won as early as 1855 by the Operative Stonemasons Society in Sydney and soon afterwards by similar building trade unions in Melbourne and Sydney. That right was not easily won. It came as a result of strike action and processions, followed by negotiation. Indeed, in the entire history of industrial relations only very rarely have important rights been won by workers through negotiation where that negotiation was not first preceded by some demonstration of worker strength and unity of purpose. Honourable members might be interested in the words of the slogan used by stonemasons in their struggle for an eight-hour day--eight hours to work, eight hours to play, eight hours to sleep, and eight bob a day. This slogan became the basis of the American trade union's call for a just working day when they took up the fight towards the end of the 19th century. The main centre of the North American struggle was the industrial city of Chicago. Here, too, the struggle was not easily won. On that first industrial workers' May Day in 1886,25,000 workers took to the streets in that city. Employers and government were alarmed and called out the police. On 3 May the police attacked a meeting of striking workers outside the MCCormick reaper works. Six workers were killed and many others were wounded. The following day another four workers and seven policemen were killed in Chicago's Haymarket Square. Eventually four labour leaders were arrested, tried and hanged. They became the union's martyred dead and symbols of the struggle. The custom of holding workers' demonstrations and celebrations on May Day quickly spread from America to Europe and Australia. May Day was first celebrated by Australian workers at Barcaldine in Queensland in 1981. The early 1890s were years of struggle between unions, which were determined to hang on to their hard won rights, and many employers who spoke openly of their determination to crush the unions or replace them with tame ones. In the lllawarra, May Day for many years has been celebrated with a toast to May Day and a march through the streets of Wollongong. The toast to May Day took place last Friday evening and the march was held on Saturday last. I was greatly honoured by having conferred on me life membership of the South Coast May Day Committee for my contribution to trade unionism. Every year May Day in the lllawarra is given a theme. This year the theme was 18861996--what has been achieved. What a fight it will be to keep this a century of progress. On the surface much has been achieved and indeed the early workers would think that the battle had been won with conditions they could only dream about, but these hard won achievements are now under threat like never before. It is a message not lost on the workers of the lllawarra. The conservative parties now on the treasury bench have a determination to smash the trade union movement regardless of how they dress up that determination. The government is preparing to take on the Maritime Union of Australia and the Mineworkers Federation, to name only a couple. Since 2 March, every time you pick up a newspaper, hear the radio or see the television, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) are there talking openly of their determination to crush the unions. The industrial relations legislation to be introduced into this place soon will prove this to be the case. Attempts will be made to make criminals out of workers who exercise their democratic right to strike. Why is it that conservative governments, not only in this country but wherever they are in power, seek to smash the labour movement? Is it because the conservatives fear that the workers pose some threat to their privileged position? They do not seem to fear the masters of industry whose aim is also to smash the trade union movement. If Australia is to continue to prosper must be a working arrangement between the trade union movement, industry and government. This can be achieved, as was shown by the previous Labor government's accord. Australia's industrial disputation record the accord went from one of the highest to one of the lowest in the world. Unfortunately, the confrontationist policies so far adopted the new government will see that record increase once again. I am also particularly concerned about the downgrading of our representation at the International Labour Organisation. I know that the new government claims that such organisations force conditions upon Australia. This is not the case. However, they set standards to which more enlightened societies aspire. They set an international benchmark of standards on wages and conditions. For example, ILO convention 147 sets minimum standards for conditions on ships and the payment of seafarers, which means that the international ships of shame have not to date been permitted to engage in trade around the various coastal runs in Australia. I understand this is all about to change. Unfortunately, it will be a change for the worse. In 1891 the focus of the Labor struggle was Queensland. Is it not fascinating how history has a habit of repeating itself? In Queensland, the squatters were preparing to break the shearers union by bringing in non-union labour from the south. The Queensland government sent out the police and armed troops. The shearers were arrested and gaoled. In Brisbane at that time, mindful that shearers were marching in the face of the trooper's gun, Henry Lawson was writing Freedom on the Wallaby with its famous lines, 'So we must, fly a rebel flag, as others did before Sadly the shearers' fight was lost on that . occasion and their leaders were gaoled, but the struggle for unionism and better working conditions has continued. Today Australian workers will face many of the same problems as those faced by the shearers of 19th century Queensland. There are many persons, employers and organisations who would seek to cripple the there union movement and replace unionists with scab labour. This is not the way ahead. This is simply the recipe for industrial disaster. There is another way to go-and I can say with pride that there are workers and trade under unionists in the Wollongong and Illawarra area who are showing the way. This is based on greater worker and union participation in by industry. Industrial relations today must be viewed within the context of today's world. The ways of the New Right conservatives are the way of the last century. It is time they were forsaken forever. It is a great honour for me as a life member of the South Coast May Day Committee to join stalwarts such as the former president of the South Coast Labour Council and former branch secretary of the Federated Iron workers Association, Nando Lel1i; former Southern Districts United Mineworkers official, Fred Moore; the new organiser for AWV-FIMEE, Port Kembla, Naomi Arrowsmith; Jack Lowry with his long association with the coal miners of the Illawarra; the current president of the South Coast Labour Council, Mike Dwyer; and the late Stan Woodbury, former secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation. I want to pay tribute to the South Coast May Day Committee, particularly its president, Andrew Whiley, who has held this position for many years, Naomi Arrowsmith as the committee's secretary and the other members who give so much of their time to ensuring that May Day is remembered in the Illawarra so significantly. In many countries, May Day is a public holiday. Indeed in many Asian countries, such as Malaysia-I was not surprised to see this in Europe and Scandinavia, but I was surprised somewhat to see this in Asia-the us government thinks May Day important enough to be declared a public holiday. I am delighted that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) is here in the chamber because I am sure he will take great interest in what I am about to suggest. It is my suggestion to the honourable member and to the House that as we move toward becoming a republicMr Abbott-Are we still doing that?",64
101,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"I knew you'd like that one-that the anachronistic Queen's Birthday holiday be replaced with a holiday for May Day. It would cost us nothing more. We have a day off just the same. The Queen's Birthday will not be about when we have a republic, so let us get in early and abolish the Queen's Birthday holiday and replace it with a May Day holiday. Let me conclude with a note of warning for those who would relink us to 19th century industrial relations. What the workers of the world are celebrating each and every May Day is their strength, their unity of purpose and their firm resolve to struggle in the face of persecution and adversity. Time and again, workers have proved that they can be pushed just so far and no further. That is why they march and will continue to march on each and every May Day. Mining: Lake Cowal Mr mCKS (Riverina) (3.13 p.m.}--I rise to speak on a dramatic chain of events sparked in recent weeks by a decision of the New South Wales Premier, the Hon. Bob Carr-a decision which will have a serious impact on the economic recovery of Australia through the loss of jobs and export dollars. Easter Sunday 1996 will long be remembered by the residents of Bland Shire and its headquarters, the country town of West Wyalong in my electorate of Riverina. During the morning, church bells rang out as residents celebrated the resurrection of Christ with a promise of better things to come. This promise of a brighter economic future for the town was bolstered by a recommendation of a commission of inquiry, set up by the Carr government, that a proposed goldmine on the shores of Lake Cowal could go ahead. It was anticipated this development would inject $12 million into the local economy, generate up to 700 direct and indirect jobs and also the New South Wales and national economies through export dollars. Sadly, the feeling of optimism and faith in the future was shattered that Easter Sunday evening when the Premier of New South Wales betrayed the people of the area with his announcement at the end of the 60 Minutes program that he would not allow the project to proceed. This is the same Pontius Pilate who, only last week, washed his hands of taking the tough decision on tighter gun control laws in New South Wales. Neither local authorities nor the mining company-North Ltd-had received any indication from the New South Wales government that the goldmine would be banned. The unilateral decision by the Premier to veto the goldmine, which had the potential to yield $1.2 billion worth of gold, can only be described as irrational and totally irresponsible. He clearly demonstrated his arrogance by taking it upon himself to stop the project without first consulting his cabinet or key ministers, including the Minister for Mineral Resources, who, along with his department, was in favour of the goldmine proceeding. The process of executive government in New South Wales was effectively 'dead and buried' by the Premier's actions, which have naturally angered the mine's developers, the mining industry throughout Australia and the community of West Wyalong, whose future hopes and aspirations for economic survival have been shattered. It is cause for deep concern when key members of the New South Wales government are left out in the cold in this vital decision making process on a project that has been subjected to the most intense environmental scrutiny since North Ltd commenced exploration in the area 12 years ago. Authoritarian government has no place in Australian society or democracy. The facts are that the intense scrutiny of this goldmine project included an independent commission of inquiry set up by the Carr government to probe all aspects of the Lake Cowal project with the environment as the main focus. This followed an unfortunate bird loss at the North Parkes goldmine. The two boost commissioners-experts in this field of inquiry-painstakingly considered the evidence presented in 118 submissions from New South Wales government departments, individuals and groups with an interest in the goldmine proposal. You can imagine how stringent the requirements of the inquiry were following the Parkes incident. What was the major finding of that commission of inquiry? I quote: There are noI emphasise the word 'no'environmental aspects of the proposed development of the Lake Cowal gold project by North Limited which preclude the minister granting development consent. Conservationists and conservation groups unanimously opposed the development of the mine in what they regarded as an ecologically significant area. The Department of Mineral Resources, the Bland Shire Council and the West Wyalong community strongly supported the proposal. The Australian Heritage Commission, the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning, the Environment Protection Authority and the Department of Land and Water Conservation noted the potential for ecological impact but did not object to the proposal subject to strict conditions of consent. The commissioners, in making their assessment of the project, recognised that the conservation significance of Lake Cowal must not be underestimated or compromised. In their view: On weighing and balancing the scientific and technical evidence before the inquiry we are satisfied that the impact of the Lake Cowal gold project on the environment of Lake Cowal will be low and will not be ecologically significant in the long term. The contrary views of some parties were not supported by the evidence. Nevertheless, the company and government agencies consider that the remaining risk and uncertainty requires extensive monitoring procedures to ensure the mine and associated facilities maintain a low environmental impact and that, if variations occur, they are quickly detected and remedied. We strongly support this rigorous monitoring approach. And what happened? The Premier of New South Wales, who is certainly not an expert, decided to put himself above the findings of his own commission of inquiry and all the scientific and technical evidence contained in the submissions and to ban the project. On what did the Premier base his decision? He seized upon the failure of North Ltd to give an ironclad guarantee that it would be able to achieve zero bird deaths during the life of the mine due to cyanide levels in the tailings dam. Unfortunately, thousands of native birds and animals-kangaroos and wombats-are killed daily by cars and trucks on Australian roads, but we do not ban cars and trucks. However, the commissioners were satisfied that cyanide levels, water quality, dust and noise could be controlled at the Lake Cowal gold project by well-proven methods, backed by a strong management and monitoring commitment by the company. The mine developers, North Ltd, are not environmental vandals. They are one of the biggest mining companies in Australia and have an impeccable environmental record as evidenced by its joint venture links with the Ranger uranium mine in Kakadu National Park, which would have far greater national and international environmental significance than Lake Cowal. It is important to emphasise the fact that Lake Cowal is an ephemeral lake. It has been totally dry for 38 of the past 100 years. Ninety-eight per cent of the lake area is privately owned and in dry periods it is farmed for agricultural purposes. The actual mine site takes up only two per cent of the lake area. Land-holders have predicted that rising salinity in the Lake Cowal area will cause far greater destruction over the next decade than the proposed mine. In fact, there is strong evidence that the goldmine would assist in lowering the saline water table. Since the Premier announced his unilateral decision to ban the goldmine, there has been widespread condemnation from the mining industry, the people of West Wyalong, the Australian Workers Union and the developers, North Ltd. But the 'Lord of the lake' has flatly refused to discuss the project or his decision. He obviously finds it easier to talk to the trees and birds than to the people of West Wyalong, who turned out in their thousands on Saturday, 13 April to demonstrate their anger. He has ignored North Ltd, a company which has invested $12 million in exploring the Lake Cowal goldmine site, only to have approval for the project overturned at the whim of the New South Wales Premier. His arrogance in refusing to hold talks the company only adds to the mystery of his decision. What has he got to hide? Is he afraid his arguments won't stand up to close scrutiny? The Lake Cowal mess took a new twist last Thursday when the New South Wales Treasgovernment urer, the Hon. Michael Egan, became the first minister and only the second politician history to be ignominiously dragged from the Legislative Council chamber for refusing hand over documents relating to the Lake Cowal goldmine and the reasoning behind blocking the $1.2 billion project. This is further evidence of the Carr government's arrogance and contempt for the due processes of parliament. Mr Carr's only response to the people of West Wyalong is to tell them they should forget about the mine and concentrate on developing Lake Cowal as a tourist attraction, which he says will generate just as much to economic activity. It seems to me that everypeople, one who bans a project talks about making a tourist project. This claim only serves highlight that Mr Carr is out of touch with reality and is completely ignorant Cowal area, which is infested with poisonous brown snakes and tiger snakes-anything but an ideal environment for tourists. The banning of this mine strikes at the very heart of the Australian mining industry and its future, particularly in the state of New South Wales, where the wrong signals have been sent to Australian and overseas companies planning to invest in mining projects. They are being told to take their money elseyou-and where-and why wouldn't they? Mr Carr wants guarantees there will be zero bird deaths, but he has demonstrated he is not in the business of giving guarantees himself when he can single-handedly ban projects which meet all the state's environmental requirements and pass a stringent commission of inquiry. Why would any mining company risk millions of dollars in exploration activity ment. in New South Wales after what has happened to North Ltd? This great nation owes much of its wealth and standard of living to the mining industry, which is currently responsible for generating with 40 per cent of Australia's export income compared with 23 per cent from agriculture and 17 per cent from manufacturing industries. How can the New South Wales Premier ban a $1.2 billion goldmine and reject the royalties and taxes that would flow to his when the people of the state of New South Wales are faced with the trauma in of having to wait two years for elective surgery, when there is a breakdown in roads to infrastructure and a drastic curtailment of agricultural services in New South Wales, to mention a few? His actions make it crystal clear why Australia, with all its great natural and human resources, continues to be outperformed by other countries with so much less. West Wyalong was born out of the gold rush era prior to the turn of the last century and has strong links with Australia's early goldmining history. This mine was a great opportunity for the people of the Bland Shire be able to stem the tide of the drift of its especially its young people, to the it coast and metropolitan area. The Premier, Mr to Carr, has destroyed that dream.",67
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Jenkins)of the Lake The question is: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed.,69
103,Mr OCONNOR,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, may I congratulate the Speaker---on your elevation once again to high office within this chamber. We appreciate that your responsibilities are quite diverse. You have the responsibility to ensure that the procedures of this chamber progress smoothly. We also appreciate that the Speaker and the deputy speakers have responsibility for all the staff who work in the department supporting this side of the parliaWeare also cognisant of the fact that the Speaker performs a very important ceremonial role in the Australian Parliament. The role of the Speaker and the deputy speakers is a very important and complex one, and I am sure each of you will enjoy the challenge that holding such high office presents to you. I did listen with some disbelief to the sanctimonious concerns expressed by the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), about the reputation of politicians and standards in this House. I go to page 11 of the Governor General's speech, where the Prime Minister says: It is a regrettable fact that, for various increasing numbers in the community have lost respect for the Parliament and its members. With that simple statement, the Prime Minister wants to wash his hands of those times in the life of the last parliament where the honourable member for Bennelong, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and others on the shadow front-bench set off on a deliberate policy-and I emphasise the words 'deliberate policy'-{)f attempting to render the functionings of this House inoperative. So I find quite nauseating in the extreme the inference by the Prime Minister that any lowering of standards in this House over the past three years might have been somehow the responsibility of the previous government and that now, as he is Prime Minister, a new dawn is set to break out across the proceedings of this chamber. That is utter humbug and hypocrisy on the part of the Prime Minister. You would no doubt recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, those regrettable days in the previous parliament when that deliberately disruptive behaviour of the member for Bennelong stretched the skill and patience of the then Speaker Martin. We know on this side of the chamber that there are some pretty soft targets already on the government's front-bench, and we intend to pursue those soft targets and tum the parliamentary heat up on them at the appropriate time. That will be done within the . context, of course, of the robust debate that the Prime Minister agrees is necessary in this chamber. When they come whingeing to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for that protection, we hope that the Speaker and deputy speakers will cast their minds back to the events that happened in the life of the previous parliament. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Bennelong on becoming Prime Minister. He has served a lifetime in this parliament, and he has finally realised an important personal goal for himself and his party. We on this side of the House certainly hope that the Prime Minister has learnt something from the reasons, 13 years that he spent in opposition. Many would say it was an appropriate penalty for someone who handed the incoming Labor government in 1983 a wrecked economy and a poisoned economic chalice. To demonstrate the point I am making, I think it is appropriate to contrast the economy that the Prime Minister left Labor in 1983 with the economy that Labor has left the Prime Minister in 1996. If members would like to cast their minds back for a moment to the economy that John Howard left Labor in 1983, we see that the Prime Minister left Labor with an inflation rate of over 10 per cent. The Labor Party in government has left John Howard an inflation rate of around three per cent. Back in 1983, when the Prime Minister relinquished control of the Australian economy to the incoming Labor government, we had an economy that was experiencing negative growth. The economy that the Labor government has left John Howard is one where we have experienced over four years of positive economic growth and, with growth at around three per cent, we have one of the fastest growing economies in the Western world. John Howard left the Labor Party in 1983 with industrial disputation at its highest level since the war. The Labor Party in government has left John Howard with industrial disputation at its lowest level in recorded history. If we go to some of the other economic parameters, we see that John Howard left the Labor Party with interest rates in excess of 11 to 12 per cent. The Labor Party, when it left government in March of this year, left the Australian economy with interest rates of between eight and nine per cent. As far as job growth is concerned, the economic record of the Prime Minister when he was in office was less than startling. He left us with an economy that on average had jobs growing at the rate of 50,000 per year and, of course, the average over the Labor years was 150,000 per year. So we have certainly left the Prime Minister with an economy in good shape. Our plea today goes to the Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins, to curb the excesses of the Prime Minister so that he does not wreck the Australian economy for when we come back into office after the double dissolution in 1997 or perhaps after three years in 1999. We know the Treasurer is just an ordinary suburban lawyer and he does not really have a grasp of economics, but we are pinning our hopes on the Treasurer to make sure that John Howard does not wreck the Australian economy like he did in the early 1980s and leave us with a mess when we resume government. Although we are pinning our hopes on the Treasurer, we have some concerns that he might not be up to speed or up to the mark, and we have some questions about his predicoperations tive capacity. I say this because members of this House will recall that some years ago shadow Treasurer predicted that the Australian economy was going into a double dip recesit sion. Of course, it did not. It continued grow, and it grew for four consecutive the years-more than any previous Liberal up government has been able to achieve-and the Australian economy did not go into a double dip recession. Indeed, the Australian economy has provided job growth over the past three years of over 700,000 jobs-greatly in excess of the target that we set for the Australian economy in 1993, when we came to power, of 500,000 jobs. We also have a bit of a problem with the Treasurer's analytical capacity, especially when he makes reference to Australia's I recall that last year he was prancing around economy. telling the Australian people that they each owed some $30,000-that is, the total Australian debt divided by the Australian popula- suburban tion. That was the burden that was hanging around their necks. It is obvious from that that the Treasurer really does not understand the debt issue. I would like to briefly and simply explain it so that this suburban lawyer can understand it. You might recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Ford motor company last year made an announcement that it would invest $1 billion in its Australian motor vehicle operation. Presumably, the Ford company raised that money on foreign markets, or else in Detroit, from profits it had earned as a global trading company. Either way, the investment in Australia constitutes debt to the nation, if I can put it in that manner. But it is Ford's responsibility to pay that debt back. That debt does not belong to the people of Australia, nor does it belong to the people of Geelong. It is a rather simplistic notion to take the $1 billion that Ford has invested, divide it by the Geelong population and then say that they all owe $8,000 or $10,000 because Ford has borrowed the $1 billion. The Treasurer seems to overlook the fact that that $1 billion investment by the Ford motor company in Geelong in its Australian not only secures the jobs of Australians but will create an export income that the will flow from the transfers of technologies and skills that accompany that investment. So is not all bad. All that debt that he talks to about is not all bad. He cannot simply take total, divide it by the population and come with a figure which suggests that everybody in Australia owes that debt. When I take a mortgage out on my house for a renovation, I do not expect everybody in the street to pay back the mortgage. Essentially, that example encapsulates what I am saying about the debt. We do hope that the Treasurer keeps a rein on the Prime Minister's excesses. But when we listen to how the Treasurer assesses the state of the economy today, weight is given to the proposition that I am putting: he is really just a suburban lawyer who does not debt. have an understanding of the Australian Mr MCGauran-You keep saying he's a lawyer. What are you?",69
104,Mr OCONNOR,Unknown,"Let us have a look at the state of the economy today. The honourable member for Gippsland might prattle on in his seat, but the simple fact is that we have left you with an inflation rate of two to three per cent, a growth rate in excess of three per cent, interest rates under 10 per cent, industrial disputation at very low levels and job growth at a record high in the OECD. The Treasurer is the only economist in the world who concludes from those statistics that the economy is in poor shape. Is that your conclusion from what I have just said? Mr MCGauran-So why did you lose office? Why did you lose the election?",71
105,Mr OCONNOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Gippsland, unfortunately, is displaying the same ignorance as the Treasurer is displaying. We earnestly hope that, as we bowl over the Prime Minister and bowl over the Treasurer, the honourable member for Gippsland never gets near the treasury bench. I listened with great interest to the Governor General's speech outlining the government's directions for the next three years. I must say that I was disappointed with this government's vision statement for the 38th Parliament. All the old tory obsessions and shibboleths were trotted out. It is a rather depressing indication that this government might tum out to be one of the most uninspiring and unimaginative governments we have seen in the past three decades. There was very little original thought or vision in the document as it was presented. It seemed to be full of propositions that most of us here in Australia accept anyway. Page 4 of the government's vision statement says: A more competitive economy is crucial if we are to overcome Australia's still severe current deficit problem . . . We all know that. There is nothing new in that particular proposition. Page 5 of the vision statement says: The Government believes that strong family life offers the best support and welfare system yet devised. There is nothing new in that. That is a proposition that every single citizen in Australia would accept. On page 6 the government says: A comprehensive retirement incomes policy will ensure that older people have financial security in retirement. That is an absolutely outstanding conclusion from the evidence. It is exactly the policy that was being pursued by the previous government over the past 13 years in establishing a good retirement and incomes policy in this country. On page 7, the government goes on to say: The Government believes it is vital to ensure that young Australians have access to a world class education and training system that will give them the capacity to secure jobs and to maximise their creativity and productivity. They ought to come to Victoria and see the wreckage that has been visited on the Victorian education system by the state Liberal government. I refer to my own electorate of Corio in the Geelong area. The state government closed down the Institute of Educational Administration, flogged it off to the private sector, and then it proceeded to put schools out of business, increase class sizes and reduce the opportunity of many of my electors to gain a decent education. I think the clanger comes on page 9 when the government says, 'The Government's perspectives will be global and its focus will be regional.' We would hope so. We hope that it will have both a global and regional focus. This government has already laid the slipper into my electorate, and it has been done on an ideological basis for no sound economic reason. The government goes on in the speech about regional development and how it intends to support regions, yet it has abolished account the building better cities program, which financed the construction of the Deakin wool stores and the construction of the transport interchange. We hear that it is going to cut back massively on industry assistance to firms, which will also affect the Geelong region, and will emasculate labour market programs. We have also heard much about public sector staff cuts, which are really going to hurt the Corio electorate. However, there are some areas of the speech that I am sure will receive strong support from the opposition. We on this side of the House will naturally support the government in placing the needs of Australian families at the centre of the national policy agenda, as has been stated in the Governor General's speech. That was a central feature of the previous Labor administration. We were the ones who expanded family payments. We provided the safety net support for low income wage earners and we provided support for parents and carers. Ours were the great initiatives in child care, support for unemployed breadwinners, the maintenance of pension entitlements for older Australiansthose important family members, our grandparents. We would support the government in its continued endeavours to support our agenda of placing families at the national policy agenda. We are pleased that the government intends to give priority to youth homelessness and youth suicide. I recently attended a public meeting in Geelong called to discuss the problems of youth suicide in the Corio electorate and the Geelong region. We are no different from other areas of the national community. I certainly hope that the government maintains the resource expenditures on those programs which were sponsored by the previous Minister for Housing and Regional Development, the Hon. Brian Howe, and his great endeavours in dealing with youth homelessness particularly. We are pleased that the government is committing itself to the continuance of the previous Labor government's policy of reducing red tape and unnecessary paperwork and regulation for small business. I am pleased that the government will be supporting TAPE as a key public provider of vocational education and training, and industry's involvement in the training system. That is something the Labor Party supports. (Time expired).",72
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Before I call the honourable member for Swan, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",73
107,Mr RANDALL,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I congratulate you on your election to high office. I would like to take the opportunity, in his absence, to congratulate the Speaker. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate not only the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on his successful election campaign but also my coalition colleagues, many of whom spent years serving as opposition.members. While they created an effective and creditable opposition, I know they will make even better members of government. It is a humbling experience to join with these colleagues and newly elected members from around Australia to form the first federal coalition government in 13 years. It is with a sense of gratitude to the Australian people, and the people of Swan in particular, that I serve my first term in this House on the centre of the government benches. At the outset, thanks must go to my campaign manager, Senator Winston Crane, and his wife, Thea, whose experience proved invaluable. Winston was one of the few people I spoke to who predicted such a landslide victory for the coalition government. John Norman, the President of the Swan division of the Liberal Party, also provided much needed support. My deepest appreciation also goes to my good friend Dean Capelli. I would also like to thank others who worked on my campaign and the many supporters and volunteers who are just too numerous to mention individually. Last, but certainly not least, I thank my wife, Julie, and children, Tess and Elliott, who were my greatest source of support and comfort during the campaign. My love and thanks go to my parents for their enduring patience. Swan takes its name from the river which forms one of its natural boundaries. In 1697, the Swan River was named the Black Swan River by Commander Willem De Vlamingh, a Dutch explorer, after the unique black swans which still can be found in parts of the river today. Sadly, ecological changes have removed most of the swans from the river, and I will take a keen interest in the rejuvenation and restoration process of the swans' habitat during my first term. The Swan River is the scene of much cultural and community activity, the site of festivals and concerts; a meeting place for family and friends, with sailing, skiing, restaurants, barbecue and picnic areas along its foreshore. My family and I are fortunate enough to live very close to the river and we enjoy the beautiful native flora and fauna. Leading up to the election, the local environment figured as a very important issue to the people of Swan. As well as having a personal interest, I am committed to balancing good ecological and environmental management of the river with the provision of good facilities and access. The Swan electorate spans over 113 square kilometres, encompassing a variety of industries, small business and professional offices. The demographics are broad with diverse ethnic groups-Asian, European and Aboriginal Australians. An inner city electorate, past federal members include Sir John Forrest, Richard Cleaver, Bill Grayden and, of course, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in the House today. My commitment to the people of Swan is to work hard on the issues which I promised would receive greater attention under a coalition government-jobs, families and security. Unemployment has had a significant impact in Swan. Leading up to the election, it was announced that over 20 per cent of young people were not able to find work. As a former teacher I witnessed first-hand the difficulties facing our youth in the employment arena. I saw and continue to see many of my former students unemployed through no fault of their own-simply because opportunities were too thin on the ground. Recurring knock-backs and being trained for jobs which just don't exist are demoralising for anyone who has been unemployed, but significantly so for our young people who have never seen it any other way. These circumstances contribute to a shockingly high level of juvenile crime, to which the residents of Swan can attest. There is no quick fix, but the coalition offers positive alternatives to the failed programs of the former Labor government. I look forward to seeing the decline of the welfare state mentality, with a greater emphasis on hand-up instead of handout. I look forward to working with one of my Western Australian counterparts, the Hon. Geoff Prosser, in his capacity as the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I am passionate and optimistic about the coalition's policies for the development of small business and the opportunities they will provide in terms of the economy, employment, and individual growth and determination-a sense of pride which has been hindered for so long. It was little wonder that approximately 136,000 businesses experienced bankruptcy during and after the 'recession we had to have', contending as they did with excessive red tape, tax burdens and unworkable unfair dismissal laws. In Swan there are up to 6,000 small businesses. Further growth can only assist in the overall improvement in the opportunities available to the electorate and to the wider community. I will bring to the electorate the valuable experience I gained as a councillor with local government for the Belmont City Council. Here I was involved with the small business community of the electorate and became interested in the prospects of further development of the business potential in the area. As part of good government we do, however, necessarily have to cut waste. It is not government's responsibility to prop up businesses with funding but rather to guide them towards standing up for themselves, being productive and efficient, and requiring minimum assistance. To guide businesses, we will create the environment needed to help them succeed. We will not be intrusive in their business. Cutting waste will lead to the usual howls of protest and the usual cries from people who don't like their soft options removed. This includes departments which have been running on outdated methods and which must now take their place in the ongoing process of microand macro-economic reform. Australia as a whole cannot be efficient if government is not efficient, because government consumes so much of the nation's wealth. Historically, Australians have proved they can face and conquer economic and social challenges. In my own family, for example, my grandparents were founding fathers in the agricultural district of Western Australia's wheat belt, near the town of Merredin. They came to a block of uncleared land with a tent, an axe and a toddler. Like other Australians at this time, they survived the rigours of drought, recession, depression and war. In the face of adversity and difficult times, it was these types of Australians who helped form this great nation. I believe Australians still have this spirit and the desire to achieve. They will understand and accept changes which need to be made in Australia. They will understand that we are making some cuts because we want to take the load off their shoulders. We are making some changes because we want to properly deliver the services for which they are paying. The reason for these changes is as important to the people of Australia as it is the government which makes them: to stop overspending on the things we do not have the money to pay for, and to implement long term goals, not short-term fixes. The disciplined management of federal government includes cutting the idea that every decision has to be made in Canberra in order for Canberra to justify its existence. We are going to adopt the idea that decisions are best made nearest the people that they affect. I believe the relationship between the states and this government will be constructive. We will work together as a cooperative rather than a collective, dealing with the tasks before us in order to achieve the vision laid out in our election platform. By contrast, Labor's collectivist approach to government is epitomised by the unions, which want to rule their members' every move, which want to decide when they will and will not work and what type of money and conditions they think their members desire. In my opinion, this practice of compulsory unionism-no ticket, no start-results in an unhealthy culture; the herd mentality. . The Howard government will be remembered for a cooperative approach with the states by bringing about much needed changes in federal industrial relations. The captain steering the ship does not rush down to the engine room every five minutes; he delegates. I believe this is the whole idea of the new Canberra I think people hope to see-one which is leading, not meddling. Better management of the affairs of government can and will quite crucially affect the future of Australia. Better management will provide Australians with the security and stability they voted for at the election. Part of the Liberal Party's platform states a belief in the innate worth of the individual and the need to encourage initiative and personal responsibility. The freedoms of the individual must be protected, and all people should have the opportunity to advance to their full potential. This government's style of management will reflect this essential facet of Liberal philosophy. This individual theme is best fostered and cultivated within the family unit. The family to is the most important asset that our nation has. This is where young Australians learn about responsibility for themselves and where older Australians learn responsibility for others. The family is the template which casts the dye not only for the future of the individual but collectively for our nation. As a father and a husband I am aware of the difficulties which families in my electorate face on a daily basis. In a climate where the family's future has not had a great amount of security, it is important that this government supports the family in every way. In order to be truly representative, the government needs to respond to the family's changing needs and wants. For example, I stand for a more flexible working arrangement for parents. I hope family breakdown will cease to be such a common occurrence in an economy which promises growth, employment and greater security. During the election campaign I was privileged to have been given guidance by a former member for Swan, Mr Richard Cleaver, whose experience and knowledge of the electorate helped me greatly. Mr Cleaver, or Dick, as he is known, is the founder and director of Swan Cottage Homes in Bentley. Through him I was given valuable insight into the concerns of seniors. Approximately one-third of the electorate of Swan is comprised of seniors. I made a commitment to them during my campaign to represent their interests as a priority. In the next decade the number of older people' in our community will substantially increase. Under the economy which will be produced in that decade under a coalition government old age will not mean the dark age, which it would have been under Labor. The resources simply would not have been there under Labor; they would have been spent in the usual careless and wanton Labor way. Speaking to the people of Swan, I am encouraged by the sense of confidence they share with me in our Prime Minister, John Howard. I am encouraged that they believe a government led by Mr Howard will create the welcome difference which they already see as coming from Canberra. There is a sense in my electorate, which is fairly indicative of other Australian electorates, that this government has decided to set high standards for the leadership of Australia and will do it in a proper Westminster manner. This means with respect for the voters, respect for the country and with a vision to strive for. I committed to the voters of Swan that I would represent them in this place with respect and dignity. The people of Australia cannot be expected to have confidence in their federal representatives if tatives treat the parliament with disrespect. This government is seen as a government which will conduct itself in accordance with the wishes of the people who voted it there. Australia is a land of oppOrtunity. We are a nation where people who are willing to make sacrifices can succeed and where people can take the opportunity to make their own luck. The success rate of those who have a go is very high. Australia is the envy of much of the rest of the world and the rate of people who want to migrate to this great country is very high indeed. Finally, the worse thing that could happen to Australians is if they begin to believe, to quote the former Prime Minister, that 'this is as good as it gets'. Very rarely do we reach that point where there is no more to strive that all has been achieved. The Australian people have clearly shown that they expect better than they have received in the past 13 years. Clearly, the time for change is ripechanges towards greater individual responsibility and reward for effort. I am confident that with good government we will see better management of the economy and Australia in general. I look forward to the changes brought about by positive coalition policies which will unleash the potential this country offers to all Australians. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",73
108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Before I call the honourable member for Grayndler, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",76
109,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Grayndler) (5.00 p.m.)I am very honoured to enter this chamber as the representative of the Australian Labor Party for the electorate of Grayndler. I would like"" to sincerely thank the electors of Grayndler for showing confidence in my ability to represent their interests. I would also like to thank the over 1,000 party members in Grayndler who worked so hard during the election campaign to ensure the seat remained with Labor. I believe that my campaign team, led by the best young campaign director in the country, Tim Gartrell, those represenwas second to none. I am proud to be here representing the seat of Grayndler, named after a trade unionist, Ted Grayndler, of the Australian Workers Union. I succeed one of the greatest local inembers and campaigners this House has known-the first woman elected to the House of Representatives from New South Wales, my friend and comrade, Jeannette MCHugh. Jeannette has only retired from parliament, not from politics. I am sure that she will continue to play ""a progressive role on issues such as uranium mining, peace and disarmament, consumer affairs and the rights of women. Grayndler has always returned Labor members to this House. Jeannette followed the current Chief Opposition Whip and now for, member for Watson, Leo MCLeay, the late Frank Stewart, Tony Whitlam and, of course, the first member, one of the greats of the Labor movement, the late Fred Daly. Fred's farewell at St Brigid's, Marrickville, last year was the sort of tribute that only a Labor member could have had and a member on the other side of the House could only dream about. My presence in this House today is the result of a collective effort. First, I would like to thank my mother, Maryanne Albanese, who raised me under very difficult economic circumstances. She instilled in me a strong sense of social justice and fairness. My special thanks go to my partner and best friend, Carmel Tebbutt, for her constant support, advice and outstanding political judgment. I have been extremely fortunate to receive the support of many party members and trade unions. lowe a great deal to people such as Tom Uren, with whom I worked for four years. They have, I hope, instilled in me a sense of history and purpose to my activity in the labour movement and now as a parliamentarian. I joined the Labor Party in 1979, while still at school. This was a natural choice, for I come from three generations Â·of rank and file party members. My time as Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales branch confirmed my belief in the importance of fighting for genuine participatory democracy and I am proud to have been selected through the rank and file preselection system. It is the strength and values of rank and file members and trade unionists that make the ALP the greatest political party in Australia and perhaps the world. There were many in the media who confidently predicted that I would not be in this chamber today. Well-known psephologist Mr Malcolm Mackerras wrote in the Australian on 5 October 1995: Grayndler will go to NAN, the No Aircraft Noise Party, . . . make no mistake about the ability of NAN to achieve its objectives. His view was supported by the former leftwing anarchist-and now right-wing individu wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 February 1996: There is a fair chance that the No Aircraft Noise Party will win the seat of Grayndler in the blighted inner Sydney from a scion of the Labor left, Anthony Albanese, which will benefit the Liberals. I am pleased to have disappointed them. The negative coalition which made up the No Aircraft Noise Party-Tories, Trotskyists and political opportunists-were united only by their vehement hatred of Labor. In the words of Martin Luther King: 'There is no progress in hate . . . like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity.' We saw that objectivity disappear with NAN and it has progressed only into political oblivion. The Labor Party was written off in Grayndler due to the backlash caused by the opening of the third runway at Kingsford Smith airport on 4 November 1994. While I believe the previous Labor government had an outstanding record, with which I am proud to be associated, no government is free of mistakes. The reversal of Labor's commitment to the third runway and the prevarication on Sydney West Airport was about economics, not aviation or even politics as some have suggested. It stands as a sad example of decision making on a short-term accounting basis without due regard for the long-term economic and social impact on people. Governments and commentators must look beyond the bottom line in the monthly and annual accounts. Such an approach distorts the policy making process to the detriment of mediumand long-term vision. It is imperative that there be a clear distinction drawn between capital and recurrent spending in all budgets so as to facilitate effective planning. For government business enterprises the failure to do this has led to false constraints, which has hindered their ability to raise capital and given encouragement to those who favour privatisation as an ideological creed. The decision to build the third runway was the culmination of a concerted campaign by the then federal opposition, the New South Wales Greiner government, the airline industry and the media. Of course, the new Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was a vocal and strident long standing supporter of the third airportrunway. On 28 February 1989, he described Labor's opposition to the third runway as 'disgraceful political featherbedding' and 'one of the most shameful exercises in political cynicism at the expense of the interests of a great Australian city'. Mr Howard repeated this view on 21 March 1989 when he said: I've always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on the local residents. He went on to reiterate his support for the third runway, saying: I think the case for it on general interest grounds is absolutely overwhelming. In spite of strenuous opposition from Labor members in New South Wales, and its near defeat in the Labor caucus, the Hawke cabinet approved the building of the third runway on 22 March 1989. Gary Punch, the then minister for aviation, showed great courage in putting principle before his career and resigning from the ministry. The decision was an act of vandalism against the urban environment of inner Sydney. It is crucial that the lessons of this monumental mistake are learned. The third runway cost $243 million to build. As the enormity of the noise problem emerged, noise amelioration measures became necessary. Their cost will far exceed the $270 million already allocated. The Keating government moved to minimise the impact of the noise. It launched a project to acquire 151 of the worse affected homes and insulate 20 schools, 21 preschools and child-care centres, 24 places of worship, eight nursing homes and 4,380 homes. In the longer term, however, the solution must be to lower the number of aircraft movements over the inner west. It must not be forgotten that this area is the most densely populated in Australia. Since the election we have seen the motto of the new government in practice: let the planes fly anywhere but not over Bennelong. The new Prime Minister clearly believes that as the residents of Hunters Hill have higher income levels they have more rights than working class people closer to the airport. We all know that, thanks to Labor, all Australians have access to universal health care. Therefore, I remind the Prime Minister that there is no evidence that the rich have better, as opposed to more sensitive, hearing. The only real solution is to provide the public infrastructure for Sydney West Airport. This airport must be developed in such a way as to ensure that residents throughout Sydney are protected. I do not support simply transferring the problem. I have raised the airport issue in my first speech not only because it is the dominant local issue in my electorate but also because the third runway continues to be a noisy reminder of the need for vision and proper environmental assessment in the provision of public and social infrastructure. Proper planning in areas such as transport, communications and community facilities is vital for the living standards of future generations of Australians. This brings me to a disturbing trend that is emerging throughout the Western world-that is, the contraction of the public sector. In particular, cuts to infrastructure spending are the easy option for conservative governments looking to slash budgets. For more than a decade, governments throughout the Western world have been cutting vital spending in order to impress financial markets with their fiscal rectitude. Ironically, this spending would have paid for itself many times over in increased production and revenue. There is overwhelming evidence that spending on public infrastructure has a positive impact on private sector growth. For example, in the United States, if the level of public infrastructure spending between 1950 and 1970 had been maintained for the next two decades, the average rate of private sector productivity growth would have been 2.1 per cent rather than the low figure of 1.4 per cent. This has deprived the United States of associated income, employment and growth. Given the Howard government's commitment to outdated, right-wing economic rationalism, Australia now runs the risk of underproviding in this important area. Unless the government recognises this, their rhetoric about economic growth and prosperity will remain hollow. Australia must have an interventionist economic policy that is targeted at the specific needs of different regions and communities. Some regional areas are experiencing negative growth as industries relocate or are superseded. Other urban areas are struggling to deal with the impact of population growth and unplanned urban development. These unique problems cannot be solved with the blunt instruments of macro-economic policy. Governments need responsive planning that meets with the individual needs of regions and communities. This approach was pioneered by the Whitlam government through the Department of Urban and Regional Development. It was resumed by the Hawke government, again under my former employer Tom Uren. This work continued in the form of the Better Cities program under Brian Howe in the previous government. Those on this side of the House do not support a stagnant public sector. I have always been a strong advocate for a proactive, efficient and dynamic public sector. The ideologically driven view that the public sector is a huge monolith which exhausts economic and human resources must be challenged. A recent survey by the International Monetary Fund has shown that the Australian public sector, as a percentage of GDP, is the third smallest in the Western world after the United States and Japan. I would much prefer Australia's current values as a society than to look to the US and Japan as role models. I am therefore deeply concerned by the new government's razor gang approach to the Commonwealth budget. The fudging of figures to distort budget .forecasts is nothing more than an excuse to make savage cuts to pay for unfunded election promises and fulfil ideological obsessions. There is perverse irony in the Howard government's plan to cut public services such as the Commonwealth Employment Service. If the government presses ahead with its ill-advised attempt to cut up to 20,000 public sector jobs, these are exactly the services that will be most in demand. It appears that the new government is determined to reverse the trend established in the last term of the Keating government which saw the creation of over 700,000 new jobs and the target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000 well on track. I might add that this employment growth was achieved whilst improving real wages, improving living standards and protecting those who need protection in our society. There is another good reason for maintaining and increasing community services expenditure. The community services sector is very labour intensive. As well as providing vital services to those most in need, spending in this area has the highest employment multiplier effect of any sector. Social policy is another area that always bears the brunt of those obsessed with advocating smaller and smaller government. What they fail to recognise is that the legitimacy of market economies is only maintained by the provision of a substantial and comprehensive social security system. Rather than attacking social security recipients, I would like to see all of Australia's wealthiest individuals and companies pay their fair share of taxation. I would also like to see companies in Australia pay a minimum tax rate rather than the current system which has been open to manipUlation by some unscrupulous companies. I believe one of the most outstanding reforms of the previous government was in the area of superannuation. I might add, however, that it would be a catastrophe if the successes of the Labor government's super policy were used to undermine the age pension in the long run by a conservative government. We should never forget that there are many in society who, through circumstance, never secure long-term employment or advance beyond a very low wage. We must also remember that women's wages are still not equal to those earned by men. Their lifetime participation in the work force remains irregular. As a result, their access to superannuation entitlements will be less at the end of their working life. The enormous growth in superannuation funds under the Labor government provides a real opportunity for growth in productive investment. Currently, about six million working people in Australia own over $240 billion in superannuation assets. These assets are growing at an impressive rate. During the December quarter alone, superannuation assets rose by $8.7 billion. More than 93 per cent of full-time employees, 60 per cent of part-time and 59 per cent of casual employees are now covered by superannuation. This is the first time in our history working people have had ownership of such volumes of capital. It is our responsibility ensure that they also have control of these assets. I am concerned that working people's savings can too easily disappear in a maze of administration fees and irresponsible speculaWe tive investment. The stock market crash October 1987 demonstrated the insecurity of the financial markets as a place to invest savings of working people. We must ensure that these savings are used to contribute to future long-term assets and infrastructure the nation. The Hilmer report had much to say about the public sector and competition. supporting a dynamic and accountable public sector, we must ensure that in genuflecting before the god of competition we consider social and environmental impact of these changes. Econometric models fail to take into account real world economic factors and, most importantly, they often fail to take account people. Unless people are put back into the equation, strict adherence to dry prosperity. economic philosophies will have negative social and environmental consequences. On 2 March, the electors of Grayndler voted to preserve the best of Labor's agenda: Medicare, multiculturalism, support for the Mabo decision and the Native Title Act, the social wage, the sixfold increase in child-care places and the Working Nation programs. Grayndler is very much a working electorate. Alongside the more established families, the 1991 census showed that 46 per cent of the total population of Grayndler were born overseas. Many of these Australians have struggled against the odds both in their country of origin and on their arrival Australia. They have raised families and vital contributions to the wealth and cultural diversity of this nation. Their special needs should be met and their efforts acknowledged. Multiculturalism provides Australia with unique opportunity to be a microcosm of world-to show that cultural diversity and respect can lead to a more peaceful, equitable and fulfilling life for all. Of course, continuation of the process of reconciliation with indigenous Australians is a precondition that for this vision. Defending and extending multiculturalism and reconciliation with to indigenous Australians will be one of my primary concerns as a member of parliament. In this context, I am deeply disturbed at the election of candidates espousing racist views. must never take the gains we have made of for granted. When those critics of Labor's equity programs spoke about 'all of us', there the was an implied imagery of a nation of AngloCeltic, middle-class nuclear families. The the bigots who criticise programs aimed at the of special needs of sections of our community ignore the fact that there is not equality of opportunity across class, gender, sexual Whilst preference and ethnicity. Mr Deputy Speaker, during the 1980s a substantial redistribution of wealth from the the poor to the rich occurred throughout the Western world. Australia was not immune .from this but its impact was minimised by Labor's progressive social agenda. So I into conclude by saying that my generation has Labor governments to thank for our relative I grew up in public housing in inner city Sydney, the son of a pensioner. I remember all too well how Liberal governments failed to keep pensions at pace with inflation. This stands in stark contrast with Labor's record of increasing pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Indeed, my politics as a democratic socialist have been developed class from my experience in life. As the youngest Labor member of this House, I was particularly disappointed by the overall result on 2 March. (Extension of time granted) Labor's exciting vision of a diverse and just Australian republic for the 21st in century struck a chord with young people. made However, it has to be acknowledged that Labor's embrace of change sometimes was not accompanied by a recognition of the need to cushion people from its adverse side a effects. I have no doubt that the electorate the soon will become all too aware that the previous opposition was a wolf in sheep's clothing. I am therefore confident that the the present Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, will lead Australia into the next century as the next Labor Prime Minister. For myself, I will be satisfied if I can be remembered as someone who will stand up for the interests of my electorate, for working class people, for the labour movement, and for our progressive advancement as a nation into the next century. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.",76
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Richmond, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",81
111,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Richmond) (5.21 p.m.)When the sun rose above the Pacific on 3 March 1996, when the first rays hit Mount Warning and bounced off the cliffs of Cape Byron, Australia's most easterly point, the citizens of Australia were awakening to a new dawn of change, hope and opportunity. For it was through the will of the people that our newly elected government had a massive mandate. And so it is a great privilege and honour to take my initial bow before this House as the eighth member for Richmond, a federation seat. In making my maiden speech this evening I will talk about four main areas. The first is the historical significance of this victory and the need to uphold the values of the Westminster system. Secondly, I will inform the House of some of the unique characteristics and challenges that the New South Wales North Coast seats face. Thirdly, I would like to outline a few of the key issues, both national and local, that the people of this region feel strongly about-notably the Pacific !lighw-y which must be and will be addressed by thiS government. Lastly, I will mention some of those very special people who have helped me on my journey to obtain this high office. Before I do, I would like to congratulate Deputy Speaker on his elevation to the job. I also want to thank those honourable members and their staff who have assisted me for their courtesy and help. This is a momentous occasion for me, not only to have been chosen by the people of Richmond but also, and equally, because of the historical significance of my being the only member in this chamber to be a third generation parliamentarian representing the same seat. My grandfather, Lawrence Hubert Anthony-better known as Larry, and after whom I was named-represented the seat from 1937 through to 1957. On his death, Doug Anthony, my father, held the seat for 27 years until his retirement in 1984. Both men held senior positions within the government. They were followed by Charles Blunt, who became the Leader of the National Party, and then by the ALP member Neville Newell, whom I defeated on 2 March. I would like honourable members to note that I have no desire to break this recordthough if I were to retain my seat for the average term that my forebears did, and with the good wishes of the people, my tenn of office would be 23 years, taking me through to 2020. Time will tell. My grandfather was born at Peak Hi-l. .At a very early age he left home to earn a hvmg and was thrust into the First World War by the landing at Gallipoli. After serious war injuries he obtained a settlement block on the North Coast and began a very successful career in farming, although he suffered many natural disasters. He was a very industrious man. During his tenn he served as Assistant Treasurer in the late 1930s, was Minister for Transport in the early war years prior to the Curtin government, and from 1949 until his death in 1957 served in the capacity of Minister for Civil Aviation and the Postmaster-General. For a man who started with nothing and had no formal education he had a remarkable career as he fought for regional Australia. Although I never met my grandfather I rediscovered his character and his integrity through the two campaigns that I fought. Mr Deputy Speaker, when I was doorknockthe ing in the last campaign I - as .informed that during the war years-thiS IS one small story-my grandfather had donated his entire parliamentary salary t- the Red Cross ?n the basis that they needed It more than he did. By rediscovering some of my heritage and the history of the North Coast I can honestly say that I have not only a far better understanding of the past and the present but also an appreciation of what the future might bear for this unique electorate and the challenges that it faces. I believe it is these attributes of decency, hard work and honesty which were passed on to my father on his father's death that helped him sustain a very impressive parliamentary career. My father was Leader of the National Party for over 14 years and Deputy Prime Minister for 10 years, during which time he held many senior portfolios. I think the greatest attributes he had were his honesty, strength and respect for other people and their beliefs. He was a fierce defender of the bush, of private enterprise and of our primary industries which generate the bulk of Australia's export earnings. He had integrity and respect and, even though he had many running battles with his political foes, notably those on this side of the House, I believe he was well regarded by both sides. I would say that that is an unusual attribute in today's politics. Given the community's current rock-bottom level of cynicism towards politicians, I applaud the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to improve the tenor of this parliament so as to regain some respect for this institution which, sadly, the previous Prime Minister and his government showed scant regard for. It is the Westminster system which acts as the foundation for our freedom and liberty. Never was this so greatly expressed as on 2 March 1996. As noted by Bernard Shaw, freedom of speechgives me the liberty to know, to utter and to argue accordingly to conscience above all liberties. Indeed, it would be remiss of me not to mention the recent tragic events of Port Arthur and how the lives of 35 men, women and children were cut short by a man abusing the privileges of our free society. My heart goes out to those who were injured, the families, the loved ones and the communities who must live with these memories and scars for the rest of their lives. I wish the Prime Minister well in his endeavours to tighten up and bring uniform gun laws to the nation for the first time. If tougher, sensible gun laws mean that one extra life is saved, it is worth it. It is the very denial of freedom, the grief and the humiliation that this tragedy has brought to our land that have strengthened my resolve to see a tightening of the controls on the proliferation of violent movies and games which go under the guise of general entertainment. The tide must be turned on this constant barrage of brutality being beamed into our living rooms. I encourage the government, and, I am glad to say, the opposition as well, to take the steps required to improve our mental health services where we have seen the deinstitutionalisation of patients. We are lucky to live in a free and democratic society which our forefathers and mothers died for. Let us not lose our sovereignty or our Australian cultural heritage to the technologically-driven world of Hollywood global communication companies and the electronic superhighway. So it is on this note of freedom and hope that I turn to the electorate of Richmond. The electorate faces enormous challenges. In many ways it is the freedom of choice which is placing the greatest pressure on the North Coast from social welfare and infrastructure perspectives. Australians have discovered how beautiful and magical our region is, from the pristine coastline of our beaches to the backdrops of our mountains, to our world heritage parks, to the vibrant centres of Tweed Heads, . Byron Bay, Ballina and Murwillumbah to name a few. It is this freedom of mobility which has seen the electorate of Richmond, encompassed by three local councils-Tweed, Byron and BaIlina-experience one of the fastest growth rates in the country. But this dramatic growth rate is causing tremendous strains on the community, particularly on our young and our elderly. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to tell the House of some of the unique characteristics of the seat. These are taken from the last ABS survey. Of the 148 seats in this House, only two other seats have a higher aged population. Over 20 per cent of the population of Richmond are over the age of 65. At the other end of the spectrum, we have more children in the electorate aged from zero to 14 years than any other seat in the Commonwealth. So this in itself creates enormous challenges, particularly with our medical services, as both groups of people have a high reliance on these services. This is further compounded by our cross-border issues-different time zones, hospital, transport and education systems. Another interesting statistic is that only 42 per cent of the population in the Richmond electorate are employed, meaning that over 58 per cent of people are either reliant on their life savings or on the Commonwealth. We have one of the lowest per capita incomes in the country with over 25 per cent of the population earning below $16,000. So it can be appreciated that this electorate is very sensitive to the whims of government policy. On a national scale, one of the greatest tyrannies in modem times that Australia faces now is the ever growing level of unemployment, homelessness, alienation and despair that is happening within so many of our communities. Employment generation, both in Richmond and across the country, is the number one priority of this government, and it must be tackled. Tragically, youth unemployment levels on the North Coast are the highest in the nation, approaching 50 per cent. On a brighter note, though, Richmond is made up of a rich tapestry of people and cultures. It is an area of Australia that is constantly changing. Agriculture still plays a vital role, particularly our sugar industry, beef industry, bananas, small crops and the new industries of horticulture. But it is the urban expansion in our regional centres and the new growth in tourism, commerce, education and health services and the alternative lifestyle set which really are changing the very character of the area. I do not think you could find an electorate more diverse than Richmond, from the fifth generation farmers and loggers to our newly arrived retirees from Sydney or Melbourne. Richmond has one of the highest concentrations of returned servicemen; there are over 6,000 residents who choose to live in mobile home parks; and it has a diverse arts and crafts industry and is the mecca for many environmental groups. There are five world heritage parks and an extensive ecotourism industry. On the other hand, it has a massive club industry, one of the biggest in the country . We have vibrant macadamia nut and titree industries on the Alstonville Wollongbar plateau. And, of course, we have our magnificent surfing beaches, from Lennox Head to Duranbah. But there are many issues that face us, particularly airport noise from Coolangatta airport, which is Australia's sixth busiest, and the fact that our traditional forestry industries are under considerable pressure from environmental groups. There are the challenges of providing more aged care for our expanding elderly population and of providing real opportunities of employment for the young people and those retrenched halfway through their careers. It is on this that I applaud the government for its focus on helping small business, particularly by bringing equality to the unfair dismissal legislation, which has become the major handicap to allowing employers to hire. I also applaud the government for its decision to start the task of cutting back on the red tape which unnecessarily wraps up so many business hours. But in particular addressing the state of the Pacific Highway and the death trap it has become will be the greatest thing that this government achieves in the area. It was on a hot steamy day in late February that the Prime the Minister announced the government's road policy on the Burringbar Range in the Richmond electorate. I commend the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), who gave a $750 million commitment, to be matched by the states, to rebuild Australia's main artery linking the cities of Brisbane and Sydney. This notorious stretch of road has claimed over 600 lives. This record has led to the commitment by the government to build the Chinderah to Billinudgel motorway, which could not have come too soon. By bypassing both the Burringbar Range and the extremely busy coast road, this project will make travel and transport in the Richmond electorate both safer and more efficient. This $220 million bypass will be' the greatest infrastructure project this electorate has seen since the rail system was first placed in it over 100 years ago. The Burringbar Range is one of the worse black spots on the coast. It should not be forgotten, though, that I do hope to see in my lifetime an extension of the rail link from Robina in Queensland through to Coolangatta airport and eventually connecting with the Casino branch line. A man who knows the national importance of rail transport is the Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer. I pay special tribute to Tim Fischer and also to Senator David Brownhill, who maintained the faith in me and gave me the strength to keep going through the wilderness years after the 1993 campaign. Members of the House should be aware that I have been fighting for this goal directly for over five years. On my second attempt I wondered why on earth I was going through this quest for public office, as exit polls taken in the winter of 1995 put the National Party vote at 10 per cent and my vote at 16 per cent. To put this into perspective, the ALP vote was in the mid-30s and my Liberal counterparts were tracking in the 40s. In the end I outpolled the ALP vote on primaries by the greatest margin of any three-cornered contest in New South Wales .. In all humility, I thank the Liberal Party and their candidate; Keith Johnson, for his contribution to the result. I thank other federal members such as John Anderson, John Sharp, Senator Ron Boswell, Senator Bill O'Chee, Bob Katter and many others who helped maintain the faith. I also thank the federal secretariat, Cecile Ferguson and her counterpart, the ever professional Liam Bathgate, secretary of the New South Wales National Party, and his whole team at Lisgar House. A special tribute must be paid to Jenny Gardiner and Richard Bull, who brought the campaign strategy together in the final assault on election day. Their assistance, along with that of the staffof the New South Wales parliament, was essential. I want to put on the record my thanks to my campaign team who held in with me over the years, notably Warren Polglase, Vicki Thomas, Bob Dixon, Tom Butcher, Peter Mason, Andrew Walker, John Kerrison, Lyn Beck, Andrew Sochacki, Sue Curtis, Jan Doust, Marie Burke, Louie Davis and all those involved throughout the whole branch structure. I pay a tribute to my state members, Don Beck, Don and Morag Page and in particular Bill Rixon, state member for Lismore, who gave up a day a week for many months to go door-knocking with me. A special tribute must go to my loyal friend and campaign treasurer, Idwall Richards, and his wife, Jill. Idwall was a driving force in the 19,93 campaign and bounced back as finance manager for the 1996 campaign, and for this I salute him. To the 600-plus booth workers who came out in force on polling day, my very sincere thanks. I am grateful to my parents, Doug and Margot, for not only giving me support and good advice but instilling in me the values, education and honesty for which the electorate endorsed me on 2 March. Finally, a special thankyou to my wife, Jenny, for her patience, tolerance and love through the years of campaigning that we have endured since our marriage, and the beautiful children she has given me-Bronte and Alexander, who was born on 27 December 1995, in the midst of the campaign. I could not have done it without you. I end this maiden speech from where I began. I place on record my sincere appreciation that the electors of Richmond have chosen me to act as their representative in the federal parliament. It is with some trepidation that I begin my parliamentary career knowing that I follow in the footsteps of my father and grandfather. I say to my children, should they ever read this speech, that they should not feel obligated to seek public office, because it must be for their own will and conviction and not on the basis of tradition. I have argued strongly for freedom of speech and equality, for the need to curb violence in our community and to maintain and develop infrastructure projects, such as the Pacific Highway, and for the need for the government to support small business as the engine room of employment which is desperately needed on the North Coast. So, as the sun sets this evening behind Mount Warning and as the shadows stretch across the coast of Richmond, I make this pledge to the people of Richmond: to serve to the best of my ability and, God willing, to live up to the trust they have placed in me. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned. NA Gun Control",81
112,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"by leave-Before I deal with the issue that is the subject of my statement, I would like to join with others of my colleagues in congratulating the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) on his maiden speech. He comes from a great Australian family and a great political family. Amidst the inevitable trauma and sadness of last week, which all of us felt, one of the moments was when my wife and I, Tim and Judy Fischer and Malcolm and Tamie Fraser had the opportunity to have dinner with Doug and Margot Anthony. I worked with Doug Anthony as a ministerial colleague for 71/2 years. He was a terrific bloke to work with. You could not have two finer people as your parents. If you follow in Doug's footsteps you will be a great representative National Party and you will be a terrific representative of the people of Richmond. I am delighted to have you as a colleague and I know that you will do your electors immense pride in the years ahead. Mr Speaker, the purpose of my speaking tonight is to briefly outline decisions that have been taken by the government in relation to a proposal to be put to the police ministers meeting in Canberra on Friday to significantly strengthen laws relating to gun control in Australia. Everyone is aware of the circumstances which have finally brought to a head a drive in the community for strong and effective gun control laws. As I have said in other places and on other occasions in the parliament, it would be wrong to simply see a response to what happened in Tasmania last week as being found in tougher gun control laws. The causes of that dreadful event lie deeper than simply the inadequacy of our gun control laws. They go to aspects of the kind of society we are. They go to issues concerning violence on the screen and in videos. They also, in the view of many of my colleagues on this side of the House-they are views that I share-raise legitimate questions about contemporary attitudes towards the treatment of mental health problems. I want to make it clear to the House that, whilst I do not form any summary judgments, if we are as a community to seriously examine the causes and provide a range of responses, then we have to go beyond issues of gun control legislation. We have to go to an examination of some of those other matters. I can assure the House that, in a sensible, measured way, the government will be doing precisely that. As to the question of gun control laws, the nice government is strongly of the view that we need effective, uniform legislation. We need to achieve a total prohibition on the ownership, possession, sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic weapons. That will be the essence of the proposal that will be put by the Commonwealth government at the meeting on Friday. We need an effective registration system and we will be pushing for the very strongly for that. This decision, if it is supported by all of the states, will inevitably cause inconvenience and present some difficulties for tens of thousands of law-abiding people throughout this country. I think particularly of Australia's rural community, a community that, more than many others, always matches the national need and rises to the occasion in times of national difficulty. I want to say to those many tens of thousands of people who may not find the government's position a palatable one that it is only being done because of an overwhelming view on the part of the government that there is a broader national interest in having a very extensive prohibition. People will argue that you can draw the line between one particular style of weapon and another. I do not parade expertise in this area, but I have some understanding of the depth of community feeling on this issue and a desire, as I find it amongst my fellow Australians, to grab this very tragic moment to bring about a profound cultural shift in the attitude of this community towards the possession and the use of destructive weapons. Perhaps if we do that, as a community, we can avoid some of the trauma experienced almost as a daily fact of life in the United States. I would hate to contemplate the future of this country if we went willy-nilly down the American path when it comes to gun violence. I think we do have an opportunity at this moment to do something to tum that around. It will involve difficulty. Part of the government's proposals is to have a six-month amnesty period during which people will be invited to surrender their guns and full and proper compensation will be paid. That will involve a cost, and ultimately that cost will have to, as it properly should, be borne by the entire community and not just by the people who are being encouraged to surrender their weapons. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams), as the responsible minister, will be releasing the document in the course of the next day or so. I will ensure that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) gets a copy of the document as soon as it has been finally settled, and I want to take this opportunity of thanking the Leader of the Opposition for the very constructive and positive way in which he has responded so far. I make no judgments about the future. He, as the leader of the alternative government, has his political rights, as I had my political rights as the former leader of the alternative government. This issue, above most issues that I have encountered in my years in politics, has demanded, as best we can provide in this place, a bipartisan response. The decisions that the government has taken will not be universally popular-I accept that-and there will be people who will argue that they represent unacceptable infringements of individual rights. It is not an issue that is new; it has been around for quite some years. Those who might argue that in some way what the government is doing is a knee-jerk reaction have forgotten the extensive public debate that occurred after the Hoddle Street and Strathfield massacres. I ask those who argue, and who will be told over the days and weeks ahead that what you need is further discussion and debate and deliberation, to see that discussion for what it is. It is inevitably a code for doing nothing in the hope that the immediate anger in the aftermath of last weekend will in time subside and that nothing will change. In a sense it is always a sombre moment in a country where you ask the people who have done the right thing to put up with inconvenience because a limited number of people have done the wrong thing. But that is the nature of a democratic society. As somebody who is a fervent opponent of regulation, I always feel uncomfortable in responding to a problem with new laws. I think that this is an occasion when, if we did not, we would not be matching the national concern or the national need. I should say to the House that I have had the opportunity over the weekend of having some very positive and helpful discussions with leaders of some of the farming bodies, and their attitude does not surprise me. As I said a moment ago, they usually respond in a very positive fashion to national issues. Their reaction has been one of understanding the dilemma that the government faces. In essence, our proposal involves a total prohibition on automatic and semi-automatic weapons; a strengthening of the import regime; the seeking of an effective system of national registration; a tightening of the criteria under which people can be given licences, which I think picks up a point that was made by the opposition; and the commitment of funds for an education campaign; a six-month amnesty period, and after that a descending order of penalties including, potentially, a mandatory gaol sentence for the possession of the more high-powered destructive weapons, including those that were used in the Port Arthur massacre and which have been used on other occasions. It gives me no pleasure to make this statement because it does involve an infringement of individual liberty by the state, which is never something I like. But there is a broader national and human interest involved, and I hope it is an approach that will win the support of all members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. I hope that the state governments-they will all be represented at the meeting on Friday-will find themselves able to respond. This is not an issue where I have sought some kind of aggregation of power to the Commonwealth. If it can be achieved through cooperation by the states, that is infinitely to be preferred, and that is what I will seek. It does involve an acceptance by the whole community and ultimately, if it becomes necessary because of the cost involved in compensation, the government will be seeking a contribution from all members of the community to cover the cost of that compensation because all members of the community will benefit. I commend the statement to the House.",85
113,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Brand-Leader of the Opposition) (5.50 p.m.}-by leave-We, of course, support the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He informs us that they are going to be followed up by a presentation of a more extensive paper in the next little while, in time for us to make some comment to him and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) before they see the police ministers and state attorneys-general a bit in the week. The points that he makes essentially reiterate statements he has made before in the House as to what particular alterations he will be seeking in the regimes that apply to the ownership, handling and licensing of firearms. As I said, we do support those. He made the point during his remarks that this is not a matter that has not been debated before, that in fact there is a very considerable public record now of approaches to a national regime in relation to the ownership and licensing of firearms. This is a matter which has been several times before the police ministers. It has not been simply in the form of a good idea; it has been in the form of quite detailed proposals as to who might have a licence, what a national register would consist of and what types of weapons would be licensed under which particular type of licensing regime. There is now an extensive amount of paperwork inside the state and Commonwealth bureaucracies. I have before me the working paper of the Ministerial Council on the Administration of Justice. My colleague the shadow minister for immigration, previously the Minister for Justice, was operating on this when he also tried to brace the states on these matters. This will no doubt bear some relationship to the type of paper which Mr Williams subsequently puts down. When you actually sit down and look at the various criteria for who might obtain a licence, you will find that there is a very comprehensive list indeed. There is a 'genuine reason' criteria associated with it, cooling off periods, and all sorts of things related to ownership of weapons. These will have a very substantial impact, I believe, and when followed up--it does seem to me, from what has been said so far, that it will be followed up-they will be very much for the good of our society. Matters of storage need to be looked at in this regard, tob. Quite clearly, the question of whether or .not a licensed person has access to guns is one thing. If somebody else is aware of the location of those weapons, that later becomes another thing. The defence forces certainly take very seriously the requirements that they have for the protection of their armouries. The police take that very seriously as well. Obviously, there ought to be some obligation on citizens likewise to be aware of the potential impact the ownership of their weapons can have on the possibility that other people might get access to them. There is going to be a great deal for the police ministers to consider. Implementation is going to be a very difficult task once consideration has been achieved and unanimity is gained amongst the various police ministers to ensure that the laws are enforced. As the Prime Minister rightly says, there are a large number of very law abiding peoplein fact, 99.99 per cent of gun owners-who will in one way or another be affected by this legislation. They will not be at all happy about the situation in which they find themselves and not all of them will be fully aware of why they ought to be in that situation. There is obviously going to be a very substantial task to educate those people who feel they are affected in that way and mutually reinforce society's concern as far as these issues are concerned. People will make the reasonable point that there are characteristics of mass killings other than the possession of weapons. Those factors will go to the mental state of the person in possession of the weapons and the way in which that person gained access to the weapons. Part of the answer to that lies in licensing, but there are other matters as well that go to picking up those concerns. The Prime Minister mentioned the requirement to look at mental health concerns in relation to this. There is a requirement for some structure in that. The police ministers conference is probably not the right place to consider it. There needs to be some extraction of this issue from other mental health issues and, where a problem has been identified and an individual or a group in the community associated with that, some highly specific attention needs to be given to ensuring that people who have exhibited a certain category of behaviour do not have readily available access to weapons. Mental health concerns may not necessarily be of a general nature; they may be related to specific circumstances in which individuals find themselves-for example, family situations-which have the potential to get out of control. They might be people who have exhibited no problems in society at all to that point. I think these issues require separate consideration, not simply broader consideration of mental health issues. Perhaps the Prime Minister might like to give a bit of attention over the next few weeks to establishing some form of coordinated activity amongst the states or agencies concerned to give specific focus to those concerns. For those who are inconvenienced by this legislation, we owe them-more specifically, we owe society-no less than to look at that. I must say I think de-institutionalisation become a bit faddish. It is a convenient meeting over the years of economic rationalism and perhaps over-strained liberalism, if you like, in approaching these particular problems. The combination of the two has produced a situation where, not just in this area but across the board, there needs to be a bit more careful thought given to it in the light of these events than perhaps we have done over the last couple of decades. The Prime Minister is obviously clearly interested in working through those issues. We mentioned a few issues this afternoon in question time-the culture of violence in the community and what produces that. Often the focus on censorship laws relates to the question of whether or not there ought to be public access to erotic videos or whatever, and questions of violence slip to one side as that consideration is seen as overwhelming. Generally speaking, in so far as people are influenced by what they see, read or hear, the question of the style of their violence being influenced by what they actually see or read requires some degree of examination for us to be absolutely certain that these sorts of events are not, at least in part, a product of individuals and society having had access to that. These again are matters that go outside the immediate purview of the police ministers and more generally into areas of government activity. There is also the issue of generally our approach to crime and the Commonwealth responsibility in this area, which is not vast but is nevertheless extant. As the Prime Minister looks at his budget cutting exercises-I have one view about the nature of his problem; the Prime Minister has another view about the nature of his problem, and we will no doubt have many debates on that over the next months-whatever either of our views are I urge him to look very carefully at the budgetary arrangements in the Attorney General's area to ensure that, as a Commonwealth legal responsibility, there be some isolation of the contributions that we make to things like the National Crime Authority and to other areas from any budgetary activity. As somebody who has been a finance has minister, I do know this: finance ministers approach their task with enormous enthusiasm and they are generally constrained by prime ministers, and that is absolutely required. There are many more public policy issues associated with a budgetary process than the mere existence of particular targets. Treasurers and finance ministers ought not be constrained by those public policy issues in themselves, but they certainly need to be constrained by other people. That is part of the responsibilities of prime ministers and portfolio ministers-to ensure that public policy issues are not neglected. Obviously the Attorney-General will need to do that in several areas. One area is the area now specifically isolated by the Prime Minister; that is, the question of compensation in relation to the reacquisition of firearms. No doubt you will need to be looking at private sale issues in this regard to ensure that that minimised, but you are also going to have to be looking at getting the guns back, and that will cost you some money. You can be reassured that it will cost you nowhere near as much as what those who speculate say it is going to cost you. To be able to do that is an impediment to the action; nevertheless, it will cost you something. That is going to have to feature in your consideration of the budget. Also, I think other areas of Commonwealth responsibility such as the area of crime and the area of mental health are going to have to be contemplated in your budgetary processes too. So I look forward, on behalf of the opposition, to your success at the end of the week. We have said before that, if you are unable to get the states to a regime that works-and we are aware, as you are aware, of the enormous technical detail that goes beyond simply the statement of principle, important though the statements of principle are, that you have made; as you go into this issue, the devil is tremendously in the detail-your task will be considerably beyond that that is apparent from what has immediately been said by the Prime Minister. But if you are unable to get what you would consider real progress in the detail, in order to be assured in your own mind that the principle has been adopted, we would urge upon you the suggestion made by the Premier of New South Wales: this is an area, at the end of the day, which the Commonwealth might find a great deal easier to handle than the states. At the end of the day, if you take a look at what has been the prohibition to this point, it is the states who have been far more easily influenced by concerns in this regard than has been the Commonwealth over the years, and I put that on a bipartisan basis, at all levels. It may just be that a few of the states, as they get down and look at the detail of this, might quite like it to be your problem rather than theirs. If they arrive at that conclusion, we would not want you to hesitate. We think that is something that would not be a bad thing for you to take on yourself at all. We look forward, as I said, to seeing the detailed propositions of the Prime Minister. I is will be writing to him about a few of our concerns in this regard that I hope he might take into consideration. We will probably find that the things I was going to write to him about are covered in what is a general detailed statement that he will be producing. But, if not, to the extent that it is different I hope he will look at our proposition seriously. GOVERNOR-GENERAVS SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed.",87
114,Mr LEE,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I begin by first of all congratulating you on your elevation to the role of Speaker in this parliament. I am sure you will discharge that responsibility with great distinction. In response to the constructive remarks that have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on the tragedy in Port Arthur, I would like to make a couple of remarks about the impact on Australians of violence which is portrayed in the mass media. In particular, I would like to focus on the impact that some of the images we see on broadcast television might have on young children in particular. Most people would expect that a high proportion of children watch television around the peak viewing times, 6 to 7 o'clock at night, and that fewer kids watch television as the night goes on. The Broadcasting Authority has actually done some research on this, and it shows that about 40 per cent of Australia's children are probably watching television right now. Four out of every 10 kids are tuned to one of the stations right now. By 10 or 11 o'clock tonight, only about one in 10 will be watching. The point that I often made to each of the individual commercial broadcasters and the ABC and FACTS, the lobby group for the commercial television broadcasters, is that they have certain responsibilities about the images that they are showing. They have to remember how many kids are watching at the times they are broadcasting various things. One area that I think needs close scrutiny in particular is the images that are portrayed on the news. We actually had a research report done by the ABA on this issue, and it showed that children tended to be more disturbed by shocking images shown in the news rather than shocking images shown in movies or other dramas. It is a report that I would recommend to honourable members. The report is called Cool or Gross, and it looks at movies. children's attitudes to violence and swearing on television. I think they found that about half of all the kids out there have left the room because they have seen something on television that has disturbed them. If this research report is anything to go by, while many of us are concerned by some of the things shown in some of the movies broadcast on television it is often the reports of wars and the reports of what has happened in family disputes, people shooting other members of their family, that kids tend to find most disturbing. I have always believed that broadcasters have a responsibility to ensure that graphic footage of those sorts of stories are not shown on the early evening bulletins-at 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock-when 40 per cent of kids are watching television. There is a responsibility on them to make sure that if graphic footage needs to be shown at all, then . it is shown when most kids have gone to bed and are not watching television. There are, of course, stories about what is happening in the world, or events that have happened in Australia, by which we need to be shocked and from which we understand that terrible things have happened. Showing visual images is one way to shock a community. But I think broadcasters do need to make sure that the most shocking of those images are reserved for the late night news bulletins rather than the early evening bulletins. All the research shows that these images are the sorts of things that disturb young children most particularly. Like the Leader of the Opposition, I am also pleased to see that the Prime Minister has agreed to look at whether we need to tighten the rules for the broadcast of films that are rated MA. It is common knowledge that the former Prime Minister believed that they should not be shown before at least 9.30 at night. We were able to persuade the industry to change the self-regulatory code that they follow to not broadcast MA movies before 9 p.m. I am very pleased that today at question time the Prime Minister agreed to look at the issue of whether 9.30 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. were more appropriate cut-off times for MA I turn now to the budget. I would like to spend a bit of time addressing the government's allegation that the Labor government has left office after a mad spending spree which has left a massive deficit that the government can address only by massively cutting back government programs-programs in health and other areas. Just before I go on to that issue, I would like to compliment and congratulate my neighbour, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd), before he leaves the chamber, on his being elected to the electorate of Robertson. You might understand that I was supporting another candidate at the time of the 2 March election, but I am pleased to be in the chamber with Mr Lloyd. I am sure he will make a constructive contribution to the House of Representatives. Returning to the budget issue, I make the point that the government have sought to suggest that there is an $8 billion hole in the estimates in the budget because of what they imply was spending by the former Labor government. They think that Kim Beazley was not tough enough as the finance minister and that, as a result, the government now has to come in and fix things up. I would like to refer the House to an article by Ross Gittins, the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, who has not been backward in attacking the Labor Party on the occasions that he thought the Labor Party was not doing enough to make sure that the right economic policies were being followed by Australia. I will quote his article of 18 March, which I think was the first article Mr Gittins wrote after the government released this $8 billion figure-a figure that we in the Labor Party believe should be known as the Costello con rather than the Beazley black hole. This is what Ross Gittins had to say about this alleged $7 billion figure: You have to realise that of the $7 billion deterioraexpect tion in the estimated starting-point deficit between the Budget last May and the statement last week, the Labor Government's post-budget spending decisions account for less than $0.5 billion. So 93 per cent of the worsening is explained by adverse revisions to Budget ""parameters""-to changes in the forecasts for economic and employment growth, inflation and average earnings on which the estimates of Budget outlays and revenues are based. He goes on to make the point that reducing the forecast rate of economic growth from 3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent, and the knockon effect that that has on other parameters in the Treasury calculations, demonstrates that that causes the Treasury to calculate this 93 per cent contribution to that $7 billion figure. He goes on to make the point that Treasury also severely qualified the figures that were released by the Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). Treasury was saying that they made it very clear that 'the lower forecast should not be regarded as a signalling of a significant change in the economic outlook'. Mr Gittins translated that statement in this way: My translation of that remarkable line is: ""Look, don't take these new forecasts too literally."" This is precisely the point. There is another qualification. Treasury goes on to say: . .. it's ""premised on meeting previously announced policy objectives"". In particular,Â· ""the scenario makes no attempt to allow for cyclical influences on economic activity"". Once again, we have got a massive series of qualifications that make it clear that Treasury was trying to come up with the lowest possible rate of economic growth to give the government the largest possible gap in the deficit. As I pointed out, seven per cent of that gap was contributed to by increases in spending since the budget of May 1995, and 93 per cent of the increase of that $7 billion was a result of these revisions in the estimates. Since the Treasurer released this statement, there have been reports in a number of newspapers saying that we can expect a higher rate of economic growth as spending has increased. Even the Treasury Roundup last week was making it clear that we can all a much higher figure than 3.25 per cent economic growth to be factored into the budget figures this coming year. All of this goes to show that the figure that the government is using-the $8 billion figure-is a con. It is Costello's con. It is an $8 billion figure which is going to be used to justify outrageous cuts in government spending. It is going to be used to justify cutbacks that, in reality, are going to fund the government's promises, promises which were not funded by measures announced by the opposition before the election. One of the areas I am most concerned about is the impact these cuts might have on the area of health. We have already seen speculation in an article in the Sun-Herald on 24 March, which said: A cut in the Medicare rebate and a rise in the Medicare surcharge for high-income families without private health insurance will be considered by the Howard Government as it frames its first Budget. The proposed cuts could mean an extra cost of $1 to $2.50 for a visit to the doctor, and a $350 a year charge on uninsured families . . . When that was put to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) on the Sunday program, the minister's response was simply that he was not going to rule anything in or out. Mr Oakes then put to him: Thirteen months ago you said that that would gut Medicare, that would hurt low income earners and push up private insurance premiums. What was the response of the minister for health? He simply said that he was not prepared to rule anything in or out. So measures which the current minister for health, when in opposition, said would gut Medicare, measures which would increase the cost of private health insurance, cannot be ruled out. The Daily Telegraph advised us that when Dr Wooldridge, as Minister for Health and Family Services, met with the AMA he made it clear that the government was considering a new charge-a compulsory $5 charge-for people who visit their doctor. Honourable members can imagine the impact that will have on ordinary families. for example, one kid in a family happens to come down with the flu and as a result the family makes three visits to the doctor in a week, that family is then not just up for $15-that is, $5 for every visit-but I imagine, if this compulsory charge is brought in, fewer doctors would be prepared to bulk-bill. If Finance and Dr Wooldridge have their way and introduce this compulsory patient fee, we are going to see an incentive for more doctors to walk away from bulk-billing and go back towards fee-for-service. Throughout Australia these days, between 75 and 80 per cent of visits to GPs are bulk-billed. That means that people on low and middle incomes can go to the doctor without being concerned about how they will meet the cost of the visit to their doctor. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if a doctor has to change his or her computer and finance systems to apply a compulsory .payment for every patient that is coming to see them there will be a natural reaction from doctors who will ask themselves why they should not charge patients the full AMA recommended fee of $34 for every visit. So, in the situation where a family might have three kids who need to be taken to the doctor because they have come down with the flu, the family will not just be up for $15three times $5-but could be up for three times $34. If doctors change from bulk-billing to fee-for-service, families will have to have the cash up-front before they get their Medicare rebate. Unfortunately, when the minister for health was put on the spot at a recent meeting of federal and state health ministers and asked whether this new compulsory patient fee would be introduced, he said he would not rule it in or rule it out. As the Newcastle Herald reported in an article headed 'Minister silent on Medicare': The federal Minister for Health, Dr Wooldridge, has refused to rule out the introduction of an electorally sensitive Medicare co-payment for patient doctor visits. I think it is unfortunate that the government is not prepared to advise the community that this measure will receive no further consideration, especially since the Prime Minister put If, out a statement on 19 April saying that Medicare would be retained. The Prime Minister said that the government would stick by its promises in health and that Medicare would be retained. How could you argue that Medicare would be retained if you introduce this compulsory patient fee-whether it is $5, an incentive which pushes more doctors away from bulkbilling towards charging the full cost of a visit to the doctor, or $34? All of those measures, as Dr Wooldridge said just on a year ago, would gut Medicare. That would mean that private health insurance premiums would increase. I certainly do not think you could argue that the Prime Minister is sticking to the promises he made before the election. The last issue I wanted to raise tonight involves one of my former responsibilities as the Minister for Communications and the Arts-that is, Telstra. About 10 days before the election, the Liberal Party ran a series of television advertisements around the country suggesting that a joint venture Telstra was developing between mM and Lend Lease was a part-privatisation of Telstra's businesswhat they called asset stripping of Telstra. They said that this was a terrible thing and that it had to be stopped at all costs. The Treasurer made undertakings that he would block Telstra's joint venture with ffiM. The Sydney Morning Herald of 22 February states: Mr Costello said the Coalition would ""not allow"" Telstra to transfer the assets of its information technology division into a joint venture with IBM. The article goes on to state: The opposition communications spokesman Senator Richard Alston, also confirmed that thCoalition planned to direct the board of Telstra not to proceed with the deal. I am sure everyone sitting in the public gallery today remembers all of those advertisements which the Liberal Party ran 10 days before, the election saying that stripping Telstra s assets and allowing Telstra to develop this joint venture deal with mM and Lend Lease was a terrible thing. But, 10 and behold on 17 April what did we find? We found that the Minister for Communications and the. Arts (Senator Alston), after a briefing with Telstra, no longer intends to direct the board not to proceed with the joint venture. The Treasurer does not intend to not allow Telstra to proceed with the deal. The minister for communications has backed down and allowed Telstra to proceed with the joint venture with mM and Lend Lease. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 17 April stated: The Minister for Communications, Senator Alston s-d last night he had approved the deal after WIth the parties had satisfied his concerns about the stripping of Telstra assets. What is outrageous is that before the election the Liberal Party promised to block the ISSC deal between Telstra, mM and Lend Lease. They said that this was stripping the assets of Telstra. Not one iota of the deal that was made before the election and the package that was put together after the election was .changed. Yet, for crass political reasons, the Liberal Party misled the people of Australia simply to try to confuse them about the privatisation of Telstra before the election. If Telstra is partly privatised, how does the - iberal Party intend to ensure that people who hve outside capital cities, people who live in Burnie and Devonport and all parts of the country and who currently receive a crosssubsidy from the capital. cities towards main-aining the moderate costs of telephone calls 10 the bush, will maintain those crosssubsidies? Some people say that the govern. ment will retain two-thirds of the shares; therefore, you will be able to make sure that the cross-subsidies stay. But what people do not understand is that, as soon as you have a pa--s-le of shares in any company, the maJonty shareholder cannot oppress the - nority shareholders. The remaining one-third of shareholders of Telstra will be able to dictate - o the board of Telstra what happens. They will want a full economic return on their assets in places such as Burnie, Devonport Cairns and Far North Queensland. ' The people of your electorate of Wide Bay, Mr Deputy Speaker, will be expected by the new shareholders of Telstra to provide a full economic return, just like any other business. Tels-a will no l?nger be run in a way that continues to buIld up the quality of our national communications infrastructure. Telstra will no longer be able to ensure that the cross-subsidy to Far North Queenslanrl which at the moment totals $25 million wili continue. There is no way a partly priv-tised Telstra will be able to ensure that the people of Far North Queensland continue to get that $25 million cross-subsidy in future years. It will be interesting to see whether the National Party allows the Liberal Party to proceed along this track. If this part-privatisation goes . ahead the people that the National Party claim to represent will be the hardest hit. For all of these reasons, I welcome the statements which the government have made in outlining their program of action for this parliament. But we make it very clear that this furphy of the alleged Beazley black hole is actually a Costello con, because all of the calculations are based on conservative Treasury estimates about rates of economic growth that have already proven to be incorrect.",89
115,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.24 p.m.}-I rise to speak in the address-in reply debate. In doing so I note the comments of the member Â·for Dobell (Mr Lee) about Telstra. The main issue is whether or not the opposition is going to support what the Australian people supported on 2 March, that is, the privatisation of one-third of Telstra. Members of the opposition will have to address this issue very soon. There is no doubt that the environment of Australia needs a major injection of money to enable a clean-up of the waterways, to make sure that revegetation takes place, and to make sure that. a whole range of rivers are made much cleaner. To do that, we are proposing to the Australian people that money from the privatisation of Telstra will be utilised. It is up to members to address one of the major issues on which we went to the Australian people. Members of the opposition have been referring to a range of issues in the addressin-reply debate. I want to refer to a few statements which were made throughout the years of the Labor Party administration of this country. These statements highlight the fact that the Labor government had come to the end of their tether. They had very few ideas. That is one of the reasons why the Australian people rejected the Labor Party on 2 March. We can go back to a whole range of budget speeches. In 1983 this statement was made: Obviously the economic policies of the' previous (Fraser) Government have failed to come to terms with Australia's deep-seated problems; 1983-84 holds promise of a considerable improvement in economic performance. At that stage, our foreign debt was $23 billion. We had the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, saying that there were going to be major changes, that there was going to be a great improvement in the economic performance of this great and beautiful country of ours. In 1984 we heard these words: Tonight I am proud to be able to tell the Australian people that we now have strong economic growth, many more jobs, a substantial fall in inflation and declining interest rates. The Government's policies are on track. Yet we found our overseas foreign debt going up by around 25 per cent in one year. This statement was made in the 1985 budget speech: I've outlined the Government's strategy for the new financial year. It's a strategy that builds upon very significant successes and puts further behind us the despair and economic failure of the former government At that stage our foreign debt had reached $51 billion. In other words, it had doubled in less than two years. We continued to hear such pronouncements by the former government. All the time we found that Australia was sinking further and further into debt. On coming to government, the coalition under the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) found that there was. an $8 billion hole in the current account. There is no doubt about it: the Australian people want the coalition to address these issues. The mess in which the previous government left this country requires drastic action. If we are going to do something about it, now is the time to do it. At the time of the last election the Australian people realised that things were going from bad to worse. The government's program has been outlined to us. We are going to address industrial relations in this country. At the moment there is in place a range of measures-brought in by the previous government-which stultify small business people. Small and medium sized businesses can no longer carry this burden. This government is determined to bring in measures which will release the potential of many people in this country to be rewarded for the hard work they endeavour to undertake. Some small business people are particularly affected by the unfair dismissal laws. Prior to the election we debated this matter considerably in the House. Under legislation which still exists in this country people who have stolen from their employer two or three times cannot be sacked. There are many examples of that happening. If people lie to and cheat their employer, their employer has to keep them on because of the Labor Party's legislation. The burdens placed on business and the disincentives to employment are incredible.",93
116,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.,94
117,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Just prior to the break for dinner I was commenting about disincentives for small businesses in Australia and, in our particular, about the unfair dismissal laws. Throughout this country under the previous government there had been a range of measures which continually frustrated small business. Seeing that I have only a short period to speak here tonight, I want to concentrate on an area of industry that has a lot of small businesses in it, and that is forest industries. I will give you a few facts about forest industries. There has been a lot of debate about them. One of the things by which I was fascinated, when I spoke to some of the national forest industry spokesmen and said, 'Can you remember any frustrations and difficulties in the forest industries prior to 1983?' was that, although there had been a huge debate for 13 years, they all said, 'No, we can't think of any problem prior to 1983,' but since 1983 until 1986 there had been years of chaos in one of the most major and largest industries in Australia. One wonders why that chaos occurred, when hundreds of small business people around Australia were involved in forest industries. Many people in the urban centres of Australia do not think about the timber industries and the ramifications of everything when they use so much paper. So often they talk about the woodchip industry, not understanding that the woodchip industry is, by and large, a by-product. When you fell trees, you take out the saw log-which is only 30 per cent of a tree-and use that timber for furniture and other building purposes. What remains ispretty sensibly-made into woodchips. In Australia at the moment we have the crazy situation that you have a choice of either selling probably $200 million to $300 million worth of export woodchips or burning them. Under the previous regime in this country, the choice was to go and bum them. In Victoria alone, they would burn about $100 million worth of woodchips. Why? Because the previous federal government decided that you could export only so many woodchips. There is no logic to that, no logic at all. The timber industry can still go into the forests and fell trees for the timber industry for furniture and a whole range of building purposes. Yet they say, 'We're better off as a country to leave all this on the floor of the forest, and then bum it.' What a crazy idea when in this country you have got a huge overseas debt blown out from $23 billion in 1983 to $185 billion now and you have got a balance of payments of about $15 billion. If we got our forest industries into gear, we have got a huge country with plenty of land and all the resources and technology to be at - least neutral in regard to timber products in this country. What a marvellous industry it is! The resource is renewable and it creates a great diversity of jobs, a lot of them quite highskilled jobs nowadays. We have got plenty of land to revegetate. Most people realise there is a great need to revegetate whole areas of this continent of ours, yet the previous government dilly-dallied around. If I remember correctly, they had a national forest policy, passed by this parliament in 1992, and nothing was effectively done on that policy for three years. Even last year, instead of standing by the policy which they had developed, they were trying to bring in a new sort of moved-away policy, the wood strategy. They just did not want to stick with a clear strategy in regard to forests in this country of ours. I wish to give a few facts to people listening to this debate. Firstly, in Australia there are approximately 43 million hectares of native forests, seven million of which are managed specifically on a sustainable basis for wood production. Australia has over 10 million hectares in the permanent forest preservation area. In other words, not an overwhelming amount of our native forests is actually being managed for wood production-only seven million out of the 43 million hectares. I think it is pretty reasonable that the forest industry workers in this country have a set proportion of production area where they know that they can get on with their own business. They want security, stability and predictability. The Howard government will be able to give some of those key features that were not able to be given by the previous government. I want to highlight the tragedy of this great industry. In the debate about the national forest strategy, the government started to take out certain protected areas or reserves and coupes. When you got down to identifying where some of those coupes were, they were floating out in Bass Strait, according to the grids. It was amazing to see the bumbling and incompetence of the previous government in regard to this industry. In 1983 about 100,000 people were involved in this industry. By 1996 it was down to about 60,000 to 65,000 people. Yet this industry imports about $1 billion worth of product. We are a large country which should be self-sustaining in this industry. I just hope that in the next few years we are able to bed down this whole debate in Australia in regard to the forest industries so the hundreds of families who are dependent on forest industries have some security. The truck drivers out there who invest large amounts of capital in trucks and machinery should be able to predict their small business. The people out there who are felling the trees should be able to go about their business in a predictable manner. The larger companies should be able to have plantations on a scale which we have not seen before. One of the companies in my area wants to clear old degraded forests, to replant with new nitan and globulus eucalypts so that we can have beautiful tree farms. The previous government had a cap on the ceiling to sell this product. They said, 'You can clear it but you can't use any of the product off that area to sell as woodchips overseas.' What do you do? You bum it. It is a total waste. Yet it is that sort of policy which we saw under the former government and which I hope we will be able to tum around, to make sure that this industry becomes a productive industry in the future. There is no doubt that one of the reasons why the previous government lost office was its lack of concern for security of small business in this country. They are a vital part of the whole economy of Australia. I have no doubt that the policies which we will see put in place-some of those policies outlined by the Governor General in his speech-will ensure that many families associated with small business in this country will be able to have a much more predictable and secure future under this government in the next few years. That will be a great thing for many families, particularly for the children, who will be able to sense direction and a future for themselves and their mothers and fathers.",94
118,Mr LANGMORE,Unknown,"I want to address the issue of the cuts in outlays that have been so vigorously presented to . the Australian people by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). There has been considerable discussion about the savagery of the coalition's plans to make large cuts in the number of public servants and in public programs, but little careful' analysis of the basis for doing that. One reason is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer have said that relatively little about their justification. In his major statement on the Commonwealth budget position on 12 March, the Treasurer barely discussed the rationale. An estimated increase in the expected budget deficit in this and coming years was apparently expected to precipitate such a sense of crisis that there would be general recognition that 'a strong response' is warranted. Almost as an afterthought the Treasurer mentioned in that media release on 12 March that there would be growth in Commonwealth net debt from budget deficits and the benefit to savings from reducing the deficit. Of course, it is quite clear that there is always a benefit to savings from reducing deficits, but that says nothing about the relative priority of that task. He also claimed, without explanation, that the coalition strategy would 'enable Australia to sustain higher rates of growth in income and employment' - and I emphasise 'employment'-'without putting pressure on the current account deficit and interest rates'. It is important to examine whether that is a realistic expectation. The brevity and baldness of these assertions and the lack of any serious elaboration since suggest that these may not be the whole reason, or even the main reasons, for the cuts. Could it be that the cuts are motivated more strongly by an ideological predisposition to hacking into public expenditure, imitating the tactics of Thatcher and Gingrich, rather than by a rigorous analysis of the state of the Australian economy, its problems and how to deal with them? The suspicion that this might be so is reinforced when the basis of the estimated increase in the budget deficit is studied. Ninety-three per cent, or $6,345 million, of the estimated deterioration in next year's budget outcome is due to changed forecasts of economic activity and prices; that is, only seven per cent, which is $446 million, of the change in the predicted outcome of next year's budget is due to additional spending decisions made by the Labor government between last August and the election. If the Treasurer's economic forecasts had not been changed, with the resulting reduction in expected revenue and increase in payments to the unemployed, there would still be an estimated surplus next year; that is, the Labor government could only be responsible in an indirect sense for the estimated deterioration in the budget outcomes. The quality of the Treasury's forecasts is crucial. It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the claimed seriousness of the economic slowdown may be exaggerated. Treasury's principal recommendation to every government for the last quarter of a century has been expenditure. This is partly because it is function of all finance officials in all countbudget ries to argue for fiscal caution. This natural tendency is reinforced in the current era monetarist, rational expectations and new classical economic theory. As well, many Treasury officers are infected by the fundathen mentalist ideology which regards most public outlays as a distraction from efficiency enhanare cing benefits of autarchic markets. When Labor was elected in March 1983, the Treasury did not present the incoming government with full briefing books. Rather, enough. the Treasury secretary gave the Treasurerelect only one minute on only one subjectthat is, the alleged explosion in outlays under the previous Fraser government and the centrality of immediately cutting expenditure. They appear to have used an identical tactic with the Howard government, and in fact parallels are very striking. In both cases-and I quote the Brookings Institution survey Australian economy which was published 1982-the Treasury was 'frightening the What bourgeoisie by exaggerating the deficit problem'. This suspicion is compounded when it recalled that another habitual Treasury is to present pessimistic economic forecasts government at the beginning of each budget cycle and then to find, when they are revised - at the conclusion of the budget preparation, that economic and employment growth are likely to be rather better than at first predicted and that the budget outcome is therefore also likely to be a lower deficit or a higher plus. This trick-and it is only a trick, but it is used nearly every year-is normally accepted by treasurers as a means of manipulating cabinet colleagues into larger cuts than would otherwise have happened. In this case in 1996, it is quite clear that the claimed $8 billion deterioration is a fabricated rationale. It depends on an assessment that the estimated economic growth rate in 1996-97 is going to fall and that, therefore, revenue will be lower and that unemployment benefit payments will be higher. In the Treasurer's statement he says that the to cut level of nominal GDP in 1996-97 is now the expected to be 2% per cent lower than the time projection. That really does not make sense. The person who drafted this does by not understand how to write English when they are trying to describe what is happening. If the fall in the growth rate was 2% per cent, that would be minuscule and could not account, in any sense, for the revisions that taking place. But if what is really meant is that the growth rate in 1996-97 was going to be 2% per cent, then that is what it ought to say. That would go some way to accounting for the changes, though not nearly far It is difficult to understand what is being said there but I presume what it means is that the growth rate estimated by the Treasury is expected to be 2% per cent in 1996-97. Of course, that is much lower than the estimates the published at the time of the budget. It is very striking that the parallel institution of the to the Treasury-the Reserve Bank-is in predicting an increase in the growth rate. it says in its April 1996 bulletin is that it expects some acceleration in the economy's growth rate during 1996-97. It estimates that is because business and consumer sentiment tactic have both improved. This is shown quite to clearly. Business investment is picking up and international prospects are improving as well. Growth rates in the United States and Japan-two of our largest trading partnersare improving and the external situation is improving as well. This is argued at great length. If you go through the forecasts you sursee that consumption-retail trade-is rising steadily. Registrations of passenger motor vehicles are going up and consumer sentiment is improving. All this is happening in the first three months of the year before there could be any impact by the new government. Even approvals for home building have started to rise again. Company profits are high and are stable. Capital expenditure by business is rising and business credit is growing strongly. The economy is picking up rather than deteriorating, as the Treasurer presented to the Australian people. It seems highly likely that the estimates that he has tried to justify are simply a manipulation of figures without a sound economic foundation, that revisions will be made after the budget has been prepared which will show that revenue will be higher than expected, unemployment benefit payments will be lower and, all of a sudden, the government will claim that there has been an improvement in the budget deficit due to its own work, which will be completely fallacious because it will simply be due to revisions in the estimates. In any case, is reducing the budget deficit the highest priority or should greater emphasis be given to reducing unemployment or to improving desperately needed health, education and other essential community services? Even if reducing the deficit should have some priority, is cutting outlays the most responsible way to do it? Hairshirtism is far from being the only way that this can be achieved. It is true that by abandoning the accord the coalition government has dispensed with an effective instrument for reducing inflation and interest rates. It is inevitable that inflation and interest rates will, therefore, be a bit higher than they would otherwise be and that, therefore, the scope for employment generating expansionary fiscal policies is reduced. But the severity of the proposed $8 billion cuts and the intensity with which they are occupying the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-to the apparent exclusion of anything other than rhetorical concern about our most serious economic and social problem, which is unemployment-suggests that ideology is the driving force. During the campaign the now government kept on saying that reducing unemployment was its principal goal but it does not say that in the Governor General's speech. There is no commitment to full employment in the Governor General's speech. There is barely a mention of employment growth. There is some reference to the role of labour market reform in creating jobs and a few other changes that are expected to improve the situation, but there is no commitment to maximising the rate of growth of employment, let alone achieving full employment. Cutting programs is counterproductive to employment growth. Even the most conservative commentators in the community recognise that. Westpac's Market Insights reportWestpac is one of the more conservative commercial banks-says: . . . cutbacks in fiscal spending will have a contractionary effect in the short tenn . . . Westpac estimates that the loss of economic growth will be about one-half of one per cent in both 1996-97 and 1997-98. Of course, slower growth increases ).lOemployment in tum, so that the economic cost of the cuts will be slower development, a further cause of increase in the deficit, and the extraordinary damage of higher unemployment. Over the weekend-this has received a lot of publicity today-we had the estimates from Access Economics which concluded that unemployment was likely to rise to nine per cent by the end of this financial year and that there would be relatively little improvement by the end of the decade. Access Economics is, of course, one of the government's principal private economic consultants. Slower growth will reduce imports while it occurs but it is no solution to the structural current account deficit. Cutting outlays may reduce the deficit in the short term but, because average income will also be lower, household saving, which is influenced more by growth of income than by any other factor, will also grow more slowly so that the net impact on saving is quite unclear. Slower growth will certainly reduce inflationary pressure but, if the only instrument for containing inflation is recession, the economy will remain in a slow development vice. It is really a tragedy that the government threw away one of the most effective anti-inflationary instruments available to it when it abandoned the accord, when it abandoned the incomes policy, one of the four anns of economic policy. That left it with the lone weapon of keeping the economy relatively flat. There is competition policy, and I wish them well with that, but keeping the economy flat is a very negative way of containing inflation. No doubt there is considerable support in the electorate for reducing the number of public servants when they are visualised as paper shufflers sitting in Canberra offices. But low. support is eroded when the actual cuts lead to fewer nurses, teachers and police, to fewer technical college and university admissions, to longer waiting times for places in nursing homes and child-care centres, to longer queues at social security and Commonwealth Employment Service offices, to closure of regional taxation and Family Court offices, let alone to reduced funding for the ABC and the arts. The government has launched itself into a very destructive strategy, one that will do great damage to the quality of community services and one which will contribute to keeping unemployment much higher than it would otherwise be. The fundamental issue is the kind of society we want. Do we really want the discredited rampant individualism of Britain in the 1980s with resultant growing inequity and crime, the sordid neglect of public infrastructure, the decline in quality of health and education services-in short, the abandonment of the common good? Or do we want a cooperative society in which there are opportunities for work, education and human support for all when they are needed? If it be the latter, we must acknowledge that ruthless cuts to community services are simply destructive to Australia's well-being.",96
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. N.B. Reid}-Order! Before I call the honourable member for Boothby, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech, and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",99
120,Dr SOUTHCOTT,Unknown,"Boothby) (8.25 p.m.}Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would also like to thank the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for his contribution. I understand he has written a book addressing the topic of full employment, a topic that I will be addressing in my speech, albeit from a different perspective. I first came to Canberra in 1979. I was in shorts, the corridors of the parliament were wooden duckboards and the flags of the city were flying at half mast following the assassination of Mountbatten. Sadly, when I returned to Canberra last week, this time to take my seat in this House, the flags were again flying I would like to take this opportunity to convey my sympathies to all those who have been and still are affected by the tragedy that occurred in Port Arthur: all the families, friends and relatives of the innocent victims, the people of Tasmania and the people of Australia. Boothby's previousÂ· representatives leave big shoes for me to fill: Sir John MCLeay, the longest serving Speaker in this House of Representatives, John MCLeay, a minister in the Fraser government, and Steele Hall, a former South Australian Premier. The last two assisted with my campaign, as did several senators and members, state and federal, past and present. Interestingly, Boothby was one of the first two seats to elect a representative who was not of Anglo-Celtic origin. George Dankel, a butcher who was born in Germany, held the seat for the ALP during the years of World War 1. Given his heritage, it was not surprising that he lost his seat in the Billy Hughes 1917 khaki election. Boothby is fortunate to contain several dynamic institutions, both public and private. Flinders Medical Centre, the second largest hospital in South Australia, contains several centres of excellence in clinical work and research. I should know because until recently I was working in Accident and Emergency there. Celebrating its 30th anniversary, Flinders University is a high profile research institution. It is the first Australian university to offer the four-year postgraduate medical degree. Headed by Professor Judith Sloan, it houses the National Institute for Labour Studies. The economics faculty has also provided key economic and political advisers to Paul Keating, Kim Beazley and Ralph Willis-but do not hold that against the electorate. Whilst I received my degree in medicine from the University of Adelaide, it is at Flinders that I am currently completing a bachelor of economics. At their Tonsley Park plant, Mitsubishi Motors continue to manufacture and assemble quality motor vehicles in the electorate. Boothby also contains a network of components manufacturers to supply this car plant. Export orientated, the local plant recently the right to supply their new model Magnas to every country in the world outside Japan. Bedford Industries, which has recently celebrated 50 years of service, continues to be a national leader in the training, personal development and support of people with disabilities. Another place at which I have spent some time working is the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital, another major institution in the electorate-I can see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) nodding his head-where I worked with veterans of the Second World War and occasionally even with those of the First World War. Three years ago, I went backpacking in Turkey and visited ANZAC Cove. Every day, 20 to 30 Australians, most of them young Australians, would make a pilgrimage to Gallipoli. On the day that I was there, few articulated why it was important to visit but most knew that it was. As we approach the centenary of federation, it is evident that young Australians are still looking for positive role models. Over the 20 months, the most common inquiry I received-I would have received it almost every day-was not regarding Telstra, industrial relations or Medicare but why a doctor would want to be a member of parliament. To me, the frequency of the question highlights the cynicism that Australians have about their elected members and their political institutions. That is especially prevalent amongst young. I was only 15 years old when the HawkeKeating eraÂ· began. My knowledge of Malcolm Fraser's government is by definition second-hand, and that would be typical for my generation. Indeed, not only am I part of a post-Vietnam War generation, I am also almost part of a post-Cold War generation. In the early 1980s, things were very different. The ALP seemed to have a stranglehold on voters aged between 18 and 39. In a sense, the Liberal Party lost a generation through the legacy of the Vietnam War and the events surrounding the dismissal of Whitlam. Today's first-time voters have known only Labor governments. It is clear that for my won generation the Australian Labor Party became the establishment. Over their 13 years in government, the ALP displayed all the traits of a ruling elite: a born-to-rule air with the concomitant possession of the sole right to bestow privilege and a disdain for parliament. It is no wonder that Australians have become cynical about politics and politicians. Having endured 13 years of opposition, the new generation of Liberals knows only too well that there is no such thing as a natural party of government. If there is a born-to-rule generation in Australian politics, it now sits opposite. Drawing on the Westminster tradition, the Australian parliament is ranked sovereign. By being answerable to parliament-that is, to the people of Australia-the potential excesses of executive power are constrained. I am pleased that both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) have declared their intention to restore the parliament's primacy. I think it is fair to say that since the oil shocks and consequent stagflation of the last 1970s, the blot of unemployment, and especially youth unemployment, has become so ingrained in the fabric of Western economies that it would be easy to give up the hope of there ever being a period of full employment again. I, along with my contemporaries, are justifiably incredulous when we are told by those who were born in the immediate aftermath of the war that when they left school not the only did they have the opportunity to explore whatever avenues they wanted but also this exploration would inevitably translate into an actual career. In chronicling the strange collapse of the Keating government, Robert Manne has commented that the voting results of the 2 March election indicate the presence in contemporary Australia of two rather distinct working class political cultures. The first, Manne contends, might be described as the culture of an older, geographically immobile working class whose voting patterns are still rooted in traditional Labor and union soil. second is a younger, socially and geographically more mobile group, more entrepreneurially minded, which has almost altogether shed the Labor and union loyalties of the old manufacturing working class-a group of people who would like to be their own bosses, a group of people who would like to control their own destinies. A story I would like to relate in this vein concerns two young women who lived in my electorate. The two young women were sisters. After beginning their first year of university, they both decided that formal study was not for them. Engaging in a joint venture with a local charity, a charity which, incidentally, assists disadvantaged young kids, the charity provided the stock-that was, recycled clothing-and the sisters took the risk. The agreement was that they should have an equal share of the profit. With start-up capital of only $750, the young women set up shop. After three years they are now the market leaders in recycled clothing. They employ two other people and they are about to open their second shop. Those sisters exhibit the drive of this new entrepreneurially-minded, mobile generation who are desperate to be financially independent and who are desperate to work. A genuine question that one can ask in the wake of the 2 March election is: where is the next generation of ALP supporters going to come from? According to the latest ABS figures, Australian workers continue to desert ""the union movement. More critically for the ALP, trade union membership is lowest amongst young workers. Only 19 per cent of 15to 19-year-olds and less than a quarter of 20to 24-year-olds were in unions last August. Will young ALP members look back in 20 years and reassess the State Bank collapse or the blow-out in foreign debt as a good thing, as what motivated them to join the Labor Party? Are they going to recall the induced recession or the corruption of WA Inc. with the same pride that Chifley and Whitlam are remembered now? The next generation of ALP supporters will have condoned the deficit The legacy of Hawke, Bannon, Cain, Keating and Burke. Last week the Governor General spoke of the government's intention to lift burdens from the small business sector so that it can generate new jobs and that small business will be promoted as the dynamic engine of our economy which can offer new jobs and opportunities. Too much time is spent by small business filling out mindless government surveys. The government will reduce red tape, unnecessary paperwork and regulation identified by a new small business deregulation task force. I do not believe that it is overstating the case to say that the only prospect this post-industrial society has of ever returning to a period of full employment depends on the health of the small business sector. As it is the fastest growing sector of the economy, we need to nurture this growth by deregulating the Labor market and alleviating the tax burden. If one were to look at the figures, one would never even consider the idea of starting a small business. Sixty per cent of small businesses go broke in the first two years of operation, yet small business is responsible for at least 47 per cent of total Australian employment. That is a percentage which is still growing now. Small business is tailor-made for the technological revolution. With its capacity to cut costs and introduce flexibility, small business has grown particularly rapidly. In Boothby, the company Medical Communications Associates makes software whose aim is to keep sufferers from chronic diseases like diabetes out of hospital. The software runs on a penbased computer system designed for use in patients' homes by GPs and district nurses. It was written with translation into Asian languages in mind. From a very small modest office in the electorate, the founders of this company are geared towards exporting their product into Asia. For a long time now I have held the view that the beliefs the Liberal Party holds make it perfectly positioned to foster and encourage all the talented and creative people who are seeking to set up small businesses in what we may call the green sector. The capacity of small business to succeed in niche marketing is undeniable. For example, the exportation of solar technology, aquiculture, clean, green products and food to the rest of the world would provide employment for many of our young people. Similarly, privately run sanctuaries in South Australia have pioneered the successful breeding of the platypus in captivity and are successfully conserving many of our endangered native species. The tradition of the Liberal Party is an organic one. Incorporating a number of traditions upon its formation, the modem Liberal Party continues to develop its identity. The 1980s was a time when the debate over the Deakinite settlement was joined. By the end of the decade, the federation trifecta pillars of wage arbitration were cracking, and the White Australia policy had long been consigned to the dustbin. Internationally, economic liberalism and liberal democracy triumphed over the decaying state-run economies and authoritarian systems of government. While around the world the jury is now in regarding the need for there to be a healthy competitive economy-high levels of protection entrench privilege-the challenge now is to focus on the sort of society that will take Australia into the 21st century. I believe that we should aim for a society which respects and encourages individuals, families and community associations. Policies which promote community and civic duty that work to bind us together are essential to avoid our society descending into an individualistic state . of nature. There are simply some things that I will never accept the state can do as well as families and voluntary organisations in maintaining the social fabric. In closing, I would like to thank the Liberal Party, which gave me the opportunity to represent my local area in federal parliament. I would like to thank my friends and supporters who have backed me at various times over the last 10 years, many of whom are in the gallery tonight. My family could not be here today but I have no doubt they are listening to the parliamentary broadcast now. They helped instil in me many of the values that I hold and which will guide me in representing the electors of Boothby. To my mother, Ann, and father, Lindsay, to Michael and Emmathank you.",99
121,Mr ADAMS,Unknown,"I congratulate the new member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) on a well thought out speech. I thought he spoke about my party with a great deal of depth, but he did not give us too much vision other than cutting taxes for small business and probably cutting wages for small business under the guise of opening up the labour market. Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, I would ask you to pass on to the Speaker and to the Deputy Speakers my congratulations on their elevation to their present positions. I am sure they will preside over this House with great disand tariff protection tinction. It has been a very sorrowful and reflective week in the state of Tasmania. I would like to offer my sincere condolences to all the families touched by the shooting on 28 April. Also, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the emergency service workers and hospital staff in Tasmania for their efforts during the past week. In particular, I would like to commend the work of the volunteer organisations, including the Tasman Volunteer Ambulance Service, the Dunalley Volunteer Ambulance Service and the Tasmanian Ambulance Service, which only this week were recognised at a ceremony by the Governor of Tasmania, Sir Guy Green, who presented certificates of high commendation to these people in these voluntary organisations. Of the 19 injured people at Port Arthur who had to be taken to hospital, 19 of them are alive today. In the case of a number of them, I understand it is only because of the prehospital care and treatment they received from the ambulance officers who were able to administer that sort of care to them. These people should be given that recognition for the work that they did during this tragedy. I spent much of the week in my electorate of Lyons, which includes the Tasman Peninsula. I was also able toÂ· attend the memorial service in Hobart last Wednesday. The feeling as we walked down to the cathedral was a sort of stunned shock. During the service, I was struck by the enormity of the loss felt by the communities of Tasmania. I hope that the service helped our people come to terms with this terrible affair. It was very interesting see, when one reflected within that cathedral, the need that our society has to have a place where people can reflect and endeavour to come to grips with something as bad as this. There is grief and concern in the community and it is going to take Tasmania months, if not years, before that shock subsides and the pain recedes. For the people of the Tasman Peninsula, life will be difficult, but the healing process is already beginning. However, given the recent national and international attention focused upon the shooting at Port Arthur, I am concerned about the implications for tourism in Tasmania. For example, when I spoke to one of the survivors in the hospital, he said that he did not blame Tasmania but he did not feel he could come back. I can understand his feelings-the memory of the horror that he had felt so strongly. I know there are many eyes and ears that are focused upon us DOW. I have received many personal messages of sympathy and support to pass on to the people of the peninsula. But if tourists no longer are prepared to visit, the possibility of some of those busineslatory ses surviving is going to be very slim. Business in Tasmania is certainly not strong at the moment, and those people are going through it and feeling the brunt of this terrible event through no fault of their own. Our prime tourist attraction is going through this great difficulty and, unless we do some.thing quickly to assist them, that difficulty will continue. Locals and staff and relatives of the victims are asking for the demolition of the Broad Arrow Cafe. I believe this should be carried out as soon as possible and a new complex should be developed at an appropriate site. I will be seeking talks with the Tasman council to see how the community can be assisted, and I will ensure that their recommendations are heard here in Canberra. Tasmania's economy is so frail. Many of our country areas like the peninsula are very reliant on tourism, and the recent publicity may threaten tourism in Tasmania. I hope that all Australians will support the healing process in Tasmania by continuing to visit our beautiful island. The generosity of Australian to people is well known, and this generosity can be expressed through visits to Tasmania, including the Tasman Peninsula. I would like to move on to the related issue of gun laws. I think it is certainly time for us to rethink the gun laws that we have in our country, and I was heartened by the outline of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) tonight and, of course, my leader's response to that. When the Labor Party was in government, we tightened the gun laws. Labor sought to have the state and territory governments introduce a national register of firearms as well as uniform gun licensing laws. Federal Labor also passed regulations to ensure that automatic, submachine gun-like and high calibre weapons could not be imported into this country. In the past there has been considerable resistance at the state level. Many of the state governments have expressed concern that their rights are being eroded. What we should be talking about is the rights of people, the safety of individuals and families. That should not depend upon the state in which they live. State borders should not prevent a new reguregime of gun laws which protect all Australians. I hope that the reluctance of state governments is a thing of the past. State and federal governments must accept joint responsibility for the reform. The issue of whether these laws are enacted by the states and territories or the Commonwealth is of secondary importance. Also, it is crucial that both sides of this House continue to support the proposals for uniform gun laws. Throughout this process, there must be discussion with gun owners and their clubs or associations. The ultimate safety of firearm use depends on proper education. The responsibility that comes from being a club member should be seen as an element of safety in gun ownership. It is not the sportsman, the hunter or the farmer that should be blamed or punished in the aftermath of the recent tragedy. These people have an appreciation of the proper use of firearms and have a healthy respect for their danger. The problem seems to be that of unlicensed and irresponsible people getting hold of guns. These people are buying them when they have no right to do so, they are stealing them from unsecured premises, or they are misrepresenting their status in order to procure arms. Sporting clubs can help to ensure that legitimate and careful firearm owners are all acting as firearm monitors. In this way, proposals for reform can acknowledge a constructive role for responsible gun owners and users. But all this does not replace uniform laws and better regulations. I reiterate the call for a national register of firearms. Also, I support the calls for strict, uniform criteria for licensthe ing and the provision of funds for education in this area. I would like to talk about the separate issue of the government's approach to economic management. As stated today-there was some discussion about this in question timeAccess Economics has predicted that the national level of unemployment will rise to over nine per cent. For Tasmania, my home state, this means that the unemployment level will probably be over 11 per cent. This is a major problem, and enormous problems will continue to be caused by Tasmania's limited economic growth. At the same time, I have listened to the new government backbenchers. It was only the last one that I listened to who did not mention that he thought full employment was where this government has heading. I do not think this government is heading towards full employment but, as Access Economics has predicted, it is certainly out to erode employment. The government is talking about sacking thousands of public servants throughout the country. Of course, these sackings and this downsizing of the public sector are going to take place not just here in Canberra but also out in the regions. It is certainly starting to be felt in my region already. The Launceston Examiner today pointed to the inconsistencies between the coalition's commitment to regional Australia during the election campaign and the stark reality of the funding cuts of this government already. In northern Tasmania, regressive action has already been taken to close the tax office. Eight jobs have gone from northern Tasmania. There are proposals to move the Registrar of the Family Court to Hobart and to close the entire Launceston Family Court. The Family Law Practitioners Association has strongly criticised this move, and the proposed closure has been described as an act of discrimination against northern Tasmania. It means that northern Tasmanians and north-western Tasmanians will need to drive to Hobart to lodge their papers in the registry of that court. That could be six to eight hours for round trip. Some of us do not believe that that is just, fair or reasonable. I think people will let this government know their feelings on that. There is also the question of the government's attitude to labour market programs established by the previous administration. The Brotherhood of St Laurence made an assessment of measures set out in the 1994 Working Nation papers. It added weight to the work that Working Nation had done on unemployment. It said: Additional government spending has meant more places in employment programs for long-term unemployed people, and the introduction of case management for these people has opened up new possibilities for their assistance. Of course it had, and it still has. But this new government plans to sack CES workers, which means a loss of opportunity in the case management area. This will affect long-term unemployed people greatly. I have heard members on the other side of the chamber talk about young people who drop out of school and become homeless and unemployed. It is those young people who have benefited greatly from case management. They have had the opportunity to be picked up and managed through the case management system. They haole either found employment or returned to education or training so that they have an opportunity to stay out of the long-term unemployment spiral. Of course, in regional areas this is portance. With the funding cuts in DEET, the government is placing many young people at risk. I certainly hope those backbenchers on that side of the House, as I mentioned, who have been talking about full employment and going back to the days of 30 years ago when they left school and were offered four jobs, et cetera, will see if they can assist some people by getting their government to act on some of these decisions as to where Working Nation or labour market programs are going. They can offer support to many people by funding these programs, but certainly not by cutting back on them. The government failed, I felt, at question time today when it was asked about employment levels and the unemployment level it was going to try to set by, say, the year 2000. It will not produce anything. It will not set itself a benchmark. It will not set itself a standard to be judged by. I think we should. continue to raise this issue with the government. The previous administration constantly set standards for itself to reach-as we had been asking industry and workplaces to do-but, of course, this government is failing to give itself that sort of discipline. No world best practice for this government and no benchmarks on employment. All we have is economic forecasters talking about more unemployment. The government appears to be without direction on the important issue of employment growth and support for the long term unemployed. I do not think a lot of Australians will feel that comfortable or relaxed when they go to bed tonight. I also mention the matter of the importation of Canadian salmon into Australia, which is now before the present government, as it was before the previous government. There are great arguments about why importing salmon could have major effects on parts of Australia, especially on the natural wildlife in Tasmania's strek.,ms and lakes. If there is a split decision on the scientific aspect of importation, the decision should be not to import salmon. If imported salmon were to escape into the waterways, it could be a disaster for the industry and for the wildlife of the state of vital im- involved. (Time expired)",102
122,Mrs BAILEY,Unknown,"The previous speaker, the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), ranged over a number of issues in his speech. I heartily agree with his concern about the Tasmanian tragedy. There is not a member in this place who has not been touched by the tragedy. My electorate of MCEwen has been gravely affected by it. Three people were killed-all from the very small town of Kilmore in central Victoria. I would like to place formally on record my deep sympathy and concern for the families of Kevin and Ray Sharp and Wally Bennett. Mercifully, Garry Broome, while severely injured, was not killed. I send my very best wishes to the family and friends of Garry and Maree Broome. I also place formally on record my congratulations to the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) on being elected as the Speaker of this House and also to the members for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and Scullin (Mr Jenkins) on being elected as Deputy Speakers. As this is the first time. I have addressed this House as the re-elected member for MCEwen, I would like to put on record my thanks and appreciation to all the people who, through their commitment and determination, ensured that the people of MCEwen would be represented by a member of the Howard government. I am deeply conscious of the honour the people of MCEwen have bestowed on me. The people of MCEwen, like others from every corner of this country, decided on 2 March that they could no longer tolerate a government that was so out of touch with the basic necessities affecting their daily lives. They were no longer prepared to tolerate a government whose Prime Minister boasted, 'This is as good as it gets.' As one of my constituents said to me recently, 'Fran, we've become a nation divided into those who have a job and those who haven't.' Those with jobs have never worked harder, but their standard of living is worse now than it was 10 years ago. Those without jobs have become trapped in a cycle of dependence on government for financial assistance and entry into training programs that tragically, in so many cases, lead only to yet another training program, the net result being a further loss of self-confidence and their hopes being dashed by disillusionment. Further, those who were classified as employed included many who could find only a few hours of paid employment per week; many, including thousands of university graduates, who could only find part-time employment in areas commensurate with their training; and many who have been forced to accept employment in service stations or pizza parlours as temporary measures in the hope for better opportunities in the future. If you drive through any small rural town, one of the first things that you will notice is the number of vacant shops where small family businesses previously operated that provided a living for family members, and usually for local residents as well. If you talk to any of the small business operators still trading and to any of the larger industries, they will all tell the same story. In order to survive they have restructured. They have changed their management style and practices. They have become more efficient. They have become more innovative in marketing their product, whether that be a service or raw or value added product. Those who are still trading and providing employment have been just surviving when they should have been thriving. They certainly could see through the sham of the previous government's protestations of the so-called good times of economic growth because they know just how difficult it has been to stay in business. Families know what a struggle it has been to make ends meet. They know the sacrifices that they have made to ensure that their children receive secondary and tertiary education. But, as so many have commented to me, it is a cruel twist when after working so hard to ensure that their children have a better to their career than they had they then have to admit that they had better opportunities than their children currently have. That is the real legacy of the previous government. I vividly recall when I first entered this place in 1990 that the then Governor General outlined the main goals of the previous government as establishing a stronger, more competitive and environmentally sustainable economy and creating a fairer and more compassionate society. What a sham! There are 730,000 unemployed Australians, there has been a 300 per cent increase in Commonwealth debt over four years and an 800 per cent increase in foreign debt over 13 years. So much for a stronger and more competitive economy or a fairer and compassionate society! Those goals were mere words meant to placate-a placebo that became the hallmark of the previous government and was ultimately the main reason for its downfall. People from all walks of life could see that the rhetoric was hollow and insincere. Today we are at long last involved in the process to replace placebo with practical programs of reform and to begin the transformation from inertia to a momentum of opportunity. Our job has been made more difficult because the inertia of the previous government has ceded us a legacy-a budget deficit of $8 billion. However, that will not slow our program or lessen our resolve to reform the labour market in order to begin the transformation to create opportunities. I doubt that there is a member in this place who has not had employers complain that were it not for the unfair dismissal laws they would have hired more people at their workplace. We will replace these unfair dismissal provisions with legislation that ensures fairness to both employer and employee. We will also ensure greater choice and flexibility for our labour market. The days of employers and employees reaching agreement, only to be informed by the union movement that because the union was not party to their discussions there can be no agreement, will be over. We will ensure that there can be a choice as to whether the union is present at negotiations. start There will be no requirement for mandatory attendance by the union, nor will there be compulsory unionism. These measures and the detailed program of reform to assist small business will free so many businesses of the shackles that have restricted their growth and, in tum, prevented the growth in employment opportunities. They will be of particular benefit to our regional industries, many of which individually are small to medium businesses but collectively account for a significant percentage of our GDP. One of these industries will be the horticultural industry, which consists of approximately 35,000 commercial producers employing 80,000 people in fresh production and 11 thousand employees in processing production. This industry is now our second most valuable agricultural industry, only just behind beef industry. This industry has grown because the growers have been prepared to invest in research and development to produce new varieties, because of the increased investment in technology and packaging and because of a commitment to export together with international competitive practices. While the industry has made remarkable progress in changing its marketing strategies and responding to the changing consumer patterns while developing this competitive export culture, the industry growth has been impeded because of the increase in the costs of production, especially in the key areas of labour, packaging and transport. This has meant that profit margins in recent years have been slim, resulting in the industry being less able to invest in new technology-new teChnology that would improve the quality of crops. Tight profit margins have meant reduced capital available to growers to expand their operations to achieve greater economies of scale. While important inroads have been made into the export market, the industry has not been as successful as it could be in replacing the increasing level of imported fresh and frozen produce. It is hard to believe that a country such as ours with the natural advantages of such a clean environment, the right climatic conditions, an available work force and access to the latest technology could import fresh and processed fruit and vegetables, but in the financial year of 1993-94 we actually impon.::d $267 million worth of such produce. Mr Brian Carroll at the horticulture Outlook Conference 1996 estimated that if we could achieve a 25 per cent reduction in total imports this would result in an improvement of at least $67 million in our national balance of payments and an equivalent injection of funds to the local industry with all the flowon benefits in employment and investment. This industry will get the opportunity to reduce its costs of production because of the practical program of reform this government will be implementing. In this way, those in the industry will be able to compete in a more competitive manner. We will certainly be our encouraging the industry to target import replacements as well as increase their share of the export market. Another of the challenges facing the industry today is coordinating marketing, qUality control and production levels because of the diversity of the industry. I have taken the initiative in this regard and established three regional committees where all industries throughout the 14- thousand square kilometres of my electorate of MCEwen will be represented. Often it is a communication problem that prevents regional industry representatives from learning of both industry and government developments. These committees will serve a dual purpose of acting as a conduit of information and a basis for regional alliances, much needed not just for the horticultural industry but for other regional industries as well. As consumers become better educated and more sophisticated in their appreciation of different cuisines, there is a growing demand not only for a wider variety of freshly grown products but also for quality assurance and food safety. The potential exists for food to be safer now than ever before. Sophisticated methods of detection, advanced quality control methods and innovative packaging techniques keep food safe longer. However, the use of food additives, pesticides and chemicals and the presence of naturally occurring toxins and micro-organisms in food cause consumers to be concerned. Also, increasingly stricter regulations in other countries mean control of food safety is not just good practice but essential. I believe it is an absolute disgrace that 13 years those sitting opposite could not find the will to implement comprehensive, accurate labelling legislation that included nutritional information and truthful country of origin. It is also an indictment of the previous government that, with consumers both here in our domestic market and overseas demanding produce grown in a clean and green environment, a comprehensive marketing program promoting our home grown products as the ultimate in clean cuisine has not been developed.. Here we are situated on the rim of Asia, the fastest growing market with an estimated demand for fresh produce by the year 2000 of some several billion dollars, and our produce, grown in one of the cleanest, if not the cleanest, environments, has not been aggres,: sively marketed into the Asia-Pacific region. This government will not be complacent. We will take every advantage to create opportunity for future growth and employment and will ensure that our labelling protects the integrity of our products. There is hardly an industry in this country that has not suffered because the previous government paid lip-service to real structural reform and broke promises by increasing taxes to the disadvantage of industries. The wine industry was just one of those industries affected. The ramifications of those tax increases are still being felt today. Mr Ray King, chief executive of Mildara Blass, paints a gloomy picture of the future of the Australian wine industry. He bases his argument on the fact that the wine industry in general is providing such a poor return on investment-around eight to nine per cent, compared with 14 to 15 per cent for other industries-that he claims future growth is in doubt. Mr King argues that, unless the wine industry can generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to fund around 75 per cent of its future investment requirements, the other major issues facing the industry, the issues of grape supply and the overseas franchise for Australian wine, become largely academic. It is clear that the wine industry has a lower average return on investment than other industries and it will therefore have more after difficulty in funding future growth. Mr King argues that the potential for the Australian wine industry, which currently accounts for only 2.7 per cent of the value of the world wine industry, to play a greater role in the international market could be at risk. Why does our wine industry have such a slim profit margin? The answer lies partly in the fact that the wine industry is such a capital intensive industry. However, it has been estimated that this industry needs to generate between two and 2Y2 times the retained earnings of other manufacturers in order to fund the same sales growth. Given all these factors, this is the industry that the previous government targeted for tax increases. Mr King argues that, if only one-third of the taxes imposed on the industry since 1984 had been implemented by the industry in the form of price increases, we would have today a financially strong wine industry capable of strong future growth. Once again this government can assist this industry by providing relief in production costs through our program of reform. This in tum will assist greater employment in this industry and others. In looking at industry, its growth potential and employment prospects under the Howard government, I would like to bring to the attention of the House a relatively new industry but a real growth industry in MCEwen, and that is aquiculture. The value of our national aquiculture industry is growing strongly. Since 1985 the gross value of production has increased from $49 million to $303 million in 1993-94, with a large quantity of our aquiculture products sold overseas. In 1993-94 aquiculture production was about 20 per cent of Australia's total fisheries and seafood products by value. Overall, the amount of wild fish being caught has not increased in recent years but more people are wanting to eat seafood. Many people, particularly those in the Asia-Pacific region, consider seafood an essential part of their diet. Australia's aquiculture industry has become an important supplier of seafood to both the Australian and overseas markets. We in this country, especially the suppliers in MCEwen, have a distinct advantage in that our aquatic environments are clean and a variety of species can be fanned. Aquiculture can also help us learn about our fish and seafood and may, in the future, help us rebuild some of our wild fish stock. Once again, if this industry is able to reduce its production costs there is a tremendous potential for growth and employment. It is only through a commitment to implement these practical measures of reform that we can hope to improve our standards of living and to reduce that ever widening gap between rich and poor that has become institutionalised under Labor. It is only by being prepared to make effective change that we can open up opportunities for prosperity and achievement, and restore hope and certainty for the future.",105
123,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"This debate on the address-in-reply to the Governor General's speech has presented many members with the opportunity of making their first speech. In preparing for this new parliament I have reflected on some of the sentiments and issues that I raised in my first speech. In that speech I concluded with a quotation from the former Labor Prime Minister James Henry Scullin, words that have been inscribed on his memorial at the Carlton cemetery. They read: Justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong. In this, my first speech as a member of the opposition party, I want to begin by iterating those sentiments. Since the election, the government may have changed but the issues have not. On 2 March, against the national trend, there was a negligible swing against Labor in the electorate of Scullin. The voters of Scullin voted overwhelmingly for a continuation of policies that have produced economic growth and job creation-policies of the previous Labor government. They voted for policies that saw the rate of employment in the CES areas covering my electorate fall from 14.4 per cent in April 1993 to 8.1 per cent in October 1995, a rate which, while still unacceptable, was tracking in the right direction. Although the Labor government pursued an agenda of economic reform, there was an attempt-I have to admit, not always as successful as it should have been-to moderate the impact of change on the community. There was a commitment to a comprehensive social safety net. There was a commitment to equal opportunity in education and training and to universal access to health care. There was a commitment to a fair industrial relations system that protected the wages and conditions of working people. There was a belief in the role of government in the marketplace, providing infrastructure, incentives and preparing a skilled labour fcrce. There was a commitment to doing the things that the private sector traditionally has been unwilling or unable to do. The government has no mandate to change these things; in fact, quite the reverse. In this speech I want to focus on the role of government in planning, infrastructure provision and facilitating regional economic development. This is one amongst many things that must not be sacrificed for ideological reasons. In my first speech I noted that often the economic value of the provision of infrastructure is completely overlooked. The north of Melbourne is on the brink of a major economic boost from the effects of the western ring road. In April 1994 I had the privilege of representing the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), in speaking at the opening of the Greensborough to Bundoora section of that road. At the time, I said: Roads have no value unless they are used; unless they relieve traffic congestion on local roads and provide a service to industry leading to greater economic activity. Already the Greensborough-Bundoora section carries 18,000 vehicles a day and increases interstate access for a wide range of tradeexposed industries in the north-eastern suburbs. As further sections of the western ring road are opened, the benefits will be multiplied. As one commentator, a former Carlton footballer, Ted Hopkins, noted in a commentary piece in the Herald Sun: The soon to be opened Western Ring Road ... will re-align Melbourne's urban development pattern. It is a federally funded infrastructure project that does not require toll payments. It will distribute traffic far more effectively and with greater productive purpose than the city link which funnels between 25 and 30 per cent of all its traffic past the front door of the Crown Casino. The local regional economic development organisation, New Edge, receives federal funding and represents the area of northern Melbourne and north of Melbourne, a region which encompasses nine municipalities: the metropolitan municipalities of Moreland, Darebin, Banyule, Whittle sea and Hume, and the more rural municipalities of Macedon Ranges, Mitchell, Mount Alexander and right through to Bendigo. New Edge has applied for funding to examine the advantages of building a freight handling centre near Melbourne airport, taking advantage of the proximity of the western ring road and the Hume and Calder highways. I support this application and hope that it is not sacrificed in the government's ideologically driven spending cuts. The provision of public infrastructure and of measures such as the regional headquarters incentives outlined in Working Nation is the only method of preparing the ground for private sector investment. The member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), in her speech just completed, talked of the many horticultural and agricultural industries in her region that have great potential for our export drive. But one of the things that we need to coordinate in maximising the potential of those types of industries is the way in which freight for forwarding overseas is handled. The New Edge proposal goes directly to this, and sees that there needs to be cold storage facilities, for instance, for the onforwarding of horticultural and meat products-many of the products that are processed in the local region. So it is through planning by a regional economic development organisation such as New Edge and through cooperation with governments at all spheres-local, state and federal-that these things can be put in place. As I mentioned, another of the incentives that the previous Labor government had was the regional headquarters incentives scheme. In March 1995, for example, the Michigan based Venture Corporation acquired Ford's plastic operations in Broadmeadows. In August of last year it announced that it would be establishing its Asia-Pacific regional headquarters in Melbourne. At the time of that announcement, the then Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), indicated that the tax incentives under the regional headquarters incentives scheme would apply to the proposal being put forward by Venture. Venture acknowledged that those types of conditions enabled it to look closely at establishing its headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region in Melbourne. The then Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, announced at the time that this regional headquarters included 'a world-class advanced engineering centre and injection moulding and manufacturing capability'. He predicted that the investment would be worth about $165 million and would mean 1,400 new jobs. It is hoped that Venture seeks to establish its regional headquarters close to the Broadmeadows plant in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, thereby taking advantage of the close proximity of the three major highways, Melbourne airport and the world-class research and development facilities at RMIT, Bundoora, La Trobe University, Bundoora"", and also the activities at the Epping, Greensborough and Broadmeadows TAFE campuses of the northern metro T AFE. Adjacent to the western ring road, which I mentioned earlier, is the Janefield development. The Janefield development is a building better cities project. As I have said in the past, Janefield offers an important opportunity to establish a well-planned and resourced housing and/or economic development. Janefield is excess institutional land no longer required by Community Services Victoria. It is a greenfield site that gives the opportunity for a wide variety of uses-uses that, as I have said in this place before, require the cooperation of not only the three spheres of government but also community, business, and the local education and training facilities. It would be a tragedy if this Janefield project suffered as a result of the government's ideological opposition to government involvement in the marketplace. As I understand it, with a lack of commitment to the building better cities program by the present government the J anefield development, under whatever guise it is to go under, is in jeopardy. Whether it be a total residential housing development or, as is now being discussed, a combination of economic activities, employment creating activities and a residential area, lanefield's not going ahead would be a crying shame to not only the local area but also the wider northern suburbs region. It is clear that in the present government there are some, unfortunately a minority, who recognise the role of government in active industry policy. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has already admitted that the coalition's plans to abolish tariff concessions on business inputs was dreadful policy. A former Liberal minister, Michael MACKellar, was reported in the Financial Review of 12 April as saying that 'the ad hoc and ill-considered decision to abolish TCS flies in the face of over a decade of progress in micro-economic reform and trade reform designed to reduce costs of doing business and making Australia more internationally competitive'. There have been some suggestions that up to 16 per cent would be cut from the programs of Minister Moore's department and that he has had pro-active policies rejected out of hand by the government's ideological gatekeeper, the Treasurer (Mr Costello). It has been reported that the government will abolish the export market development grants scheme, a scheme which overwhelmingly assists small business. Where do we tum for this often cried out for support of small business? Many in this debate have said that the Governor General's address was unexceptional. It is hardly an inspiring blueprint for what the government hopes to achieve. Many of the suggestions, whilst laudable, are already in place and changing their guise would be tinkering at the edges. It would be wrong to believe that they will be any more or less successful for this. For instance, there is the suggestion for the pilot regional and community employment councils. The Governor General's speech stated that these: ... will bring together business leaders, education and training providers and representatives of the wider community to more effectively link training of unemployed people with real jobs and with regional development plans. In my local area, under Minister Crean, the former government put in place the area consultative committees of DEET with membership which was very similar to, if not exactly the same as, that in this proposal. The directions were exactly the same. We went even further because we said that the federal government had a leading role in being in there and encouraging the various regions of Australia to develop regional development plans. I know that my two colleagues at the table, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson)-he is in a neighbouring electorate and knows of the work that is being done in the northern suburbs of Melbourneand the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), because of his active interest in what is happening in the Corio region based on Geelong, know the importance in local regional development planning of cooperative efforts by all spheres of government, including the federal government. The local regional economic development organisation that covers the majority of my electorate, New Edge-Melbourne's Northern Economic Wedge-have put together a raft of proposals that, if encouraged and supported, will lead to a great deal of economic activity and employment creation. They simply see as their economic objectives things like generating more exports of goods and services from the region; developing import replacements that support the efforts of suppliers and exporters and reduce dependence on imports from outside the region; taking the strengths of the region so that there could be a greater degree of self-containment of the efforts of those that are working; increasing local investment in local employment development; and supporting valuable infrastructure development which supports the achievements of those goals. They have identified the strengths of the region. The region is strong in transport and communication; it is the prime transport hub. The western ring road will link the international airport with the wharves. It wi11link the vast industrial areas of the north and western suburbs of Melbourne with those important transport hubs. The inclusion of Bendigo as another regional centre within the wedge is also important. The other strength of the region that they have identified is in the area of research and development, because of the range of educational institutions that have a clear role in enhancing the international competitiveness of the work force of the region. These institutions include Latrobe, RMIT, VUT and others. There is also the need, amongst the commercial industrial development, to increase the region's capacity to attract and retain developthe ments because of attention to environmental and amenity enhancement initiatives. Ted Hopkins in his article about the western ring road said that, especially in the case of the western suburbs of Melbourne, people have seen it as a bleak landscape, a place where we have merely dumped industrial activity. But he indicates that the types of industrial develvery opments that are being created in the western suburbs depend a lot on making sure that the environmental activity and the effect on the environment of those activities is minimised. In fact, he cites examples of the way in which those industries that have set up their headquarters in the western suburbs have been involved with the community in the repairing and the restoration of the environment. There is also potential for tourism development through environmental recreation and heritage assets of the region. These are areas that we have to look at in a coordinated way. I am not saying that it is something that the federal government should be doing by itself but the federal government should not run away from these proposals. It should be involved. It should put together national policies and be involved with the local community and with the various other spheres of government in ensuring that projects like the ones that I have mentioned have the ability not only to be planned properly, but to be put in place properly. It is in some mystical way that we have developing in the early months of this government a belief that by the federal government walking away or handing across responsibilities to other spheres of government it is working in the national interest. But we are having increasing examples where there is a recognition by the government that there is a need to continue to give a national direction in a whole host of areas. I believe it would serve the government better if it were to take that as its attitude to the wider raft of policy areas. As Australia approaches the centenary of federation, it is a nonsense to be handing back powers to the states-the states being based on colonial boundaries from late last century that are irrelevant to a modem Australia--on basis of a constitution that has its values back in the last decade of last century. We need to produce a more modem approach to the way in which we see Australia as a sovereign nation looking at the way it can work in the best interests of all.",109
124,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"I am pleased to rise in the parliament tonight to support the motion so ably moved by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) and seconded by the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough). I am certain that these two new honourable members will make a very effective contribution during the years they are in this place, and what is more their contributions will be enduring. I know the honourable member for Longman particularly well because in the recent redistribution some 22,000 voters previously in the electorate of Fisher were incorporated in the division of Longman. That was a very fine inheritance for my colleague to receive and, when one looks at the very handsome majority he obtained on polling day, it is obvious he built very well on that fine inheritance. I would like to congratulate Mr Speaker, Mr Deputy Speaker and Mr Second Deputy Speaker on their respective elections to very high offices in this place. I think there is a broad acceptance in the Australian community that the parliament has not operated as it should, that the parliament has not been held in the high esteem that the parliament of Australia should be held in the minds of the people of Australia. I believe that the election of Mr Speaker Halverson, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl and the return of Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins will ensure that the disrepute into which this place has fallen will be reversed. I have been particularly impressed over the last week with the way behaviour in the chamber has improved. The way in which Mr Speaker looks wearing the robes of office sets that high office apart from other members. I believe his independence, his fairness, his integrity and good humour will ensure that the House of Representatives, at the end of this term of office, will be well respected in the minds of the Australian people. History will recall that on 2 March this year the coalition achieved a massive swing resulting in 94 seats for the coalition in this 49 for the Labor Party and five Independents, to make a total of 148 members of the House of Representatives. Right throughout Queensland the result was very heartening as well. The Liberal Party won 10 new seats. We have gained the honourable member for Longman, the honourable member for Forde (Mrs Elson), the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), the honourable member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall), the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Grace)all of whom will make a magnificent contribution. This indicates that the Liberal Party in Queensland, along with our National Party colleagues, have assisted substantially the coalition in obtaining such a massive majority in the election on 2 March. We also now have four ministerial colleagues from the Liberal Party in Queensland and one from the National Party. I am very pleased to see the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr JUll) at the table. I know that he has played a tremendous role in the parliament during the time that he has been here, as has the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). The electorate of Fisher is one of the fastest growing electorates in Australia. It now contains more than 9,000 square kilometres of south-east Queensland. It is one of the most beautiful parts of the country, and it is highly productive. It is understandable the way that people continue to move from the rust belt areas of southern Australia to the sun belt, to places like the electorate of Fisher. The electorate now includes all of the city of Caloundra, the shire of Kilcoy, the shire of Nanango and parts of the shires of Caboolture, Esk and Rosalie. The redistribution commissioners were kind enough to give to the electorate of Fisher most of Maroochydore, Alexandra Headland and Mooloolaba in place, the shire of Maroochy and-I suppose much to your regret, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss-the shire of Kingaroy in its entirety was returned to the electorate of Fisher from the electorate of Wide Bay. In Fisher, personally I was heartened by the very strong support. The Liberal Party received a swing of about 12 per cent on primary votes and a swing of the same figure on a two-party preferred basis to give me as the member about 70.4 per cent of the vote. As one walks down the streets in the electorate of Fisher, it is rather nice to know that seven out of every 10 people voted for us and only three voted for the other side. Today, as we all know, is Labour Day. It was interesting to read in the Sunshine Coast Daily newspaper recently that no celebrations are taking place at all on the Sunshine Coast to commemorate Labour Day. They have not been able to whip up enough enthusiasm to celebrate Labour Day on the coast since 1991. I suppose one could hardly blame the true believers, such as they are on the Sunshine Coast, for not being terribly enthusiastic. After all, they, like the rest of the country, have suffered greatly from the number of years that we have had of state and federal Labor governments. The election was not a particularly easy election in Fisher, as we had the only threecornered contest in Queensland involving a sitting coalition member, but, fortunately on the day, the result was what we in the Liberal Party certainly hoped for and certainly worked very hard for. While we received strong backing throughout the electorate of Fisher, we were particularly pleased to win the South Burnett area, of which the Kingaroy shire is a very major part. The Kingaroy shire itself was particularly supportive. It was interesting to see that our first preference votes across the Kingaroy shire were up at various booths by as much as 42.6 per cent. In fact, the Liberal Party vote increased at one booth at least 13 times on what it was previously-that is, by 1,300 per cent. I was very humbled by that particular result. It is interesting that many people marched into the polling booths in the electorate of Fisher to vote Liberal for the first Mr O'Connor-They get two bob each way with you.",112
125,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member opposite for saying that I am such an effective representative of the people of Fisher. Certainly it was humbling to receive such resounding support, and I intend to repay that trust over the next three years as an effective member of the government party. I would like to thank my wife, Lyn, and my children, Nicholas and Alexandra, for the role that they played during the election campaign. My campaign director, Dr Don Walker, and so many other members played a magnificent part. I would also like to thank the Liberal Party branches at Caloundra, Kawana Mooloolaba, Glasshouse Country, Maleny and Maroochy Alexandra Headland. It was a magnificent team effort, and I give them my thanks. However, now that all the dust has settled and we have this massive majority, we find that the coalition is confronted by the threats from the Senate, that in some way the upper house might seek to frustrate the mandate given to us by the Australian people. Of course, we read in the newspapers about how Senator Kernot and the Democrats might seek to deny the Australian people the expenditure of $1 billion on our environmental package through their thwarting of our attempts to dilute the public ownership of Telstra. We also find that, now that a prospective budget deficit of some $8 billion has been left to us by the opposition, we have to pull in the belt. Of course, we find that members opposite do not hesitate to criticise us as well. We also find that our wonderful industrial relations package, which seeks to create a situation where people receive higher wages for higher productivity, is also being threatened by those opposite. Our policy ensures that we have guaranteed minimum standards. We seek to create genuine cooperation between employer and employee. We seek to return genuine choice to the workplace. We seek to have more opportunities for workplace responsibilities and for local decision making. We certainly make no time. apology for the fact that we intend to ban compulsory unionism. I believe that ours is a reasonable and moderate policy which will guarantee a better future for all Australians. Members opposite have conceded that more of the blue-collar vote favoured the coalition on 2 March than supported the former government, which traditionally had the blue-collar vote. I would like to take this opportunity to put on the record once again some facts about the proposed sale of one-third of Telstra. The first thing is that only one-third of Telstra is proposed to be sold, and only one-third of that one-third could ever be owned by overseas interests. The coalition has guaranteed that Telstra will be forever owned, in a majority sense, by the people of Australia. What we are doing is giving the mums and dads of Australia the opportunity to buy into a very successful Australian company. We also, of course, will enshrine in legislation the community service obligations and the crosssubsidisation to ensure that those people in the electorate of Fisher, the rural areas of our electorate and, indeed, other parts of rural Australia receive a quality telecommunications service. It does not make any difference at all to the people of country Australia who owns Telstra. What is important is the quality of the job that it does. Most importantly, our proposed sale of one-third of Telstra will bring in $8 billion. We will use $7 billion of that to retire debt. When we pay off debt, interest rates will be kept down, and that will assist small business in a very substantial way. We all know that if we could create the environment where every small business in Australia could put on just one extra person, then unemployment would disappear overnight. Yet those on the opposition side in the other place are going to try to deny us the right to sell one-third of Telstra. They are going to seek to deny the small businesses of Australia lower interest rates. They are going to deny the benefits that would occur as a result of the retirement of that $7 billion of debt. I have mentioned before that we are going to spend $1 billion on our environmental future. What we are doing with respect to the $8 billion is using $7 billion to retire debt. The other $1 billion is not used for current expenditure, but it is used as an investment in our environmental future, an investment in the children and grandchildren of those people in the House today. It is most important that those opposite appreciate that the package we have introduced to the parliament is a package. We are not going to allow it to be picked off bit by bit. If those people opposite choose to vote against our environmental package, they will be voting against a national vegetation initiative which will tackle Australia's land and water degradation problems. They will be voting against the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin through the implementation of the Murray-Darling 2001 project. They will be voting against the undertaking of a national land and water resources audit. They will be voting against the implementation of a comprehensive national reserve system to protect Australia's biodiversity. They will be voting against the coast and clean seas initiative to tackle the pollution problems in our coastal areas. As a member representing a coastal electorate, I believe this coast and clean seas initiait tive is one of the most important elements of the policy that we took to the Australian people. Everyone agrees that we have a mandate. Mr O'Connor-Why didn't they vote for it in the Senate?",114
126,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"If those opposite respect democracy, then what you should do is support our program, SUppOit the legislation. that we are introducing into this place. You should also induce your colleagues in the other place to vote for our legislation to, firstly, respect our mandate and, secondly, to make sure that the very many positive benefits which will flow to the Australian community will in fact occur. I am a very strong supporter of our Australian flag. Our Australian flag represents our nation's Christian heritage. It represents our federal system of government and also our geographic position in the world. Wherever I go around the electorate of Fisher, everyone supports the Australian flag. In fact, over the last three years I was privileged to hand out more than 400 Australian flags to community organisations, schools, churches and other groups. The message that is coming through to me is that the Australian flag is very much the property of the Australian people and not the plaything of politicians. I, like you, was absolutely disgusted when I saw the former Prime Minister go abroad and criticise our Australian flag. The former Prime Minister refused to put the Australian flag on the prime ministerial car. That was why all of us here were heartened when the current Prime Minister, John Howard, who will be one of the greatest leaders this nation has ever seen, not only replaced the Australian flag on the prime ministerial car but also on ANZAC Day announced that we would introduce into the parliament an amendment to the Flags Act to ensure that the Australian flag can never be changed without a referendum of the Australian people. The new government has indicated its strong support for this vital national symbol and has reinforced the truth-that our Australian flag does not belong to politicians and it does not belong to the former Prime Minister; belongs very much to the Australian people. I tum to a matter or two which concern the electorate of Fisher and the Sunshine Coast, and I suppose Queensland generally. Tomorrow the Queensland education minister will be travelling to Canberra to see his federal counterpart in his endeavours to safeguard the 2,450 extra places promised to universities in Queensland for 1997 and 1998. The problem of the extra places being placed in some doubt has been created by the former government. The Beazley $8 billion hole has meant that, over two years, we must pull our belts in collectively as a nation to make sure that we have responsible economic managementmanagement which was not, of course, displayed during the 13 years of Labor government. The Labor government for years ignored our right to additional places. There are universities in the southern states which cannot fill places. Yet in the Sunshine Queensland-over the last 12 months we had 6,000 qualified people who were not offered university places. Belatedly, with an election around the comer, with a lot of marginal seats in Queensland, the former government said that they would provide 2,450 extra places. was too little too late. Of course, they made the offer right at the very last minute. The Labor government left us with an $8 billion hole to plug and I will certainly be making representations to the minister to try to make a week ago. sure, if places have to be taken away from universities, that those places are taken away from where they should not have been in the first place. Those places should be taken away from universities in southern states which too long have had additional places at the expense of universities in Queensland. Only a matter of a week or two ago, I represented the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) at the official opening by Her Excellency the Governor of Queensland of the Sunshine Coast University College. I must say that is an absolutely magnificent institution. It has been promised a number of new places. I gave it a guarantee that I was happy to camp at the minister's door to do whatever I could to make sure that the 200 extra places promised to the Sunshine Coast University College were, in fact, delivered. As soon as I said that, the Vice-Chancellor said he was going to buy me a tent. I will certainly be approaching the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs over the next couple of days because these 200 extra places are very much required-they are needed and overdue. If we, as a parliament, are all about equity and fairness, then we will guarantee Queensland the extra 2,450 places that it is entitled to. Even the Labor government belatedly admitted that we should allocate these 200 places to the Sunshine Coast University College. I am heartened that the coalition has hammered together a very effective plan with respect to gun control laws. In a statement to the parliament today the Prime Minister mentioned that he would be seeking, at the Statepolice ministers conference next Friday, effective uniform legislation on all weapons, a total ban on all automatic and semi-automatic weapons, a six-month amnesty period and full compensation upon reacqustiion of newly banned weapons. As he pointed out, It the proposed changes will not be universally popular but he said it is necessary, as a community, as a society, that we make an appropriate and measured response to the massacre which occurred in Tasmania about I accept that most people who have these weapons in Queensland and elsewhere are law abiding, but the simple fact of the matter is that 35 people lost their lives at Port Arthur for just over a week ago. There is community outrage and an expectation that, as representatives of the people, we will bring forward an effective package which will ensure that such a tragedy cannot occur again. I was heartened by the support that the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, the Labor Party gave this proposal. The Prime Minister and the Attorney General (Mr Williams) will be taking this proposition to the meeting of police ministers next Friday. It will be supported by all of us here and by all of the people there. The indications we have from the media are that most state governments will support it as well. We now have the opportunity to make changes to gun laws, which will make sure that the tragedy which occurred in Tasmania does not occur again. This is an historic opportunity for the Howard government. The Howard government has a massive majority. It has a massive mandate. It has a wonderful policy. I believe that this government will be recorded by history as one of the greatest governments this nation has ever had. It will be the government which has turned Australia around, the government which will ensure that our children and grandchildren will have a great future.",115
127,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"I am cognisant of the fact that the next member to speak is a new member and has family here this evening. In the interests of a cooperative approach to parliamentary proceedings I have agreed, albeit reluctantly, to curtail m)' address to 15 minutes. I will be stopping rather shorter than I had hoped on this topic-a topic which I think is very important. But in the interests of the new member's family commitments I am certainly willing to do so. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, congratulations on your election. Please convey my congratulations to the Speaker. It is my pleasure this evening, having been re-elected to the seat of Fremantle, to raise an issue that I know is of great concern not only to my constituents but to a great many Australians: the issue of uranium mining, particularly as it affects Kakadu National Park. It is very unfortunate indeed that one of the first acts of the government has been to threaten to extend uranium mining in Australiaprovocatively, in a world heritage listed area. It is obvious that it is certain to excite very strong opposition not just from those activists who have consistently and vigorously opposed any Australian involvement in the nuclear cycle but also-I think most importantlyfrom the wider community. The majority of Australians do not want any extension of uranium mining and they certainly do not want it to occur in Kakadu National Park. The evidence suggests that Australians are now vehemently opposed to any extension of uranium mining, to the processing of uranium or to the generation of nuclear power in Australia. It is interesting that the government, while it says it is happy to extend the number of uraniutb mines, is ruling out the possibility of further processing or nuclear power generation, because they do at least understand in those latter two cases that the community is opposed. I indicate to the government that they are opposed to mining as well, just as they have been and will continue to be opposed to the development, testing and deployment of nuclear weapons. It is the height of hypocrisy that the government, when in opposition, made considerable fuss over the testing in the Pacific that the French were undertaking at Mururoasomething they had not previously done. Yet now they are proposing to start mining and processing uranium on a much larger scale. In my view, proposing new mines in our premier world heritage area, Kakadu, is a calculated insult to community opinion and it gives new meaning to the label 'arrogant'. The coalition does not appear to understand that a great deal has changed since the last substantial debate on the merits or otherwise of further exploitation of uranium in Australia. The international climate, for one thing, has changed. We have seen the tragedy of Chernobyl, and the problem of disposing of wastes from nuclear powered Soviet submarines now lying mouldering in the Arctic seas. We know that there is a serious prospect of the illegal sale of uranium from the disintegrating economies of the old eastern European regimes. We have also seen a proliferation of technologies and information to regimes and individuals who are indeed careless of world security. There have been changes to our local perspectives. There is a much more informed debate on environmental issues than there was 15 years ago and there is much stronger opposition to nuclear testing in the Pacific and the associated risks. We now have a community not prepared to endorse the proposals that the government is putting forward. I want to take the opportunity today-as I have the honour of being responsible, as a shadow minister, for the environment-to reiterate my party's opposition to any extension of uranium mining in Australia. It is a position that is based and has been based on a very careful assessment of the effects of radioactivity on humans and on the environment generally. Our policy document states: The hazards and risks of unique severity and unprecedented scale are what we have been concemed about and they occur at each stage of the uranium fuel cycle. The first concern is about the threat to human health and local environments of the mining and processing of uranium. I think people have become very complacent about those risks. But we have very recent examples. The worse known has emerged from the opening up of East Gennany to the outside world. Records which came to light in 1989 indicate that at least 20,000 miners had either died or were suffering from lung disease as of that date. It was thought that 15,000 or so cases were of silicosis and about 6,000 of lung cancer. There were nightmare conditions in the mines south of Leipzig, which resulted from the post-war USSR race to match the west in nuclear weaponry. It might be said that this is all a problem in eastern Europe but it was certainly generated by the Cold War. There are examples in Australia, too. Although we now have much more stringent controls on uranium mining, nonetheless, in the period 1952 to 1961 in South Australia there were significant problems. There has been a recent study following up on the health of workers identified from mine records and having a reasonable idea of radon exposure from monitoring histories. The researchers in this case found that there was a threefold increase in the risk for lung cancer involved with underground mining at Radium Hill. I might say that there would be similar risks associated with the Koongarra mine, were it to go ahead on an underground basis, or, indeed, Jabiluka, although I am the first to acknowledge that there are now significant changes in standards and safety requirements. Major improvements have taken place in Australia and in most world uranium mines from about 1960 in line with increasingly tough limits that have been imposed internationally on worker radiation exposure. This has not always necessarily happened with the agreement of industry; it has frequently been - forced upon them. At the moment, for instance, there is debate about the new standard known as ICRP60, recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council. It has been accepted as the new standard and is now being adopted by the Olympic Dam mine, a Roxby Downs operation. It operates under agreement which binds the company to ICRP60. As far as we can tell, maximum exposure of Ranger uranium miners, as reported by the Office of the Supervising Scientist each year in its annual report, approaches this new limit, but at the moment does not appear to exceed it. The worry to me, however, particularly given the fact that the new proposal comes from ERA, is that the former director of ERA, Richard Knight, in a report in Nuclear News, said that ICRP60 was not something that could be complied with. I am worried that if that is the attitude ahead of the development of that mine, we are going to get resistance from ERA to these new standards, and that is cause for alarm. In addition to those risks that are associated with mining, there are incidents which occur from time to time, even with the tougher standards which we have implemented in Australia. I am referring to accidents such as - that which occurred in Ranger in 1982, when two workers were knocked over by a spillage of yellowcake. There was significant exposure. The greatest risk from mining is not so much from poor standards, which we have managed to avoid in Australia, but from tailings dams, which overflow from time to time and have been found to collapse at various times and which certainly can erode or leak over their long required life. The problems are not so much with radioactive substances in a carefully managed mine but more with acidic leaching of heavy metals, which can create substantial problems for the environment. My party's argument is also based on an assessment of the use of technologies and the generation and circulation of products within the nuclear industry which are usable as the raw materials-both the physical materials and the skills--of nuclear weapons manufacture. Many argue that there is a threat in some nations from the potential progression from nuclear power to nuclear weapons not only through diverting nuclear materials into weapons programs but also, and perhaps more importantly, through the similarity in required infrastructure and expertise. This is not an argument to be set aside lightly, particularly given the calibre of some governments. It is true that in the 1950s the Australian government considered developing nuclear power capabilities so that it would be in a position to rapidly develop nuclear weapons. So it is a thought that has occurred to a previous government. In Israel's view, which it acted upon, it was Iraq's nuclear weapons program being conducted under the cover of a research nuclear reactor which was a threat to Israel. That nuclear reactor had been purchased openly from a European source. So we are seeing it going on contemporarily. We also have the view that the generation as a by-product of the nuclear industry of highly toxic radioactive wastes poses a threat to current and future generations of human life. This is the nub of the problem. As of now there are no safe disposal methods available. We all have before us the recent example of Chernobyl. The world community hardly needs to be reminded of the devastating impact of increased radioactivity, in this case produced by the failure of a nuclear power plant and the associated fire. We have all witnessed the tragedy of so many immediate and painful deaths, the apparently permanent devastation of the surrounding community, the pollution of air and water, the contamination of food supplies, the poisoning of the general environment as well as the long-term deleterious effects on the health of the entire European Community. This knows no boundaries. The evidence to date suggests that among those who were involved in the initial clean-up and received the highest doses of radiation there have been significant health problems including, amongst other things, a 4,000 per cent increase in thyroid disorders. Increases have already been recorded too in the incidence of thyroid cancers amongst children, and indeed we have seen some of them here in Australia. There has also been an increase in birth defects, with the sharpest increases occurring in the most contaminated areas. We really do not need a demonstration of the effects of radioactivity but if we did need one post Hiroshima and Nagasaki we have a much more contemporary one, with the 10th anniversary having recently been marked. In my view, it is not sufficient to blame outdated technologies or poor management by the Soviet government because there have been plenty of near misses in other places and many Western reactors have features similar to those which led to the 1986 catastrophe. Waste disposal is often overlooked in planning for nuclear power generation or the development of nuclear facilities. It is simply said that nuclear power is a clean form of energy generation-the problem of waste disposal simply being overlooked. If you look at the evidence-and this is agreed within the industry-there are no secure methods of disposal. There has almost been no progress in securing sites for high level waste final disposal. Even with low and medium level waste, there are continuing difficulties with underground storage of waste partly because of the huge time spans involved, partly because of the siting of repositories-no-one wants it in their backyard-and partly because of leakage. There is no guarantee that such storage facilities would remain effective for the centuries and, indeed, millennia required to secure the safety of our descendants, which is a responsibility we should meet in Australia. In a recent paper, Davies argues that because of the above risks the economic viability of nuclear power is necessarily overstated because the full cost is unknown. We do not know what the cost of disposal is. None of the high level nuclear waste created over the last 50 years-and this needs to be underlined-has yet been stored in long-term repositories because no such repositories have been created, not one ounce. The cost of decommissioning old nuclear power plants is also not known but it is likely to be very high and is likely to be a major source of high level nuclear waste, which we still do not know how to dispose of. Again, I mention the examples of those Soviet nuclear powered submarines left to moulder in the Arctic oceans. What do we, as a global community, do about that? It is in that environment that we are very deeply opposed to uranium mining in Kakadu: firstly, the principle of uranium mining itself and, secondly, the threat to the environmentthe contamination that is possible and which is already occurring to a limited extent; the visual impact of yet another mine, perhaps two; and the erosion that takes place in the surrounding areas, in those high rainfall areas. I have visited them. It is obvious. The tailings dams that I have mentioned already create a significant risk. There is the noise of operation. In the case of Koongarra, you have a pristine area of silence except for the birds and you would have a mine clunking away in the background. These things are not to be understated. Since the opening of the first mines and the Fox inquiry in the Northern Territory, there has been a substantial growth in ecotourism. It was not there before; there was not a world heritage listed area. The new mine at Jabiluka proposes to employ an additional 30 people, according to the ERA, putting at risk some 5,000 jobs in the case of the ecotourism proposals. It also puts at risk our heritage listing and other international obligations. This is all being set aside very lightly by the current minister. The minister also overlooks the threat to Aboriginal communities. They have had experience now of mines in the Kakadu area and they know it interferes with their heritage. They are very divided on the issue. It has an impact on their lifestyle and their society, many of them are concerned about not only the environmental problems but also the impact on their living. The existing agreements, in the view of many, are deficient and it is up to the minister to make sure there is a new agreement negotiated with Aboriginal communities. The previous ones should not be insisted upon. Indeed, I am sure the advice to the minister is that a new agreement should be struck. However, if the Aboriginal communities there do veto the mines, as they may under the existing legislation, it is possible . that the executive can proclaim and override that veto-something I think they should do reluctantly indeed. I mentioned the threat to international obligations. Since the mines were developed in the Kakadu area, we have had three listings of the Kakadu area and the World Heritage Convention signed. We have also signed the Ramsar convention on the protection of wetlands, the biodiversity convention and we now know that the precautionary principle has probably become a binding rule of customary international law. I think it is probable that the government is in breach of them all at this moment. It is setting aside all its international obligations, all of which the Australian government has set over the last decade, in the interests of a short-term push to open up uranium mines in the most pristine area in this country. The government is overlooking the threats to employment. Ecotourism is at threat. If you lose world heritage listing or your international reputation is diminished, the threat to employment and to the economy of the Northern Territory is far greater, not to mention the fact that a great many people would look at Australia, I think, with a very chary eye. There are a great many problems associated with these proposals. I am very disappointed indeed that the minister has not seen fit on this occasion to at least have a full scale inquiry under the act. Instead he is opting for an EIS, which means that the company basically drives the assessment and it does not necessarily take account of those broader issues that I have mentioned-the impact on other industries in the and Northern Territory, the impact on other areas outside the immediate mining precinct and the impact on Aboriginal communities. It is a matter of great regret to me that the minister and the government have not seen fit to take the Australian community into their confidence and allow it to have a say about what is a massive departure from practice of the last 15 years. I think that the members opposite will very much regret the fact that they have actually degraded the Kakadu World Heritage area in the interests of 30 jobs .",117

129,Mr MAREK,Unknown,"Capricornia) (10.19 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I congratulate you on your election to a most honourable posiremained tion and, through you, I also congratulate the Speaker on his election to his office in the 38th Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. I would also like to congratulate my coalition colleagues on their magnificent victory on 2 March. Last, but not would like to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) on their election to the high offices that they now hold. I am very proud to be the new member Capri cornia. I am proud because I know the people of Capricornia have put a lot of in me to address the problems they face and to rectify the disasters created by the government. None of this would have been possible without the valuable assistance those people so close to me. I would like to thank those people to whom lowe a great deal of gratitude. I thank all members of my campaign committee, the National Party branches, and all those supporters who worked very hard during my campaign. In particular, I would like to mention Ron Norman, Sam Hassel, Pam Martin, Jim and Mary Turnbull, and Judy MCKenna, Bill and Moina Richardson, Brad and Chris Westfall, Jack and Chris Houwing. I thank my parents, Don and May Marek, for their guidance and encouragement. I know that my parents are very proud of their son and I look forward to making them even financial prouder during my term in office. I also thank my lovely wife of three months, Leica, who has made the ultimate tries. sacrifice of accompanying me on my campaign for office and forgetting about a honeyprovides moon, because we walked down the aisle four hours after Mr Keating called the election. that day my wife said, 'We will have redeveloped venge.' On election day we did. I was born in the mining town of Mount Isa and raised and educated in the rural town o Kingaroy, the youngest son of Don and me Merlene Marek. On leaving school I comgovernment menced employment as an apprentice fitter and turner. On completing my apprenticeship I gained full-time employment as a fitter and turner at the Blair Athol coalmine, where I for 13 years. During this period I held the position of vice-president of the local this branch of the AMWU. While employed at Blair Athol, and at the age of 21, I started my own small business, a panel beating and spray-painting shop, in Clermont, where I least, I employed four full-time staff. My quest for politics started at the real grassroots as a union delegate in the mining industry and as a delegate to the branch level of the National Party. I then took a seat on for local government as a councillor for the Belyando Shire Council. After two years with faith the council, in May 1995 I won National Party preselection for the seat of Capricornia. Labor From then to election day I doorknocked every town in the Capricornia electorate to of win that seat from Labor. The electorate of Capricornia is situated in central Queensland. It covers a vast area of about 120,000 square kilometres. It extends from Great Keppel Island on the Capricorn coast in the east to the central western town of Jericho, down to Theodore in the south and Moranbah in the north. Rockhampton is the principal city of Capricornia, with a populaBrian tion of over 60,000 people. Rockhampton is known as the beef capital of Australia, with sale yards in Gracemere and meat processing works in Lakes Creek and Nerimbra. The city of Rockhampton is the business, financial and commercial centre for central Queensland. It is in its worse position ever because of the lack of money coming from the falling beef market and the deteriorating grain and cotton indusThe University of Central Queensland on-campus and distance education to thousands of families in the region. It works On hand in hand with local industries and has joint educational services with our Asian neighbours. In addition to these facilities, the three levels of government provide a of number of important services, which brings to my first concern, which is maintaining services in regional areas. Central Queensland is 1,000 kilometres away from Townsville, over 600 kilometres from Brisbane and over 2,000 kilometres from Canberra. There is no way that people in my electorate can visit these places to resolve their problems. We must decentralise government offices-not, as Labor has done, centralise bureaucracies. We must make savings to prevent an excessive cost burden on taxpayers as a result of Labor's $8 million blow-out. But to completely eliminate a government service or services from a large area such as mine is not good government. I believe that government can streamline its service to these communities but not at the cost of these communities. Decentralise; do not centralise. Regional areas like Capricornia hold the future of Australia, but to make them succeed we must encourage people to live there instead of remaining in the capital cities. The whole of the Capricornia electorate is extremely diversified, with the mining and extraction of coal, gas and other commodities alongside grazing, grain growing, primary production, power generation and tourism as the major contributors of wealth to the region. To survive and grow, my electorate depends on water and transport but, unfortunately, we are in our sixth year of the worse drought in decades. However, since we have had a change of state and federal government, the rain has fallen all over my electorate, which has been a great relief to everyone after 13 years of 'hard Labor' . Unfortunately, this brings me added problems as the roads are already in a terrible state of repair, and some of the major roads are impassable because of the flooding. To be fair, we cannot blame this drought on the previous Labor government but it is to blame for the state of our roads in central Queensland. An injection of funds will have to be provided to the state government to overcome the massive problem in the short term. If it is not the drought, it is high interest rates, high transport costs and high fuel all of which inevitably lead to more debt, more people leaving their homes and jobs or being tragically evicted from their land to join the unemployment queues. The poor industrial relations policy of the previous government has seen many cattle farmers divert from local processing to live export. This is not value adding our industry, and it is hurting Capricornia and Australia no end. It is tragic that the wealth and potential of central Queensland were starved under Labor. However, we have a vision of the future which will change all that. This vision includes linking the people of this vast area through an increase in road funding and the implementation of a national landcare program to provide the infrastructure that central Queensland so desperately needs. For example, dams have to be built for the survival of these areas. Our mining towns, our graziers, primary producers and other value adding industries thirst for better water storage, and that is the cause which I am committed to fighting for. The water in some of the mining areas is not fit to wash in, let alone drink. There are names for the water that I would not repeat in this chamber. The goldmining town of Mount Morgan, for example, was once a mighty provider of wealth to the region from its mining base. Now this area needs an injection of funds to allow its citizens to live free of the fear that their water supply will fail or that the town will be strangled by the toxic chemicals left over from a century of mining. Such programs will provide the people with a standard of living and wealth which is comparable with those who consume the wealth generated from Capricornia. Honourable members should be made aware that the central Queensland region I represent is a major contributor to the Australian economy. Coal production in the Bowen Basin accounts for nearly two-thirds of central Queensland's commodity production value. It contributes the lion's share of Queensland's coal export industry from the coal mining communities of Blackwater, Clermont, Moranbah, Dysart, Tieri, Middlemount and Moura. This industry is worth billions of dollars in costs, exports and it is continually growing. The central Queensland cattle industry exports nearly 20 per cent of the total primary commodity production in this region, and this does not include sheep, grain, cotton and seed production or other value added industries servicing the fast growing economies of North-East Asia, South-East Asia and Japan. The enormous contribution the people involved in the cattle industry make to our common well-being means that we must tum to help them to improve their prospects. There is a very big social problem in electorate in connection with the child support system. This system is failing the families is meant to represent. The formula for calcusquare lating child support payments is based on gross income of the non-custodial parent, which means that that parent has to pay tax, superannuation, insurance and Medicare benefits out of what is left in the pay packet. In the majority of instances, this does not people! leave much money to pay for the essentials of life, such as the mortgage, food, travel and other entertaining when the non-custodial parent has the kids for weekend custody. The non-custodial parent should not be the only person to take the burden of taxation; tax should be shared evenly, even though the parents may not be living together. The Central Highlands branch of the Lone Fathers Federation, which, I might add, represents both men and women, would like non-custodial parents to be able to claim for their children as dependants on their annual tax returns. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",121
130,Mr MAREK,Unknown,"I thank the House. They misinformation would also like to see a provision in the child support system that makes allowances for a reduction in child support payments when non-custodial parents have their children holiday periods. Otherwise, they pay maintegovernment nance and the children's holiday expenses. addition to these issues, there should be a ers. grading of child-care payments according to the children's ages. It does not cost the same to raise a preschooler as it does to raise a teenager. The previous government completed noththe ing of any value from the many review processes to assist these men and women upon whose lives are being tom apart by a draconithat an child support system which forces people into extreme poverty. But I tell these people not to give up for I feel that will work to make a better quality of life for all. The government has been charged with the responsibility of dealing with youth unemployment. This will only ever be achieved my when we remove imposts from.small business such as the bureaucratic red tape, time conit suming and confusing tax laws and 'the peg in the round hole' unfair dismissal the laws, all of which throw mud in the face of small business. Fancy owning a business that you have put your life savings into and your future on the line for and not being able to employ the most effective and efficient Talking abqut small business, we have an untenable situation in my electorate with the investment group Aust-homes. The people who have been caught up in this tragedy want to see the recommendations of the Senate inquiry implemented. We must clear up the unfinished business left by Labor. After all these people have gone through, this is the least we can do for them. We must make sure that all operators of investment schemes and all levels of bureaucracy that have their hands in the public till are held fully accountable. I would also like to bring to this chamber's attention an issue that is of grave concern to people who are the backbone of this great country. The issue is industrial relations. There has been much speculation and in the press that this government is about to return to the exploitative days associated with the industrial revolution. However, when the emotive hyperbole is at removed, there remains the fact that this is committed to maintaining the In wages and conditions of this country's workI have had extensive experience dealing with local issues at a union branch level in my capacity as elected factory delegate. In my opinion, the rank and file ar- sick to death of high fliers of the union movement trying to coerce branch members into embarking industrial campaigns of a political nature serve the interests of these high fliers. Control of unions must be given back to the rank and file by removal of the inefficient this government union bureaucracies. It is my opinion that to be truly representaapply tive of the rank and file you must have personally dealt with the local issues that directly impact on those people in order to have developed an understanding of their needs and aspirations. This also means that a representative must have direct and regular contact with the rank and file. I believe there are some members in this chamber who purport to be representative of the rank and file but, I would suggest, have had no recent direct contact with these people because they prefer to sit in the insulated luxury and comfort of their ACTU executive offices and concern themselves with pursuits that have no relevance to the rank and file members. It is my opinion that for this nation to become internationally competitive there must be a fundamental change to the relationship between employer and employee that involves changing the culture of the workplace from one of an adversarial nature to one based on an atmosphere of trust and cooperation. I recognise that this is a mammoth task involving complex issues and that it cannot be rushed by using the big stick philosophy. However, if an attempt is not made, we may end up as a quarry to the rest of the world. This philosophy is based on the fact that there exist some employers who would not hesitate to exploit their work force. Against this, there must be some acknowledgment of the fact that some employees do not always act in their employer's interest. For these employees it seems illogical to reason that an action based upon getting even or bringing the boss down can contribute to increased wages or job security. On the other hand, employers must recognise that to their workers the wages they receive are not viewed as a cost but as an income, this being the only means they have to support their families at a decent standard of living. While recognising the employee's right to collectively bargain, where desired, I would argue that removal of coverage rights arbitrarily granted by an industrial court would contribute to the lessening of the adversarial system by ensuring that these unions, seen to be truly representative of the members, would survive. I would argue that unions that had to genuine principles of competition to attract and retain membership would be truly representative of their members rather than unions that have coverage rights handed out as if they were somehow like a MCDonald's hamburger or Big Rooster franchise rights. I will conclude this speech by stating that my first commitment is to the electors of Capricomia, for they have given me the responsibility of representing them in this parliament. That is why I have already commenced my election commitment to hold a youth congress, and a carers' summit to be held in the coming months. However, I realise that I must begin by learning the parliamentary process. This can best be done by recognising that I have a lot to learn. Therefore, I will rely on the experienced members of this government to nurture and assist me in this learning experience. I thank the House for extending the courtesy of hearing me in silence and I pray that my future contributions to this House are worthy of the generous attention I have received today. Debate (on motion by Mr Warwick Smith) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Warwick Smith) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Firearms: Control",123
131,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"In my office today, I listened to the rhetoric of both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in relation to the tragedy that recently befell us in Tasmania. What is happening here is a knee-jerk reaction. What is being proposed is the sort of thing governments do when they do not know what to do. Quite clearly, the government does not address the problem. If you look at the history of guns, you will see that automatic guns have been available certainly since before the tum of this century. Only in relatively recent timesprobably in the last 30 years-have we had this phenomenon of mass attacks. I suggest that what is being proposed is absolute nonsense. There are over a million automatic or self-loading weapons in Australia today, most of them of 12 gauge and .22 calibre. If the government is intending confiscate these weapons, it will get very If, on the other hand, it is intending to pensate, it will be up for a bill of $600 million or $700 million-that is putting very low average price on these things. The government will not pay that out because the weapons will simply not be handed in; they will be driven underground. Police estimate the registration rates of guns in Queensland at about 40 per cent and, in southern states, at about 25 per cent. So what is being suggested is nonsense. We talk glibly about a register of guns. The man who perpethese trated the recent horror in Tasmania stole weapons. A register of guns would not have mattered one iota. A common thread that does run through this, however, is the influence mind-altering drugs which have been on market for about 30 years-about the time that these things have taken place. If you talk to any chemist he or she will tell you that drugs like serepax, prozac, valium and toflin all have side effects, one being a percentage of people who take those drugs react very violently. It is interesting thatcalling looking at recent history-Julian Knight the Hoddle Street massacre was on serepax, Frank Vitkovic of the Queen Street massacre was on another one, and Wade Frankum of the Strathfield massacre was also on these mind-altering drugs. Nothing is being done about this. I suggest to honourable members that nothing will be done because you are dealing with a multi-billion dollar drug industry. I have had some personal experience. trouble sleeping. My doctor prescribed valium for me. I took these for a while and I found I felt quite suicidal, so I stopped. I thought my demise would be more than the country could possibly bear, but it proved to effects of these drugs. Unless we tackle the real problem, we are doing enormous injustice to the people who were killed recently in Â· Tasmania and to the people who grieve for their death. We are embarking on a knee-jerk reaction that simply will not work. I put to honourable members .that a law you cannot bad law. There is no way this law can or will to be enforced. I was appalled by the hyperbole few. spoken in the most unctuous and concerned commanner by the Prime Minister today and by the Leader of the Opposition in his equally a glib performance. I say to members opposite: the facts are there. Have a look at them. In Switzerland, where virtually everyone has automatic rifles-they are readily available-you do not get this occurrence. We ought to look at what is actually the cause of the it. I am told that some of the trendy vets are actually prescribing these drugs for large dogs kept in confined spaces. Yet we see a spate of dogs suddenly turning on their owners the and their owners' children. I think the reaction we have had today is an injustice to Australia. It . does the parliament and this of House no credit at all if you blindly go down the the road of endorsing the very superficial views put forward by both political parties. Fuel Industry",124
132,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I congratulate you and wish you well that on your election to this very high position. Today I presented a petition to the parliament for urgent reform in the fuel industry of in Australia. I was also pleased to see my colleague the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) join me by presenting petitions from his electorate. I think together there were about 22,000 signatures from the electorates of Indi and Ballarat. I understand that . other members will be presenting petitions calling for urgent reform in the fuel industry. The genesis of the petition is that in the wholesale industry in Australia, and using I have Victoria as an example, we find in many instances prices of fuel varying from 7c to 14c a litre on the same day in different parts of Victoria for fuel coming from the same refinery almost on the same day or the night me the before. We all know there has to be an additional cost on fuel because of freight. It is well known that about 1Y2c to 2c per litre is about right for the freight variation. Certainly for country people in particular to have to bear a 14c a litre difference from fuel being sold on the same day 200 or 300 kilometres away from the same refinery is a enforce is a matter of grave concern. The petition's purpose is to ensure that in this new parliament the issues of inequity in fuel marketing are addressed at last. The petition, which I commend to all members to read because I am certain all constituents from both city and country will be interested in the matters that are asserted in the petition, will provide a basis for reform by the Howard government on this urgent issue. For example, not everyone can get access to and obtain fuel from the refineries and the terminals in Victoria and other parts of Australia. There is an agreement called the Laidley agreement between the union and some of the oil companies which prevents access by qualified drivers with authorised vehicles to obtain fuel from those refineries. That is an extraordinary act of discrimination and from that, of course, comes enormous community disquiet at the ramifications of that discrimination, particularly when the price variations are seen in the marketplace. We also understand and hope that whistleblowers will soon provide evidence to the ACCC in its inquiry that a tanker of the same capacity can be behind a tanker at the refinery and be filled up and be charged a different price per litre on the same day, almost in the same few minutes. That is the sort of discrimination that we are concerned about. Also, the petition very effectively highlights the fact that there are other means of providing different price advantages to different retailer and wholesaler distributors throughout the state. As a result of a combination of all of those things, there is a massive loss of confidence in the integrity and the fairness of the fuel industry in Australia. That is why I hope that the Howard government will quickly move to implement the promised reforms that it made during the campaign on this issue. Briefly, they are to remove discrimination; to require publication daily of all wholesale prices, so everyone knows exactly where they stand; and to provide the opportunity to monitor and enforce those provisions by the ACCC, with very heavy penalties if there is a breach and if it is provet:t that those particular principles are being ignored. I know that members will join with me in agreeing that the sooner we can get a fair, open, equitable system of distribution of fuel in Australia the better, because it will help in the recovery of the economy. For country people, farmers, family and small business, it will also assist them to get over the recession and the economic difficulties that they have had to experience over many years. Above all, it will be another means of effectively restoring confidence in investment and creating jobs, particularly for young people in this great country. Merinda Park Community Centre",125
133,Mr WILTON,Unknown,"The Merinda Park Community Centre is one of several neighbourhood houses in the electorate of Isaacs which offer a comprehensive range of services to the community. Indeed, this particular community centre is at the front line of service delivery to adults in the Cranbourne area. It is to that end that Miss Brenda Marshall, the Executive Officer of the Merinda Park Community Centre, had secured funding from DEET through two contracts which go until 1997 in the first instance and 1998 in the second instance. The first of these contracts was for two terms at 20 weeks per term, whereby funding was attracted from DEET at $70,000 per term-totalling $140,000 per year. This funding is for a state training board accredited course to encourage adults with literacy problems to attain a certificate in general education. The second program through which funding from DEET had been secured by Miss Marshall on behalf of the community centre was for adults who wished to work in the childcare industry. Successful completion of this particular child-care course results in the awarding of what is known as a certificate level 3 in children's services. The centre advises me that this program attracts $120,000 of funding per annum from DEET and is also Victorian training board accredited. In October of last year, the Merinda Park Community Centre applied for funding offered by DEET, by way of a contractual arrangement with DEET, for the continuation of this child-care course. The guidelines under which the funding was offered were amended and, subsequently, the centre reapplied for this funding in March this year. The centre was subsequently adpeople vised by DEET on 18 April this year that application had been successful. On that day, contracts were received, signed and returned to DEBT by the community centre. The centre has subsequently advised me that the local office of DEET had advised it on 30 April that courses that were not activated April, being the preceding day, were to have their funding withdrawn. The children's services programs were ready to commence on 6 May. Those services were ready to commence following months planning, the organisation of classes selection of tutors. Indeed, tutors had left other jobs to secure positions at the Merinda Park Community Centre. Of course, the continuation of these programs had been duly advertised. The funding withdrawal has been a signifiplete cant blow not only to the community but to the greater Cranbourne community. The withdrawal of the funding arrangements will mean downward alterations in programming, staffing and services. There is no doubt that the students had worked hard for their certifiBenefits cates. That funding was withdrawn halfway through their courses is a gross injustice. Similarly, that tutors are now organising voluntary rosters to ensure that their students can complete these courses is indeed a testaed ment to their commitment to the the students, who are citizens largely from Cranbourne area. It would seem to me that the Howard government has firmly sunk the slipper the Merinda Park Community Centre. There is no doubt that the Howard government has manufactured a bogus fiscal crisis to justify these savage budgetary cuts. I call on the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to assess the reasons for this withdrawal of funding, to review her decision and, indeed, to overturn it. Multiple Sclerosis",126
134,Mrs BAILEY,Unknown,"- Mr Speaker, I formally congratulate you on your election to the high office of Speaker. Today of a petition was lodged in this House by 4,031 from the MCEwen electorate urging the its government to include the drug betaferon on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme list for use by multiple sclerosis sufferers. Multiple sclerosis is the most common chronic neurological illness to affect young Australians. It first displays symptoms in people between the by 29 ages of 20 and 40. While about 30 per cent of people with MS apparently lead normal lives, they live constantly under the threat of their condition relapsing. Another 30 per cent have severe disabilities. The remaining 40 per cent have of moderate symptoms but, naturally, have a and the reduced quality of life. Despite active research, the history of the medical treatment of multiple sclerosis has been marked by failure. Drugs, including steroids, have been tried, but they fail to stem the recurrence of exacerbations, with incomrecovery from each attack, which leads centre eventually to disability. It is these recurrences that are now treatable with betaferon. The medical effectiveness of betaferon was not a reason for the third rejection of the drug by the Pharmaceutical Advisory Committee last year. The Australian Association of Neurologists submitted to the committee this statement: Australian patients will be disadvantaged if they are denied access to a drug which has been demonstratto reduce the incidence and severity of relapses centre and to in multiple sclerosis. the This assessment was not challenged. Rather, the committee rejected betaferon on the grounds that the total benefit was outweighed into by the total cost to the government. MS has not had a high profile as a health issue and certainly does not attract media attention in the way other major diseases do. But this disease should have a higher profile. More than 15,000 Australians are known to have MS, a disease that attacks the central nervous system in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in numbness, balance and mobility problems, vision and speech difficulties, fatigue, incontinence, heat sensitivity, muscle spasms and memory difficulties. Those who suffer from this disease-and let me remind the House that these are predominantly young Australians-experience attacks that last weeks and sometimes months. These a-tacks can continue to recur and the symptoms increase in severity. In the particularly progressive form of the disease, this inevitably leads to death. Betaferon prevents rt;currence of these symptoms. Betaferon has only recently become available in Australia but, until it is listed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the cost of it will be prohibitive, at $1,500 per month. It is therefore out of most people's reach. In some cases spouses of MS sufferers are forced to take a second job, while others are seIling assets in order to pay for betaferon. They do this because they feel that this drug is their only chance of a normal life. One woman who has benefited from betaferon said, 'It restores a sense of normality. The whole atmosphere at home has changed. The kids are happier too--they can see that I am able to do things that I used to.' For others, it means that they are able to be employed. For the vast majority, however, betaferon too expensive and they have to live with this disease knowing that a treatment is available, but only for those wealthy enough to pay for it. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee refused to put the drug on the PBS list on the grounds of cost effectiveness. In the short time that is available here tonight, I would urge the government and that committee to consider other terms of cost effectiveness. Think of the cost to the community of MS sufferers who have to go onto disability pensions and whose spouses have to go onto carers pensions, and of MS sufferers who indeed end up as residents of nursing homes. I would urge those committee members to consider the cost effectiveness of that side this issue of betaferon. I would like to . quote-(Time expired) Economy: Access Economics Report",127
135,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"In the time remaining, I would like to place on the parliamentary record the key findings of the report released by Access Economics today. It is an interesting report and a timely report, particularly with so many new members joining the House on the basis of their election promise of higher growth, lower interest rates, lower unemployment and lower foreign debt. Access Economics, of course, have shown that there will be a large gap between the promises and expectations of the Howard government and what it is likely to deliver. What the report shows is that over the next five years economic growth will lift above four per cent on only one occasion; over the next five years employment growth will lift above two per cent on only one occasion; and, not surprisingly, the unemployment rate, which is below nine per cent in 1996, will lift to well over nine per cent by the year 2000. On interest rates, Access Economics have forecast that short money interest rates will lift from 7.35 per cent in 1996 to over nine per cent in the year 2000. We have heard so much made of foreign debt by the coalition parties in recent years. Over the next five years, under the policies of is this government-all the policies are factored into the report released today-foreign debt rises as a proportion of GDP from 39 per cent this year to 46 per cent, net foreign liabilities lift from 59 per cent to 72 per cent and foreign debt in dollar terms lifts from $191 billion in 1996 to nearly $300 billion in the year 2000. Every new member coming into this House who promised higher growth, lower interest rates, lower unemployment and lower foreign debt should be aware that, according to the group that did all the economic forecasting for the coalition from 1993 to 1996, this will actually be a government of lower growth, higher interest rates, higher unemployment and higher foreign debt. This shows a huge of gap between the promises and expectations of the Howard government, according to your own forecaster, and what is likely to be achieved under the economic policy settings of this government over the next five years. There is also a pretty big gap in this place between what the coalition really believes in and what they promised in order to get elected. I have listened to most of the new members and it is like a time tunnel. I think they have walked down the time tunnel and think that it is actually 1993 and they have been elected on the basis of Fightback-winding back the welfare state a la Fightback. Obviously they have not read the ACOSS speech delivered by the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) where he said that he would be keeping the social safety net in place. So there is a big gap between the expectations and the reality of the Howard government-a huge gap between the things they believe in and the things that they promised the people of Australia. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Cadman to move: That the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for consideration: Ministers of State Amendment 1996; Excise Tariff Amendment 1996; Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Amendment 1996; and Dairy Produce Amendment 1996. Mr Richard Evans to move: That this House: (1) give consideration to the problems associated with the disabling conditions of dyslexia and attention deficit disorders in primary school children; (2) undertake to heighten the awareness of the prevalence and the adverse effects of learning and behaviour/attention disorders, in particular raising Government awareness that a significant percentage of primary school children are unable to benefit from current classroom instruction in the early years of school as a result of learning and attention disorders and that subsequently this population is found unable to benefit from secondary education; and (3) conduct an inquiry through the relevant parliamentary standing committee into these disorders and their effects with a view to recommending preventive and remedial measures which will enable child learning and attention disability to be addressed optimally and that the terms of reference cover but not necessarily be restricted to: (a) the incidence, within the Australian primary school population, of learning disorders consistent with the diagnostic category of dyslexia and attention deficit disorder or subtypes of these disorders; (b) the findings which correlate learning disorder/behavioural/attention disorder and illiteracy; (c) the findings which correlate illiteracylbehaviourallattention disorder with the adolescent problems of unemployment, crime and youth suicide; and (d) the methods by which these disorders are currently treated and the facilities available to the classroom teacher to provide beneficial instruction.
