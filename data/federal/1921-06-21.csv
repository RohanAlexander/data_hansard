4,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Has the Acting Prime Minister seen the statement in the press that in all probability the Estimates will not. be ready for some months? Is that statement correct? - Sir JOSEPH COOK-The press appears to know more about the Estimates than I do. So far as I am aware, the arrangements that have already been made will stand.",19
5,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Are you accepting all the advice that the press has given you in regard to the matter? You will make a hell of a mess of it if you do!,19
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to withdraw those words.,19
7,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I withdraw them.,19

9,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs been drawn to the statement that a large line of lucerne seed has been landed in Sydney, and that a vigorous attempt is being made to get it passed through the Customs without being stained, which is the usual treatment for imported seed? Will the Minister take steps to prevent this seed from escaping staining.",19
10,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I have received a number of telegrams and letters on the subject. I understand that a shipment of lucerne seed has been received from South Africa, and that the importer has applied for leave to introduce it without staining, but that leave has been refused. M. WAR SERVICE HMS. TIMBER AND OTHER AWARDS : CLOSING OF MILLS.",19
11,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister in charge of War Service Homes matters and soldier land settlement whether he has noticed the proposed new log of the timber workers of Victoria, and if he has considered the effect its adoption would have on the t erection of War Service Homes.",19
12,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is not a fair question, inasmuch as there must be an application to the Court before the log can be adopted.",19
13,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I have not seen the full log, but I have read the press statement about it. The claim is a staggerer. The War Service Homes Commission has had applied to its operations at least two awards which, being retrospective, have seriously affected them, vastly increasing the cost of houses that were almost completed. It will be impossible to continue in the present uncertainty, seeing that Parliament has fixed definitely the sum which a War Service Home should not exceed.",19
14,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is it a fact that some of the mills taken over by the War Service Homes Commission from Lahey Limited have been closed, and that, therefore, a large number of returned men have been thrown out of work?",19
15,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"It is a fact that some of the Lahey mills have been closed; but they were not closed until the full storage capacity at the disposal of tha Commission was filled, and we have utilized the timber to the full financial provision made for this year. Other mills, in Australia which have never before been closed are now closed. NA SHIPS..",19

As the result of an interview between Repatriation Commission, the Principal Deseas articles. partmental Medical Officer for Repatriation, and the Inspector-General of the Insane for Victoria, the latter instructed Dr Hollow, Medical Superintendent at Mont Park, to arrange for the transfer of certain patients (for special reasons) from No. 16 Australian General Hospital to - Kew and Sunbury Hospitals for the Insane. 2. The instruction was given by telephone to Dr Hollow by the Inspector-General of the Insane. 3. The medical certificate was in the form of schedule 5 of the Lunacy Act No. 26S7. Procedure was to be under section 26 of that Act. 4. The Medical Superintendent, Dr Hollow, has the medical certificates at present in his 5. The patients so transferred would be supplied with civilian clothing.

The raw material of these is already taxed severely under the Tariff , and duty of 20 per cent, is not the sufficient to keep out the foreign or overTariff. Â± [21 JUNE, 1921.]",20
23,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Fanc y calling the Old Country a "" foreign "" country.",21
24,Mr COESEE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Whether these dips come from England, America or elsewhere, there is no reason for their importation, in view of the fact that there are now established here twelve factories for their manufacture.",21
25,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Robertson) [3.14] Last week I gave notice of my intention to move an amendment on this item, with a view to the reduction of the duty on British dips. Every man interested in the great primary industry of wool-grow-, ing knows that it is essential to have the best quality of dips for the production of the best quality wool. I speak as one with experience, and there is no doubt in my mind, or in the minds of others of experience, that Australia has not yet produced a dip which is as good for wool as some of the best British dips.",21
26,Sir GEANVILLE RYRIE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,That is absolutely correct.,21
27,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Honourable members will observe that my opinion is backed by another experienced wool grower. I am convinced that 90 per cent, of the wool growers in Australia, who pride themselves on producing the best quality of wool, do not use Australian dips. For the purpose of destroying insects and so forth the Australian dips are quite good, and from that point of view I have no <lesire to decry them, but of those who are particular about their wool; quite apart from keeping their sheep healthy and clean, by far the majority prefer British dips. It will be a serious matter if we <lo anything to injure the most important primary product of Australia. Wool has made Australia's good name'throughout the world, and is, above all other products, helping us to bear the burdens of today. It would be ridiculous in order to help a very minor industry to do that which might result in irreparable injury to the most important of our _ primary industries. I hope that the Committee will not agree to the amendment just submitted. Later on, I shall move an amendment to reduce the duty as against Great Britain. Amendment negatived.",21
28,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.16] - I intend to move an amendment to provide, Tariff. 9175 amongst other things, that nicotine preparations shall be free. This amendment is in accordance with the promise I made to the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) last week.",21
29,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Why make them free?,21
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Because they are not made here. The amendment leaves sheep dips at the same rates as now in the Tariff.,21
31,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Robertson) [3.19] - I move That the following words be added to subitem (A)-""And on and after 22nd June, 1021, ad val., British, 10 per cent.; intermediate, 30 per cent.; general, 40 per cent."" I do not care how high the protection is against foreign dips, but I object to dips manufactured in Great Britain being described in that way. I am very strongly in favour of giving manufacturers in Great Britain a preference which will be of real value to them, and, at the same time, of value to wool-growers in Australia, many of whom believe that they must have British dip if the high quality of our wool is to be maintained.",21
32,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Maribyrnong) [3.22]. - I thought that the very reasonable amendment suggested by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) would be accepted. I cannot claim to have had much to do with sheep in recent years, but I think that if I read an extract from a circular issued by a firm of sheep dip manufacturers it should he sufficient to convince honourable members that the duties proposed are reasonable and fair. The firm to which I refer is William Cooper and Nephews, and only last year they were amongst the most bitter opponents of any duty on imports of sheep dip. They were then manufacturing in Great Britain, and were greatly opposed to these duties and to the embargo placed during war time on the importation of British-made dips. One of the principal reasons - for the embargo was that the. Prime Minister of Great Britain made a. special request to the Prime Ministers' of. the Dominions and of Australia in particular",21
33,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,The honourable member cannot prove .that statement.,21
34,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"If the honourable member would permit me to. finish what I wish to say, perhaps he would not be so ready to interject. The Prime Minister of Great Britain made a request to. the Prime Ministers of the overseas Dominions that, while there was a shortage of ships and shipping space, the Dominions should, as far as possible, manufacture all their own requirements.",21
35,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,There good reason for it then.,22
36,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I admit that. The matter of sheep dip was remitted to the Wool Committee, and it will be agreed that the Chairman of the Wool Committee knows something about sheep dips. After an exhaustive investigation the Wool Committee came to the conclusion, and advised the Government accordingly, that sheep dips were manufactured Australia sufficient for local requirements, and that an embargo should be placed on the importation of sheep dip. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) complained of that on many occasions, - and, as I have previously said, the of William Cooper and Nephews was bitsheep terly opposed to it . Owing to the bargo, and to the fact that fifteen months ago certain duties were levied on ported dips, the firm of William Cooper and Nephews came to Australia, and began the manufacture of their dip here.",22
37,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,It is not the dip some of us want.,22
38,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,It is a well-known fact that Cooper's sheep dip is favourably known and used by leading sheep-breeders throughout Australia.,22
39,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"As an insecticide a very fine dip, but not as a dip for wool.",22
40,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"It was the popular dip, and is now.",22
41,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"The most relentless Free Trader should be prepared to abdicate Free Trade principles in connection with this item when he hears read lowing extract from a circular issued by (Mr Jowett). William Cooper and Nephews: We have already embarked in Australia capital of some Â£75,000 in this enterprise, and if we are to have a full measure of protection and continue to operate, the import must be such as to afford effective protection against unfair and unequal competition ports. That is a most effective reply to the orable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming). This firm, that was most bitterly opposed to any kind of protection for Australian-made dips, is now manuthe facturing a dip in Australia. The wo encourage'the manufacture of these articles, in which chemists are extensively employed, the more shall we multiply - wealth of Australia. The establishment of such industries will help us in times of peace, and must be of the greatest advantage to us in time of war. was a Mr CORSER (Wide Bay) [3.28] - It will be recollected that during the war our friends, especially some of those in the Country party's corner, were advocating the use of Cooper's dip.",22
42,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"No one in this corner advocated the use of Cooper's dips, by name.",22
43,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"What we tried to do in was to have the embargo on the importation of British dips removed. Mr CORSER,-Willia m Cooper and Nephews were assured of protection and support if they came to Australia and firm established the manufacture of their dip here-at very considerable cost. emI t is admitted to be a very good dip, and it has become no worse since it has been immanufactured in Australia. This firm has been induced to establish a factory here, and is giving satisfaction, and I , therefore, cannot admit the adthat visability of reducing the duty on imported dips. I know as much of the re_ quirements of dip as do most people in Australia, and recognised authorities on the subject find no fault with the dip manufactured here by William Cooper it is and Nephews, either for sheep or for cattle, and there are many other good dips most being manufactured in the Commonwealth.",22
44,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,The honourable member could get a fine testimonial for it from the folthe honourable member for Grampians,22
45,Mr JOWETT,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,It is undoubtedly one a of the very finest dips used.,22
46,Mr CORSER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"There are so many duty manufacturers of sheep dip in Australia at the present time that it is very unof imlikely that there should be a Combine formed by them. If we continue to give honthem sufficient ^protection against importations of dip from outside we shall be in a position to secure the continuance of the manufacture of a good article on spot. I sincerely hope that no atmore tempt will be made to bring about a reduction of duties' which would be disastrous to this industry. If that is the done, the people who are advocating the ' reduction may be the worse sufferers.",22
47,Mr GEEGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Dampier) [3.30] - I do not think the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) was correct in stating that the members of the Country party claimed any special merits for Cooper's Sheep Dip, or tried to get any advantage for that company; but we did fight for the removal of the embargo placed on the importation of sheep dips into the Commonwealth. That was a very proper fight, aud I am glad that it was successful. In reply to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), I say that it was not necessary to place a duty on sheep dip in order to enable its manufacture in Australia. The industry was already here, and firms in New Soutli Wales advertised that they wanted neither an embargo nor a duty on the imported article.",23
48,Mr COKSEB,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,What companies were they ?,23
49,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I cannot name them off-hand; but the Minister probably can. One company was ruined by the interference of the Government.,23
50,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Is the honourable member sure that that company's sheep dip was any good? I have used a lot of Australian dips, with disastrous results.",23
51,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"The firm had their business in Australia, and their own customers, and were doing very well. They worked on co-operative lines, and were quite content to go on as they had been. They advertised that they wanted no embargo and no duty on the imported article. But during the war some people conceived the idea that it would be nice to have an embargo on a product that competed with their own; and one evening, in the Queen's Hall, Mr Leggo stated before the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) and me, that ho. had been promised an embargo for twelve months, and if he got that he did not care what might happen afterwards.",23
52,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,That firm made a lot of money.,23
53,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I think they have made application to the Government for over Â£30,000 as compensation for losses sustained through the removal of the embargo. We know that it is not true that the British Government would not assist the firms that were manufacturing insecticides for this country. They realized how important it was to British industries that Australia should be supplied with efficient dips, so that when the war was over Australian wool of unimpaired quality would be available. Coopers have supplied honourable members with circulars which state that during the war the British Government assisted the manufacturers to carry on what they regarded as a national industry. We read that they applied to the Prime Minister, in England, who gave them a written agreement-whic h this Government refused to endorse as long as they could-that all sheep dips ordered prior to March, 1921, would be admitted into the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the embargo, subject to the importers entering into an agreement that they would pay any duty which Parliament might thereafter impose. I remember urging the Minister during the war to bring iii the Tariff and place on these dips any duty he chose, so long as we could get them. I was not advocating the merits of Cooper's dip particularly; but Coopers are an old-established firm. They have sent their chemists all over the world to discover a dip that would cause the least deterioration to the wool, while dealing effectively with tick and other pests. And what Australia needs is trade with firms of that kind, so that we may benefit by their experience and research. In the fruit-growing and wool-growing industries, it is essential that the best insecticides shall be available. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) promised, through Colonel Amery, that sheep dip would be allowed to be imported into Australia, but the Government delayed the removal of the embargo until a writ was to be served upon them. Later the embargo was removed, but Coopers complained that, although they had the dip ready to ship to Australia, the Commonwealth Government would not put it in either the first, second, or third degree of preference for shipping space. All the time certain people were trying to strengthen the embargo until they got their own industries established under its protection. The local firm to which I have already referred as having _ desired neither a duty nor an embargo, were induced to enter ii>to arrangements for the purpose of complying with the requests of the Government, and nobody knows better than the Minister that owing to large sums they had to expend for arsenic and other materials bought at high prices they overreached themselves financially. They had been told that the production of sheep dip was a national necessity, and to assist the Government they embarked upon this enterprise. But the Government were not able to keep their promise to them, because Cooper's dip and others were being imported, and the local firms found themselves in possession of an enormous quantity of dip that was absolutely unsaleable. This Sydney firm was treated scandalously. It is the duty of any Government to make every effort to supply the producers with insecticides that will most effectively prevent the deterioration of our wool and keep our orchards free of pests. Mr Fenton!-But for the way which the secondary industries stood by them, during the war, the primary industries would have gone to the wall.",23
54,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"A certain section of producers wan ted the 'higher grade article, and they were content to pay a bigger price for the imported dip than for the local product.",24
55,Mr CORSER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Are not Coopers manufacturing in Australia now?,24
56,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Yes ; and they are asking for protection. They were forced to come here as an alternative to losing their trade. But they say that the protection given in this schedule is useless, because of the heavy duties placed on almost every ingredient required in the manufacture of their product. I repeat that other local firms were able to carry on profitably without a duty before Coopers established themselves in Australia.",24
57,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,And they used practically the same ingredients.,24
58,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"No . Cooper's dip is an insecticide, and some of the others are merely stimulants.",24
59,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"It is very important that we should secure the best chemical and bacteriological advice in connection with the manufacture of insecticide for the destruction of pests, and especially it is dangerous to do anything which may prevent the people of Australia from getting the very best insecticide. I have received letter after letter from orehardists asking me to endeavour to have these special duties removed. They prefer to buy certain preparations. It may be true that the imported article is double the price of that which is locally manufactured; but would any one be inclined to pay the higher price if the lower-priced article was equally effective? In the destruction of some germ or pest the cost lies, not so much in the amount paid for the dip or insecticide as in the amount of labour employed. The cost of an article which requires to be used three or four times a year becomes enormous. Insecticides ought to be permitted to come in free of duty, because anything tending in the slightest degree to injure, for example, the pastoral industry, which has done so much to develop Australia, must receive the gravest in consideration. The special plea put forward by Coopers was that by reason of their old association with the manufacture of sheep dip they have been in the position to send chemists and bacteriologists all over the world inquiring into the treatment of various diseases, and, as a result, have been able to make a preparation of such a high degree of perfection that it would imperil our industry torefuse to permit its entry into Australia. ""We want the best the world can supply, and we can only get that with a free market.",24
60,Mr CORSER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Cooper s have established themselves in Australia now.,24
61,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"But that fact does not insure the Australian pastoralists getting the very best sheep dip. The last word in the matter of research work has not yet been said. Coopers are a great firm, and have a very high name in the world as manufacturers of this article; but they are not the only manufacturers, and other investigations are in progress. That is why I say it is essential we should get the very best the world can supply.",24
62,Mr CORSER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,We have several factories in Australia trying to do that.,24
63,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,""" Trying,"" yes.",24
64,Mr CORSER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,And succeeding admirably.,24
65,Mr RICXAXD FOSTER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"They tried under practically a free Tariff. Mr GREGORY!-Yes . The Minister had the advertisement, of one Australian firm, in which they stated that they wanted neither a duty nor an embargo. Apparently they were doing remarkably well, and were quite satisfied to carry on under the old conditions. If I had moved an amendment to this item I would have moved to remove the duty altogether, hut I shall support the reduction moved for by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming).",25
66,Mr GREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Gustoms) [3.45] - I should not let the remarks'of ""the honourable member for Dampier pass without ,-- word or two in reply, because the setting in which he .put the subject hardly did justice to himself or to the Government. I need not rake up a lot of old history already repeated on this floor over and .over again.",25
67,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,And in regard to which the Minister made a lot of .promises.,25
68,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Promise s S,25
69,Mr GMSQOBY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Yes . I can quote them from Hansard if you require to reminded of them; the promises, for example, in regard to the time the emwas bargo was to remain in force.",25
70,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I cannot recall any circumstances or set of conditions where I made a definite promise to the House which I have not endeavoured to carry into effect, and if the honourable her can .point to any particular assist instance - in whioh I have not carried out a promise, all I can say is that I am not aware of it , and if it is my power to .do 80s I shall fulfil promise. ' It is quite true that the ticular firm of which the honourable ber spoke advertised that they were ing to carry on without any embargo duty, bnt they did that .at a period when the publio mind was more or less excited over the question of the embargo, .they have since \ approached the Governing), ment, and asked for a considerable of money as compensation, on the ground that we did not fulfil our promise to on the embargo at the time when we said we would put it on. So far from not quiring any embargo, they are tiating with the Government for compensation because we did not put oneon, have though at the time they advertised that they did not require an .embargo or any' duty. But that was to help them to self? their goods, and not because they really did not want a duty or an embargo.",25
71,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"That is absolutely incorrect, because the Minister removed the embargo. He did not carry, out the promise he made to them.",25
72,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Pardo n me, the embargo was on.",25
73,Mr GREGORY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Of course it was,' but the Minister had to remove it .",25
74,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"It was on, and was kept on until the Tariff was imposed. X made a definite promise to the House that all embargoes would be lifted when .the Tariff was laid' on the table. That promise was carried out, and, among others,- the sheep dip embargo was removed. But that was not the trouble of these people. Their trouble was that the embargo had not been put on as early as they thought it would be. imposed, and they say that in that period a large quantity of dip was imported, which made it impossible for them to sell their stocks. Let me recall the circumstances under which this was done. Originally the be British Munitions Department requested the Australian Government to see if it possible for Australia's sheep dip re, quirements to be made, in Australia, thus avoiding the drain upon certain stocks, in' Britain required for munition purposes. Everybody understands that it was the desire of the Australian Government, and memthe people of the Commonwealth, to in every possible way in the great struggle in which we were engaged, and an effort was made to see if it was posi n sible to carry out this desire, nnd manumy facture within Australia from the raw parmaterials already in this country the memthings we ' so much needed. Certain willmanufacturers, including Coopers, were or approached at the time, and they said they were not prepared to do as suggested. I do not think the statement of the honor-' and able member for. Robertson (Mr Flemthat at the time Coopers were not sum the only dip manufacturers to be considered, is correct. The whole of the put controversy ranged round the question' of Cooper's dip; because the product of that refirm was used throughout the length and now negobreadth of the country.",25
75,Mr CORSER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,For sheep!,25
76,Mr GIBSON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,That is the point.,25
77,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"As the honourable member for Robertson suggests, there arc people who use other dips; but the great bulk of the flock-masters throughout Australia rely largely' on the product of Coopers.",26
78,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Cooper' s dip may have the largest sale in the world, but that is no reason why we should be compelled io use it.",26
79,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I do not suggest that. The controversy ranged round Cooper's dip at the time. Now that Coopers are established here, and have brought all their experience with tliem, a determined effort'should be made to keep them here. It would be a short-sighted policy on our part if we followed the example of other countries and left our ports open so that we could have the experience of the world at our command when we have already had established in this country one of the best, if not the best, manufacturer of sheep dip known.",26
80,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"But , surely, there are other manufacturers?",26
81,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Of course there are, and I am not saying anything whatever against the quality of the dips produced by other manufacturers. I was merely pointing out that the manufacturers of a dip which is spoken very highly of are already established in Australia.",26
82,Mr JOWETT,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,There are some very good Australian dips.,26
83,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) uses Australian sheep dip very extensively, and I suppose he is ono of the largest flock-anasters in Australia. I presume the honourable member, is as capable of judging the value of the dips he uses as any other man.",26
84,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I . am sorry the Minister is not moving for an increase.,26
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I am not entirely satisfied with the duties we are imposing, but I am inclined to think they are sufficient. It must also be remembered that this industry is a very useful adjunct to the mining industry.",26
86,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,But the dips we quire are not manufactured from arsenic or mineral compounds.,26
87,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Can the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) give the constituent elements of these dips?,26
88,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,They contain a variety of things.,26
89,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Can the honourable member indicate what is the principal commodity in a dip of the kind he has is mind? There are some dips which are more in the nature of disinfectants.,26
90,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Some stimulate the growth of wool.,26
91,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"They are not the dips of which I am speaking. This industry is a very useful adjunct to mining, and I _ believe it is coming to the rescue of some part of that industry at a very critical period. Difficulty has been experienced in the past in connection with our arsenical and sulphide ores, and here we have an opportunity of building up a secondary industry which will be of great assistance, to mining. The honourable member for New England (Mr. Hay) will agree that in the"" district he represents mining prospects have been considerably improved in consequence of mines being opened up for the production of ores used for this particular purpose. The duties we are imposing are low; but I hope they aro not too lew.",26
92,Mr STEWART,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,They are low for the Minister.,26
93,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I would like to make them higher. When America commenced the manufacture of sheep dip's, she imposed a duty of DO por cent., and naturally manufacturers immediately established works in that country.",26
94,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,We knock her end on in wool.,26
95,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Yes , but we have a different climate, and I am sure the honourable member for Robertson would not like us to think that the difference has been brought about merely because a different type of dip has been used.",26
96,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I did not suggest that.,26
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"That is the inference to be drawn from the honourable member's interjection. Some of the South American Republics imposed a duty of 75 per cent, on imported dips when they established industries of their own, with the result that the particular manufacturers who were exporting to South reAmerica, commenced manufacturing in that country. If it had not been for the embargo, in all probability Coopers would not have established a plant here. But they are here, and we should endeavour to make the conditions such that they will be prepared to remain. If the proposed duties, which, have been referred to as a burden, are passed on, they will not be a handicap to those who have to use this commodity, because the additional cost will be a mere bagatelle per sheep per year.",26
98,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Robertson) [4.0] The Minister's own statement is the best argument which, could be advanced for ihe reduction of the duty on British dips. He says that this firm, when there was an embargo, was able to sell its dips here, but . that as soon as the embargo was removed it felt that it had been damaged to the extent of some Â£30,000.",27
99,Mr GREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I did not say anything of the sort.,27
100,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"The Minister said the imported. something to the effect that this firm was coming upon-.the. Government for about Â£30,000. Sid not the Minister say that the company in question was asking compensation to that extent for its losses",27
101,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I . said nothing of the kind. These people, I repeat, are making application ,to the Government for retical t muneration,, or compensation, because we did not impose the embargo earlier.",27
102,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I am sorry that misunderstood the Minister. I took remark to refer, to one of .the firms is still carrying on. However, there are one or two other aspects to which I desire to allude. Under the old Tariff, sheep dips were admitted free; and, according to a report which I have in my Tariff Commission recommended'that they be placed on the list of. special exemptions. The Government should take not to damage the greatest of all Australian industries in the interests of a very industry. That is not only my view, but, evidently, the view which the bers of the Tariff ' Commission took. Another important point has to do with the difference ip the prices of ported and locally-made dips. Surely, if the Australian-made dips are as as those from overseas, they can be sold special imported lines. successfully at the same prices. There are not as many as 2 per cent, among sheep-growers of Australia who prefer to use the imported rather than locally-produced dip, if the quality the same. Among the primary producers, the other dips are not poisonous. there is a very strong desire to use tralian products first and every time, long as the latter are as good as those made overseas. But .where it is essential for the maintenance of anindustry that the very best among the world's products shall be employed in special circumstances, producers naturally feel bound to forego their predilection for the Australian article,, and to get the very best, particularly if it be a British manufacture. I quote the following comparison of prices of four imported and four locally-made sheep dips. Those for the imported dips are, respectively, Â£4 5s., Â£4,. Â£4 5s., and Â£4 5s. per 100 lbs.; while the prices for the four Australian lines are, Â£4, Â£3 12s. 6d., Â£3 12s. 6d., and Â£3 12s. 6d. It is evident, then, that the locally-made dips can be sold for considerably less than",27
103,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Cooper' s is a locaJlymade dip, and that is sold at 85s.",27
104,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"My whole point is for that the imported dips' are generally ? dearer than the local, and that wool growers only buy the more expensive lines because they believe, after years of pracexperience, that the imported suits their purposes better than the local , dip. Their view is that the one class of dip will I not do as good work, allover Australia, his and. with different kinds of sheep, as which another. The wool-grower knows that he must' have Ms dip to suit his locality. One of the most important lessons to be learned in the field of primary production is that local conditions very often, hand, the break down all theories.",27
105,Mr COBBER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Does the honourable memcare ber Bay that none of the twelve Australian makers is turning out the class minor of dip of which he is now speaking?,27
106,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Not one of the memfirms is making the particular dip which numbers of graziers prefer to use,' as I . say, in special ' circumstances. There the imhas been an attempt made in Aus: tralia recently to produce a ..dip. which good would have the same effect as certain I am not acquainted with the position at the moment, the and cannot say, therefore, whether the would Australian makers have succeeded in thetheir endeavours. Cooper's is a poiwere sonous, or arsenical, dip, while some of The AusMinister has pleaded for support for the so mining industry, in that certain of its products go to the making of sheep dips.. I would remind honourable members that there, are two distinct kinds of dip. Most of them are like Cooper's; that is to say, they are made of arsenical compounds. But, in the manufacture of others, arsenic is not employed. There are such varied ingredients as phenyle, nicotine, oil, and sulphur. As a matter of fact, a grazier could make his own dip; but, in these days of specialization, it is likely to be a mistake to do so. A wool-grower needs the very best adjuncts that he can possibly secure, seeing that his product has to compete with the highest classes of wool in the world's markets. requires most particular handling in order to achieve the best results. Australia's good name depends upon this Committee exercising sufficient common sense to give to growers a proper choice of the things with which to produce the best wool. Some of the dips do not act, in any sense, as insecticides, but as stimulants and as a protection to the wool. I appeal to honourable members to vote for tide reduction of the degree of protection enjoyed by local makers as against British manufactures. Surely the present rates are sufficient to give our own people a commanding lead in the Australian market, while still permitting the superior imported dips to be purchased here.'",27
107,Mr COBSEB,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Wide Bay) [4.8] - I again impress on honourable members that there are in Australia twelve established factories for the making of sheep and cattle dips. The makers claim that they are supplyingas good a line, 'both for sheep and for cattle, as any overseas manufacturer. They are also . turning out. different classes of dip, to suit varied and particular purposes, in regard to the especial treatment of different fleeces. They claim, further, that in order to stabilize the industry they should be adequately protected against outside competition. They do not wish to increase their prices, but desire to have the Australian market to themselves, as they should ""have, and would bave, if proper and sufficient protection were granted.",28
108,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,As they would have if they made the right dip.,28
109,Mr CORSER,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"They are as good as any imported dips. Every one of the twelve Australian firms has asked for additional protection. They consider it essential mainly for the reason that the ingredients used already carry high protective duties-higher , in the main, than that upon the finished product itself. The local manufacturers state that if , instead of the duties of 20 per cent, and 30 per cent., now proposed, the duties of 30 per cent., 35 per cent., and 40 per cent., for which they asked, had heen granted, the cost to the users, even i i i that event, would have been only 37s. per 1,000 head of stock dipped. The increased rate of 10 per cent, asked for would mean Wool an increase of only 3s. 9d. per 1,000 head of stock, so that such increase would not be a matter of much concern. We have to consider the advantages which the encouragement of this industry will confer upon Australia. In the first place, it means that the employment involved in the manufacture of these dips will be secured to our own people. It is pointed out, secondly, that several new industries for the production of the raw materia] will be established here. Then, again, the primary industries, and especially those engaged in stock raising, will be protected against failure of supplies, and stock-owners will, also be insured against any inordinate increase in prices. Already there are twelve firms manufacturing dips in Australia, and if this duty is agreed to, other British firms may be induced, as Coo pen have been, to establish their industry here. We must all recognise that it would be a great advantage to have these dips manufactured on the spot, and our own men employed in producing them, instead of being compelled to satisfy our requirements by importations from overseas. 1 urge the Minister (Mr Greene) not to give way to the demand for a decreased duty. My only regret is that the honourable gentleman has not moved to increase the present rates; but I hope he will do so.",28
110,Mr GIBSON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Corangamite) [4.14] I hope that the Minister (Mr Greene) will agree to the amendment to reduce by 10 per cent, the duty on British dips. Australia has probably been more successful in dealing with the pests and diseases that attack stock than any other country, and we need the best scientific knowledge and appliances to cope with tick and other pests. The State Governments compel us to dip our sheep, and we want the best dip that is available. Tariff. To my own knowledge, men have been using a sheep dip which does not kill the tick, while others are using dips which, as the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) has said, is destroying the wool on the sheep. I could give iustances where sheep have been dipped in a material that has largely destroyed the % growth* of the fleece for the coming season. If it were necessary, I could give the names of the sheep-owners who have had this experience and that of the dip they have used.",28
111,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Was it because dip was of Australian manufacture that it had these bad results ?,29
112,Mr GIBSON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"It was not a good dip, and, unfortunately, it was of Australian manufacture.",29
113,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) will tell the honourable member of the effectiveness of Australian dips.,29
114,Mr GIBSON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,The honourable member for Grampians draws his experience from a State where tick in sheep is not as bad as it is in Victoria.,29
115,Mr JOWETT,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I have in mind the Riverina district; there are plenty of ticks there.,29
116,Mr GIBSON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I know of a scientific man who was induced to use an Australian dip, which proved to be quite ineffective, with the result that his sheep that year were very much troubled with ticks. Since then he has used the imported article. Practically the whole of the farmers and graziers in the Western District of Victoria, where the finest wool that the world can produce is grown, nse imported dips. Their men know how to .mix the imported dips; they know the ex'act proportions required for an effective dipping, but if we impose this duty, with the result that the imported article is no longer available Jo them, they will be working in the dark. They will have to use some of the local preparations, which up to the present have not proved satisfactory. For the most part, mported dips are used in my electorate, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to make some concession so far as British dips are concerned.",29
117,Dr MALONEY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Melbourne) [4.17] I intend to support the item as proposed by the Government. If the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming.) had [21 JUNE, 1921.] Tariff. 9183 moved to increase instead of to reduce these duties, he would have had my support. The honourable member said that local manufacturers could not satisfy all our requirements. My answer to him is lhat the higher we make the dudes the greater will be the probability of British manufacturers following the example of Coopers, and establishing factories in our midst. Some honourable members seem to think that it would be impossible for local manufacturers of sheep dips to follow the formulas of British manufacthe turers. I would suggest to the Minister that in the case of every imported preparation, we should require the formula to be stated on the package or bottle. It is difficult to obtain a perfect analysis n'f any organic chemical, but the most definite analysis can be made of any inorganic body such as arsenic. Traces of arsenic have been found in mummies 2,000 years old. That will give the Committee some idea of the lasting effects of that chemical. I hope the item will be agreed to.",29
118,Mr HAY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,New England) [4.19] - Did I understand the Minister (Mr Greene) to say that local manufacturers of dips had given him an undertaking not to increase their prices?,29
119,Mr GREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"They have addressed to me a letter to the effect that if the additional duty is granted, they will not increase the price.",29
120,Mr HAY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"In the event of the item being passed as introduced, and the local manufacturers increasing their prices, will the proposed Tariff Board have power to deal with them?",29
121,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Unde r the Bill that I propose to introduce, the Board will have that power.",29
122,Mr HAY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Then , users of these dips will not have to pay more if the item be passed as introduced. I take it that those who are engaged in the production of sheep dip in Australia ""at the. present ; time are producing an article which is satisfactory to our wool-growers. Their desire is not to increase the price, but to secure to themselves ihe Australian market. Are we not shrieking for increased population in this country? Is it not essential and urgent that we should make provision for people who come here, and develop our mineral industry, amongst 9184 Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] others? God knows that the mineral industry is down and out at present.  voice like that came from that corner.",29
123,Mr HAY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"It is not the. first time. I know that in the north of New South Wales very large arsenical deposits have been developed for the purpose of manufacturing dips. The question of supreme importance to me, in a great many of these essential products, is the danger which this country runs in the event of being cut off from imported supplies. We are informed that satisfactory dips are being made in Australia, and the Minister tells us that undertakings have been given that the prices will not be increased,"" that the market is required for our own people to develop our own industries, and that if prices are increased the proposed Tariff Board will be in a position to deal with those responsible.",30
124,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Kooyong) [4.22]. - I hope the Minister will see his way to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser).,30
125,Mr HAY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,That has been defeated.,30
126,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,The amendment before the Committee aims at reducing the British preferential rate.,30
127,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I am certain that the Minister will not entertain a proposal of that kind.,30
128,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Because you have not heard the arguments.,30
129,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I nave made myself acquainted with this case. The very object which we have sought to attain by our Protectionist policy has beon achieved. in this instance. Coopers, the makers of a well-known and recognised dip, which is very popular in Australia, have established a factory in the Commonwealth, and have already expended -Â£75,000 on it, and contemplate a vast further expenditure. That at once affords us a guarantee of the quality of the dip that will be locally manufactured. There was never a case where we were more, justified in giving encouragement to local industry. I should imagine that that firm were given to understand that they would receive the necessary encouragement and protection, and for that reason incurred the expenditure mentioned. In the fact that a numTariff. ber of other local factories are established, we have also a guarantee as to the price. The local manufacturer suffers from a serious disadvantage in this case, becauso the maker in the Old Country has his raw material free, and immediately at hand, and is therefore able to export at a fairly low rate. The Australian manufacturer has this difficulty to contend with, that we are also trying to establish a subordinate industry, from which he draws his raw material, and have already extended to it a protection of 25 per cent. Therefore, as the raw material of the sheep-dip industry is not free in Australia, then, until the local product is available, that industry naturally suffers disadvantage to that extent. In the circumstances, the Committee should extend to it reasonable encouragement.",30
130,Mr STEWART,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"You are arguing that, owing to the existence of a duty on it, the price of the raw material is higher.",30
131,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"There is practically no protection, in the circumstances, to the local sheep-dip industry; but I am given to understand that the arsenic industry is rapidly growing, so that the local raw material will soon be available.",30
132,Mr GIBSON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"The local product is selling at 8s. per 100 lbs. less than the imported. Sir ROBERT' BEST - Exactly . We have a guarantee as to the price and a guarantee as to the quality. The well known makers who have established themselves here are prepared not only to supply the local market, but also to expand tlieir industry and to provide for an export trade from Australia. In the eircumstances, we are not dealing fairly or justly by these people if we do not give them substantial protection, and the modest, proposal in this schedule should bo readily conceded. It is not really a protection at all to the sheep-dip industry, in view of the duty on the raw material.",30
133,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,They tell us that they want this protection to enable them to nso the raw material which we produce here.,30
134,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Is not the honourable member desirous of producing the raw material here?,30
135,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Certainly ; but you cannot have it both ways. Sir ROBE RT BEST - Then the honourable member cannot hesitate to give the necessary aid aud protection to tnis industry, because the raw material cannot be used here unless encouragement is given to the local manufacture of sheep dip.' The one industry is dependent on the other. The arsenical industry is encouraged directly by the T a r if f , but there will be no market for its product unless the sheep-dip industry is concurrently established. I regret that the Committee would not entertain the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, but the rates in the schedule are so modest that honourable members in the Ministerial corner are not doing themselves justice in opposing them.",30
136,Mr FENTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,The Minister Senate may propose an increase in this duty.,31
137,Sir ROBERTBEST,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I sincerely hope that we shall do justice to ourselves, and to this Australian industry. amount which is involved, so far as the pastoralist is concerned, is so trifling that it is not worth considering.",31
138,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"You are going to do Â£750,000 worth of damage for the sake of the Â£75,000 you speak of.",31
139,Sir ROBERTBEST,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"It is very easy for the honourable member to say that, but the' facts are against him. most unreasonable for any one to oppose a duty of this kind, and, personally, I should have been glad if even further consideration than the Minister has proposed could be given. The manufacturers abroad are doing what we invite them to do by our Tariff-establishin g their industry locally, and are prepared to spend even more than they have already done, and they are only one of twelve firms. Why then should we not give them the necessary aid and encouragement ?",31
140,Mr HAY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Did I understand the M i nister to say that at a later stage he would - state to what extent the increased duty would affect the price?,31
141,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.31] - I understand that if the whole of the 10 per oent. were passed on, the price would represent an extra 3s. 9d. per 1,000 sheep dipped.",31
142,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I thought that was the explanation given by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser).,31
143,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Yes , but the Committee has rejected his amendment.

I do not propose, at this stage at all events, to take up much time in dealing with this item. Honourable members know NOES. that many of our ores, in conjunction with other metals, hold large quantities of sulphur. This sulphur is very often one of the greatest detriments to the reG. covery of the precious metals, but, at the same time, if it can be used, it becomes of itself valuable, and in this way an enormous assistance to mining is afforded.",32
154,Mr HAY,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"New England) [ 4 . 5 5 ] - I should like to impress on honourable members the very great importance of this item. At the present time the metal i dustries in Australia are at a very low ebb, ancl sulphur is one of the by-proBy ducts which will in a very large measure assist in restoring the profitable working of mines, and afford employment to large numbers of our people. U p to the prebut sent we have imported practically the whole of our sulphur from Asiatic tries and the United States of America. Before the war a great deal came to this eountry from Spain at a very low rate, as ballast. We know that Asiatic countries produce their commodities by means of cheap labour, and that those employed does that mean? work very long hours daily. I have not the figures for the importations to Ausworked tralia, but I have the information as to duties mean. New South Wales. Last year New South Wales imported 12,500 tons, so that fairly clear that the total quantity imported into Australia must be about at present is Â£7 16s. 40,000 tons. In 1914-15 the price paid for Japanese sulphur was Â£ 4 14s. 4d. ton, and that price rose in 1920 to Â£ 1 3 cent. l is . 4d. In 1918-19 America sent only 188 tons, but for the nine months of 1920-21 there was imported from the United States of America into New South Wales 12,300 tons. The whole of that sulphur could be produced in this try at our sulphur-producing mines at Broken Hill and elsewhere. Sulphur, we all know, is used in the of a great many industries, such as the production of chemicals generally, superhope phosphates, explosives, galvanizing and steel, in the refining of copper, zinc, gold, and silver, the manufacture of paper, and so for t h. It will beaseen the development of this industry is of great importance to Australia . * We sulphide mines throughout the country, and in Tasmania quite recently something he has proposed. like Â£250,000 has been expended for the purpose of producing sulphuric suggest that under the circumstances the Minister (Mr Greene) should agree to higher duties than those he has proposed. I may explain that the reason sulphur is now coming into this country America, instead of Japan and other Asiatic countries, is that freights are favour of America at the present time. Later on, however, it is quite possible that freights may turn round again favour of Asiatic countries, and it seems to me that we ought not ""to be in danger in time of war, for instance, of being off from .supplies of this basic product. n - If we were thus cut off, Australia would find herself in a. very unhappy position. producing sulphur for ourselves we should, as I have said, afford employment for considerable numbers of our own people, not only in primary industries, in secondary industries. I movesThat the amendment be amended by making counthe duties as follows :Sulphur per ton, British, 40s.; internmediate, 60s.; general, 80s.

162,Mr BOWDEN,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Nepean) [5.5] - I the Minister (Mr Greene) will not iron accept the amendment. Sulphur is the basis of the orehardists' spray, and the duties proposed by the Minister are quite that bad enough without any increase. Sulphur is one of the principal ingredients have in superphosphates; and I hope the Minister will adhere to the ample duties",33
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I regard the duties I acid. I propose as sufficient.,33

When in - the Minister proposes a duty, however high, there is an - end of the matter. No matter what, the item may be, wire netting cut or anything else, we are told that the proposed duty means only so much per ton or per cent., but what we have to look at is the aggregate of all these duties imposed on the commodities required by the primary producer.",33
166,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,This sulphur production can be held to be a primary industry.,34
167,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Thes o duties will establish a local industry.,34
168,Mr STEWART,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Yes ; at the expense of another industry. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has argued, in regard to one industry, that simply because there is a higher duty on the raw material for that industry, there should be a still higher duty on the finished article. The honourable member laid down the principle that the effect of a duty is to increase the cost of the raw material; and sulphur enters largely into the manufacture of superphosphates, which arc of prime necessity to those on the land. The primary producers have no preserve for themselves, but must go into the world's market; they must pay Protectionists' prices for all they require, and accept black-labour rates for what they produce. The Ministry are simply piling on duties to build up secondary industrieseverything for the manufacturers, and to hell with the primary producers - ister",34
169,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Robertson) [5.10] I ask .the Minister to consent to reduce the duties he is now threatening to impose on the fruit-growers of this country. They have quite sufficient burdens to bear at present. During the war, and during the last few years - they did remarkably well, but now that we have returned to normal conditions, they are finding it very difficult to carry on. We are told that this is only a small increase, but these small increases in the aggregate represent a tremendous burden on the primary producers of Australia. The fruit growing industry affords a greater number of people an opportunity to earn a comfortable living on small areas than does almost any other industry that could be named. It is not a great money-producing industry, and does not assist to any great extent in helping us to carry our burden of debt; but it does afford a means for the settlement of a great number of fam'lies under healthy and happy conditions. We are going to spend many thousands of pounds in bringing people to Australia from overseas.",34
170,Mr STEWAET,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,We aro spending hundreds of thousands of pounds in Victoria alone in putting returned soldiers on fruit blocks.,34
171,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"We are doing the same in the other States. In the district which I represent in New South Wales, a great many returned soldiers have been settled on orchard blocks. I ask the Minister to display some little sympathy for people who are endeavouring to continue in primary production. These imposts are driving people away from the land. The position is becoming intensely serious ""though many members of the Committee seem unable to realise it. In our industrial civilization there is a tendency for people to drift to the cities, and it sliould be our aim to counteract that tendency to engage in industries which sap the vitality of our people. Every honourable member will agree that the healthiest and most vigorous people are those who are brought up under country conditions, and there is no industry which produces a healthier and happier people than does the fruit-growing industry. Yet here we are on almost every line in this Tariff adding to the burdens rhey are asked to sustain. The Minhas been good enough to remove the duty imposed on nicotine sprays because they are not produced in this country.",34
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Tb e duty on nicotine .sprays cost the orehardists far more than the duty on sulphur.,34
173,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"The removal of the duty on. nicotine sprays may afford orehardists some little help, though in a negative way, because there was no necessity for such a duty, and there was no call for it, aud no pressure brought to bear to secure its imposition.",34
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,We did not intend to cover nicotine spray3. It was only after the Tariff was tabled that we found that our definition covered them.,34
175,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I am glad that the Minister has removed the duty on nicotine sprays, and while I give him credit for doing so I think that very little credit is due to him, because such a duty should never have been imposed. In this case some slight pressure has been brought to bear by those engaged in an industry that is quite as capable of carrying on as is tlic fruit-growing industry. If the Minister could show us how we can give Protection to fruit-growers to make up for these duties, I should be prepared to accept them. Can he tell us of any way in which we can protect the fruit-grower? The fruit-grower is today called upon to pay increased duties on implements, fencing wire, wire netting, building material, and, in fact, on everything that he wears or uses for carrying on his industry. There seems to be no limit to the burdens which the Committee is prepared to impose upon him.",34
176,Mr JOWETT,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Whor e is the Committee now?,35
177,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Apparently , in the billiard-rooms or other places of recreation, although some may be attending to their correspondence. They should be here to assist us to protect the primary producer.",35
178,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.],35
179,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I am glad that the honourable member has called for a quorum, because it is time that honourable members gave some consideration to tbese items which pres3 so heavily on the primary producer. The fruit-grower has already sufficient burdens to carry, but since this Tariff came under review honourable members have been piling further burdens on him. When we move for a reduction of duty to give some relief to one of the greatest primary industries of this country, a city member comes along with an amendment to add to the burdens of those engaged in that industry, and the Minister accepts it. It will bo impossible for those people to continue their industry if the voice of the city is to be heard in this overwhelming way in this Committee. I move That the amendment he amended by making the duty on sulphur, per ton, British, intermediate, 20s.; general, 50s. I submit that amendment in the hope that honourable members will realise that the burdens that are being imposed on lb. primary producers are becoming altoonly gether too heavy for him to bear. It is not fair to bolster up one industry the expense of another, which is producprices ing the most vigorous people we have i Australia. If there is one thing for which ket. we have been noted ih the past, it is the vigour, vitality, and happy outlook of the people of our country districts, and now it is proposed to sacrifice the industry which is responsible for those people in order to benefit city industries, which never in the history of the world have produced such people.",35
180,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.21] - 1I have no objection at all to accept the honourable member's amendment. I think it is fair to say that the reason is that importations of sulphur fall under the general Tariff. The other duties are submitted in case reciprocal relationships may subsequently be established with different countries. Most of the sulphur imported comes from Japan, while some is imported from America.",35
181,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,It might be imported from countries other than Japan and America.,35
182,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"I say that I am quite prepared to accept the amendment. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) has said that there is no protection afforded by this Tariff to fruit growers. I say that that is not so. There are many items in the Tariff which give fruit-growers a very substantial protection indeed. For instance, there is a duty of 100 per cent, on dried fruits. That is one of the highest duties in the Tariff. I do not think that oven the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) would oppose that duty. There are many hundreds of people engaged in the production of dried fruits. .",35
183,Mr STEWART,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,We can get more for sultanas outside of Australia than we can get here.,35
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,That may be so at the moment. . Mr STEWART - It was so during the war.,35
185,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"That may be so, but los.; under normal conditions the honourable member must be aware that a duty of 100 per cent, is a tremendously high duty. Then there is a duty on lemons of l d . per There is a duty on apples. The season of the year when there is an importation of apples is when cold-stored at supplies are carried over, aud bigger are asked for them, or when the n early frui t is just .coming on to the marWe have a duty of 6s. per central on apples. I might quote ever so many more duties which we have imposed in favour of the primary producer. To say that under this Tariff we have given no protection to the fruit-growers, apart from the protection on jams, is to say what is entirely contrary to the facts.

Is it unreasonable, therefore, to ask him to pay what is, after all, a comparatively minor impost? What burden does the sulphur duty place on the lemongrower in comparison with the assistance he gets from the duty of I d . per lb. on citrus fruits?",36
187,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Who m duty on sulphur protect?,36
188,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,It is the one duty that will protect the mining industry.,36
189,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"This is one of the very' few ways in which we can materially assist an industry which in the present circumstances is in sore straits. giving this assistance in connection with arsenical and sulphide ores, we can do something to put the industry on a better basis. I have given most serious consideration to the question of imposing a duty on sulphur.",36
190,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,Do you think that it will really help the big companies?,36
191,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,There is no question as to that.,36

I feel that in all the circumstances the duly is warranted. long time before asking the Committee than we do. to agree to it , but I am satisfied that we may well impose it without placing any undue burden on any other industry in which sulphur is used. In regard to superphosphates, all the manufacturers, with, possibly, one exception, have assured me that owing to the arrangements they have been able to make they can guarantee that the duty on sulphur will uot necessitate any increase in the price of superphosphates. As a matter of In many re- fact, the representatives of the mining companies ancl the superphosphate manufacturers interviewed me together.",36

199,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Melbourne Ports) ' [ 5 . 3 2 ] - I can understand some honourable members making a fight against duties which they consider are likely to be injurious to certain interests, but the honourable member for F r a n k l in (Mr . MCWilliams) is amongst those who are opposed to any duty on any article that can be manufactured in Australia. How such members were ever elected to this House, I cannot understand. . Those must be peculiar constituents who will send a man to Parliament to vote against everything Australian. The Minister (Mr . Greene) could have enumerated a great many other articles upon which a duty is imposed for the 'benefit of the primary producer. We hear too much of that cry about driving men off the land. Have the primary producers been driven off the land in the United States of America and Canada, two of the most highly-protected countries in the world?",36
200,Mr STEWART,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,The farmers in those I hesitated a countries get much cheaper implements,36

I object to being told that I dethat sire to drive the farmer off the land. is not my desire, and, in any case, i would be a very foolish policy. I hold no brief for the Minister (Mr Greene), who is well able to look after himself; but he represents a constituency essentially agricultural, and as I suppose he hopes to remain in oublic life longer than the term of this Parliament, he would not be likely to propose duties which he regarded as injurious to the peopio whom he represents.",37

206,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,"Yes , because I . am glad to see the representative of a pricent.; mary-production constituency declaring per cent. that Australia can, and should, produce the things she needs. I do not object to the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), the honourable member for Franklin *(Mr MCWilliams), and some of the old sinners who represent Victorian farming constituencies, raising the cry that an attempt is being made to injur the farmer; but I do not like to see a young man like the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) repeating the statement that we desire to - ruin the rural interests.",37
207,Mr FLEMING,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,It is not so much what the honourable member is trying to do as what he is doing.,37
208,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF WOODEN,I was in this House when the 1906 Tariff was introduced.,37

224,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Wilmot) [5.55] - I . trust the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) will agree 'to make arsenate of lead a separate item and to sult. amend the duties. This commodity is very largely used by fruit-growers, and it is of the greatest importance that plies of a satisfactory quality should be available at a reasonable price. I suppose it can be said that orehardists settle the land in the closest possible manner. A large number of orchards can be established on a few square miles of country, giving employment to many hands. The importance of fruit-growing as an industry cannot be overestimated; and, considering the attention devoted to it in the different States of the Commonwealth, it can be regarded as one of our most successful primary industries. It would be folly to footer an industry manufacturing arsenate of lead by high Protective duties at the expense of a much more important business, such as that of fruit growing. I feel it somewhat useless asking the Minister to agree to amended duties, because I have formed the opinion, when in the chair and on the floor of this House, that whatever the Minister decides upon is not likely to be altered. However, in an endeavour to improve the position, I move That the following words be added after subitem (A ) : - "" And on and after 22nd June. 1921 (AA) Arsenate of lead, ad val., British, free; intermediate, 15 per cent.; general, 20 geneArsenate of lead is a necessary chemical that is used extensively in the destruction of codlin moth.

225,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"It does not hold the general, arsenate in solution long enough.",39
226,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Exactly . These tests were made by the Governments in,39
227,Mr GREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Has the honourable member the results of the tests before him?,39
228,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I have the South Australian tests, which show an opposite re",39
229,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,And so have I .,39
230,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,The Government suptests gave results as I have indicated.,39
231,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,That is not so.,39
232,Mr GREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I have the South Australian tests here, which show that the arsenate of lead produced in Australia is superior to the others.",40
233,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"If such is the case, it is peculiar that practical men who have to use this chemical strongly favour the imported article.",40
234,Mr BOWDEN,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Yes ; and they are prepared to pay double the price.,40
235,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Yes . If the consumer is agreeable to purchase the imported arsenate at an increased price, it shows that there is really no need for a Protective duty. Industries for the local manufacture of this commodity have been established for twelve or thirten years, and some of the manufacturers boast that their sales are larger than those of the imtoo much? ported article. The orchardist deserves special consideration because, during the war period and since the termination of hostilities, he has had to encounter numerous difficulties. During the war he was unable to ship his fruit abroad, as it was not considered a necessary product, and his sales were confined to the local market. Since that time the shipping position has been against him, as a freight of 8s. per bushel has been charged on apples shipped from Australia to Great Britain. During the war many industries were able to derive considerable financial advantage, but the fruit-growing industry was consideraby hampered. During the year 1919 we produced off 264,000 acres 4,000,000 bushels of apples, which shows that the fruit-growing industry is of sufficient importance to be fostered. A fruitgrower has to contend with pests and parasites, his fruit is subjected to damage by climatic changes, frosts, hailstorms, and high winds, and generally he is in a very precarious position. An applegrower has to work five or six years before he receives any return at all.",40
236,Mr RILEY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,What is the size of the honourable member's orchard ?,40
237,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I do not own an orchard; but many of my friends and constituents are fruit-growers. There are 20"" or 30 miles of orchards on the river Tamar, and I am fully conversant with the difficulties with which the fruit growers have to contend. Large sums of money have been invested in orchards in my electorate and elsewhere, and as many fruit-growers are performing very arduous work for unsatisfactory returns, I am not going to see them prejudiced merely in an endeavour to keep a few people employed in a city industry. The proposed duties work out at, approximately, 4s. per acre, which is equal to the imposition of another land tax. I trust the Minister will consider this matter from a broad, common-sense point of view, and realise that as this and other similar commodities have been produced in the Commonwealth for twelve or thirteen years, and can be sold cheaper than the imported article, there is no necessity to impose such heavy rates. If the tests, as the Minister asserts, establish the superiority of the local product, surely it is unnecessary to have such duties.",40
238,Mr WATT,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Has the Minister proved,40
239,Mr GREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I have not said anything, except by interjection.",40
240,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"The Minister said that he was in possession of the results of tests showing that the local arsenate of lead was superior to the imported lead. If it is cheaper, and the manufacturers can afford to sell it more cheaply, that proves that there is no necessity for any duty.",40
241,Mr WATT,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I have heard the Minister talk about the quality, but have heard nothing concerning prices.",40
242,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I say that the prices of the imported lines are at present 100 per cent, higher; but I am talking of an average over a period of years. The curious thing is that practical men who have spent their lives in growing fruit are the kind who do not hesitate to pay the higher price for the imported products. They are the wiser folk who know what they are asking for.",40
243,Mr WATT,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I know men who still buy imported manures, but they are not wiser men.",40
244,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Perhaps not. But those who bought the local article when the codlin - moth was so bad, last year, found that it would have paid them much better to give'more for the imported. Some of them are now buying the latter article, although prices have been increased. A rate of duty which amounts to a taxof 4s. per acre extra upon the orchardist - coming , as it does, upon all the other numerous disabilities with which he has to contend-is too much of a good thing. I ask the Minister' not to overlook the fact that the fruit-growing industry gives"" employment to great numbers in various other lines of activity. In Melbourne last year, to cite an example, owing to the failure of the apple and pear crop because of the ravages of the codlin moth, there was a serious reduction in the Victorian railway traffic, and a number of men lost employment. I urge the Minister, further, to take particular notice of the prices of the local line as against those of the imported products. Among the latter I mention Swift's, which is about the best of the American brands, and the price of which is Is. 9d.; and Carlton, which is representative of the best British make, the price of which is Is. 8d. Against these, the price of Vallo is 8d.; and of Blyth's Blue Bell, 9d.",40
245,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Robertson) [6.17] - I draw attention to an important test recorded in an undoubted source of authority, namely, the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales. In the volume dated 2nd March, 1920, there is an article entitled, "" The compositions of various lead arsenates,"" by A. A. Ramsay, Principal Assistant Chemist. This article statesAn examination has been made of such brands of arsenate of lead as were procurableon the market in September, 1910.",41
246,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,I have some facts before me dealing with investigations two years later.,41
247,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Mr Ramsay continuesNino samples in all were examined, four of these being in "" paste "" form and five as "" dry powder"". Of the paste forms examined, it w i ll be noted that the moisture content ranged from 34.7 to 47.1, the arsenic acid content from 13.9 to 19.6, and the lead oxide content from 33.9 to 39.5 per cent. Of the dry powder forms examined, the moisture content ranged from 0.2 to 0.8, the arsenic acid from 26 to 29.5 per cent., and the lead oxide from 60.5 to 65.3 per cent. The time that a lead arsenate w i ll remain in suspension is a point worthy of consideration. Other things being equal, any lead arsenate that separated out immediately would be inferior for spraying to one in which the lead arsenate remained in suspension. The r e is a g r a p h accompanying the a r t i c l e , and the letterpress attached statesOn inspecting the graph it is at once see> that Nos. 6 (Vallo), and 8 (Kodgers) separate out with great rapidity, and that the arsenate has fallen out of suspension in less than two minutes. The superiority of No. 4 (Swift's) is also immediately noted, and it will be observed that over a period ot fifteen or seventeen minutes very little arsenate has settled out. The line of No. 9 (Carlton) indicates that it is very slightly inferior to No. 4 (Swift's), but that both are superior to all the others. The graph further indicates that up to three or three and a half minutes there is very little difference in the rate of settlement of the others, viz., Nos. 1 (Electro), 2 (Lewis Berger), 3 ""(Blyth's Blue Bell), 5 (Orchard), and V (Green Cross), ancl, consequently, little to choose between them. At four minutes, however, No. 7 (Green Cross) has practically settled; at five minutes Nos. 2 (Lewis Berger), and 3 (Blyth's Blue Bell) have practically settled; and at five and a half or six minutes Mos. 1 (.Electro), and 5 (Orchard), have practically settled. The graph, therefore, conclusively proves the superiority of No. 4 (Swift's), aDd No. 9 (Carlton) over all other preparations so far as rate of settlement is concerned. That information comes from a source that cannot ba questioned-the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, and the report is made by a man of undoubted ability and honesty of purpose.",41
248,Mr CORSER,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,What is the date of publication ?,41
249,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Secon d of March, 1920.",41
250,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"But the tests were made in September, 1919.",41
251,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"They were tests of brands that were procurable in September, 1919. I am bringing this matter forward because it is essential that we should probe it to the bottom, and in the hope that our orehardists will be allowed to use the material best suited to their purposes.",41
252,Mr WATT,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Apar t from the summary . .referred to by the honourable member, what do the analyses show?",41
253,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"This authority shows that Nos. 4 and 9 were considerably the best of those tested. I shall not weary the Committee with the whole of the figures, since, owing to the technical character of the analyses, they would really convey nothing to honourable members. But the summary which I have read shows clearly that at the date named the Australian brands of arsenate' of lead were not to be compared with those of foreign production. One of them was manufactured by a man whose sheep dip was the subject of much commendation thereto this afternoon, although I have said from the first that it is not as good as some other brands. It has been said during this debate that the tests made in South Australia were such as to overturn the results of those made in New South Wales. I have here, however, a statement thatThe South Australian suspension tests, lished ten months after the New South Wales tests, show that the two leading local makes, namely, ""Vallo"" (Leggo's) and ""Bluebell"" (Blyth's) were still deficient in flotation qualities. The other local make, namely, "" Elephant,"" which showed up well for flotation, contained an abnormal proportion of water, namely, 54.7 per cent. I do not pretend to any personal knowdistilled ledge of these sprays; but, in view of the fact that an authority such as I have 50 quoted stands up for two imported brands, and it seems to me that it would be a grave filtered, mistake for the Committee to place too heavy a burden on these imported sprays, which, according to all practical tests, far as one has been able to follow them, and are superior to any local production. maining There is no reason why the local manuminutes. facturers should not turn out an article equal to that which is imported, if they set themselves to the task, because we in this country, the lead and, I presume, all the other materials which go to make up these sprays. It seems,, however, that we have not yet reached the stage at which any of the small factories can afford to pay for the requisite technical ability. The chemical side of these preparations seems to be the stumbling block in the way of Australian manufacturers. I hope that, in view of the reports, the Committee will hesitate to do anything likely to prevent our fruit-growers from obtaining the best spray at the lowest price.",41
254,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Maribyrnong) [6.25] The honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) passed very lightly over the South Australian tests, and spoke in glowing terms of the tests made in New South Wales. An examination of the figures relating to the New South Wales tests, however, shows that locally-made sprays were equal to many of the imported productions. I have here the South Australian Journal of Agriculture for January, 1921, which contains the most up-to-date evidence in regard to these matters. In this publication reference is made to a report presented by the South Australian Director of Chemistry, in which he gives the results of chemical and physical analyses, made under his supervision, of samples of various brands of arsenate of lead on sale in South Australia this season. The report shows that an Australian brand of arsenate of lead was far pubsuperior to any other. The tests were of an exhaustive character,' as is shown by the following statement by the Director of Chemistry: A weight of arsenate ot lead equivalent to 0.5 gram, of the moisture-free sample was mixed with distilled water in a mortar to a thin paste. The paste was then washed into a glass cylinder, and made up to 250 cc. with water. The cylinder was shaken for one minute. After standing for five minutes, cc. of the liquor was drawn off from a point midway between the bottom of the cylinder the top of the liquor. The 50 cc. was and the lead arsenate collected on the filter was dried and weighed. The weight of dry arsenate of lead obtained from 50 cc. of as the liquor was calculated to the percentage of the 0.5 gram, of dry arsenate of lead taken thus gives an indication of the arsenate rein suspension after standing for five After standing for fifteen minutes another 50 cc of the liquor was drawn off and treated in the same way as the portion have, drawn oir at the end of five minutes. Then follows a table which shows that an Australian brand was far and away superior to the so-called champion imported article. In the case of an Australian production, the percentage of arsenate of lead remaining in suspension after standing for five minutes was 89.85 and, after standing for fifteen minutes, 41.2, as compared with 53.35 and 35.3 in the ease of the best imported article. I fail to understand why some honourable members are constantly trying .to depreciate the value of local manufactures, in the face of incontestable evidence as to tlieir superiority.",42
255,Mr GIBSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,The honourable member has merely been quoting laboratory tests; no practical tests were given.,42
256,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,I intend to give the Committee information as to practical tests made in Tasmania.,42
257,Mr GREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,I have evidence as to practical tests carried out by orehardists' associations.,42
258,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"The local manufacturers have had to submit their preparations to the Government Analytical Chemist, and the Minister (Mr Greene) has exhaustive information on the subject. The production of arsenate of lead has an important bearing on the sheepdip industry. The encouragement of the local article means the employment of miners and of otlier workers engaged in the production of the raw material, the carriage of that raw material to the factories, and the conversion of it into the manufactured article. If there is one thing more than another that enabled Germany to continue the war as long as she did it was the use which she made of the chemists within her borders. But for their discoveries Germany would have had to "" throw up the sponge "" at the end of 1914. We should endeavour to establish industries that will give employment to our own people and be of service to us in peace as well as in war.",42
259,Unknown,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. Mr Fenton"" - We have heard a good deal from one member representing Tasmania about the codlin moth and its ravages. He draws the conclusion that nearly every apple-grower in Australia and Tasmania last year was using locally manufactured arsenate of lead, and not the imported article, and that in consequence there was a great increase in the codlin moth and its ravages in almost every orchard. If the honourable member read what some of the Tasmanian experts have to say about the ravages of the codlin moth in his State, he would come to quite a different conclusion. I do not suppose that any manufacturer or user of arsenate of lead thinks that even the most consistent and regular spraying .with it is sufficient to keep the codlin moth absolutely under. A practical illustration was given to me recently. The codlin moth had increased in an orchard near where I reside. The owner, one of the best apple-growers in Victoriaalthough he has other trees, he grows mostly apples-tol d me that he had given his trees only one spraying, and that then he paid more attention to cutting timber for fruit cases for growers in the locality. Being so busy at his saw-mill, he was unable to spray his trees a second time. He added, "" Had. I been able to spray my trees a second time. I should not have been troubled nearly so much with the codlin moth."" I believe that statement of his explains a good deal of the trouble of many apple-growers. Others, while not engaged in saw-milling, were, perhaps, occupied in doing something else, or were careless in their spraying.",43
260,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,What spray did he use?,43
261,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"He is a Free Trader, and would use an imported spray.",43
262,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Some growers spray five or six times during the year.,43
263,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Some may spray a dozen times; but if they do not know how to spray properly, it is of very little use. As to my friend's fiscal faith, what he said to me was, "" So far as I am concerned, I would open the doors as wide as possible and let into Australia everything that we require.""",43
264,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Perhaps he said that after using the local article.,43
265,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"No . He is an outand-out Free Trader. If the honourable member were dealing with a war period, I could understand him speaking as he has done to-night, but there was an ample supply of the imported article for last season's spraying, at any rate. I make bold to say that last year the orehardists of Australia had as much of the imported article as they cared to use. There was no shortage of it.",43
266,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,It is a question of having the most effective spray.,43
267,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"That is so; but the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) seemed to imply that the increase in the codlin moth last year in the apple orchards of Australia was due to the use of the local article. Some honourable members, and some people who have been fortifying them with certain very doubtful information, seem to think that the local article was used in every instance. That is not so. The following appeared in "" Orchard notes from Tasmania,"" in the Australian Farmer of 16th May,<""1921 :The codlin moth grub has been very prevalent in some of the apple districts of Tasmania during the past season, and growers have beenunder the impression that the arsenate of lead used is inferior in quality to that of former years. They have been loud in their complaints against it . The Department of Agriculture being responsible for the quality of the material sold to growers, the f r u it expert, Mr J. M . Ward, had samples of the various brands on the Tasmanbm market analyzed, and in every instance the percentage of arsenic pentoxide was shown to he above the standard required under the r e f l at i o n s of the Insecticides Act. This Act states that arsenate of lead must contnin 25 per cent, of arsenic pentoxide. The f r u it division of the Department has been conducting experiments in regard to spraying for various fungoid insect pests.",43
268,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,The point is that the local article will not hold the arsenate in solution long enough.,44
269,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member's argument was pierced very effectively by the Minister (Mr Greene) by interjection while he was speaking. was not only perforated, but absolutely shattered.",44
270,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Did the Minister hold it in solution?,44
271,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"What the Minister does in this debate is to hold the scales fairly; and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), knowing that, ought to be prepared to agree to the item as it appears in the schedule. I believe that when it comes to a vote, he will realise that a fair thing is being done. The honourable member for Wilmot will find, at page 511 of the Journal of Agriculture for South Australia for January, 1921, that his arguments, and those of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming), who made a great deal out of the graph published by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, which is two years old, are refuted by experiments conducted by the Director of Chemistry in South Australia. That officer paid special attention to this matter, and the article contains a definite and detailed account of the way the analysis was carried out, and of its results.",44
272,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Does he claim that the arsenate was held in solution by the local article as long as by the imported?,44
273,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Yes , longer and better.",44
274,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,He is a good mau.,44
275,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"He is a good man, and has really good experts under him. The Elephant brand, of Jacques Proprietary Limited, who make the local article, showed a percentage of 89.35 per cent, of arsenate of lead remaining in suspension after standing five minutes, and the nearest approach to that by the best imported article was 53.35 per cent. That was Swift's.",44
276,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,What does the Carlton go?,44
277,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"That is not given in this table, but Swift's is generally regarded by fruit-growers as one of the best imported brands. The percentage of and arsenate of lead remaining in suspension after standing fifteen minutes was, in the case of the Elephant brand, 41.2; and the nearest imported article, which, again, was Swift's, showed a percentage of 35.3. The matter needs no further argument. I could submit bundles of other proofs, if necessary; but I believe the Committee It has made up its mind that the item as presented by the Minister is fair, although I do not know that the local manufacturers of arsenate of lead consider that they are getting sumcient protection under it.",44
278,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,I proved that the duty is not necessary.,44
279,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member may have convinced himself. The chief agitator for wiping out the duty is not to be found among the real fruit growers qf Australia. He is a man who is agent, for one particular imported brand, and who has been wrongfully making use of the cool storage employees and the fruit-growers of this country. It takes some people quite a time to discover what this man really is. You might talk to him for half-an-hour, and would think that he was one of the chief fruit-grower's of Australia; but when you probe the matter to the bottom, you find that he is vitally interested in the importing of an American brand of arsenate of lead.",44
280,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,The prices show whether the protection is necessary.,44
281,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"The very apple I had at dessert to-night was pierced by the codlin moth. Certain climatic influences have a tendency either to increase or decrease the prevalence of the pest. In Victoria, and I think the same applied to quite a number of other States, after the heavy downpour of rain about New Year's Day,, there was a long spell of dry weather. Those who bave studied the codlin moth say that with a long spell of dry weather at a particular season of the year there is a chance of two or three broods of codlin moth hatching, and I believe that the dry spell referred to was conducive in certain States to the hatching of the codlin moth in far greater numbers than if we had had normal weather. I believe a great number of people do not understand how to spray, and that others neglect to spray. I can produce evidence to show that prominent fruit-growers in the Huon and Franklin districts of Tasmania have sprayed parts of their orchards twice with the local article, and left two rows of trees unsprayed. In those two rows the codlin moth throve and was plentiful, while in the trees which had had only two sprayings there was hardly any trace of it . That and other experiments show that the local article is quite effective in keeping down the pest. We should support the duty, not only for the sake of the f r u it growers, but for the sake of giving employment to people in our own factories, and using onr own raw material. Arsenic forms the base of these sprays. We have an arsenical mine in Western Australia, and an immense concern in New South Wales, where capital is going to be in vested to the extent of nearly Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 / This will give employment to a large number of people. The arsenate of lead in dustry will give the mining industry a lift , and provide a considerable amount of employment there. There is also the carriage of the raw material to the factories, and the employment of a large number of people in the factories. A f t e r being submitted to the greatest competition, and the most severe tests, the Australian product stands out, as the result of the keenest possible analysis, as the best spray for the fruit-growers of Australia to use. I favour the amount of duty proposed by the Minister in the schedule, and if I am given an opportunity of voting for an in creased duty, I shall do so with pleasure.",44
282,Mr GREGORY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Dampier) [ 8 . 1 3 ] was hopeful that the Minister Greene) would realise that growing is an industry a great number of people are employed in a small way. An enormous tbeComplaints number of returned soldiers have been placed on the land throughout Australia as fruit-growers, and the industry forms a magnificent means of closer settlement. If it is encouraged as it ought to be, and as I believe it will be, and if we realise the its great value, it will become one of the great industries of t i e ""Commonwealth. Our export trade in fresh and dried lb. fruits, and tinned fruits and jams, ought to make this one of the greatest producsuppose ing countries in the world.",45
283,Mr MATHEWS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Do you think they can do without Protection ?,45
284,Mr GREGORY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Decidedly . I want the Committee to pause before it places excessively high duties on the requirenexion ments of the orchardist, and to consider [372] seriously whether more employment will be given by allowing insecticides in free, or by putting a few pounds extra into the pockets of the manufacturers. The price at which the article has been sold does not disclose any reason for increasing the duty. Australian arsenate of lead haa been selling at lOd. per l b . , the British at Is. 8d., and the American at Is. 9d. If the orchardist buys the British or the American product, it must be because he believes it is more suitable; otherwise he would not pay the higher price demanded. Of course, he may be quite wrong, bu t the man who takes the risk and responsibility of building up an orchard business should be allowed to judge. Personally, I prefer the Australian article if it in any way approaches the imported commodity in quality and price. I want to draw the attention of honourable members to the* following reports concerning this matter. In the Age of 19th May, 1921, there appeared in the report of the f r u it growers' annual conference this statementThe increasing prevalence of codlin moth was generally regarded as due to defects in the arsenate of lead used in spraying. It was urged that the official analyses should take into account the mechanical condition, as well as the poison effectiveness, of the material. The Weekly Times correspondent at Mornington, reporting in A p r i l , 1921, stated- Fruit-growers here are experiencing heavy losses from codlin moth, even when the garden - I has been sprayed four times. The poison does (Mr not seem to be effective. f r u it - The Australasian of 12th March, 1921, in which, contained the following: are numerous from all parts of State regarding the efficacy of the arsenate of lead sprayings. The codlin moth is far worse than in previous seasons. Codlin moth has been found attacking peaches growing in the Shepparton district this season. Hard-headed fruit-growers in strongholds of local article, such as Harcourt, Somerville, Pomonal, Diamond Creek, and Hurstbridge, who would not buy the British article when the price was Cd. per lb., as against 4jd. per for the local, have ordered it this year when the price is Is. 8d. per lb. and the local article lOd. per Ib. Reason forbids us to they have done this simply for the sake of spending their money. It is possible, of course, that the orehardists may be wrong. We all know that a person building up an industry encounters many difficulties at the start, but in conwith arsenate of lead the orchardist should not be compelled to pay for any mistakes of the manufacturers. He should have the right to purchase the best article that is obtainable for his purposes. In view of the grave menace to the fruit growing industry through the ravages of the codlin moth, we should see to it that the best preventive obtainable is made available to all those engaged in the industry. I can see no reason why the local manufacturer of arsenate of lead should not be required to build up his business in the same way as other people. I have here a list of quite a number of people who have made complaints about the quality of the Australian arsenate pf lead, but I have no desire to injure any one in any business way, and so I shall not publish the names. Mr .FENTON - The Tasmanian expert has shown that many of the faults are due to defective spraying.",45
285,Mr GREGORY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"In my list there are complaints from men who sprayed four times, and yet suffered enormous losses from the codlin moth. As the honourable member says, much of this may be due to want of knowledge on the part of the orchardist as to the proper method of spraying; but I repeat that there is no reason why this heavy duty should be imposed on an imported article which the orchardist might consider the most; effective for his purposes. We have recently settled a very large number of returned soldiers on the land as orehardists. These men are confronted with very great difficulties, and we should not impose any further burdens upon them. In my own State over 1,000 returned soldiers have entered, upon the business of fruit growing, and I want to do what I can to assist them. This, I believe is one way. Another is to help them market their products. I hope the Minister will realise the advisability of giving relief to a very deserving section of our producers.",46
286,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.25] - I am sorry that the objection to the duty is based on the inferiority of the Australian article.,46
287,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,It is not.,46
288,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"That was the honourable member's whole argument, and those who followed him in their objection to the duty stressed the fact that in their opinion the Australian article was inferior in quality. I believe that prejudice, backed up by the concentrated efforts of gentlemen who have business connexions with overseas firms, is playing a very important part in this agitation. Certain gentlemen have sent circulars all over Australia praying the various bodies of orehardists to oppose this duty, and, of course, letters have been coming in in answer to that request. Prior to the dinner adjournment I was pointing out that we have set out to protect the fruitgrower in many directions. We have given him increased duties, far and away. above those previously imposed, and by proposing the duties in this item we are not taking away any of the advantage he enjoys at present. I believe that the Australian manufacturer is turning out an article quite equal in quality to the imported arsenate of lead, and that our or-' chardists on the whole will get a cheaper spraying material in future. Reference has already been made to a report by the Tasmanian expert, and I want honourable members to pay particular attention to one or two statements which he makes:The codlin moth grub has been particularly prevalent in some ""of the apple districts of Tasmania during the past season, and growers have been under the impression that the arsenate of lead used is inferior in quality to that of former yeors. He goes on to say that there is an obligation on the part of the Government to ascertain the purity and suitability of the various spraying materials for use by the orehardists. He add3 that the experiments have been practical as well as analytical and physical chemical tests, and says:State orchard (Bluebell Brand) season 191920 - Firs t spraying, last week in November, 1919; strength, of mixture, 6 lbs. to 100 gallons of water. Second spraying, last week in January, 1920, at same strength. Result-Or chard, entirely free from grub. This was a practical experiment carried out with one of the Australian brands of arsenate of lead.",46
289,Mr GEEGOKY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Hav e you the test made by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in March, 1920 ?",46
290,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"That was quoted by the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Atkinson), but was a purely chemical test.",46
291,Mr BOWDEN,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"No , it was a practical test.",46
292,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"It was a physical and chemical analytical test, whereas the Tasmanian expert went further and applied the practical test. The figures in regard to the chemical and physical tests carried out in South Australia by the Government expert have been given by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Teuton), and I have no desire to traverse the same ground. The figures quoted by the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) refer to tests carried out in September, 1919, and reported in the March, 1920, issue of the Agricultural Gazette. The tests quoted by the honourable member for Maribyrnong were carried out at the end of 1920, and were published in January, 1921. The great desideratum of a spraying mixture is that the poisonous material in it' shall remain suspended in solution, and two of the Australian brands mentioned in this latter test passed - a better suspension test than the best of the imported brands. This Tasmanian expert goes on to deal with a number of other practical tests. In one or two cases there was, he says, some slight infection after spraying, but it was due to the fact that the prevailing wind blew towards the infected trees from an orchard which was heavily infested; but, nevertheless, the spraying was efficient and effective. He goes on to sayI t will bo noticed that none of the areas ceived a calyx spraying. Although good results have several times been obtained from non-calyx spraying, it is advisable to do this in most districts. One has to be guided local and climatic conditions. When spraying for the codlin moth, thoroughness of application is all-important. In addressing a meeting at Franklin, on spraying for the moth, Ward informed growers that, in his opinion, the cause of the increase of the moth was, a very great extent, due to careless spraying. In this, he was supported by such growers as Mr T. A. Frankconib, who produces something like 30,000 cases of apples per annum, and Mr ST. B. Barnett, With careful spraying (every apple or pear should receive a covering of arsenate of lead) growers will find that they will have very good article. little codlin moth in their fruit. I should like to quote a letter received by local manufacturers of spraying material. I shall not mention their names, as I do not wish to give a special advertisement to one brand. This letter was written on behalf of the Harcourt Fruit-growers [372]- 2 Progress Association-Harcour t being one of the biggest fruit-growing districts in VictoriaI have much pleasure in forwarding ' you results of tests . with "" Australian"" and "" imported"" arsenate of lead carried out by this association. Fifty pounds of each was given by Messrs. E. Pritchard, E. Eagle, and J. B. Warren, who agreed to test them under equal conditions. The "" Australian"" arsenate of lead used was that which had been on hand by the growers from the previous season. At a  plot sprayed with "" Australian"" showed a higher percentage of clean fruit than that on which '* imported"" was used. Mr E. Eagle reported that he used "" imported"" on Jonathan trees and ""Australian"" on Esopus. The Jonathans were cleaner than the Esopus, though equally good results had been obtained with the ""Australian"" on Jonathans in other parts of the orchard. Mr J. B. Warren gave the results in his orchard as- "" Imported,"" 80 per cent, clean fruit, and "" Australian,"" 95 per cent, clean fruit. Several growers stated that the results obtained by spraying with ""Australian"" were equal to, if not better than, those obtained with other makes of arsenate of lead. Our association desires to congratulate you on the splendid results obtained with ""Australian."" We have the honour to be, sir, (Signed) H. M. MCLEAN, President. K. WAKKEN, Secretary.",47
293,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Thes e statements support the case, against the duty.",47
294,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"To my mind, a duty is needed to protect the industry from the prejudice against Australian goods. I believe that ultimately the orehardists will re- see that we have conferred a benefit on them with this duty.",47
295,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,They will have to pay by the 4s. per acre more for their spraying.,47
296,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I do. not think that they will have to pay anything more if Mr they use the best Australian brands. It may be that some of the Australian brands to are not good, and that some of the imleading ported brands are not good.",47

298,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"They must have a Arsenate of lead is a chemical combination, which,' so long as it be pure, cannot be anything else than than what it purports to be. The merit of a spraying material depends upon its mixing qualities and its ability to hold the poison in it in suspension. If the poison settles rapidly after mixing, the spray is not a good one. Physical and analytical tests of various spraying materials bought in the ordinary way across the counter have been made by Government experts. These have shown that in some of the looally-made brands the suspension is better than that of the imported brands, and that in others it is not so good. The results of these experiments are public property, and orehardists can read them for themselves. face of the statements of disinterested Government experts as to the efficacy of the Australian brands, we are not acting ivnfairly in asking the orehardists to buy a local article, the efficiency of which has been proved, and the price of which is lower than that of the imported article.",47
299,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"F r a n k l in) [8.40]. - I say nothing about the f r u it expert in Tasmania, whom I believe to be a thoroughly capable man ; but I know of one Tasmanian expert, who tested some material which he used down the Huon, and the people there have ever since been looking for him with a shot gun. Thaf'expert killed a lot of their trees.",48
300,Mr JOWETT,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Was he a Government expert?,48
301,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Yes , and he never went back to face the shot gun. The whole question is, who is the best judge of the material-the man who has to make a living by the use of it , or the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) and his advisers? These sprays are a matter of life and death to the orchardist.",48
302,Mr JOWETT,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,It will be a matter of life and death to that expert if he returns to Tasmania!,48
303,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"It will, and I hope the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) will not mind my saying that Tasmania got that expert from Western. Australia.",48
304,Mr MATHEWS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,A r e there any Australians in the honourable member's - electorate ?,48
305,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Yes , the pick of Australians can be found there. There are districts in my electorate, in which, if sprays were nob used, 75 per cent, of the f r u it would be found affected with moth, and I believe that holds good of all the States. It is now very costly to spray, seeing that wages in orchards are now almost double what they were a few years ago. A man may spray his orchard thoroughly, only to have to do the work all over again, should a heavy shower occur. Many orchards have to be sprayed three or four times a year; indeed in some of the badly-affected districts there has to be perpetual spraying. There are men in this House, though their own orchards, perhaps, consist of an old tree or two in some back yard, who take upon themselves to dictate to those to whom this spraying is a matter of lif e and death, what sort of spray they ought to use. I In the do not say that a spray is equally effective in every locality; the spray \ised in a dry climate differs entirely from that which is effective in a moist climate with heavy fogs; but whatever spray is used must be a thoroughly efficient one. As the honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr Atkinson) pointed out, the very ideal of closer settlement is orchard settlement, and it is safe to say that the great bulk of the orchards in Tasmania contain less than 20 acres. The successful orchard, moreover, is on land which would be practically worthless for any other cultivation. The f r u it trade of Tasmania has assumed large proportions. I suppose that the yield of apples there is close on 3,000,000 bushels per year; and if we touch or interfere with the efficiency of the spraying, we shall simply wipe out the orchards altogether. What do the orehardists ask from the Government ? They ask nothing more than to be left alone; to be allowed to use that spray which, in their experience, they have found the most efficacious. Is. that asking too much ? When we are dealing with insecticides, sprays, or dips, every encouragement should be given to those who have to use them; they should be allowed to select the article which they have found to suit their individual requirements. I do not believe that 1 per cent, of the people of Australia prefer an imported article if they can get.a suitable local article. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Lair d Smith) has in his electorate, I suppose, some of the smallest orchards to be found in the State, the great bulk of them being under 10 acres each; and those who conduct them are making a good living by means of hard work, and by bringing to bear on that work all the results of their individual and collective experience. It is monstrous for any Government or Parliament to tell those men that they shall not use the material which their experience has shown them to be the most successful, but that they should be compelled by the Tariff or some other means to use that which we select. And who are the men here who are going to vote for thÂ© duties proposed by the Government? Are they the representatives of the orehardists of Australia ? On the contrary, they are men who are not directly interested in the orchard industry. I appeal to those honourable members to allow the representatives of the fruit-growers of Australia to decide this question in accordance with the views of their constituents. I appeal to the representatives of city constituencies, and other constituencies in which there is no orchard industry, to let this question, at least, be decided by those who are directly interested. What would be the result, supposing the whole of the imported arsenates were prohibited? What would be the actual wealth created by the industries which the Minister (Mr. Greene) is seeking to promote. I ask the honourable gentleman to compare.those industries with a production of apples running to 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 bushels. As a matter of fact, it would pay the orehardists of Australia well to give the men employed in the production of these arsenates Â£5 a week each, and let them go fishing for eels down the Yarra. There must be between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000 bushels of apples alone grown every year in the orchards of Australia, and all that the orehardists ask of the Minister is to be allowed to use Australian-made sprays if from their own experience they find them effective, and that if they have not found them effective they shall not be debarred from using an imported article for the preservation of their industry. There are men in my electorate who from their boyhood up have cleared heavily timbered country, tilled and planted it, and all that they have to show for their life's work is 8 or 10 acres of orchard. I ask the members of this Committee not to impose a burden upon their industry. I ask that they should be given a fair chance, and should be allowed to use the spray which they have found effective, and should not be compelled to use a less effective spray because the Minister for Trade, and Customs and representatives of city constituencies desire that they should.",48
306,Mr GEEENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.52] - I should like to say a word or two in reply to honourable. member for Franklin (Mr in MCWilliams). He has asked that honori able members who represent districts in which fruit growing is carried on should be allowed to decide this question, and that the other members of the Committee should not interfere. Would the honourable member have been prepared, in connection with the duties on dried fruits, citrous fruits, and apples, to permit only honourable members who represent the consumers of those fruits to decide the duties ?",49
307,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Did they not doso?,49
308,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Yes, and to their credit they voted for them on every occasion. They did not take up the attitude recommended by the honourable member. Are honourable members who represent city constituencies to claim that they only should be allowed to vote on questions which affect the interests of their constituents 1",49
309,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,The duties the honourable gentleman has referred to do not mean the life or death of any industry.,49
310,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"No ; they simply mean that the people generally must pay . That may be said of all duties on foods. I believe that the duty now under consideration will result in orehardists ultimately obtaining cheaper, and not dearer, sprays. I believe that if Australian orehardists are sufficiently loyal to look for the best spray which Australian manufacturers can providei-and there is ample evidence that many good sprays are manufactured here-the y will find that it will effectively do what they require of it.",49
311,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Who is the best judge of that?,49
312,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Before the honourable member came in I quoted a letter from an association of orehardists, in which they said that after exhaustive tests they were prepared to admit that they got better results from the Australian than from the imported sprays.",49
313,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Then they will use the Australian sprays.,49
314,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"The whole difficulty is the prejudice against the Australian article. A man becomes used to a particular brand, and, finding that it gives good results, he continues to use it. Our experience during war time was that we could not get the imported brands, and local manufacturers came to our rescue. the These sprays are now being manufactured Australia in very large quantities, and t is only fair that the manufacturera should be given a reasonable amount of protection..",49
315,Mr RICHABD POSTER,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"We must have efficiency, and must, therefore, have the widest choice.",50
316,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"There are eight or nine manufacturers of sprays in Australia, and that should give orehardists a wide enough choice. It has been proved that some brands of sprays manufactured in Australia are as effective as any imported brand. There is no doubt that local manufacturers can supply Australian requirements, and it is surely fair, in the circumstances, that they should be given reasonable protection, so that local - prejudice may be broken down; and once it is broken down, I believe that the Australian - fruit-grower will gain a direct benefit by being able to secure a cheaper spray.",50
317,Mr BOWDEN,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Nepean) [8.58] - It ie useless for the Minister (Mr Greene) to talk of local prejudice against Australian manufacturers. So far as the fruit-growers in my district are concerned, it is not a question merely of local prejudice, because they have tried the Australian article, and have found that it does not give the best results. I know men who have been using tbese sprays. The fruit-growers of today are not so disloyal that they will not use an Australian article if it is as good as an imported article. The time has gone by when fruit-growers are content to pay Is. 8d. and Is. 9d. per lb. for an imported article, when they can get an equally good article of local manufacture for lOd. per lb. Laboratory tests are not practical tests; and the crux of the matter is that, according to the experience of a great number of fruit-growers, the Australian article will not hold in solution in the way the imported article does. The Minister mentioned the results of an experiment in a .State orchard in Tasmania; and if you can get your men to stir up the spray every five or ten minutes, it may be possible to keep it in solution. The difficulty is that you have a machine going through the rows of an orchard; one man is spraying one row and another another row. the engine is pumping the spray, and every time the machine is stopped three men have to stop working, and the engine must be stopped and started again. The spray that will hold in solution is the spray that the orchardist must have.",50
318,Mr MAHONY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,The facts are against the honourable member on that point.,50
319,Mr BOWDEN,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"No , they are not. The facts are that the great majority of fruit-growers whom I know find that the imported article is better than the Australian, and my own experience is the same as theirs.",50
320,Mr RILEY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,What spray does the honourable member use ?,50
321,Mr BOWDEN,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I tried the Vallo, which is an Australian spray, and the Carlton, which is a British spray. That is to say, I told my men to use those sprays. They sprayed about 2 acres with the Vallo spray, and 2 acres with the Carlton spray. The area sprayed with the British article gave about 5 per cent, of codlin, and the area on which the Australian article was used gave 25 per cent, of codlin. The trees were sprayed in the same way, at the same time, and they were of the same varieties. My experience in this matter is typical of the general experience, not only on Mangrove Mountain, but throughout my district. The orehardists there do not get as good results from the Australian as they get from the imported article. If the same results could be obtained from the locally-made article, no sprays would be imported, and a duty would not be necessary. A man will not pay Is. 8d. for an imported article if he can get an equally good one of local make for half that price.",50
322,Mr FENTON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,The importers reduced their price to 8*d. in an endeavour to - knock out the local industry.,50
323,Mr BOWDEN,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Some months ago the imported arsenate of lead was quoted at 6d and the local article at 4$d. So far v as I know, the price of the Australian product has always been lower than that of the imported. I rose merely to add to the statements made by previous speakers, the testimony of orehardists ih my district that they have tried the local article and have had to revert to the use of the imported spray, in spite of the greater price, because the Australian product would not give the desired results.",50
324,Mr GABB,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Angas) [9.2] - If Pontius Pilate were present to' listen to this debate, he would ask, as he asked hundreds of years ago, ""What is truth?"" I have been supplied with a good deal of information in the form of circulars, and last week, in order to satisfy my own mind upon the question, I wrote to some of the principal orehardists in my constituency to ascertain their views. Unfortunately, this item has been reached earlier than I anticipated, and only one reply is to hand. I give it for what it is worth. The only question I asked in my letters was whether the orehardists had used the Australian arsenate of lead, and, if so, with what results. The reply I have received from one orchardist is:Re Arsenate of Lead - I have heen using about half a ton each year for about five or six years. Have used several brands, Australian as well as imported, and cannot see the least difference in results, everything pending on the way the work is done. Quality is so good that I have never had less than 90 per cent, clean fruit.",50
325,Mr GEEGOKY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Is the codlin moth in South Australia?,51
326,Mr GABB,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"South Australia has its share of codlin moth, as well as other pests. Having been in business as a fruit hawker, I know the orehardists who bring clean fruit to the Adelaide market, and it was to some of them. I wrote. They are men with whom I have had business dealings, who have no' financial interest in the sprays, and upon whose word I can rely. The whole question to be determined was whether or not the. Australian arsenate of lead was efficacious, and I had made up my mind that if I could get evidence that it was I would support this duty. In addition to the one reply I have received, there is the evidence of the practical test in Tasmania mentioned by the Minister (Mr Greene). If the vote is taken before evidence to the contrary is forthcoming, I shall vote to retain the duty provided in the schedule.",51
327,Mr CORSER,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Wide Bay) [9.5] Several members have said that in these matters we should rely upon the judgment of the men who use these sprays. My experience over a considerable number of years is that the users cannot always be depended upon to show the best judgment; veiy often they are prejudiced. I recollect well that, in the early days of the establishment of some Australian industries for the production of things we wear and eat, the Australian consumer would not use the locally-produced articles, although they are in general use today. The . Committee has been told that the price of the imported article has never been below that of the local. In 1914, Hemmingway's British arsenate of lead was being sold at 4Â£d. per lb., and the local article had to be sold at the same price, although the manufacturers lost more than 2d. per lb. in doing so. That was a clear case of dumping, because the British manufacturer could not use the best ingredients and pay freight and agency commission, and sell his product profitably at 4*d. He was simply dumping his spray in. order to kill the local industry.",51
328,Mr ATKINSON,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,The foreign manufacdeturer will not be able to do that in future.,51
329,Mr CORSER,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Unti l the local manufacturers are well established, we should protect them, provided that they produce an article which is equal to the imported s P f y - As an illustration of the total a disregard of facts shown by the importers, the test carried out last year by the South Australian Department of Agriculture speaks for itself. It shows that the following percentages of arsenate of lead remained in suspension:-After 5 minute3, best locally-made spray, 89.35 per cent; imported, 53.35 per cent. Up to 15 minutes, local, 41.2 per cent.; imported, 35.3 per cent. The test was distinctly in favour of the locally-made article. Tests made by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, and the South Australian Department of Agriculture showed distinctly that the American arsenate of lead is not as good as the Australian. These official tests clearly prove that Australia does produce an arsenate of lead that is as good as any that is imported. The only attempt at refutation of these figures is the claim that the. man who uses these"" sprays ought to be the best judge, but - there is a prejudice which is often evident. When the first yellow Queensland sugar was produced many people preferred the old Mauritius black sugar, and when Queensland first grew coffee there were many people who would not use it , although it is now considered to be as good as any in the world.",51
330,Mr GREGORY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Dampier) [9.11] - I believe that the mover of the amendment would agree to a 10 per cent, duty against Great Britain with higher duties under the intermediate and general heading. The Minister (Mr Greene) has quoted tically nothing. official reports, hut I am quite satisagree fied he could also have obtained other oflicial reports giving quite different results. Por instance, I have with ings. me the results of tests carried out by the New South ""Wales Agricultural partment. However, I rise now to put be so added-put . forward a plea on behalf of the oreharddivided. ists. Numberless letters have been received from orehardists, of which the following two are an example:Yours to hand re payment of arsenate of lead, Brand. I am very sorry to say I have proved it to' be absolutely useless. I have given the apple trees five sprayBell, G.

I reckon I lost Â£15 Mackay, G. H. per acre on my Jonathans. The spray used in each case was a local brand. The fault may have been dvfe to ineffective spraying or to some error, but the number of letters received on the subject show that the orehardists have a genuine cause for complaint against the local article. I think they are entitled to ask that they should not be called upon to pay a duty of 25 per cent., which, by the time the article reaches them, will probably amount to 50 per cent., on the imported spray which they wish to use. Orehardists who take up virgin ground are obliged to wait for seven or eight years before they get any return, and even when the trees do come into bearing the whole season's crop may be lost through the use of an ineffective spray; The orchardist's lot is not too happy. If he secures a good crop free from pests he may find the market flooded.

334,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.35] - I intend to move an amendment to deal with alum cake and sulphate of alumina. The latter is used principally by papermakers and tanners. Hitherto none of the beauxite ores have been mined in Australia to any extent. These contain a certain proportion of aluminium. The local deposit from which sulphate of alumina is produced has proved to be much richer in its aluminium contents than was anticipated. One of the materials in regard to which the British Empire discovered itself during the war to be absolutely deficient was aluminium. The committee which was appointed to deal with the Empire's requirements, and the necessity for the development of deposits of various metals, and for the growth of certain productions, strongly recommended that all the Dominions should endeavour to produce aluminium. The production of the latter necessitates, .in the first place, the creation of cheap hydro-electric energy in large quantities. It depends, firlst, upon ore carrying payable quantities of alumina; and then there is required hydro-electric energy in order to work the deposit up to inter- the article of commerce. We have several deposits of these beauxite ores. A very large one exists in Western Australia, anii another in New South Wales, in the vicinity of Buledelah. There is still another in South Australia, in the form of alumite; and there is the deposit it Gippsland, from which sulphate of alumina is now being worked. I hope that, as that deposit is developed, some one or some company will be prepared to produce aluminium. An assay of samplw from the mine shows it to be very rich in The its aluminium contents.",53

In regard to the rest, I shall leave the item as it stands, with the exception that these drugs when packed for retail sale will bear a slightly higher duty. I move That the item be further amended by adding the following after sub-item (j) :- "" And on and after 22nd June, 1921(j ) Drugs, crude:-Roots , viz - Calum bae, dandelion, gentian, ipecacuanha, orris, rhubarb, sarsaparilla, senegoc, and squill; Barks, viz - Cascar a sagradai, cinchona and wild cherry; Leaves, viz - Belladonn a and buchu; Ergot; Pyrethrum flowers, in packages containing not less than 28 lbs. net, British, free; intermediate, free; general, free.

338,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Robertson) [9.45] This is a simple looking item, but it covers what, in common parlance, is known as bluestone, which is used most effectively for pickling wheat.",54
339,Mr JOWETT,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,And has also an important use in the treatment of foot-rot in sheep.,54
340,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"That is so. The item is, therefore, of considerable interest to the wheat-growers and graziers of Australia, and should receive special consideration, because I understand that in the past imports of sulphate of copper from the Old Country have been free, while Â£4; in- under the general Tariff there has been a duty of only 5 per cent. It is now proposed that the duty shall be Â£5 peiton in respect of imports from. Great Britain, and Â£10 per ton under the general Tariff. We shall probably be told that a very little bluestone is sumcient to pickle a large quantity of wheat, or to make the mixture through which we run sheep that are suffering from foot-rot. This, however, is another of those many additions to the Tariff that, when summed up, become extremely heavy from the point of view of the wheat-growers and sheep farmers of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Minister (Mr Greene) will not insist upon such a tremendous impost on an item affecting two of our greatest industries. We all know that sulphate of copper is a by-product of our copper mines; but, at the best, it is only a by-product of the mining industry, whereas it is one of the raw materials necessary for' the successful carrying on of wheat-growing and also of sheep-farming in the wetter districts. Sheep rot is both painful and offensive, and involves heavy loss to stock-owners. I am surprised that we have not in the Committee to-night some representatives of the wheat districts to enter their protest against this heavy tax. On behalf of the graziers and sale, ad. val., British, free; intermediate, 10 per cent; wheat-growers, and of the many other general, 15 per cent. primary producers, such as fruit-growers, and certain sections of. our market garval., British, 15 per cent.; in- deners, who use bluestone, I propose to termediate, 20 per cent.; movegeneral, 25 per cent."" That the item be amended by adding the following words:- "" And on ancl after 22nd June, 1921, per ton, British, Â£2: intermediate, Â£3; general, Â£5."" Knowing as I do the feeling displayed by the Oommittee in connection with other items, I am afrai d it would be useless to attempt a further reduction, although I think this item should be free. I ask the Minister (Mr Greene) to accept the amendment. The honourable gentleman has granted one or two requests made by me; but this is the most important that I have yet preferred to him, and I hope he will agree to it . If I 'had my way, I would make the item free. The loss to the copperproducing community would not be matei ial, whereas the loss which this heavy duty involves on the part of the grazing and wheat-growing industries of Australia must be very great. that the copper-mining industry needs all the support we can give it at the present time; but, after all, it is only a portion of our .great mining industry, whereas this impost would be disastrous to the whole of the wheat-producing and grazing industries of Australia. As this is only a by-product of the copper-mining industry, it would be actually of very littl e value to that source of production. Taken all round, the in j u r y which may be done by a duty such as this is so overwhebningly great in comparison with the small good that can arise from it that I trust the Minister will see his way to accept my proposal.",54
341,Mr GEEGORY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Dampier) [ 9 . 5 1 ] hope the Minister will agree to reduce the duty. The item was free in all previous Tariffs, so far as imports from Great Britain were concerned, and bore a general duty of only 5 per cent. Now we are asked to agree to a duty of Â£ 5 a ton British, and Â£ 1 0 intermediate and general. That is an awful impost for the farmer and pastoralist to have to pay for bluestone. It is not just.",55
342,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.521 - Will the honourable member for Robertson accept a reduction to Â£ 3 British, Â£ 7 intermediate, and Â£ 1 0 general?",55
343,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I will , but I think even those duties too high. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr MASSYGREENE) agreed made toThat the following words be added :- "" And range of essential oils here. on and after 22nd June, 1921, per ton, tish, Â£ 3 ; intermediate, Â£7; general, Â£10."" Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 284 (Bacteriological products and sera).",55
344,Mr GREGORY,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Dampier) [9.53] Quite a number of bacteriological products have been dealt with in Tariff decisions. I should like to know whether the large number enumerated in circular F29, dated 1st May, 1920, was put on the free list, or under a 30 per cent, duty ? These products are wanted for our hospitals, and the duty is a severe tax on the poorer portion of the community.",55
345,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"If that list were issued under a by-law, as I should imagine that it was, then the articles enumerated in it would be free. Item agreed to. I recognise It e m 285 (Medicines).",55
346,Mr GEEENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.54] - I propose to amend this item by taking drags and chemicals out of it . These will then fal l under item 281. The net effect of the amendment will be to bring them under lower duties. I move That the following words be added to subitem (A) : - "" And on and after 22nd June, 1921(A) Pharmaceutical preparations; patent and proprietary medicines and drugs, and other medicinal preparations; medicinal extracts; essences; juices; infusions; solutions; emulsions, confections; syrups; pills; pilules; tabloids; soloids; ovoids; tablets; capsules; cachets; suppositories; pessaries n.e.i.; poultices; salves; cerates; ointments; liniments; lotions; pastes and the like; medicinal waters and com- I pounded medicinal oils; medicines for animals, ad val., British, 2b per cent.; intermediate, 30 per cent.; general, 35 per cent.""

347,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Robertson) [9.57] Will this and the next item come practically under the same head ? Do they both apply to the manufacture of perfumes which naturally deal with essential oils ? If so, I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister (Mr Greene) the fact that an attempt is being to produce these things in Australia. We have a very large Our Brieucalypts are capable of producing not only medicinal oils, but very fine essential oils and perfumes. We can grow in this country, aa has been proved in a small way already, all those things which are used in other countries for producing perfumes. Our climate is eminently adapted for the purpose. We have the soil, the sunshine, the water, and every other possible condition required.",55
348,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,What duty are you recommending ?,56
349,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"I do not know what is required, but I ask the Minister to i m pose a rate sumcient to protect the new industry which is being established, and which will give a great deal of employment to a number of people who are perhaps not fitted for heavier work.",56
350,Mr WATKINS,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,Will not the farmer have to pay this duty?,56
351,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"No . It will be a charge on the luxuries of life. We should frame the Tariff with that end in view, and if we can establish our people in in dustries which produce luxuries we should do so. We do not want to import any more luxuries than are absolutely necessary to maintain our standards of life. We are already growing some of these things, and the industry is promising extremely well. Its encouragement will make for the employment, in a healthy occupation of a great number of Australians, and I therefore urge the Minister to give the industry all the Protection, which is. required to establish it here.",56
352,Mr MASSYGREENE,TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.0] - The honourable member wil l see that, while item 287 covers essential oils, non-spirituous, n.e.i., item 288 deals with materials used in the manufacture of the perfumes about which he has been speaking. We have endeavoured to encourage the use of Australian essential oils for the manufacture of perfumes by so arranging the spirit duties that a manufacturer using these oils gets the spirit at a lower rate. If the honourable member will turn to the Excise Tariff, and look at item L , he wil l find that the Excise on spirit for the manufacture, from Australian products exclusively, of scents and toilet preparations, subject to regulation, is 23s. per gallon, and in item M , spirit for industrial and scientific purposes n.e.i., 28s. per proof gallon. This represents a difference of 5s. in the Excise duty on the spirit. Alcohol forms the bulk of all perfumes, and, therefore, we are encouraging the local manufacturer by giving him the spirit at 23s:. per gallon, provided he uses Australian essential oils, whereas in the other case if the perfumery manufacturer used, imported oils, the duty is leviable on the proof gallon, and, as the spirit supplied to the manufacturer is 50 per cent, over-proof, he gets something very much more in addition to an advantage of 5s. per gallon in the Excise duty. It will be seen that, we are giving considerable encouragements to the Australian manufacturer of perfumery using Australian essential oils,, but Australia does not produce sufficient of these essential oils, and the Department have been doing what was, in point of law, an illegal act by allowing the use of a lesser proportion of Australian essential oils. When I found this out, my officers recommended that I should issue an instruction to abide strictly by the letter of the law; but we found that if we did so we would be cutting out the use* of Australian essential, oils altogether, because the manufacturers could not gets enough of it . I propose to rectify this matter when we come to the Excise duty by making the existing rate apply if manufacturers use one-third of Australian essential oils, and providing for a lowerrate of duty if they use two-thirds of our essential oils, and a still lower rate if they use all Australian essential oils. In that way we can really give more effective protection to the industry than by putting a duty on this item. Item agreed to.
