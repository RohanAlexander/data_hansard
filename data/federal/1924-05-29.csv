6,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISTRIBUTION OE WIRE,"I told the honourable member, when he submitted his questions, that it would take a considerable time, and would involve a considerable amount of expense to supply the information for which he asked. I have the reply to his questions in my hands now, and I may say that, in overtime alone, the preparation of the return has cost £163.

' INTEREST ON CURRENT ACCOUNTS. Mr A. GREEK-On the let August - of last year, I asked the Treasurer the following questions:1. Is it a fact that a banking company hasstarted business in Melbourne and Sydney which allows interest on current accounts? 2. Ic order to keep abreast of progressive banking methods, is he prepared to give the same system «i trial in the Commonwealth Bank?

On the 28th of this month I asked the Treasurer if he had received a reply, and his answer wasThe suggestion to allow interest on current accounts was submitted for the consideration of the Acting Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, but he has not advised me as to views on the matter. Seeing that I have waited for nearly twelve months for a reply to my quesday; tion",15
8,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OE WIRE,"Order ! I cannot allow the honourable member's statement to go further. May I inform him that the purpose of a question is not to give in the formation, but to elicit it . If the honororable able member will ask a question I see that the Treasurer is given an opportunity to reply to it . Mr A. GREEK- 1 will ask my question now. Is the Treasurer prepared to again communicate with the Acting Manager of the Commonwealth Bank ber with a view to elicit the information which I asked on the 1st August last?",15

13,Mr SPEAKER,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"St. Hon. W. A. Watt). his - I have received from three honourable members intimations of their desire to move the adjournment of the House tothey ai'e the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates), the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt), and the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks). I regret to have to declare notification from the last-named honmember not sufficiently definite to shall comply with the Standing Orders.",15
14,Mr WHITSITT,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,I am prepared to proceed with my motion.,15
15,Mr SPEAKER,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"As the notification of the honourable member for Adelaide was the first to reach me, that honourable memis entitled to precedence. The honorfor able member's intimation was that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter .of urgent public importance, namely, "" the of Major Bell to the position of Deputy Commissioner of Old-age Pensions and Maternity Allowances in South Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",15
16,Mr YATES,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"Adelaide) [2.42]' - The subject of my motion is not new to the is it Treasurer, and ho must have expected some protest against the appointment of Major Bell. The honourable gentleman cannot blame me. or any other honourable member for occupying the time of the House with a discussion' of this matter, because he is responsible for the action I have taken. I do not think he will be able to convince the House that he was justified in appointing-. Major Bell to this important position. So far as I can learn, Major Bell is not a member of the Public Service, and the appointment of an outsider to such a post as he is now occupying is unprecedented. This innovation, is causing, some perturbation among members of the Public Service, who have a right to expect that when vacancies occur they shall be given such consideration as their positions in the Service entitle them to. It is not in the best interests of the Commonwealth that discontent in the Service should be caused by an appointment for which there does not appear to be any justification. hope that the Treasurer will today allay the misgivings that exist amongst Commonwealth public servants, but so far he has not been candid with either the House or the Service . He-has not carried out 1 his promises, and I think I might fairly charge him with having side-stepped his obligations. Honourable members on this side of the House believe that in the Repatriation Department there is a desire to appoint military officers to positions for which they are not qualified by knowledge and experience; That objection ap-plies to Major Bell. Such a policy carries preference to soldiers to extremes, especially when public servants better qualified are sacrificed in order that appointments may be-given to soldiers. ""We on this: side of the House are opposed to the handing over of the administration of the civil pensions and maternity allowances, to-the Repatriation Department, and we do not think that that procedure is ap- action ? proved by the country.. The Repatriation' Department, is' more or less ephemeral,, because wei hope that in time all soldiers will, have been repatriated,, and there will be no further necessity for a Department to attend; to that work. There is no reason why appointments such as the one in question should he made to the detriment of permanent members of the Public Service, and the Treasurer will require toadducevery strong reasons to justify his' action, in this matter. T suggest that, so far, he has been rather disWr. Yates. ingenuous. On the. 27th March last the following questions and answers were exchanged between the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) and the Treasurer :",15
17,Mr MAHONY,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"Can the Treasurer tell us. whether it is a fact that the old-age aud invalid pensioners of Australia are to be handed over to the tender mercies of the Repatriation Board ] If so, can he give any reason for such a decision?",16
18,Dr EARLE PAGE,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"If the honourable member will wait, the Government policy on this matter will be announced, later.",16
19,Mr MAHONY,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"I ask the Treasurer whether he can tell us how many more years we shall have to wait for a statement of Government policy, seeing that it is about twelve months since we had one?",16
20,Dr EARLE PAGE,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"I suggest to the honourable member that he should guess again. Although the Treasurerpromised in March to announce the Government I policy, no announcement has yet been made, although a new policy has been initiated. The second answer by the Treasurer was unnecessarily flippant. There 1 is no room for. flippancy in connection with such an important matter. I think it will be apparent to an unbiased mind that, the Treasurer side-stepped his obligations. On the 1st April-perhap s a very appro1 priate date-the honourable member for Dalley again sought information from the Treasurer, and I quote the questions and answers in full : ",16
21,Mr MAHONY,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"the Treasurer,, upon notice I.. Has the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Department been handed over to lie Repatriation Board in the State of Western Australia? .2. If so, what is the reason for such action,3. Is it the intention to hand over the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Department, in any or all of the States, to the Repatriation Board? 4. If so-, what, are the States in whichsuch action is to be taken, and .the reason for the",16
22,Dr EARLE PAGE,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"The answers to the honourable member's; questions are aa follow:1. No. 2. Sec answer to No. 1. 3. No. 4. See answer to No. 3. In an important matter such as this, it was unreasonable for the. Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to brush the whole matter aside as ha did. He does not realise what may happen if he does not pay some regard to the wishes of members of the Public Service,, who feel that their privileges are threatened. The Treasurer indicated that what had been, done would be fully explained when the policy of the Government in connection with this Department was outlined. Mr E. EILEY - The Government have not any policy.",16
23,Mr YATES,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"They are giving effect to a policy and explaining their policy later, as was done in connection with the appointment of Mr J. A. M . Elder as Australia's representative in the United States of America. The appointment has been made, and we are informed that the question can be debated when, the Estimates are under consideration. No one. was informed of the fact that Mr Donald Mackinnon had been selected as Australia's Commissioner at Washington until the appointment was made.",17
24,Mr SPEAKER,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - Order !,17
25,Mr YATES,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"I suggest, Mr Speaker, that Major Ball was appointed in similar ciicumstances. The Treasurer further statedI may perhaps add, for the information of the honourable member, that, on the retirement recently of the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions, Adelaide, the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation in that State was appointed also as Deputy Commissioner of Pensions. This does not mean that the administration of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act is placed, the hands of the Repatriation Commission. The administration is being controlled merly by the Secretary to the Treasury in his capacity as Commissioner of Invalid and Old age Pensions. That admission was drawn from the Treasurer by the persistency of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), and again I suggest that the lastrmentioned statement was made simply to appease the honourable member for Dalley or other ^honourable members concerned in the appointment, and to create the impression - that the; position has not in any way been altered. The Treasurer knows that such is not tie! case., He knows that in South Australia the administration of the Pensions Department is not controlled as it was when in charge of Mr Gardiner, who was Deputy Public Service Commissioner, and' held a dual position. Mr GABB.:-He was a very able man.",17
26,Mr YATES,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"Yes , and he retired from the position with honour. Although Major Bell has been appointed, the De: partment isstill under the control of the Secretary to the Treasuryj but the posi* tion has been given to a man outside the Service, who had no right to be appointed. The Treasurer's statement is of a character likely to lead some to believe that nothing irregular has been done, but the action taken is contrary to the usual practice, which is to transfer such officers from one State to another according to the importance of the work. A notification appeared in the Commonwealth Gazette on the 17th January, 1924, which was long before the honourable member for Dalley submitted the question. The Treasurer knew what had been done when the question was answered. He should realise that honourable members have their rights, and should be fully informed when information is sought. Instead of replying to the honourable member for Dalley in the terms he did, he should have referred him to the Commonwealth Gazette of the 17th January of this year, on page 394 of which the following notice appears:The Governor General in Council has approved of the appointment of John William Bell, Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation, Adelaide, as Deputy Commissioner of Pensions under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908-1923, and Deputy Commissioner of Maternity Allowances under the Maternity in Allowance Act 1912, for the State of South Australia, vice Alfred Charles Clayer. as forAlfred Charles Clayer is the man who has lost his job by the appointment of Major Bell, or, if such is not the case the Treasurer should inform the House as to the exact position. I have been authoritatively informed that Mr Clayer has been deprived, by the appointment of Major Bell, of the promotion to which he was entitled on the retirement of Mr. Gardiner. Later I asked some questions relative to the appointment, which I shall quote, together with the answers. They are1. What is the reason for appointing Major Bell' to the positionof Acting Deputy Commissioner of Invalid' and Old-age Pensions in South' Australia.? 2. What is the reason for placing the Pensions Department under a. provisional officer instead of a permanent officer? 3. Has not Mr A. C. Clayer, a permanent officer, been superseded by the alteration made? 4.. Does not the alteration detrimentally affect the right, of promotion, of officers of many years-'' service? 5. Has not Mr A. C. Clayer many years of experience in the Pensions Department in excess of those of Major Bell?",17
27,Dr EARLE PAGE,MINIST ER FOR TRADE AKD,"The answers to the honourable member's questions arc as follow:1. The appointment was made in. the interests. of economy. 2.. Sec answer to No. 1. 3. No. 4. No. 5. Yes. The replies arc again characteristic of the Treasurer in dealing with this matter. The Treasurer admits in the answer to the last question that Mr Clayer has had many years experience in the Service, and states that Major Bell was appointed in the interests of economy, hut he should show why economy should be effected at the expense of a reputable public servant. Some time later the honourable member for Barton (Mr F. MCDonald) sought further information from the Treasurer. He asked the Minister the following questions:1. Was the Public Service Board consulted re the appointment of Mr Bell to the position of Deputy Commissioner for Pensions in South Australia ? 2. If so, did the Board approve of the appointment ? 3. Did the Board take the initiative in making the appointment? Again the Treasurer was economizing, because his replies were unnecessarily brief, and read:1. No. 2. <See answer to No. 1. 3. No. That is the information which the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) supplies to an honourable member on a very important matter. He has created a precedent in having made an appointment which is not justified by the Public Service Act of 1922. Those who work under the provisions of the Act are very jealous of their rights and privileges, and I am informed that the action of the Treasurer paves the way for the making of similar appointments in future. I am not raising this matter at the instance of Mr Clayer. I have not spoken to that officer more than once. ""When I went to the ofiice to transact some business I was told to see him, and that is the only occasion on which I have spoken to him. I have, however, conversed with other public servants, and I know that they expect honourable members to conserve the rights which they possess under the Act. If this appointment is not justified by the Act the Treasurer must explain why it has been made, and the Mr Yates. reason for not referring it to the Public Service Board. The retirement of Mr. Gardiner enabled the Treasurer to put this policy in operation in South Australia, but prior to that it was known that ' -, some move was contemplated to bring the Pensions Department under the control of the Repatriation Department, and steps were taken to prevent its being done. The following is an extract from the Federal Public Service Journal, regarding a meeting that was held in Perth:NA DEPARTMENTS. Considerable discussion was evoked by the letter received from the general secretary regarding the rumoured amalgamation of these Departments; and, while the information supplied by the general secretary in connection with the amalgamation issue was appreciated, it was considered by several councillors that the proposed move represented the thin edge of the wedge for the ultimate merging of the two Departments into one. Moreover, it was pointed out that, apart from amalgamation, the suggested appointment of an outsider, in the person of the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation, to the. important - position of Deputy Commissioner of Pensions, over the heads of better qualified permanent officers, constituted an injustice, and was directly opposed to the best interests of the Service. It was accordingly decided that the Central Executive he requested to strongly oppose the suggested appointment. It was further resolved to ask Mr E. A. Mann, M.H.R., to arrange for all the Federal members at present in Perth to receive a deputation on the subject from this branch, and that all the Western Australian Federal - members who are not present at that interview should be circularized. The Treasurer must have been cognisant of that when he appointed Major Bell. It is generally believed in the Service that the action taken by the ""Western Australian branch prevented the making of a similar appointment there.",18
28,Dr EARLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,No ; it did not.,18
29,Mr YATES,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"That is generally supposed to be the case. At any rate, this protest was made against action which eventually was taken in South Australia. The Government is not playing fairly with the Public Service; it is not adopting the right attitude if it desires to keep the Public Service satisfied. The Treasurer side-stepped the questions asked by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) in this House. He would have been more candid had he informed that honourable member that the appointment had been made, and explained to the House the reason for giving the position to Major Bell. Does the Treasurer believe that Major Bell has a right to the position? I suggest that he has not. Until lie returned from the war and the Repatriation Department was created, he had no knowledge of pensions work. Honourable members do not even know whether he is a clerical officer capable of carrying ou the work of that Department. The fears exhibited by the ""Western Australian public servants, subsequent events proved, were well founded. Yesterday, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) asked the Treasurer the following questions:1. Whether a permanent appointment has been made to the position of Deputy Commissioner for Pensions for Queensland? 2. If not, when will this appointment bo made, and who is to be the appointee? The Treasurer's replies Avere:1. No. 2. Tho matter is now under consideration. I think that the honourable gentleman could have been more candid than that. Judging by the nature of the appointment in South Australia, the probability is that another military man is ready to step into the position in Queensland. If that is contemplated, the Treasurer, this afternoon, must show justification for it . I hope, however, that action will be taken by this House to prevent a repetition of what occurred in South Australia. I cannot believe that the Treasurer is able to make out a case which will justify the appointment of Major Bell, and that appointment should be at once cancelled. If , as is maintained by members of the Public Service, this appointment is the thin edge of the wedge to break down the present system of making appointments and giving promotion, this House should take action to compel the Treasurer to revoke the appointment and give the position to the officer who is entitled to it. Mr Clayer entered the Public Service in 1881. He was transferred from the Postmaster-General's Department to the Pensions Department on the 18th March, 1911. I am led to believe that he is a capable officer, against whom nothing is known. Yet he has still to sit back. Another feature of the case merits earnest attention. I believe that if Mr Clayer had been given this appointment, which 1 consider he was entitled to, all the other officers of the Department would have been promoted. They, therefore, are much concerned, and from their stand-point the matter is serious. I do not think that the Treasurer was justified in so coordinating the administration of our civil and military pensions. I do not propose to say anything about Major Bell's administrative ability.",18
30,Mr MAKIN,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,I shall do that.,19
31,Mr YATES,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"I must say, however, in justice to the officers of the Pensions Department in Adelaide and to Mr John Gardiner, that whenever I have had reason to interview them, I have obtained most satisfactory attention. Unless the Treasurer gives some substantial yet reasons to justify the appointment of Major Bell, I hope that this House will indicate, in no uncertain way, that a mistake has been made which must be rectified.",19
32,Dr EARLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"Cowper-Trea surer) [3.12] - The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates), has dealt with two matters, namely, the appointment of Major Bell to the position of Deputy . Commissioner of Old-age and Invalid Pensions in Adelaide, and, also, the general impression, which seems to have been fostered by certain questions directed to me by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), that the Government propose to supersede the old-age and invalid pensions administration by repatriation administration. I shall reply briefly on both those matters. The Government's intention with respect to pensions administration generally is exactly the reverse of what seems to have been suggested by the questions asked by the honourable member for Dalley. It is the intention of the Government gradually to place the payment of the permanent repatriation pensions, of which there are now a large number, in the hands of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department. This will effect' a considerable economy, for the old age and invalid pensions system of payment' is well established throughout the Commonwealth, and is a suitable channel through which to pay the permanent repatriation pensions.",19
33,Mr SCULLIN,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,It was worthwhile moving the adjournment of the House to obtain that assurance from the - Treasurer.,19
34,Dr EARLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"Eve r since I have had charge of the repatriation administration I have been endeavouring to co-ordinate the work of the Pensions Branch with that of the permanent Pensions Department of the Commonwealth. For instance, when the lease of the premises occupied by the Old-age and In valid Pensions Department in Sydney exipired, we transferred the Department en bloc to the repatriation building, and thus saved £2,250 per annum in rent. Ultimately the problem cases now being dealt with by the Repatriation Department will decrease, and it will be possible to pay all the permanent repatriation pensions through the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department. Every week 100 repatriation pensions are being made permanent, and eventually they will all be paid in the way I have indicated. In working towards this end the Government are trying to arrange that such soldiers - as are able to handle the work shall discharge the duties appertainThe ing to both the Repatriation Pensions and the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Departments. I need say no more on this matter except that this has been the policy of the Government ever since I assumed control 'Of repatriation work. One reason why that portfolio was placed in the hands of the Treasurer was that was felt that that would lead to economy and more satisfactory service. The honourable member for Adelaide truly remarked, and I think all honourable members in the House will agree with him, that the permanent officials in our Pensions Department have rendered thoroughly satisfactory service in dealing with the claims that have been placed before them. When I visited Western Australia in February, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) introduced a deputation of pension officers to me, and I expressed to them the view which T have now expressed to honourable members. I must confess that the relevance of the questions asked by the honourable member for Dalley has now dawned upon me for the first time. I did not appreciate the fact that a member representing a New South Wales constituency was dealing with an Adelaide case.",19
35,Mr MAHONY,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,I think the Treasurer knew it all along.,20
36,Dr EARLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"I informed the honourable member for Dalley, in reply to his questions, that the Government policy would be announced at the appropriate time. When the honourable member asked me whether the appointment of Major Bell had been made, by the Public Service Board, I replied that it had not, foi the reason that Mr John Gardiner,, the ex-Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in South Australia, had not been so appointed. The administration in South Australia of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was in the hands of Mr John Gardiner, the South Australian Public Service Inspector, from 1909 to 1923. He acted in consideration of an allowance of £100 per annum. There has never been a Deputy Commissioner in South Australia who devoted the whole of his'time to pensions administration, and - the administration has thus been far less expensive than would have been the case had a full-time publio servant, drawing the usual fairly high salary, been in charge' of the work. South Australian method of administration having been found to be most satisfactory, it was determined to continue it , and Major Bell, the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation in that State, was instructed to take up the invalid and old-age pensions duties in addition to his repatriation work. The it appointment was peculiarly suitable, for invalid and old-age pensions work and repatriation pension activities have many features in common. Major Bell is discharging the duties for both Departments at the .remuneration he formerly received for repatriation work only. His salary is £650 per annum. Honourable members will realise that it is possible for him to do the work required by both - Departments on account - of the repatriation work having declined so"" considerably.",20
37,Mr YATES,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,Has he applied for the £100 per annum allowance which was paid to Mr Gardiner?,20
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"I do not. know. In consequence of the amalgamation Of the pensions work of the two Departments, considerable economy has been effected, notwithstanding that the system has been operative for only a short time. The savings are.: Allowance .to Deputy Commissioner, £100; salary of one assistant, £230; salary of one typist, £140; rent, £387. Total saving, £857.",20
39,Mr YATES,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,Surely the amalgamation has not saved rent?,20
40,Dr EARLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"It has, for the work is now being done in one building instead of in two. Similar savings axe practicable in other States, but cannot be effected immediately. I hope, however, that before very long we shall have the old-age and invalid pensions and repatriation pensions work amalgamated. When that time comes, savings, comparable with those which have already been made in Sydney and Adelaide, will result. No one will suggest that there has been any victimization through the new arrangement. No officer has been prevented from advancing in the Service. No new office has been created, because the position rendered vacant by Mr . Gardiner was not a full-time office.",20
41,Mr COLEMAN,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,Why was the Public Service Board ignored ?,21
42,Dr EARLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"Because neither officer was under the control 'of the Board. The appointment was made by the Commissioner of Pensions, because, owing to peculiar circumstances, the administration of invalid and old-age pensions in South Australia was merely a part-time position. - Mr YATES - Will Major Bell become a, permanent officer of the Commonwealth Service ?",21
43,Dr EARLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,No .,21
44,Mr MAKIN,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"Hindmarsh) [ 3 . 2 1 ] heartily concur in the object sought by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates) in raising this question today. If it has served no other purpose than to secure from the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) the information that it is the in tention of the Commonwealth Government to transfer the activities of the Repatriation Department to the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Department, this afternoon's debate has not been in vain.",21
45,Dr EAHLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,That transfer will relate only to the payment of automatic pensions.,21
46,Mr MAKIN,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"The Treasurer has claimed that the contentions put forward by the honourable member for Adelaide are not in accordance with the actual circumstances of the case he has submitted, but either he has been misinformed by his advisors, or the Department has displayed inexcusable ignorance. stance, the Treasurer was quite incorrect in saying that in South Australia, repatriation matters have been transferred to the Invalid age Pensions Department. ter of fact, the Invalid and Old age Pensions work in Adelaide has been [39] transferred to the Repatriation Department in Pulteney-street, and it is now under the direct supervision of an officer who, for some years, has occupied and still occupies the position of Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation, and is paid his salary for that position. Therefore, in Adelaide the very reverse of what the Treasurer now tells us is the policy of the Government has taken, place. The administration of invalid and old-age pensions has been transferred to the Repatriation Department, and the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation is now the Deputy Commissioner of Invalid and Old-age Pensions. It is regrettable that the Treasurer, when replying to the questions asked by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony), did not indicate the intentions of the Government in this respect.",21
47,Dr EARLE PAGE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"In A p r i l or March of last year, I told the Returned Soldiers' League in Sydney what the Government intended to do.",21
48,Mr MAKIN,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"That may be so, but the Treasurer could certainly have given the House the advantage of this knowledge at a very much earlier date than ho has. The appointment of Major Bell - I has given serious concern not only to officers in. the Commonwealth Service in South Australia, .but also to the Public Service of the Commonwealth generally. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates) has mentioned the case of Mr . Clayer who has been in the service of the State of South Australia and of the Commonwealth since 1881, and it is possible other officers in the Commonwealth service are senior to Mr Clayer, yet these trusted officials have been passed over and a position is filled by a man who is really only a "" Johnny come lately,"" and is not temperamentally fitted to supervise the administration of invalid and old-age pensions. Feeling that I could not get sympathetic treatment for the cases that came under my notice concerning the Repatriation Department, I have not for the last two years personally interviewed and submitted For in - claims to M a j or Bell, preferring to bring them under the notice of the Department in Melbourne. I was always able to go to Mr Gardiner or Mr i Clayer and Old- whenever I had a matter which conAs a mat- cerned their department. Mr M . CAMERON - Why would the honourable member not go to Major Bell I ",21
49,Mr MAKIN,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"Because in my early experience as a member of this House I had occasion to interview him, and I then realized that while he might have many excellent qualities, he was not temperamentally fitted to deal with claims for pensions. He may be a most admirable officer in other directions, but I hav6 always felt that I would nob secure from him the sympathetic treatment which the cases I might have to bring under his notice would deserve. I knew that in Melbourne I would be dealing with men who would be more sympathetic. If I could not have sufficient confidence in Mr . Bell in matters concerning returned soldiers-and he is a returned soldier himself-ho w could I expect that he would deal sympathetically with in valid and old-age pensioners, and to properly administer a Department of which he had had no previous experience ? The appointment of Major Bell is unfortunate from the stand-point, not only of the Commonwealth Public Service, but also of those who are compelled to submit to him claims for pensions. I shall not put a single claim before him ; I shall have nothing whatever to do with him.",22
50,Mr SEABROOK,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"He will not mind, I suppose.",22
51,Mr OKEEFE,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"But we, and people we represent, will mind.",22
52,Mr MAKIN,PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION,"I can afford to ignore the interjection made by the - honourable ing member for Franklin. It is in keeping with what I might have expected f r o him, and justifies the opinion I have formed of him. I repeat that I am financial not prepared to take cases with which I may be entrusted to M a j o r Bell, but shall bring them to the Central Office in MelNaval bourne for consideration. Many of these cases, no doubt, should be determined from by the local authority, but I have not sufficient confidencein the gentleman year-Roya concerned to take that course. not had sufficient experience in these £30,733. matters, and knows little or nothing about the Service. I feel that I should not be doing justice to those people who staffs come to me concerning their claims for old-age and invalid pensions if I were to Training place them before the present Deputy Commissioner in Adelaide. This proof cedure will mean that, by the circum-. stances created by the Government, I shall be required to press additional work Central Administration. The Government profess a policy of co-ordination in service and economy in administration. If what has been said this afternoon results in bringing soldiers' pensions again under the administration of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department, I shall heartily concur. But let that be done. The Government should not profess a desire for co-ordination and economy and by such appointments as the one under review act differently. That is what has been done in Adelaide, to the great concern and dissatisfaction of public servants throughout the States.' Question resolved in the negative.",22

DESTITUTE ALLOWANCE. Debate resumed from 12tk July, 1923 (vide page 1045, vol. 103), on motion by Dr MALONEY1. That this House is of opinion that Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act should be amended in order to provide for a destitute allowance to be made to all inhabitants are destitute, so that any person making statutory declaration (to a postmaster, toms officer, or other appointed Commonwealth official, a schoolmaster, a union tary, a magistrate, or other appointed indistatutory declarations. vidual) that he or she is insufficiently fed, jected clothed, or sheltered, shall be paid as soon as possible the sum of 15s. per week, and each child 10s. per week, until relieved. 2.

87,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"Cowper-Trea surer) [3.53] - This motion was moved the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) about this time last year, before the House had had an opportunity of considering the Budget proposals for increases in the invalid and old-age sions. It proposes that any person makliable to serious imposition. ing a statutoi'y declaration that he or is insufficiently fed, clothed, or sheltered, phall, as soon as possible, and u n t lieved, b'e paid 15s. a week, with an addif tional 10s. for each child. Apparently the chief object of the honourable member for Melbourne is to provide adequate lief for all those who at the present do not come with in the operation of the entitled. Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. He desires to make it as easy as possible needy persons to obtain allowances. assume that the allowance would be granted in a similar way to the Compasof sionate Allowance formerly provided i the State of ""Victoria. That was allowance granted on the recommendation of a member of Parliament, a clergyman, or any other person of repute. then, the Invalid and Old-age Pensions opinion. Act has been passed, and has come into operation throughout Australia - The motion proposes a distinct departure might, from established systems of pensions ministration. The Government recognizes that the present system is faulty in many respects. It is built on a wrong basis, and in order to correct it , a Royal mission to inquire about national insurare ance, old age, invalidity, and unemployare ment was appointed. That Commission now taking evidence. I submit that this question can be properly considered by vision. this House when the report of that Commission has been presented. I assume that we shall then go into the whole question of unemployment and invalidity. The experience of the Old-age Pensions Dethe partment is that it is very dangerous to grant pensions 011 the unsupported statewho ment of persons that they are destitute. a This is shown by the fact that since 1909, Cus47,000 claims have been rejected, and secrepractically all of them were supported by They were rebecause an examination of for the facts proved that the statutory declarations were not accurate. It is resolureasonable to assume that the claims Had they been dealt with by the method suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne, the full pension rate by would have beeu paid in a large proportion of them, although probably many of the applicants were substantially well off. A grave objection to the honourable member's proposal is that it would penmake the Commonwealth Government Applishe cants for relief under the present system are compelled to disclose all their"" i l recircumstances, and the Department has u l l power to investigate their .statements. Despite these provisions many claims are received from persons who remisrepresent facts in order to obtain time pensions to which they are not legally The adoption of a. system requiring the applicant merely to make for a declaration would give rise to a large I number of applications, many of which would, no doubt, be genuine, but some which would be fro m applicants n undeserving of assistance. It is proan posed that the applicant himself should decide whether he is insufficiently clothed, fed, and sheltered. This is a very wide Since qualification to be decided by a personal A person might make an honest declaration that he was insufficiently clothed, fed, or sheltered, and nevertheless, be in a position of adaverage comfort. Deserving persons who find themselves in destitute circumstances can generally attribute their condition to one of three causes-ol d age, in Comvalidity, or unemployment. Those who destitute on account of old age already provided for by old-age 13 pensions. For those who are permanently invalided there is similar proThere remain, therftfore, those who are temporarily incapacitated, and. - those who are unemployed. I submit that the House would be acting unwisely if it came to a decision on this motion before the Commission which has been appointed to inquire into the basis of insurance for unemployment and sickness, presents its report. have no statistics sufficiently accurate to estimate the cost of giving effect to the motion. There are 210,000 persons' over 65 years of age who are not receiving pensions. If a general invitation were extended to them to apply for pensions, and if only half of them applied, the cost would be over £5,000,000 a year. It is almost impossible to estimate what would be the cost of providing unemployment relief on the basis proposed. I should say that, at' the least, it would be £10,000,000 a year, which would bring the Commonwealth liability for relief, in this for m up to £16,000,000 or £17,000,000 a year, or £2 18s. per head of the population. Such an estimate does :aot take into account the cost of administration. Even at the present time - the cost of administration is moderately heavy, but under a system such as that advocated, with the necessity - detecting cases of imposition by people not actually destitute, it would be ;rnueh heavier and more complicated. There would have to be an enormous in crease of staff, and additional expenditure. The adoption of the proposal at Che present juncture would be a leap in the dark. We would not know where we swould land. Until the subject has been investigated by the National Insurance 'Commission, which is doing very valuable work, I ask the House to allow the motion to be postponed.",29
88,Mr LAZZARINI,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"Werriwa) [ 4 . 1 ] The plea of the Treasurer (Dr Earle statutory Page) for the postponement of this matter u n t i l the report of the Commisofficial, sion on Unemployment and Insurance he comes before the House, is in accordance wjth the usual policy of the present Gosum vernment, that all matters of an i m -' portant nature should be held over. In tion effect, the. Treasurer says, "" Let people de unemployed, and let starvation and amending Act. distress take its toll of human l if e contend that the appointment of that Commission was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to shelve this matter. They hoped that the Commission would not present its report during the life of this Parliament. The economics of the Treasurer are those of the stone age. They are the same as those of a British Prime Minister who said that assistance could not be sent to We the starving Indians, because that would be against the laws of political economy. That is ai policy of £ s. d - the policy followed by the financial institutions of the world. True economics take3 into consideration the human beings who constitute the nation. The people of a country should be considered before its finances. No nation is truly wealthy which has among its citizens both millionaires and paupers. It is only in having a sturdy aud virile people that a nation cau be considered rich in the true sense of the word. This country is capable of supporting ten times its present population, but what do we find ? In our midst there are 10,000 persons unemployed, and little children who are unable to obtain sufficient food. We should not tolerate: any system which allows even one child to ask in vain for food. I commend the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) for bringing for this matter forward. Parliament should pass the. motion, which would be a step worthy of emulation by other nations. I protest against the callous attitude adopted by the Treasurer when dealing with this important question. He attempted to brush it aside lightly by saying that some one might sign a false statutory declaration. We all know that perjury is committed every day of the week, butdo we abolish our law courts because of that? The motion reads1. That this House is of opinion that the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act should be amended in order to provide for a destitute - allowance to be made to all inhabitants who are destitute, so that any person making a declaration (to a postmaster, Customs officer, or other appointed Commonwealth a schoolmaster, a union secretary, a magistrate, or other appointed individual) that or she is insufficiently fed, clothed, or sheltered, shall be paid as soon as possible the of 15s. per week, and for each child 10s. per week, until relieved. 2. That the passing of the foregoing resolube an instruction to the Government of the Commonwealth to bring in the necessary . "" I That does not' mean that relief shall automatically be given to any person who signs a statutory declaration. The statements contained in the declaration should first be verified, and opportunity should be afforded for any cases of imposition or malingering to be detected. Even if this motion fails to receive the support of the House oil this occasion, I hope the day is not far distant when a Commonwealth Government, representative of the whole of the people, will endeavour to do something to relieve these constantly recurring periods of distress. book, The Case for Labour, the late Prime Minister (Rt. Hon. W . M . Hughes) stated definitely that unemployment and destitution are the direct result of the capitalistic system. further, that the capitalistic system should pay for the distress' it causes. I agree with Mr Hughes that these evils are the fault not of the individual, but of the system which renders unemployment inevitable. It is all very well for people to say that industry cannot stand the burden of paying for unemployment. Industry can stand it . The millions of pounds paid out each year i u dividends, and the huge wealth piled up in this country, bear eloquent testimony to the fact that industry can well afford to pay a special tax for this purpose. cannot afford to wait until this roving Commission, which sits but a few hours a week, has finished its work. sufficient evidence already at the disposal of Ministers to enable them to introduce a Bill tomorrow to deal with this matter, if they desired to do so. But while the present Ministry is in office, it is hopeless to expect that anything satisfactory will be done. I am not content to wait, .as the Treasurer has suggested. Of what use is that to the poople who today are practically destitute? It is idle to tell destitute people that the Government intend to appoint a Commission to report, next year, or the year after, on the question of a destitute allowance. It is. wanted now, and if the motion is carried by the House, immediate effect should be given to it .",30
89,Mr MARR,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"Parkes) [ 4 . 1 1 ] - I desire to amend the. motion before the House. I move That all the words after ""That,"" left out, with - a view to insert in lieu thereof the words :- "" in the opinion of this House the question of amending the Invalid and age Pensions Act to provide for the payment of a destitute allowance, be referred Royal Commission that is ^inquiring into national insurance, for report."" The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) is to be commended for bringing this important question before the House, but, at the same time, it needs very careful consideration. From the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), one would .'think that the Government supporters had-no consideration at all for the in In his valid and old-age pensioners of this country. Yet, during, the periods that Labour Governments occupied the Treasury bench, they did nothing to relieve the conditions of the pensioners - A He said, Liberal Government passed the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act . Mr O'KEKFE - The Labour party compelled it to do so.",31
90,Mr MARR,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"A National Government increased the pension. It is all very well for the Opposition to criticize the Government. An ounce of fact is worth a pound of theory. We, on this side, have not abused the Opposition for their inaction. In considering this motion, we must ascertain whether our finances permit of an increased payment to old-age - and invalid pensioners, We who may, possibly - in the near future, obtain further benefits as a result of the deliberations of the National Insurance There is Commission. The motion proposes to allow statutory declarations to be made by certain officials who, in actual practice, are not concerned with public funds. It is not necessary to go outside the Public Service to find responsible men capable of deciding whether - certain persons should be given a destitute allowance. We might just as well include union secretaries among the secretary of a branch of any National party in Australia. B ut these men are not responsible officers. . For eight years I occupied the position of union secretary, so I know what I am talking about. I should not like to have the responsibility of deciding who should and who should not get an allowance. I , and other honourable members, have claims made upon our purses for various donations, and we assist as far as it lies in our power to do so. Among the officials mentioned in the motion are school-masters, who may line 1, he be most excellent people.",31
91,Mr SCULLIN,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"Does the honorableOldmember think it necessary to refer the question of a destitute allowance toa to the Royal Commission, because of his objection to school-masters ?",31
92,Mr MARR,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"I object to any responsibility in these matters being placed upon the various officials mentioned. We have no right to commit the people of Australia by decisions by irresponsible persons' respecting the eligibility of. applicants for a destitute allowance. must very carefully consider any proposed expenditure, since the general public* and the press seem to think that the Government are throwing . money about, not knowing what to do with it . Dr MALONEY.:-I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum",32
93,Mr MARR,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"As the National Parliament of Australia, we are the custodians hot only of the public purse, but of the interests of the invalid and old-age pensioners. A decision by the National In surance Commission on the question of a destitute allowance would be far more valuable than one that might be arrived at in this House this afternoon. Opposition claim that they alone care for the invalid and old-age pensioners, yet they have failed to form a quorum during the debate on the motion.",32
94,Mr MAKIN,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,Honourable members opposite are responsible for the lack of a quorum.,32
95,Mr MARR,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"We did not call attention to the state of the House. Honourable members opposite should have been present to support the motion. honourable members should take part in the debate and express their views on a question dear to their hearts. the Labour party credit for desiring to help the invalid and old-age pensioners, but they should at least concede that the Government' have the same object in view.",32
96,Mr MAKIN,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,Not to the same extent.,32
97,Mr MARR,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,I do not claim that greater credit is clue to this side of the House than 'to honourable members opposite.,32
98,Mr MAKIN,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"The Labour party advocated a pension of £1 per week, but the Government made it 17s. 6d.",32
99,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,I ask honourable members to refrain from further interjections.,32
100,Mr MARR,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"It is common knowledge that honourable members opposite hope to attain the Treasury bench after the next election. In that case, the motion, if carried, may later create a very awkward position by forcing the Labour party to borrow money to give effect to it . I believe that the mover of the motion will agree with me that this important question of a destitute allowance should be referred to the National Insurance ComWe mission for inclusion, if thought fit, with proposals affecting invalid and old age pensions, and national insurance, now being investigated by that body. It has been stated that the National Insurance Commission should make a world-wide in quiry, and that at least some of its memformed.] bers should be sent overseas in connection with its investigations. I do not supportthat proposal, because we have in the Commonwealth sufficient data from various countries of the world to show what they have done along the lines of national insurance.",32
101,Mr FENTON,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"Then why appoint the Commission ? The Mr MARR - To see to what extent the systems adopted in other countries might be .followed in Australia. Every member of this House is hoping that in the very near future we shall have a report from the Commission, and shall be able to discuss the question in all its bearings. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) is a medical man, and I should like other medical men in this House to give expression to their views upon his proposal. I hope that my All amendment will be carried, and that the matter will be submitted to the National Insurance Commission for its report. I give  agree with the honourable members for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) and Parkes_ (Mr Marr) that the matter dealt.with ' in the motion is one of very great i m portance, and concerns a good many people. The question raised is so big, that I do not think the House shoiild be asked to endorse the motion without in vestigation. I believe that the honourable member for Melbourne is very keenly in terested in the people who would be assisted if his proposal were adopted, but he would be well advised to consent to the matter being dealt with upon a report from the National Insurance Commission. That Commission was appointed to review the system of old-age and in valid pensions, and to see whether it is not possible for us to give old, invalid, and destitute people the assistance t * which they are entitled. I feel that it would be better and more in the in terests of the people concerned that the amendment should he carried, and the Commission should report on this matter to the House. I could not support the motion without further information. It is not, I am sure, intended by the mover of the motion that monetary assistance should be given to any man or woman who displays no desire to work. I feel sure that the members of this Parliament will not do anything that would encourage people - to be lazy.. The honourable member for Melbourne is actuated by a higher motive than that. But whatever the object of the motion, the question it deals with is one which the Commission should investigate. We would, probably, as a result of its investigations, be f u r nished with some estimate of the number of people in the Commonwealth who are in a destitute condition through no faul t of their own, and the probable expenditure involved. It may be said that the motion has appeared on the notice paper for some weeks.",32
102,Dr MALONEY,EXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL,"It has been notice-paper for over a year. Mr F . FRANCIS - Whil e that may be so, I feel sure that honourable members have not in the meantime given it the consideration which its importance deserves. I have not given it sufficient consideration to justify me in voting for it in view of the public expenditure which its adoption would involve. The question dealt with is really a branch of the question upon which the National Insurance Commission was appointed to advise this Parliament. If we dealt with it now, without further information, that might be regarded as a snub to the Commission.",33

105,Dr MALONEY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Melbourne) [4.30]. - I move- That, in view of the pronounced favouritism of those who possess the gift of distribution of public works1. This House declares that all architectural plans, designs, specifications, &c., of all works for the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Bank, the estimated cost of which amounts to £3,000 and upwards, ehall be thrown open to the public competition of the architects of Australia. 2. Contingent upon this motion being carried, it be an instruction to the Government of the day to .bring in amending legislation so as to control the policy of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank in allotting architectural work and the like to one firm consisting of his relations and others. It has long been held by the architects of Australia that every Australian architect should be given a fair chance to compete for the preparation of the plans for Government and other buildings and works in the Commonwealth. Unfortu - nately, because of nepotism, which I challenge any honourable member to equal in Australia since parliamentary procedure has existed here, one large institution in the Commonwealth has not adopted this course, and .the architects of Australia have not been given a fair deal.",33
106,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,The note printing office was a good example.,33
107,Dr MALONEY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"The preparation of the plans for the note printing office was on the one of the most infamous jobs ever perpetrated in this State or in Australia, but I shall deal with that more particularly later on. In view of the fact that a majority of Protectionists has been returned to Parliament after Parliament of the Commonwealth, it is clearly the desire of the people that we should adopt a Protectionist policy, and that Australian work should, as far as possible, be done by Australians living in Australia. I have to thank the Institute of Architects, the Employers Association, and the President of the Chamber of Manufactures for much of the information I propose to submit in support of my motion. But I have jto thank the Age for having tried to expose these dealings, which I shall be able to prove by copies of sworn to the declarations setting for t h the reasons for the nepotism practised by the late Governor of the Bank. To those honourable members who may ask why I speak in criticism of one who has passed away, I reply that, loving Australia, and desiring to see justice done, I have a duty to speak the truth. If anybody can impugn the accuracy of any statement. I make, I shall take it as a personal favour if he will do so, and I shall, on proof, readily withdraw it . I desire to prevent a repetition of the improper practices of the past. The Age tried to get the information which would supply the key to the nepotism that i:t knew was being practised, but not even the then Prime Minister could supply the facts. The Governor of the Bank was made by this Parliament a dictator, and could do what he chose with the funds deposited in the Bank. Honourable members' will agree that the continued silence of the late Sir Denison Miller, in spite of the efforts of the Age to have the facts made public, indicated his guilt. The first instance I shall quote is that of the Note P r in t in g Office, in Victoria-parade, Melbourne. of a new building for the note-printing works were prepared by departmental officers and submitted to the Public Works Committee. The estimated cost of the building, including all engineering services, was £4.4,200. In addition, there was an estimated expenditure of £1,600 for laying the electric mains, and £2,000 for moving and installing the machinery, making a total of £47,800. The investigations by the Committee disclosed the possibility of saving £1,000 by an alteration in the floors. That reduced the total estimated cost to £46,800. Shortly afterwards the control of the Note P r in t in g Office passed from the Treasury to the Commonwealth Bank, and the result was that all the plans' and quantities which had been prepared by the Department at great cost were thrown aside, and Sir Denison Miller's relatives-the Kirkpatricks, his cousins, 'and Mr Miller, his son-were commissioned to prepare a new plan at a huge cost. I endeavoured today to get particulars of the additional cost that was entailed by that change, but the Minister could not supply them; he must wait upon the sweet will of the Acting Governor of the Bank. Notwithstanding that the Public W o r k s ' Committee had recommended a building more complete than was asked for by the Note Printer, the Governor of the Commonwealth-Bank was not satisfied. Yet any architect would say that the recommendationof the Public Works Committee was justified. On the 13th July, 1922, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) asked these questions of the then TreasurerIn connection with the proposed erection of a Note Printing Office in Victoria-parade, Fitzroy, Victoria, will he.inform the House*1. What is the estimated cost of the proposed building? 2. Who prepared the plans of the building now proposed to be erected? Dr Maloney. 3. What sums have been paid, or are payable, in respect of the preparation of plans or taking out - of quantities in connection with the proposed work? 4. Is he aware that the Public Works Committee reported in 11)1!) that a suitable huilding could be erected for £43,200? 5. Were the plans and particulars furnished to the Committee made use of in designing the building now proposed ? 0. If not, why was the public called upon to pay a firm of private architects thousands of pounds for the preparaPlans tion of plans and the taking out of quantities which were already available in the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways?",33
108,Mr BRUCE,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"The answers to the honourable inemhor's questions are as follow:1, 2, and. 3. Since the recommendation was made by the Public Works Committee in 1019 that a Note Printing Office be erected in _Victoria-parade, Fitzroy, the Australian note issue has been transfered to the' Note Issue Department, of the Commonwealth Bank, and the site on which it is proposed to erect the new building has been - purchased by the Bank with the object of building premises suitable for note printing. It is understood that plans of a new building have been prepared by the Bank's own architects,by the Governor's own relativesbut no particulars, such as those asked for by the honourable mem'her, have been supplied to the Government by the Commonwealth Bank. 4. Yes. 5. No. Of course not; the architects would not have made as much money out of the public if they had used the departmental plans. 0. I cannot answer this question, it being one which pertains only to the management of the Bank, over which I have no control. At that time we did not know the relationship of the Governor of t,he' Bank to members of the firm of Kirkpatrick and Sons. In connection with the War Service Homes an even greater infamy was perpetrated, as the result of which the soldiers of Australia were robbed for the benefit of Sir Denison Miller's relatives. I find in a laudatory article published in ihe Scientific Australian on the 5th March, 1.924, that the Commonwealth Bank had purchased 5,179 homes, and 987 building blocks, and had erected 1,777 houses. A question I asked the other day elicited the fact that for architectural services in connection with those homes £48,917 was paid to the Kirkpatrick firm, and 2,892 separate plans were prepared. An y decent firm of architects in Melbourne, Sydney, or Adelaide would prepare twelve sets of plans at a fraction of that cost. The Victorian State Savings Bank, which is erecting more buildings than the Commonwealth Bank ever erected, would have rendered the same service for approximately £6,900. A fight took place between the Governor of 'the Commonwealth Bank,"" the AuditorrGeneral, Mr Israel, - and the then Commissioner for War Service Homes, Colonel Walker. I once .attacked Colonel Walker because 1 thought he had done wrong, but in this matter he was absolutely right, and if he had had his way the unfortunate soldiers would have been saved at least £42,000, which was paid to Sir Denison Miller's relatives. Could there be a graver in stance of nepotism? But Sir Denison Miller was not ashamed of what took place, because he knew how difficult it was for members of Parliament or the public to learn the facts. I have to thank Mr . Ashworth, President of the Victorian Employers Federation, for evidence of the relationship of Sir Denison Miller to the firm of Kirkpatrick and Sons. Honourable members may think that because Mr . Ashworth is an architect he is biased, but he retired from active practice nearly two years ago. He is quite unbiased, and only a strong sense of duty has caused him to reveal these facts through the columns of the Press. He did not seek any cover of privilege, but openly accused the late Governor of the Commonwealth Bank of actions of which he should be ashamed. Let no honourable member think that I am making statements now which I would not have made to the late Sir Denison Miller. In the presence of the then Treasurer (Mr Higgs), I said to Sir Denison Miller things worse than I am saying today. I should not have .waited t ill this date to discuss the matter in the House, but that I could not earlier get the information I sought. Mr Ashworth said:Backed up by the national credit and handling the Commonwealth Government accounts, the note issue, and the war loans, the growth of the Commonwealth Bank was natural and inevitable quite apart from the particular banker placed in charge. That the Governor of the Bank (Sir TJenison Miller) has some capacity as an. organizer may be admitted, but whether or not his capacity in that direction is exceptional is open to question. In most bankers of standing, organizing capacity may bo taken for granted. more serious question arises is the Governor a really big banker and a big man ? Leaving Sir Denison's standing as a scientific banker to experts (popular opinion on this question is worthless unless hascd on expert judgment) the most important question of all remainsdoes he possess that keen sense of personal honour, so essential to the discharge of his high public trust? Any member of the public is entitled to ask this question if he can advance facts tending to show that the Governor is lacking in this indispensable qualification. Sir Denison has appointed the firm of J. and H. G. Kirkpatrick as the Bank's architects, the two Kirkpatrick members of the firm being his cousins and the third member-J . Millerhis son. It has been publicly stated that the firm is responsible for unbusinesslike procedure, loss, and delay in connection with the new Melbourne Collins-street building of the Bank. For seven months after it was available for building operations that valuable site was left unimproved. Inquiry would show that the blame lay with the bank's architects, and not with the city architect, because .the plans were not fit for use. Would any private bank, which had the site and the money necessary for building, submit to seven months' delay because of the f a u l t of the architects? Assuming this to be correct, what is the position of the Governor? On the one hand it is his duty to hold the architects responsible for their failure by dismissing them from the service of the Bank. On the other hand, personal interest in the members of his family may induce him to excuse the failure. ' No person holding a position of public trust should allow himself to be placed in such an invidious position. It is a fundamental legal maxim expressed in the law of agency and trustees of every description, including members of Parliament, that there shall be no conflict between interest and duty. Persons holding offices of public trust must be free from - the most remote suspicion of using their positions to advance the interests of members of their family. I say without hesitation that the demoralizing example of Sir Denison Miller must be visited with stern public condemnation if high standards of public life are to be secured in Australia. ... Nepotism breeds irresponsibility, - extravagance and inefficiency. Not least of the sins of the Hughes Government is that it neglected to ascertain and publish the facts underlying the aspersion of nepotism cast upon the .Governor of the Bank by questions asked in Parliament. Nearly two years elapsed from the time these questions were first put to the Government before the information as given above was obtained and published by a private citizen. During this period the questions were repeated many times to the Government, and Sir Denison Miller was asked both publicly and privately to. supply the information. The facts, however, could not be obtained from either source. The This is another example of the hush-up policy which has done so much to discredit the Hughes Administration. The Hughes' Government, to whichreference is made, was not only discredited, but defeated.

Bradley, Son, & Maughan, instructing them to obtain birth certificates of Mv. J. K . Miller and Messrs. John and H . G. Kirkpatrick, and on Thursday last received from them the birth certificates of Mr J. K . Miller and Mr . John Kirkpatrick and a notification that there was no record of the birth of Mr H . G-. K i r kpatrick in the New South Wales records. In the meantime we had been in communication with Mr Ashworth, and through him had ascertained that Mr John Kiikpatrick's mother and Sir Denison Miller's mother were sisters. We, therefore, wired Messrs. Bradley, Son, &. Maughan not to proceed further with the birth certificate of Mr H . G. Kirkpatrick, but to obtain as soon as possible the birth certificate of Sir Denison Miller. If his mother's maiden CHILD. When and where born Name Sex PARENTS, FATHER.

The architectural work in connection with the Commonwealth Bank's activities and a large number of War Service Homes was given to this firm, although many reputable architects rendered service to their country, not only in Australia, but abroad, during the Great War. Every member of the firm of which Mr Blackett, who was president of the Institute of Architects, was a member, enlisted for service overseas, and even the lady typist in the office served as a nurse. Their office was closed. Notwithstanding this, the members of this and other firms were not permitted to submit designs for the Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne and other constructional work undertaken by the Bank.  done by men who have not even paid their debts?",37
113,Dr MALONEY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Yes , as shown by the dirty IOU's which I have produced, and which have never been honoured. Why are Chubb's safes exclusively - used in the Commonwealth Bank? I intend to submit a list of those using safes made by a firm in Sydney'and Melbourne, which, I am sure, can make safes and locks equal, if not superior, to those manufactured by the firm of Chubb. Here, again, there is a relationship between the late Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and the Chubb Company in England. I now quote a letter dated the 2nd June, 1922, from Mr Ashworth to Mr B . F . Marks, of the Protex Safe and Lock Company Limited, Waterloo, Sydney, which readsDear Sir, I understand from Mr Nullum Barnett, architect, of this city, that you may be willing to furnish me with some information concerning Later, his the reason why the Commonwealth Bank gives to Chubb's safes preference over the Australian article. Is it true that some relationship exists between a jirominent officer of the CommonThis wealth Bank and the manufacturers of the safes supplied to the Bank? I also submit a letter from the Protex Safe and Lock Company Limited , Sydney, dated the 6th June, 1922, to the president .of the Victorian Employers Federation, Melbourne, which reads*Dear Sir, Kirkpatrick's We have to own receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst. and note contents with much interest. We cannot, of course, state any actual reason why the Commonwealth Bank gives preference, to Chubb's safes over the Australian made article. We can only presume reasons for this attitude, and our treatment by that institution certainly justifies our presumptions. In no instance has a single letter, which we have addressed to that Bank, been favoured with the merest acknowledgement, which is, we are glad to say, an unique experience. When consideration is given to the fact that we attend to and supply all the safes and strong-room doors for the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, that we do the bulk of the work for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, and that we number among our clients the ABC. Bank, the Queensland National Bank, the Bank of Adelaide, the London Bank of Australia, the Commonwealth Works and Railways Department (supply of all strong-room doors for post offices, &c), the 1'ostal Department, the South British Insurance Company, the Queensland Insurance Company, the A.M.P. Society, the Perpetual Trustee Company, Grace Brothers Limited, Henry Jones and Company Limited, Taylor Brothers Limited, Prouds Limited, the Fresh Food and Ice Company Limited, the Coastal Farmers Co-operative Society, the Australian Gaslight Company Limited, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (Waratah), the Fiji Government Treasury, the London Assurance Company Limited, &c, &c, the utter indifference shown by the Bank to our claim for even a hearing is hard to justify. The matter is one that causes us some concern, most particularly when we know it is the stated policy of the Federal Government to give preference to Australian-made goods. That is the point on which I want to rivet attention. The letter continues:In our case, as the list of the above-mentioned clients indicate, there cannot be any question as regards the security we can supply; in fact by reason of the patent "" Protex AntiExplosive Lock,"" we can substantiate our claim to afford better security than any other maker can provide, also we can sell, quality for quality, at a much cheaper rate than any of the well-known English makers of similar lines. We are prepared to make any class of security up to the very highest grade of bankers' requirements, and are always prepared to put our products up for test against those of the same class made by any other manufacturers. As an instance of the class of work we turn out we would mention that we are now supplying to an important city bank one main bank vault door, oxy-acetelyno resisting and drill proof, With lobby and tight door, and one main bank vault door, oxy-acetelyne and drill proof, with lobby and water-tight door at rear. These doors are the very latest in strong-room door construction, and possess features for security that no other door in any bank in the city can show. There can be no question of our not being able to supply what the bank requires, because we are prepared to supply anything that they may require. The bulk of our hands are returned soldiers, who we have engaged through the Department of Repatriation Vocational Department, whereby we have saved that Department considerable expense, and for which We think wo should receive some little consideration at the hands of a Government institution. We ask for no consideration on these grounds, but it would he no less than our deserts. We have given Mr Barnett particulars for your information, which he will be able to give you verbally. If there is anything we can do to assist you in the event of your making any representations as to the attitude of the Bank in dealing with Australian concerns,' we shall be pleased to assist you to the best of our ability. Yours faithfully, Protex Safe and Lock Co. Ltd. The following letter proves the relationship between Sir Denison Miller and the Chubb f a m i l y :325 Collins-street, Melbourne, 14th April, 1924. Dr Maloney. M.H.R., 513 Elizabeth-street, Melbourne. Dear Doctor, As promised, I enclose article on Commonwealth Bank's building policy; also a letter sent by me to the Protex Safe and Lock Company of Sydney, and their reply. The information that I had, when I sent the letter, went to show t'hat a member of Sir Denison Miller's Dr Maloney. family was married to a member of the Chubb family, and I received an incidental confirmation of this when in Birmingham. Mr Chubb, the head of the firm, I believe, sat next to rnc at the hotel dining table, and when he learned that 1 came from Australia, made reference to Sir Denison Miller, and told me that the families were connected by marriage. The significance of this fact, taken in conjunction with the Protex Safe and Lock Company's letter, will not he lost on you. Yours faithfully, H. R. ASHWORTH. I have shown as clearly as one can, what I set out to prove. This evidence has taken some years to collect. Not even the mighty power of the press is sufficient to destroy the force of that admission. Imagine the way in which a good up-todate lawyer would handle this matter if he had the opportunity to cross-examine water- on it . Some honourable members may have read a book entitled The Circulating Sovereign, published by Mr J . M . Scott, whose knowledge of nnance must have impressed any one who has had the privilege of knowing or even of meeting him. In March, 1921, a public meeting was held in the Sydney Town H all . At that meeting a committee was formed on which were Mr Scott, Sir Joseph Carruthers, the late Mr T. J . Ryan, and others. It was decided to call on Sir Denison Miller, the meeting believing that, as he had full control of the money power of Australia, his in fluence would be sufficient to solve the unemployed problem. Sir Joseph Carruthers was somewhat timi d about calling on Sir Denison, considering that such action might constitute a slight on members of Parliament. He, therefore, did not accompany the committee at that time. In the J u l y following, a public meeting was held in Martin-place, Sydney, and on Thursday, the 7th July, at 3.30 p.m., Messrs. Scott-, J . K . Powell, B. A. MARKS, Geo. Waite, H . S. Cohen, H . Pritchaxd, Managing Director. W . C. Atkinson, H . S. Humphries, and A . G. Huie waited on Sir Denison M i l ler. A representative of The Daily EcJto subsequently interviewed Mr Scott to - obtain - particulars of his meeting with Sir Denison, and his report appeared in the issue of the 16th September, 1921, from which I now quote. He asked him"" How many of the deputation were Australian Labour party members ?"" Mr Scott replied, "" Five, and I hope all good - Australian citizens . . . but what has that to - do with it ? . . . Sir Denison Miller received - us just as a good Australian might be expected to receive a deputation of citizens. Two lady shorthand writers from the bank staff were present, and recorded what happened. Each deputationist spoke to Sir Denison the thoughts, that each had. I was not interested in academic problems. We had certain machinery in existence, and I wanted an acknowledgement from Sir Denison of the power of that financial machinery, and an expression also from him of his willingness or otherwise, to use the power already existing. I asked ' What is the power of the Commonwealth Bank to finance Australia ?' He said, ' This bank is just as powerful as the Australian Commonwealth is.' said, ' Sir Denison, you did finance Australia for £350,000,000 for war purposes, and had the war continued, you could have financed it to another £350,000,000 for war, is that not so? ' Sir Denison replied, ' That was the case.' ' Then, Sir Denison,' I said, ' Are you prepared to finance Australia for £350,000,000 for productive purposes ? * He replied, ' Yes, I will do my best.* I said,.' Thank you, Sir Denison ; that is the point.' I wrote down what had occurred, and read it back to Sir Denison, stating at the time that I only wanted what he would endorse, as the matter would be made public, and he replied, ' I will endorse that.' "" Mr Scott had had several interstatement views with Sir Denison prior to that occasion, and he had others subseInstitute quently. The tenor of those conversations was whether, in order to organize AusKirkpatrick tralia productively, Sir Denison was preby pared to advance the same amount of money that he claimed to have advanced for war purposes. His answer to one deMiller's putation was that if the Prime Minister partment. of the Commonwealth approached him on In the matter he was prepared to do it.  money for the .war; it was the people Australia who found the money for him.",37
114,Dr MALONEY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I agree with the honourable member; I am merely showing the power that that man possessed. On one occasion, when speaking on this mat20/8806, ter,. I asked the then Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) whether the Governor df the Commonwealth Bank was entitled to architects' claim that he was in. a position to take such action in opposition to the wishes the Government.",39
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENCOURAGEMENT OF," Order! I think the honourable member is slightly departing present. from the terms of his motion. Dr MALONEY,- I have no desire to run counter to your ruling, Mr Deputy Minister. Speaker. I have proved my point up to of the hilt. I wanted to show whether he was willing to help Australia to remove paid. for ever the curse of unemployment. I must, in justice to Mr ""Walker, whom attacked in this House, state that i advice had been followed instead of that of the Commonwealth Bank, the unfortunate returned soldiers of Australia would not have been robbed of a large sum of money for the benefit of Sir Denison Miller's relatives. I hope I have made that plain to the House. The fee of the State Bank is from £3 3s. to £4 4s. That charge is inclusive of plan and every other item. Any architect of standing will tell honourable members that the Bank I has twelve complete sets of plans. If a man wants a house built he is asked to choose one of those twelve designs. What was the practice followed by the Commonwealth Bank? If the Scientific Australian be accurate, it issued 2,892 plans, and built 1,777 houses. Cannot honourable members see how this practice benefited the Kirkpatrick crowd all the time? They drew £24 for every plan. Honourable members, surely, cannot support that kind of thing. Mr Ashworth, in a ir. the Melbourne Age on the 9th J u n e , 1921, said, on this matter I was present at a meeting of the Victorian of Architects when the first plans Por War Service Homes, prepared by Messrs. and Miller, and those prepared the architects of the War Service Homes Department, were discussed. Every member who spoke condemned the Kirkpatrick and plans and approved those of the Dejustice to Mr W a l k e r , I think I should read a letter w r it t e n by him to A u d it o r - G e n e r al of the Commonof wealth . It is as f o l l o w s : War Service Homes Commission, Headquarters, Melb., 18th Aug., 1920. Dear Sir, I am in receipt of yours of 6th inst., No. covering copy of communication addressed to you by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank in regard to the payment of fees. My attitude in this matter was fully disclosed in the file bearing on the subject recently forwarded to you, but as you of desire advice concerning the points raisedby the Governor of the Bank, I should like to point out that the Conference referred to m first paragraph was attended by the Hon. W. A. Watt, Senator Millen, Mr Collins, and Sir Denison Miller, and at no time was I Sir Denison Miller states, however, that the Conference was attended by Mr . Watt, Senator Millen, and another Cabinet Although I was not present at this Conference, I do not think that the question architects' fees was dealt with; but, if it was,'I am quite sure that no arrangement was made by the Minister for 31 per cent, to be Further on, Sir Denison Miller states that "" the Bank always understood that' the I architects' fees were to be paid by the Comf his missioner, and not by the soldier."" It*as ever so much easier to collect fees from a Government Department than from individuals. If the soldiers had known that they would have to pay £ 2 4 each for architects' services, which they could have obtained in the .ordinary way for £ 4 Is. or £ 5 5s., they would have complained immediately. The letter proceedsIn this connection, I desire to refer to the notes of an interview between the Governor of the Bank and myself on the 31st July, 1919, in which the following remarks by Sir Denison As Miller are set out:""The charges would be revised .periodically, do not and, if it was found that, as against the sity soldier the charges are excessive . . . ."" have This statement was quoted to the Governor in &c., shall my communication of 9th September, 1919, and was not questioned in any way by that gentleit man in his reply dated 15th September, As you probably gleaned from the file the itself, the decision to charge the cost of presimilar paring plans, specifications, &c, to the . soldier applicants was not departed from by me all through; and I cannot understand Sir Denison Miller's present statements that I concurred in some other arrangement. On several occaunreasonable sions, as Sir Denison Miller mentioned, interviews with him on the subject, and when requested to pass the various claims subtimes mitted by the Bank's architects, I refused and referred to my correspondence on subject, also, stating that under no circumstances would I .permit the employment architects On a percentage basis. That shows that Mr Walker was absothis exorbitant charge. lutely against engaging architects on a percentage basis. The letter continuesThis decision, however, Sir Denison Miller"" flatly declined to recognize, and on more than one occasion stated that under the agreement he had power to do what he chose in this matter Sir Denison Miller was a dictator. Whenever it was a case of Miller against the Department, Miller had his way, and used his power for the purpose of benefita ing his relatives. The letter goes on follows:This attitude is directly opposed to adopted by the Bank within the last weeks, when a number of incompleted contracts were thrown back on the Bank by taincontractors owing to theitf financial emlows :barrassment. These could not be completed without certain loss resulting, the' Governor strongly contended should be paid to this firm. borne by the Commission on the ground that the Bank was acting as its agent. As 'to the final paragraph of Sir Denison Miller's communication, you will notice from the file which you have under review that the ""very outset I strenuously opposed the charge of 3J per cent., taking the view that Dr Maloney. this was excessive. This view was brought prominently to the notice of Sir Denison Miller at several interviews and at one I mentioned, in explanation of my attitude, that 3} per cent, might be a fair charge by a private architect for the preparation of plans and specifications for a single house, but that 3} per cent, in respect of each of many plans and specifications of standardized design was exorbitant. This view I still hold, and although Sir Denison Miller declined to use the type plans and specifications prepared by the Commission, he, nevertheless, used type plans and specifications prepared by his own architects. to the reasonableness of this charge you have not yet arbitrated, and I regret that I share the view that there is no necesfor its determination. The matter, to my mind, is of paramount importance, for as you decided that the cost of preparing plans, be borne by the soldier applicants, follows that such applicants will be required to accept the charge of 3J per cent., which is considered excessive as compared with Commission's charge of 1J per cent, for services. It is very clear from that letter that Mr. Walker fought against the imposition of charges on the soldiers. Sir I had Denison Miller charged the soldiers six more for the architectural work in the construction of their houses than is the charged by the State Savings Bank for of work carried out under the Credit Foncier system. Sir Denison Miller's relativesKirkpatrick and his son-benefite d by Mi\ GABB - I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.]",39
116,Dr MALONEY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Lest'an y honourable, member should imagine that this is the first time. I have referred to this subject, I must remind the House that I attacked the administration of the Commonwealth Bank in respect to War Service Homes as long ago as the 4th November, 1920. For long time. I was unable to obtain any as information from the Minister about the charges which would be imposed on the that soldiers. On page 6200 of the 1920-21 few Hansard my remarks respecting the cerKirkpatrick firm are reported - as foland this loss theI Treasurer have been unable to get an answer from as to how much money has been In all my 30 years of political life I have never seen anything so nearly approaching nepotism. Why cannot our brave returned men of the profession have an opportunity to compete for the design, of the profrom posed new Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne? Why should this work be given to one particular firm ? I asked if any member of that firm had offered his services during the war. The Minister could not tell me. I do not say that he did not want to know, hut, as head of the Department, I should like to know why he did not make an inquiry and find out. As an old banker, I may be forgiven for reminding honourable members that one bank frequently grants to another bank favours of which the customers and shareholders of the respective banks know nothing. I admit that the Commonwealth Bank was established by a Government of which I was a whole-hearted supporter. Mr K i ng O'Malley was really the father of the Commonwealth Bank, but it was not established according to the plans he laid down. He desired to provide for a Board of seven directors. Each State was to have appointed one representative, and the Commonwealth Government was to have appointed the seventh member of the Board, who was to have been the chairman. H ad that plan been followed, all the business of the bank would have been consequent upon an absolute maj o r it y decision of the directors, and the War Service Homes trouble would not have occurred. I hope that this Government will not appoint another Governor of the Bank while Parliament is in recess. I do not think they will do so. I hope, also, that the Government will see that all Australian architects have opportunities to compete in the preparation of plans for public buildings.",40

118,Dr MALONEY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I think the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson), who has much more knowledge than I of the matters to which I have been referring, can verify my assertion that injustice has been done. I thank honourable members for their courtesy in listening so attentively to my remarks. I am an Australian, and I love Australia. I want every Australian to be given a fair chance. I do not want to see bribery, corruption, or fraud practised by any Australian Government, nor do I wish to see again anything that in m y 35 years' experience of political l if e can be compared with this horrible case of nepotism. Debate (on motion by Mr STEWART) adjourned. POSTPONEMENT. Notice of motion, "" No. 2, Dismissal of Corporal Randall "" postponed, OODNADATTA - AL 1 CE SPRINGS RAILWAY.",41
119,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Bass) [5.36] - I move That, in the opinion of this House, the Government should immediately commence the construction of that section of railway line Oodnadatta-Alice Springs, as part of-it the North-South railway, and as recommended by the Public Works Committee. The line which I think should be constructed would stretch' for 297£ miles from Oodnadatta, the present rail head, which is 688 miles north of Adelaide. The many discussions that have taken place on the North-South railway have made honourable members fully acquainted with the' reason which prevented the South Australian Government from continuing the railway line beyond Oodnadatta, and those honourable members who have been fortunate enough to go as far north as that inland town know that the line ends in one of the poorest parts of Central Australia. However, the country shows a wonderful improvement beyond the boundary line between South Australia and the Northern Territory, about 140 miles north of Oodnadatta, and although the rainfall is only from 6 inches to 8 inches per annum, a very slender reed for pastoralists to rely upon, ample water can be obtained at shallow depths throughout the country from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. I understand that at the latter place the evaporation is 94 inches as compared with S3 'inches or 35 inches at Adelaide, but no attempt has yet been made in the neighbourhood of the Macdonnell Ranges, to conserve water as it has been conserved in the Riverina district of New South Wales and in the Wimmera district of ""Victoria. As a matter of fact, I understand that i u the whole of this area stretching for' 200 miles, there has been only one dam constructed. The Commonwealth has'' had control of the Northern Territory for about thirteen years, and it is not creditable to the administration that no attempt has been made to secure proper data of the rainfal l and the possibilities of water conservation in this part of' the Territory. It may be said that I - am asking the Government to build a railway to a place where there is no settlement or any. possibility of having ?e€tlement, but having given the matter a fair amount of study by reading the various Government reports, and having had an opportunity to discuss this country with rnen who have fifteen and twenty years of their lives in it , and having seen the country myself, I have come to the conclusion that with - a railway, centre of Australia would become a wonderful asset to the Commonwealth. Sir Sidney Kidman, who is described as the cattle and sheep king of Australia, has assured me that he knows of no better climate in the world than that which is to be found in the Macdonnell Ranges. Some honourable members declare that no cattle king of Australia has ever lived on his land, but Sir Sidney Kidman was bred in the interior, and has spent about twenty years in the country of which I am talking. The Macdonnell Ranges, the height of which varies from 2,000 feet to 5,000 feet above sea level, cover an area of a greater size than the State of Tasmania. Over a period of twenty-eight years, prior to 1920, the average rainfal l in this part was 11 inches. Phenomenal rains of over 22 inches have fallen during two seasons since-then, b u l those figures have not been taken into account in arriving at the average of 11 inches. Honourable members who saw the photographs displayed in Queen's H all last week will realise the possibilities of water conseivation in the ranges. For the expenditure of a few thousand pounds the Government could very determine whether the country will hold water, and what the rate of evaporation is. I suggested last year that something should be done to secure this data, but the Government said that they had sufficient informatio n on hand. It is remarkable that when the Departments are asked to supply accurate data of the rainfalli n this portion of Australia, they cannot give the figures, except for Alice Springs, and, perhaps, the Hermannsburg Mission Station. I doubt whether there is sufficient data available in regard to the r a in f all at Arltunga, in the eastern portion of the ranges, where there is a police station, and I am sure that beyond the Hermannsburg Mission Station, to the west, where there is land fit for selection, no attempt has been made to get this information.",41
120,Mr MAXWELL,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,Do the ranges run east ana west?,42
121,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"They run for 400 miles from east to west, with a slight turn to the north-east, and they are 70 miles spent ten, across. Central Mount Stuart is 2,600 feet above sea level. The whole of the country has a height of not less than 2,000 feet above sea level. The feed the is excellent. I honestly believe that the statement made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, that the centre of Australia will carry, if not one sheep to the acre, at least one sheep to 3 aeres, was a fair one. .Prominent pastoralists have told me that it is a fair estimate under ordinary conditions. The year when members of the Public Works Committee passed through that country was most exceptional, so far as that portion to the south of the ranges was concerned, but north of the ranges the season was an ordinary one. I understand that the r a in f all has been nothing out of the ordinary this year, when a visit was made to that country by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr . Stewart), and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), both of whom were astonished at what they saw. Just to the north of the ranges lies B u r t Plain, 95 miles across, and as far as the eye could see it was at the time of our visit covered with wonderful feed for sheep and cattle. But it is useless to talk about raising sheep 300 miles from a railway. The only way in which sheep can be made a success in the centre easily of Australia is by providing a railway, and enabling people to get their goods at reasonable prices. The main requirement for pastoralists who are breeding sheep is wire netting. I do not know that honourable members full y realise the cost of, getting goods into the centre of Australia. The average cost of conveying goods from Adelaide to Oodnadatta is £10 or £1 1 per ton, and the minimum charge from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs is £17 a ton by camels, with a 50 per cent, increase for petrol or bottled goods. The carriers, who are mostly Afghans, give no guarantee that they will deliver what they are carrying in good order, but through Divine Providence things are mostly landed, in good condition, although at Christmas time, 1920, the camel teams took it into their heads to lie down in the bed of the River Finke, and the flour and sugar they were carrying, particularly the sugar, were delivered in solid lumps. With £28 or £30 a ton for carriage added to the cost of the wire netting or wire required for fencing, honourable members can see how impossible it would be for a small pastoralist to make good in the interior. To-day I was shown by a gentleman who had casually picked up the first volume of the Commonwealbh Barnard, that there was a reference to the North-South railway in the first speech delivered by the first Governor General. We have been playing with this question long enough. We have already spent several millions on the Federal Capital, and have committed ourselves to the expenditure of many more millions upon that Capital. From a closer settlement and national production point, of view, that expenditure will not benefit Australia very much. It seems tome that we can only find out whether the centre of Australia is excellent sheep country, as the experts say it ing a railway to it. We know already that it is excellent cattle country. Cattle have been driven from the Macdonnell Ranges, 325 miles, to Oodnadatta, trucked there, railed nearly 700 miles to Adelaide, and then railed' on to Melbourne, where they fetched the top prices in the market. That has happened on more than one occasion. who have had experience with horses know that the finest horseflesh Australia can produce comes from the Macdonnell Ranges. Yet, while enthusiasts have been ""battling."" in this Parliament for the expenditure of millions of pounds at Canberra, they will not face one of the greatest developmental propositions that has ever confronted a National Parliament. It is within the memory of many honourable members that exactly the same things as have been printed day after day by the metropolitan dailies of Australia concerning the proposal to build the North-South railway were printed by American newspapers in regard to the proposal to build a railway across the United States of America. They said that such a railway would never pay for axle grease, and so on. We all know the arguments that were advanced against the building of that line.. If we are to hold Australia as a white man's country we must make a serious attempt to settle people in the interior, and we can only do that by giving them transport facilitiesWhat other country has developed without the building of railways? Java, a fertile island, which is a little less than twice the size of Tasmania, has thousands of miles of railways, yet our Northern Territory, with its 523,000 square miles, is said to have been given a chance of developing with only 199-j miles of railway; and that I am sorry to say is at the wrong end of it. If the problem of developing the Northern Territory had been tackled from the south, by now there would have been a very fine settlement in and around the Macdonnell Ranges. I am sorry that the Government in power when the Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth made the unfortunate mistake of sending a huge staff of civil servants to Darwin, where they seem to be running over one another.",42
122,Mr NELSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"They should be removed is, by build- to Newcastle Waters.",43
123,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"They should be removed inland, because now they seem to go to Darwin with the sole idea of staying there no longer than they can absolutely help. If they were stationed at Newcastle Waters, or, better still, at Alice Springs, which I think should be the administrative centre of - the Territory, they Those would establish permanent homes, because the climate is so good there - I do not know of any other place in Australia with a better climate through the whole period of the year.",43
124,Mr WEST,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Is it better than that of Sydney ? "" Mr JACKSON - Sydney is at sea level; Alice Springs is 2,000 feet above sea level. There is an ample water supply a few feet below the surface. I saw a magnificent well there no deeper than 8 feet or 9 feet.",43
125,Mr MAXWELL,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,Is that water suitable for all purposes?,43
126,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"It is particularly good drinking water. In the winter, during from six to eight weeks of the year, you can break ice on the pools every morning. Then follow nice bright, sunny days, with a temperature of from 70 to 75 degrees. Pleasant conditions last for something like six months of the year. At times, especially during the month of July, the mean low temperature is lower than in Melbourne, but for three months in the summer, say from the last two weeks of November, through December, January, and a portion of February, there is a mean temperature of 98 degrees, but, as the people who live there point out, it is a dry heat, so that 98 degrees at Alice Springs is infinitely preferable to 88 degrees in bourne. It is remarkable that if people who have lived there for a length of time move south, they soon want to get back again. We who are the custodians of the public purse should be prepared to spend £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 in an endeavour to develop this vast area. Apart altogether from its pastoral prospects, there is the bility of opening up important mining propositions. I do not suggest that the railway should be built purely for mining development, unless, of course, it were definitely proved that a wonderful field was awaiting exploitation; but if we add to the prospects of the pastoral industry the possibility of important mining developments, I am satisfied that an excellent case may be made out for the construction of this line. For 400 miles north of the Macdonnell Ranges-for a distance certainly of 350 miles-ever y known commercial mineral excepting tin has been discovered. The farthest south that tin has been discovered is at Marranboy, 250 miles south of Darwin. Mr Davidson, who was head of a prospecting party in 1901, stated in a report to the South Australian Government that excellent ""shows"" had been found in Central Australia, but that in the absence of railway facilities anything under 10 ounces to the ton could not be made to pay. From the centre of the mineral fields to the nearest railway in Queenslaud the distance is 360 miles, over a long dry stretch of country.",43
127,Mr NELSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,Is the honourable member referring to Arltunga?,44
128,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"No , I am speaking - of Hatch's Creek, as the centre of the mineral field to which I refer. When war broke out Britain was very short of wolfram, a commodity essential for the hardening of steel. This area sent away scores of thousands of pounds' worth of this valuable mineral, the deposits of which are reported to be wonderfully rich. In addition to wolfram, there is also molybdenite, and any quantity of copper and silver-lead, as well as wonderful deposits of mica, some of which, according to recent reports, realized 32s. per lb. in the United States.",44
129,Mr NELSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,The best in the world.,44
130,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I do not know if Melthere are better fields, but there is very little better mica anywhere in the world than that found north-east of the Macdonnell Ranges. Unfortunately transport difficulties prevent the development of the field. It has been said, in criticism of the field, that the seams are not large. This may be correct, but the difficulties of marketing possi- the product are increased by the unsatisfactory transport arrangements. There is always the possibility of the camels throwing their loads and shattering the mica, so that when it reaches its destination it is in small pieces, probably only capable of being cut into pieces 4 or 5 inches square, and worth from 5s. to 6s. per - lb., whereas, if it could be marketed in squares of 12 inches or 15 inches, it would be worth from 30s. to 35s. per lb. Unless improved transport facilities are provided there is not much possibility of converting that wonderful mica asset into cash. At Arltunga, only 65 miles from Alice Springs, there is a hill of quartz known as the White Range. According to Mr Brown, a former geologist of the South Australian Government, that hill would assay 7 dwt. to the ton, but, obviously, in view of the heavy expenditure that must be incurred in getting machinery through, it would be impossible to work a low grade proposition like that on a big scale. One company sent a boiler up to a place called Winnecke's Depot, not far from Alice Springs, at a cost of £1,500, and it took the teams fourteen months to do the job. In view of these facts it is easily understandable that mining people in the south are not very keen about investing in Central Australian mineral "" shows,"" but I am optimistic enough to say that, up to the present, we have only scratched the surface of' Australia in regard to its mining possibilities. A railway line to Alice Springs would give a wonderful fillip to the mining industry in Central Australia. Who can say that before long we may not have another Mount Morgan, another Broken Hill , or, perhaps, another Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie? Silver-lead and copper have been discovered afc Barrow's Creek. This mining proposition would be within easy reach of a railway, if one were made to the Macdonnell Ranges, and I have been assured by gentlemen interested in that proposition that if the line went to Alice Springs, and if it were proved that the lode at Barrow's Creek dips down, as they'honestly think it does, they would be prepared to construct a light line from Alice Springs to Barrow's Creek. This north-south railway, which has been promised to South Australia for so many years, will, be the connecting link with the north eventually. not assume that the House will authorize the construction of a line to Alice Springs, and then make a definite promise that it shall immediately go straight through to Daly Waters, the terminus of the projected line from the northern end. The Public Works Committee which,, in 1921, investigated the various routes, recommended that the line should be built from Mataranka to Daly Waters. The section from Emungalan to Mataranka was approved in 1916, but no construction work has yet been undertaken. The construction of a bridge over the Katherine River was also recommended in 1916, and has just been commenced. Following the construction of a railway to Daly Waters, the Committee approved of a low-level line being built from .Oodnadatta to Alice Springs of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge with steep momentum grades, second hand rails, fastenings and sleepers at a cost, including the rolling-stock necessary for the working of the line, of £1,558,600. It also recommended that the line from Katherine River to Daly Waters should not be constructed unless the Government decided that it should be continued as far south as Newcastle Waters, or Powell's Creek, and thence across into the Barkly Tableland. I said, when the authorizing measure was before the House, that I doubted whether the extension for a distance of only 161 miles would add another settler to the country. I may have been in error, but I am satisfied that it will not make very much difference to the settlers until the line touches the Barkly Tableland. No one realizes that better than the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr . Nelson) and the Minister for' Home and Territories (Senator Pearce), who went through the Northern Territory about twelve months ago. If the line were constructed from Newcastle Waters or Powell's Creek- I would prefer Powell's Creek-the n towards the Queensland border net to'Camooweal, but to a point south, in my opinion, it would bisect better country. W it h that line constructed, and also the line to Alice Springs, the distance between that place and. Powell's Creek would be about 400 miles/ A future Parliament would then be able to decide, on the amount of settlement I do that had taken place, whether the connection should be made by a direct line. I am. satisfied that with the construction of the railway to Alice Springs scores of settlers would be prepared to take up land in the centre of Australia, and engage in sheep-raising. All they want is some encouragement in the for m of facilities such as have been provided for graziers in every other part of the Commonwealth. Mr Cavenagh, who has sheep at Arltunga, informed me that on one occasion, although he had to drive them 375 miles along the stock route to the nearest point on the railway line, he sent as many as 1,000 sheep over the route without losing a single head. This demonstrates that, generally, the s'ock-route conditions are very good. He also informed me that he got an average of 34d. per lb. for his wool-anothe r indication that the country from the grazier's point of view is good. Unfortunately, at the present time, sheep there have to be shepherded. That, as honourable members must know, is a heavy item of expenditure.",44
131,Mr LATHAM,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,What is the carrying capacity of the country of which the honourable member is speaking ?,45
132,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Peopl e in a position to judge state that the whole of the Macdonnell Range country will carry one sheep to three acres year in and year out. I may add that this part of Australia has never known a drought. Certainly there have been dry seasons, but never a year when rain has not fallen. That cannot be said of many other parts of Australia.",45
133,Mr NELSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,And its natural grasses are reinforced by edible bushes.,45
134,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"And in addition, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory has reminded me, besides the natural'grasses there are several varieties of edible bushes, which are a remarkable standby during a dry season. The Minisvisedly, ter (Mr Stewart) knows the Depot Sand Hill s country, 26 miles through. layman with but a superficial knowledge of that country would think it was not worth the toss of a coin, but I saw come off the Depot Sand Hills in condition, notwithstanding there is no water available other than that which might lie in the sand for a few hours after North-South railway. rain. The stock subsisted on a little plant called parakeia, not unlike what known in the south as pig-face. a plant with a remarkable water-content. The edible bushes mentioned are buck view. bush, blue bush, salt bush, goat's head, mulga, &c. The whole of the country from the Territory may be taken up by graziers. time has arrived for this House to take a courageous stand in regard penditure for developmental purposes. We have authorized the 'expenditure of vast sums of money for the Murray i r r i gation scheme. We have spent something like £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 on the East-West railway, but the House does not tralia by sheep raising. seem to be able to make up its mind to of the fact that if the spend money for the genuine development of the Commonwealth's own territory. We have been invited by the Queensland vernment to build the line down to Powell's Creek, thence across the Barkly Tableland, and down through western Queensland to ' l in k up with the rail at Bourke, New South Wales. I approve of the construction of that line, but I not think that the Commonwealth should undertake the expenditure and at the same time not build a railway line in own territory to Alice Springs. The latthan ter should be the first undertaking. In the United States of America no less than 150,000 miles of standard gauge to 34,000,000. railways have been built in the last 30 years, whereas in Australia a few thousand miles, at the most, have been constructed.",45
135,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,Pe r capita of the popuI lation we have built as many miles of railways .as has the United States of America.,46
136,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I do not think that is so, for in the last 20 years very littl railway extension has been undertaken in Australia. The time is now ripe us to tackle the problem seriously. have travelled over a great part of Northern Territory, and, having studied the subject of its development for at least two and a half years, I say, adthat the House would do well to proceed with the construction of a line The from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The country would certainly justify a railway. I am not forgetting the fact that cattle when the Commonwealth Government good took over from South Australia the Quorn-Oodnadatta line it made a definite promise to that State to complete the Some honourable members contend that in law the agree is ment with South Australia would not be It is binding on the Commonwealth.",46
137,Mr GABB,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,Other s take the opposite,46
138,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Yes ; but, apart from that question, I am submitting my border motion on the strength of what I have The sr-eu of the country that would be opened up for settlement. I have discussed the to exmatter with men who know good land when they see it . Sir Sidney Kidman recently told me that if the line were built, it would bring about the development of the central portion of AusI am aware Government constructs a light railway there it would be necessary to go a little f u r Gother and give the settlers some assistance; but I claim that this would be quite justified, and would be preferable to heavy expenditure such as has been head incurred in other parts of Australia to assist men to produce crops for which no do market can be found. Australian wool is a commodity for which the world is clamouring. Our flocks today number its between 20,000,000 and 30,000,000 less they did thirty years ago, and the flocks of the Argentine have decreased during a similar period from 65,000,000 When the late Lord. Forrest was once advocating the construction of the wonderful water scheme in Western Australia, somebody remarked that it would cost £1,000,000. Lord Forrest replied, "" What is a million?""' borrow that phrase, and ask "" What is a million and a half to Australia when we have such, a vast area of splendid land in the interior?"" I am sorry that so* many people decry the central portion of e this continent. It is said that white people cannot live there, and that m i l for lions of pounds have been wasted on I attempts to develop the country. I rethe peat that the money has been spent at the wrong end-of the Territory. H a d we pushed the railway line through from the south there would now be something to show for the money that has been thrown away in the north.",46
139,Mr NELSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,Not quite thrown away.,47
140,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I claim that much of it has been absolutely wasted. Look at the money that has been spent to no purpose at the Mataranka sheep station and the Daly River settlement, to which thousands of pounds worth of machinery, was sent before it was know whether the country could yield the products for which the machinery was intended. If half of that money had been devoted to developing the Territory from southern end we should today have had a great deal more to see for our expenditure - Surely it would be better to endeavour to settle the country from the soithern end, where settlement already exists, than to send half way round Australia, a distance of 6,000 miles from Melbourne, in the endeavour to develop the heart of this continent. The whole story of attempts at settlement in the north of the Territory has been a tragedy from first to last, from the time when the first effort at settlement was made at Raffles Bay in 1823, u n t i l the present time. Had railway construction proceeded from the southern end, Australia would have been millions of pounds in pocket, and there would have been a population in Central Australia today. I sincerely trust that honourable members will realise that they should not ask whether a railway into the centre of Australia would pay immediately. They should remember the experience of the private companies that built the transcontinental railways in the United States of America and Canada. Those were essentially lines of development. I am not sufficiently optimistic to think that the line I am advocating will prove a payable proposition at first, but I am at least certain that if it is built as far as Alice Springs, the loss to the Commonwealth on the whole line from Quorn to Alice Springs will be no greater than on the existing section. Mr E . RILEY - Let us take a vote on the motion before dinner.",47
141,Mr JACKSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"I should like that to be done, but I do not think that honourable members from South Australia will care to let the matter pass so quickly as that. I commend the motion to the sympathetic consideration of the House. If honourable members wish to do something for the real development of a good portion of Australia they will agree to it at once.",47
142,Mr NELSON,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Northern Territory ) [6.12] - In seconding the motion I desire to exj>ress my appreciation of the manner in which the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) has championed a good cause. I entirely endorse his statement that without railways in the Territory the Commonwealth may as well put up the shutters there altogether. The present cost of transportation is so prohibitive, that it is impossible to carry.on the the sheep industry on a profitable basis. The Commonwealth has lost £1,500,000 on the Quorn-Oodnadatta line since it took that section oyer from South Australia, and we shall continue to lose at that rate so long as the railway terminates at Oodnadatta; people whereas, if it is continued to the centre of Australia, the present deficit will be converted into a profit. It has been argued that cattlemen would not send their stock by such a railway, but I have no doubt that station-owners generally would patronize it . I shall content myself on this occasion by supporting the motion, trusting that a quick decision will be reached. Mr M . CAMERON (Barker) [ 6 . 1 5 ] - I also wish to compliment the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) upon his attitude on this subject. He has probably given it more consideration than any other honourable member, and seeing that he comes from the State of Tasmania, he must be credited with dealing with the question purely from a national stand-point. On that account, his views are worthy of careful consideration, and he deserves the thanks of the House for his informative speeches on Northern Territory subjects. Over a long period, Governments have neglected their plain duty in regard to the Territory. For many years, the Commonwealth has failed to discharge its obligation to South Australia to construct the north-south railway by a direct route. AB ill at present before the House aims at the stabilization of the pastoral and other industries in the Territory.

It reported, in July, 1910, that offices were situated in rented premises all over the city, and recommended that they be concentrated in one building on a convenient site, and suggested that a building capable of expansion from time to time be erected on the Adelaidestreet site, which was already Commonwealth property. Although details of accommodation required for the various PAIRS. Departments were obtained, the proposal was held in abeyance owing to difficulties in connection with the utilization of portion of the proposed site, which was required for defence purposes. Another proposal to erect the parcels post and postal stores building on the same land was considered, but this precipitated a civic movement in Brisbane to obtain the whole of the site for a city improvements scheme. The various bodies concerned in this project had a conference in 1915, and consideration was given to several designs prepared by Mr . Murdoch, Chief Commonwealth Architect, for the best use of the area in the publio interest. The conference agreed, to recommend that a scheme be adopted which provided for an open square between An n and Adelaide streets, Hanked at each end by groups of buildings, one of which would be of a commercial character, while the other would provide for Commonwealth requirements!. Negotiations regarding this proposal were continued between the State and Federal Governments, but' no definite action was taken in the matter, the war and the consequent difficulty over finance probably being the main cause of holding up the question. In 1919 a proposal wasput forward from Brisbane to utilize the whole area bounded by the four streets as a war memorial square, but the Commonwealth Government could not see its way to agree to this, owing to the difficulty in obtaining equally suitable sites for its own purposes. It agreed, however, to give further consideration to the scheme providing for a central square, flanked by Government buildings at each end, as such a square, whilst a benefit to the City of Brisbane, would, at the same time, prove of great financial value to the Commonwealth. The matter was then stated to be urgent, as the State Government announced its intention of building on its portion of the land at an early date. The Commonwealth Government then referred the matter to the Publio Works Committee for investigation. A f t e r considering the various schemes that had been put forward, the Committee, in July, 1921, reported in favour of the proposal for the creation of a memorial sojuare, 200 feet i m w i d t n, supported on either flank by Commonwealth and State public offices respectively, and involving the Commonwealth in the cession of a strip of land 40 feet wide for the purposes of the square, at the same time providing valuable frontage and light for Commonwealth requirements. The Queensland Government also agreed to this scheme, which was endorsed by the Federal Parliament on the 6th December, 1921. Preparations were then 'made by the Commonwealth, '.in touch with the State Government, to draw up plans for the building to be erected on the Commonwealth side of the square. These were passed by the Publio Works Committee, and endorsed by the Commonwealth Parliament on the 25th August, 1923. Preparations to call tenders were practically complete, when, at the request of a deputation which waited oii the Acting Prime Minister, directions were given for action to be stayed, pending further consideration of views put forward by local authorities that the whole of the land concerned should be devoted to the memorial square. The question was the subject of further negotiations with the State Government, the Memorial Square Committee, the Brisbane Council, and others, and the Commonwealth took the view that it could not accede to the proposal to give up the whole of the land. A f t e r further consultation, however, an amended scheme was evolved, providing for a larger square, which would involve a re-arrangement of the building proposals, by which the Commonwealth would receive special advantages in regard to building frontages and future accommodation for its activities, and at the same time the views of the local authorities would be met respecting the creation of a more suitable memorial square than that originally proposed. That is the reason why the Commonwealth Government, after having received the previous report, now asks that the matter be again referred to the Committee. I lay on the table, as required by the Act, plans, & c , of the proposed work.",48
149,Mr CHARLTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Did the House take any action with respect to the other report ?,49
150,Mr STEWART,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,No .,49
151,Mr GREGORY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Is there any special urgency about this matter ?,49
152,Mr STEWART,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,It is hoped that the Committee will deal with the proposal as soon as convenient.,49
153,Mr CHARLTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Hunter) [8.8] - The House should be informed, whether, at the time the Committee was dealing with this matter previously, any representations were made to it regarding the necessity of setting aside this area for the purpose of a war memorial square. If representations of that nature were then made, some explanation of the decision of the Committee against the area being 30 utilized, and in favour of buildings being - erected on the site, appears to be necessary. I am not referring to the expense which may be incurred, because for a matter of this kind the amount is not great. I take it that the - Government are now paying rent to different people in Brisbane for accommodation for Commonwealth offices, and for that reason it is probable that these - buildings are urgently required.",49
154,Mr STEWART,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,That is so.,50
155,Mr CHARLTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,The House should be informed whether evidence regarding a memorial square was placed before the Committee when ' it held its former in quiry.,50
156,Mr GREGORY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,This proposal was placed before the Committee.,50
157,Mr CHARLTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I do not refer to the amended proposal now before us, but I desire to know whether evidence in favour of a certain area of this particular - site being .reserved for .the purpose of a war memorial square, was placed before the Committee previously.",50
158,Mr GREGORY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Yes .,50
159,Mr CHARLTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Then we should street. know why the Committee opposed ihat suggestion, and recommended that ings should be erected on the area. We are all anxious to meet the Brisbane people, or those in other places, who desire a suitable area for the erection of a war memorial, but delays of this kind should be avoided, if possible. If these buildings are required, further delay is not in the best interests of the Commonfor wealth. Mr D. CAMERON (Brisbane) [8.10]. - - I hope the House will not oppose the motion. The Leader of the Opposibe tion will agree that already there has been too much delay in respect to this and matter.",50
160,Mr CHARLTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"That is what urging. Mr D . CAMERON - As pointed out by the Minister, in 1910 a committee of officers was appointed, and asked to investigate and report upon the housing accommodation for officials in Brisbane, and whether buildings to accommodate them should be erected. The committee recommended the erection of a building in acentral position capable of expanthe sion.. The Leader of the Opposition asks whether the desire of the of Queensland to have a memorial ment to Canberra. square in Brisbane was placed before the Committee in 1921. Evidence to that effect was placed before the Committee, but at the ' time the proposition was for a very small square. Since then the Government of Queensland has offered a larger area, and proposals to make a better memorial square have been brought forward. The proposal before us, if carried, will be to the advantage of the Commonwealth Government. We are not asked to supply a square, but have to consider whether the proposal will be of advantage to the country as a whole. This case is analogous to that of the acquisition of land for the building of a post office at Perth. In that instance more land was acquired than was necesnot sary at the time for the building of the post office, but it has since proved to have been a sound investment. I hope there wil l be no opposition to the motion.",50
161,Mr FENTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Maribyrnong) [8.13] - ols this the same site as that on which the Brisbane C t y Council are now erecting their new Town H all ? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - No ; it is a different site. The Town Hal l is in Albert,50
162,Mr FENTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,In that case I offer buildno opposition to the proposal. Question resolved in the affirmative. FEDERAL CAPITAL. NA SECRETARIATS.,50
163,Mr STEWART,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Wimmera-Minister Works and Railways) [8.15] - I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, the following proposed work referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for - investigation report, viz. :-The erection of a building at Canberra for Departmental Secretariats, including provision for an Automatic TeleI am phone Exchange anil Post Office. When the Seat of Government is transferred to Canberra, according to the scheme of construction now in progress, it will be necessary to provide accommodation for sections or secretariats of the various Departments, whose representation will then be essential. Honourable members probably know that permanent administration offices will not be ready for occupation at the time people when it is proposed to transfer ParliaA t the initial stage, skeleton staffs of the various Departments will ' need to be transferred to carry on the work of Parliament. proposed to house these skeleton staffs principally in this building, pending the completion of the permanent administration office building recommended by the Public Works Committee, and for the design of which Parliament has directed the holding of an architectural competition. Plans of a proposed provisional secretariat building, to house these sections of Departments, have been prepared and are now submitted for the consideration of the Publio Works Committee, in accordance with Statute. They provide the accommodation stated by the several Departments to be necessary for their operations at the time Parliament will sit. A district post-office and an automatic telephone exchange, in the official area of Canberra, wil l also be necessities when legislation commences, and to avoid the erection of comparatively small separate structures within this area, it is proposed to include this postal and telephone accommodation in the same building as the secretariats, in the manner indicated in the plans. The building has been designed to afford, when vacated by thpj Departments, official rooms of convenient size for members of Parliament, anticipating the probability of such provisionbeing found to be a necessity at Canberra. By such a system, of convenient, inexpensive subdivision of the floors, as planned, 54 rooms of a general u n it size of 21 feet by 14 feet will be obtained, and the plan is arranged for one bath-room to every four rooms to be added when required. The plan also provides for caretaker's quarters to bo arranged. A further building of similar size and design, but without post-office and telephone exchange, might possiblv be erected at a site at the western side of the official area, to balance and correspond with the building now proposed. Such a building would afford 72 unit rooms, with bath-rooms, and caretaker's quarters, on the scale' provided for in the provisional secretariat building. Provided, therefore, that the policy becomes such that each senator and representative shall be provided with a room, a maximum of. 126 rooms will be obtainable in two buildings of the design proposed. Exclusive of the essential corridors, staircases, lavatories, recreation accommodation-the latter to eventually become caretaker's quarters-heatin g chamber, and promenade roofs, the project now It is submitted would provide the following effective accommodation:-Offices , for secretariate, 19,712 feet; post-office, 2,518 feet; automatic - telephone exchange, 5,530 feet; totalling 27,760 feet. The probable cost of the building, not in cluding equipment connected with the telephone installation, laying out of grounds; and engineering services outside the building, would be £39,000. As required by the Public Works Committee Act, I lay' on the table the plans, & c , relating to this proposed work.  During last week I had the pleasure O'f visiting Canberra, and of seeing the expedition with which Parliament House is being erected. About one-third of the brickwork is already laid, and the roof is on the hostel. I gained the impression, during my stay there, that, in Parliament House itself, accommodation would be provided for members to the extent- I am speaking from memory-of one small room for each member. Sir LITTLET ON GBOOM - That is not so.  understood the position.",50
164,Mr STEWART,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Probably the honourable member is confusing it with the proposal to - have in Parliament House a room for each Minister. There will not be a room for each member.  my mind is in some confusion. I left Canberra, with the idea that accommodation for honourable membersi-the rank and file of Parliament-woul d be contained :n the parliamentary building itself.",51
165,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Not by way of individual rooms.  absorb nearly 5,000,000 of bricks, and, I suppose, will 'provide twice the area required for Parliament itself, including the Central H all . I should like to know for whom the very many rooms in the Parliament House building are required? Referring to the motion before the House, did I understand rightl y from the M in ister that, accommodation for honourable members would be included in this building, now to be referred to the Public Works Committee?",51
166,Mr STBWART,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"It is proposed u l t mately to use this building for that purpose.  satisfied with that reply, because I think accommodation for private members of this Parliament is long overdue. I hope that the Minister, in any proposal that he makes to the Public Works Committee, respecting accommodation for the rank and file of Parliament, will see that, at all events, it is quite adequate,, and that we shall have the necessary privacy and plenty of room to interview constituents and visitors, instead of being relegated to corners as is now the practice here. Question resolved in the affirmative. NORTHERNTERRITORYCROWN of LANDS BILL. SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 28th May (vide page 963), on motion by Mr ATKINSON That the Bill bo now read a second time. . Mr ATKINSON (Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) [8.24] - It is something like ten months ago since I moved the second tories, reading of this measure, and I am not surprised that, in the interim, some orable members have forgotten purport. There seems to be a general misconception on the part of hongreater orable members, some thinking that the Bill, if passed, will date all the present laws affecting lands in the Northern Territory, and bring new conditions into immediate operation. This measure certainly conand solidates all the laws relating to the Terquarters. ritory, but it will not affect any of the present lessees, or, at any rate, those under the South Australian Act, unless they elect to surrender their leases and become subject to the Bill. that extent only will there be a consolitunity dation of the laws concerning the ern Territory. This is a very necessary step making for improved administration, and disposing of many anomalies that present exist. An y lessee who does choose to come under the provisions of portant amendments, the Bill will continue his tenure u the expiration of his lease, when the land under will revert to the Commonwealth, to be If dealt with as the then Minister and the Lands Department think f it . i - refer, briefly, to one or two statements that were made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson). He seemed to have a confused idea of the real meaning of a number of provisions in the Bill . I , in common with honourable members who. have caref u l ly studied the Bill , have failed to read into it the meaning that the honourable member has given to its provisions. In the first place, he practically accused this Government of conspiring with the pastoral lessees of the Northern Territory to introduce this measure.",52
167,Mr SCULLIN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,The Government conspired with them to remit their land tax.,52
168,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"There is no foundation whatever for that charge, as will be seer, from a review of the history the measure. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has been misled by certain documents which dealt with only the tag end of the arrangement that was entered into between the Minister of the day and the pastoralists. The need for the Bill arose in this way: - When the Hughes Government was in office, Senator Pearce, who was then and is now the Minister for Home and Terrifelt that if the Government were to carry out a developmental policy in the honNorthern Territory, as they intended to its do, and as this Government intend to do, it was necessary for them to obtain a control.of the leased lands. On the 2nd November, 1922, Senator. Pearce, consoliwhen at Unley, a suburb of Adelaide, made a speech in which he outlined the policy now incorporated in the Bill . The Minister's speech was published widely, at that time created a. stir in pastoral A deputation of representatives of pastoralists from the Northern Territory interviewed the Minister and put their case before him. They obtained a promise that when the d r a f t Ordinance To was prepared they would have the opporof seeing it , and offering such Northcomment as they thought fit. That promise waj kept, and the pastoralists made a number of suggestions. Although at they did not secure the amendments that not they desired-and they were very imtoo-the y were n t i l quite satisfied nevertheless to come the provisions of the Bill . it is passed, I expect that a large number of the pastoralists will , as I shall soon as possible, surrender their leases dr take advantage of the sub-divisional clauses, thus bringing about the very object of the Ordinance-close r pastoral settlement so that sheep as well as cattle may be. raised in the Northern Territory. While all this was going on, Mr Massy Greene, whose name has been brought into the matter, was a member of the Hughes Government, but he had nothing whatever to .do with the drafting of this measure. It was only after the last election that Mr Greene appeared on the scene in association with the pastoralists of the Northern Territory. So far as the present Government is concerned, the terms of the Ordinance were practically settled before it .took office, and only a few slight amendments were necessary to put it in the form in which it is now before the House. It is, therefore, quite a mistaken idea to suppose that any pressure was brought to bear upon the Government, or that it connived in any way at proposals in - t tended to enable the big land-holders of the Northern Territory to secure advantages at .the expense of other people. I am sorry that the honourable member for the Northern Territory should have thought fit to suggest anything of the kind. He should have been better informed, and evidently sought the wrong source of information. The honourable member has said that all the cattle necessary to comply with the stocking conditions for a large run might be placed on one corner of it. If that is so it is due to a defect of the present law which we are trying to alter in this Bill. The most stringent stocking conditions are possible under this measure. The Land Board will have the power to frame them, and there can be no doubt that the pastoralists themselves expect under this Bill to be faced with more stringent stocking conditions. It is the experience of the Department that the improvements required under the existing law are actually a bar to settlement in the Northern Territory. If proper stocking conditions under this Bill are to be complied with, toralist must necessarily improve his run. But he will, under this measure, be the judge of what improvements are necessary, and will not he hound by hard and fast improvements regulations, as under the existing law, requiring him to make a number of improvements which might be quite unnecessary for his purpose. As a [40] matter of fact, the improvement conditions under the existing law are sostringent that they cannot be carried out in their entirety. Mr JACKSON,-They are as stringent as the stocking regulations are ridiculous.",52
169,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"That is so. The Minister for Home and Territories has assured me that if the improvement conditions of the existing law. were carried out in their entirety numbers of people in the Territory would have to abandon their holdings, and that because of the stringency of these conditions numbers of small men are prevented from taking up lands in the Northern Territory that are available for occupation at the present time.",53
170,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Hav e the improvement conditions of the existing law ever been complied with ?,53
171,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"No . I have justsaid that if they were rigidly enforced the effect would be to drive many people off their runs and to prevent small men, for whom the honourable member is rightly solicitous, from taking up land in the Territory. Some people talk as if the Northern Territory were a kind of Eldorado, to which people ardently desired t.o go. As a matter of fact, there are only 181,000 square miles of the Territory leased at the present time. TWOT thirds of its area is still available for occupation, but so far from there being any rush of people to get land there, 11,000 square miles of previously-leased country have quite recently been surrendered to the Crown. - Mr NELSON - Cartag e at £40 per ton. accounts, in some measure, for that.",53
172,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"That is so. If the honourable member would read the speeches delivered by the Minister for Home and Territories in another place or my speech in moving the second reading of the Bill, he would find that all these matters were referred to as difficulties the paswhich must be overcome if we are to secure the raising of sheep in the Northern Territory. No developmental policy is laid down in this Bill. This is a Laud Bill to provide land laws and a land system for the Territory. The developmental policy will follow in Bills for the construction of railways, roads, and other means of communication and transport. The Government must first get control of the lauds in the Territory to make any developmental policy feasible.",53
173,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,I have been saying that this is not a developmental Bill.,54
174,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Does the honourable member think that in a measure set-' - ting out the land system proposed for the Northern Territory provision should also be made for a railway, road, and general transport policy? The thing, is of course, ridiculous. We are dealing now with a land Ordinance, and I say that it is a very good Ordinance. The more closely it is studied the harder it will be for honourable members opposite to condemn it. That is shown by the fact that during the debate on the second reading no honourable member on the other side has made a concrete suggestion to better the provisions set out in the Bill. I challenged them ten months ago to consider the Bill fairly, take all the facts into account, the position and conditions under which an arrangement had to be come to, and then to produce a better scheme.  honourable gentleman issue his challenge?",54
175,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I issued it ten months ago, and no honourable member opposite has yet attempted to take it up.  the challenge was issued the Government closed up the House.",54
176,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Whil e the honourable member for the Northern Territory was making all these charges about collu:si.on between pastoralists and the Government, he stated that the pastoralists' mittee had actually decided that no improvement conditions should be included in the new Bill. That statement is absolutely incorrect and has no foundation in fact. This will be clear to the honourable member if he will read the speech - delivered at Unley by Senator Pearce on the 2nd November, 1922. That speech was. the beginning of the proceedings which culminated in the drafting of the - measure now before the House. The honourable member for the Northern Territory told the House that when the time came for existing lessees to surrender portions of their runs they would be able, under this measure, to defy the Government. In support of his contention he referred to a man ' in the Northern Territory who had a store and desired a square mile of country for certain purposes, and said that when"" the lessee of the run was asked to surrender the area required he'refused to give up an inch of his land. I ask the honourable member whether he was referring to the case of a man named Rankin.",54
177,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,No .,54
178,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I am informed that a man named Rankin made such an application, and the lessee to whom the Government referred it signed the necessary papers surrendering 2 square miles of his run. I point out to the honourable member that if the pastoral lessees come under this Bill they will have to comply with its provisions. When the time comes, the Government of the day can take the necessary steps to put the provisions of the Bill into operation, and it will be nonsense for people to talk of refusing to surrender portions of their holding if the law says otherwise. I wish now to refer to an important objection which the honourable member raised, but which I do not think he can sustain, in connection with clause 58, which permits lessees to subdivide their runs, - and lease portions of them to incoming lessees. This is the provision under which honourable members opposite claim that it will be possible to foster dummying. I admit that dummying is very difficult to deal with. Some people are so very ingenious that if they are bent on dummying they seem to be able to evade what ap. pear to be very tightly drawn laws. But com- I do not think there will be very' much danger of dummying under this measure. The honourable member seems to think that it will permit lessees to nominate others for subdivisions of their runs, and later to take them over again. He suggested that this kind ofthing might go on for years.",54
179,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,What I contended was that lessees could nominate their successors.,54
180,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,I say that they cannot do so under this Bill. One reason for my statement is that the nominee for a sub-divisional area must be approved by the Minister.,54
181,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The Minister must give his approval, unless something detrimental to the nominee is known.",54
182,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"So long as the person who is nominated to take up a sub-divisional lease is a good man, what does it matter ? Mr A. GKEBN - The honourable gentleman is begging the question.",55
183,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I am not, because the land must be put to a proper use. The sub-divisional lease will be subject to the provisions of the 'Bill. It will' contain the powers of resumption, liability of compliance with stocking conditions, and with all the covenants set out in the Bill, and the tenure of none can extend beyond the 30th June, 1965. In order to remove all possibility of dummying, I propose, at the Committee stage, to submit an amendment to sub-clause 2 of clause 58. The provision as it stands is permissive; it says that the lessee may do certain things, and I propose, by an amendment, to make it compulsory upon him to do them.. We are endeavouring to tighten the law as much as possible, and I do not think there will be any more effective law in Australia for the prevention of dummying. I intend to propose a similar amendment to clause 31, which deals with mortgagees.",55
184,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Evidentl y the criticism in this Blouse has done some good.,55
185,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The Government are bringing forward these amendments quite spontaneously, and not as the result of criticism.. This Ordinance is mainly a re-enactment of the present law with a few alterations relating, amongst other things, to the re-appraisement of rents, which will enable us to get higher rentals than are collected under the South Australian laws,",55
186,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,That is only in spect of some leases.,55
187,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"All leases that come under the Ordinance, will be subject to re-appraisement.",55
188,Mr JACKSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,But the pastoralists may decide whether or not they will come under the Ordinance.,55
189,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"If they do not choose to take advantage of this Ordinance they will continue to be governed by either the South Australian law or the existing Commonwealth Ordinances, under which they hold their leases.",55
190,Mr JACKSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,If pastoralists do - elect to come under this Ordinance will the Government enforce the stocking and improvement conditions 1,55
191,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"If this .Government is in power it. will do. so. Clauses 50 to 63. comprise the new features of the land policy, and under those clauses the period of certain leases, will be extended, but. none may extend beyond the 30th June, 1965. At the present time the greater portion of the land that is most favourably situated in relation to stock routes and water supplies is held under the old South Australian laws, and two-thirds of those leases have a further currency of from seventeen to twenty-one, years. In respect of them we have no* 2>ower of resumption, and the lessees may , continue to hold them as they do at. present. We hope they will elect to surrender or, alternatively, subdivide their holdings so that new settlers may come in. If that is done each original lease will support four or five lessees instead of one.",55
192,Mr FENTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Will the Commonwealth have any control of such subdivisions?,55
193,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Subdivision is fairly well safeguarded by clause 58.,55
194,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,The lessee will be nomi^ nally under the control of the Government?,55
195,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The lease of the subdivision will be granted by the Government, and will be subject to all theconditions of this Bill. Apart from the need for a general developmental policy, which has no place in a land Ordinance, the principal subject of discussion has been the length of time for which the land will be tied up under the conditions of this Bill. But I would like to impress upon the House that re- under it the Government will get control of the land sooner than, it would if the existing tenures were undisturbed. If the lessees choose to surrender, the Commonwealth will by 1935 regain control of an area of about' 24^000 square miles, whereas if we wait until the existing leases lapse only about 3,800 square miles will revert to the Crown by that year. It is necessary for us to get the land under proper control before we can launch a large developmental policy, and by the provisions of this Bill we shall make a fair area of land available for not settlement more rapidly than if we wait for existing leases to expire. The lessees may surrender immediately if they so choose, and we have an assurance ^from representative pastoralists that they will take advantage of the provisions of thj,s Bill in regard to surrender and' subdivision. The fears of some' honourable members that the subdivision clauses will facilitate dummying are' groundless. The Government hopes - that the provisions for subdivision will expedite the settlement of people who are prepared to engage in sheep-raising. The Minister for Home and Territories was confronted with the fact that all the big South Australian leases, and the 42-year leases under the Commonwealth Ordinance, look up the land for a long time. Honourable members opposite, seem to expect the pastoralists to surrender their leases and get nothing in return.",55
196,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Are there not resumption' conditions in connection with all existing Commonwealth leases?,56
197,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"There is power of resumption after 21 years, but some of the leases of second and third class land are for a period of 42 years, and still have a currency of many years. Minister in setting out to frame this measure was confronted with the facts that this huge area is locked . up, fhat the population of the Territory is decreasing instead of"" increasing, and that there is dire necessity for better means of communication and 'transport",56
198,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Thos e facilities will not bo provided by the policy contained in this Bill.,56
199,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"In a land Ordinance, the honourable member should be content *o find a system of land tenure. Let us first get control of the land, in order to prepare the way for a general de\ elopmental scheme. Railways, roads, and other facilities may follow. Without some .mean's of getting control of the land, honourable members would not be prepared to vote for a big developmental scheme for the Territory. The Minister for Home and Territories is anxious to develop the Territory, but he is not pre- Chapman, Austin pared to embark on a big works policy until he gets more control over the land and greater power to compel its utilization.",56
200,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Did not the Honorary Green, Minister say that two-thirds of the TerGroom, Sir Littleton ritory is not selected? Mr A1KINSON - That is so, and the tragedy of the situation is that nobody seems anxious to select it .",56
201,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,But the honourable member said that the Minister was anxious to get control of the land.,56
202,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes , and this Ordinance will provide adequate means of dealing with the land that is at present unutilized if we can get people to apply for it . We are endeavouring, by means of this land policy, to prepare the Territory for development by roads, railways, and other facilities. I have no objection to the appointment of a Committee to report on the best means of developing the Territory, but I do not think that such an inquiry would help in the formulation of. a land system. The Northern Territory, like other portions of Australia, must have a pastoral era before it can be ready for subdivisionand closer settlement.",56
203,Mr LAZZARINI,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"It must first suffer land monopoly? The Mr ATKINSON - We are endeavouring to break up the existing land monopoly. Having received certain assurances from the pastoralists, I expect a large number of leases to be surrendered under this Bill. Later, when we are in possession of complete information as to the best means of developing the Territory, this Government will submit a policy of works to the House.

There shall be a Laud Board of the Northern Territory consisting of three members appointed by the Minister, of whom ono shall, if the pastoralists of the Northern Territory nominate, in the manner and within the time specified by the Minister three persons, be appointed from among those persons nominated.",56
204,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Northern Territory ) [9.10] - The Committee is entitled to more information concerning Part II . of the Schedule which relates to administration. This clause, as I interpret it , provides for the creation of a Land Board, consisting of three members for administering the Act. I move That all the words after ""members"" to the end of sub-clause 1 be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" one of whom shall be a pastoralist elected by the pastoral lessees in the Northern Territory, two to be appointed by the Minister."" As the clause is framed at present, the three members of the Board are to be appointed by the Minister. these is to be selected by the Minister from three persons nominated by the pastoralists ; but the clause does not provide the manner in which they are to be elected or nominated. I am concerned with the smaller pastoralists, holding from 700 to 1,000 square miles. I have received a telegram from the secretary of the Pastoralists Association, ashing me to NOES. to make it perfectly clear that that asso ciation wishes to have some voice in the appointment of its representative. Honourable members will agree that it is only fair that the people in the Northern Territory should have a definite voice in the appointment of their representative. There is nothing clear in the clause as to the procedure to be followed, but if my amendment were adopted the pastoralists themselves could by popular vote elect PAIRS. their own representative.",57
205,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"What does the honourable member mean by "" popular vote "" ?",57
206,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"That each pastoralist should have one vote. Under the clause some one may nominate a panel of three fro m which the Minister will select one. If my amendment is carried, a true reflex cf the opinion of the small as well as the large land-holders in the Northern Territory will be obtained.",57
207,Mr JACKSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Where are the headquarters of the association to which the honourable member refers?,57
208,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,At-Darwin .,57
209,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Hunter) [9.14] I am surprised that the Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr Atkinson) has not risen to respond to the request of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson). The proposition submitted by the honourable member is a reasonable one. What objection is there to the pastoralists selecting their own representative on the proposed Land Board? Why should a panel of three be submitted to the M in ister from which he may select one who might possibly be the one least desired by the pastoralists. If we are to look after the - interests of land settlement in the Northern Territory-and that has been the argument put forward by honourable members opposite-surel y those immediately concerned should be allowed to nominate their own representative. When the Minister can appoint tWo> members it is unfair to give him the right also to select One of one of three suggested by the pastoralists. One of these men may be more concerned with the welfare of the big pastoralist than with that of the smaller man. A vote should be taken, as is done when appointments are made to any other Board.",57
210,Mr BOWDEN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,This is the practice adopted in connection with the representation of returned soldiers on the Repatriaendeavour tion Commission.,57
211,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,That does not necessarily justify its continuance. perience brings to light the defects of any their choice of a representative. practice.,58
212,Mr DUNCAN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"HUGHE S - Surely there are in the Territory three good men may be picked. . Mr Charlton - Thre e good lien may be picked, but the one selected f the'panel by the Minister may in the best interests of the small holders, who comprise the big majority of the lessees in the Northern Territory.",58
213,Mr JACKSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,There would still be two other men on the Board.,58
214,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,That is what I am contending; those men will watch the interests of the Government. Probably they will know as much about the Northern - Territory as I do; and I have never been there.,58

I did not care to use the can be taken to this amendment. word, but the honourable member has put it into my mouth. This amendment should be accepted toobviate that sibility. If the names of three men submitted the Government may appoint B a man who is a boodleier.",58
217,Mr LISTER,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"What is a boodleier? - Mr Charlton - On e who works his. own interests rather than in the terests of the community generally. U fortunately a few such persons exist. I do not wish to mention names, but in the Northern Territory there are men who hold very large areas. If such a one were nominated with two others the Gocompelled vernment might regard the size of his holding as a justification for appointing him to the Board. It is not always the man with the largest interests who is most likely to assist development. Invariably, the man who has a less interest is more concerned with the development of that interest; because the wealthy man can afford to sit back until railways are structed, and then derive the benefit of the unearned increment. anxious to develop the Territory we must have on the Board some one who has been chosen by the people whose interests are directly affected. At ParExliamentary elections the people indicate Why should not that principle be applied in this case, in order to conserve the in who terests of those who take up pastoral leases? Why should the lessees submit the names of three persons and allow the r o m Government to decide who shall be apnot work pointed to the Board ?",58
218,Mr WHITSITT,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Is not the Government responsible for the expenditure, and should not it have a say in the matter?",58
219,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The Government will have a say, to the extent that it will have as its representatives on the Board two of the three members. How, then, could the Government's interests bo jeopardized? Those two members may not have an intimate knowledge of land matters or of the conditions obtaining in the Territory. If ever it was necessary to appoint a practical man, possessing a knowledge of the Territory and of the conditions, that necessity exists in this case. In order to develop the Territory there must bo appointed to this Board one who will be able to give sound adI vice. I submit that no genuine objection It would not destroy the Bill . On the contrary, it would improve it . Surely, poswhatever differences there may be arc regarding the principle underlying the ill , we ought to be able to improve it in the interest of the Territory. Ne party significance attaches to the amendin ment; .the honourable member who has inmoved it is not connected with any n - party. What is the object of our considering the Bill in Committee if we are bound to accept the clauses as drafted by the Government? Although we recognize the justice of the amendment, are we to be to reject it merely because the Minister is not prepared to accept it ? This is not a vital amendment, so far as the position of the Government is concerned, although some members may think that the contrary is the case. Every one being desirous of developing the Territory as soon as possible, what obconjection can be raised to having on the Board a man who will be in touch with If we are the majorit y of the lessees and qualified to advise the other members of the Board? Wliich is better, to have on the Board a man who possesses the confidence of a majority of the settlers, or one who is representative of only one-thind of the settlers? The latter could possibly afford to put up with unsatisfactory conditions because of his wealth, and the fact that if the conditions were bettered a greater degree of settlement would take place, and he would suffer in consequence. What satisfaction would it be to the lessees to have on the Board a man in whom they had no confidence? Mr BOWDEN;-He would be nominated by them.",58
220,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I differ from the honourable gentleman. The lessees, as the clause stands, have to nominate three persons, and from these the Minister selects one. The representative of the lessees should be chosen collectively by the people interested. That can be done only by submitting to a vote the names of those nominated. If , after such an election, the successful man were appointed by the Government, the lessees would have confidence in the Board, and would work under its decisions. If the appointment were made of a man who was unacceptable to the majority of the lessees, the Board would be damned from its inception, and nothing but complaint would be heard. Honourable members of the Country party have often claimed the right of the primary producers to be represented on certain Boards.",59
221,Mr JACKSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Did they nominate a member of the Tariff Board?,59
222,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I am beginning to realise now that I was correct when I said that that position was not.intended for a member of the Country party, but that it was found necessary to appoint an additional member as a sop to that party. The honourable member admits that that was done ",59
223,Mr JACKSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,I did not say that.,59
224,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"That is the only inference I can draw from the honourable member's interjection. Nobody can justify this clause as it stands. It might as well be contended that, in the filling of a casual vacancy in this Chamber, three men should be nominated, the Government to select one.",59
225,Mr JACKSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The Labour party does not allow three Labour men to stand for any one seat; it, therefore, restricts the choice of the people.",59
226,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member is endeavouring to draw an analogy which does not exist. He knows very well that each party submits to the electors one representative, leaving it to the electors to decide who shall represent them. I now ask for that principle to be applied to the lessees of the Northern Territory.",59
227,Mr BOWDEN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Does the honourable member mean all lessees or only pastoral lessees ?,59
228,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I mean pastoral lessees. I am not asking that this amendment be accepted because if may bring us any gain politically; no such gain would follow. Surely the lessees have the right to nominate their own representative. The Minister can- not lightly brush this matter aside, or vote the amendment out, without replying to the arguments advanced in favour of it. Debate must take place on an amendment such as this in order that honourable members may judge whether the measure would be improved by its acceptance. I submit that this amendment is an improvement on the clause as drafted, and should commend itself to any one who desires to do justice to the lessees in the Territory. We want to see the Territory populate'd, and not to expend public money unprofitably. A representative who is in direct touch with the lessees of the Territory, and who is approved by them, will be able to give great assistance to the other members of the Board. A practical man is needed on Boards of this kind.",59
229,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Wilmot-Vice-Presi dent of the Executive Council) [9.31] I cannot see that the clause will inflict any great hardship on the Northern Territory pastoralists, nor can I see that the amendment by the honourable member representing the Northern Territory would improve it . Under the Government proposal the pastoralists are entitled to nominate three of their number from whom the Minister will select one. The passing of this Bill will mark the beginning of a new era in the Northern Territory, and it is desirable that in the early stages of its administration the responsible Minister shall have a large measure of control.",59
230,Mr LAZZARINI,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Why should the pastoralists nominate three men? .,59
231,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Because it is advisable for the Minister to retain considerable authority. If three men are nominated, lie will have more opportunity to satisfy himself that a man of the right type is appointed. Honourable members must give the Minister credit for possessing some common sense. If he ascertains that one of the three men nominated possesses the confidence of the lessees to a larger degree than the others, he will undoubtedly appoint that one.",60
232,Mr BRENNAN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"What is the definition of ""pastoralist""? Does it mean all lease-holders 1 ' Mr ATKINSON - Not necessarily. I have not the details at my hand.",60
233,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"How will the pastoralists vote in this matter? Will it be a case of "" one man one vote "" ?",60
234,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I suppose that the selection will be made as prescribed by regulations. I expect it will be "" one man one vote.""",60
235,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"If the Minister will accept a reasonable amendment to the clause we shall make good progress, but if he does not, he will get no further with the Bill to-night.",60
236,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I cannot accept an amendment under duress. .If the honourable member chooses to adopt the attitude that he will hold up the business of the country because of personal pique, that is his affair. vernment will not be stampeded. consider that no advantage will be gained by accepting the amendment. It will not improve the Bill. The interests of the smaller pastoralists have not been overlooked. If the Leader of the Opposition will look at clause 11, paragraph d, he will find a provision that precludes any likelihood of a pastoralist in a big way of business accepting a position on the Land Board. The clause provides that a member of the Board shall be deemed to have vacated his office if (rf) lie. in any way, directly or indirectly is to advise his colleague. interested in any land, other than as a place of residence for himself or his family, in the Northern Territory, or in any matter which may arise in connection therewith under this Ordinance, or engages in any live-stock transactions for the sake of gain or any other business. It will not pay a pastoralist engaged in large stock transactions to become a member of this Board. We shall be wise to pass the clause as it is. If experience proves the advisableness of adopting a proposal such as that contained in the amendment, the measure can be amended. I ask honourable members to study paragraph d of clause 11, for it will remove from their minds any suspicion that the proprietors of large interests in the Territory will accept seats on the Land Board.",60
237,Mr LISTER,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Corio) [9.38] - I regret exceedingly that the Leader of the Opposition has attempted to threaten honourable members on this side of the Committee. His interjection a few minutes ago amounts to a threat. I.have.a good deal of sympathy for the proposal contained in the amendment. All honourable members have emphasized at some time in their public life that we are a Democratic community, and I fail to see that any reasonable objection can be taken to the amendment before the Committee. It is preferable, in my opinion, to the provision in the Bill. Since looking at the paragraph quoted by the Minister I am beginning to wonder whether any practical men will be able to accept a seat on the Board. Paragraph d of clause 11 appears to preclude every one other than a swagman from accepting a seat.",60
238,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,That paragraph will have to be amended.,60
239,Mr LISTER,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I think it will. The last line of the paragraph contains the The Go- words ""or any other business."" I hope I the Minister will reconsider his attitude, for the amendment is reasonable. In my opinion, a man holding comparatively small interests in the Territory would be a desirable member of the Land Board if he possessed the confidence of a majority of the pastoralists.",60
240,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Gwydir) [9.40'). - I am astonished that the Minister (Mr. Atkinson) has' adopted such a hostile attitude towards this amendment. Senator Pearce who fathered this Bill in another place is not in attendance Evidently he has given - instructions that the Bill must be bludgeoned through this Committee in its present form. We might reasonably have expected the Minister who piloted this measure through the other Chamber to be here to listen to the opinions of honourable members of this Committee. It would have been courteous to do so. This is a most important Bill. I am surprised at the proposition contained in the clause now before us. It may very well happen that, though the names of three pastoralists are submitted to the Minister, one of the nominees may possess the confidence of his fellows to a much greater degree than either of the others. I doubt very much whether it will be possible to submit the names of three suitable men . in view of the provisions of paragraph d of clause 11. Even the "" honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) finds' fault with that paragraph, and questions' whether a practical man will be found to accept a seat on the Board. Why, therefore, should we' put the settlers to. the trouble of discovering' three such men? Many' of the smaller' lessees in the' Territory have resided on their holdings for many years, and are more or' less out of touch with affairs in other parts of the Commonwealth. It will not be easy for them to find three men who .will be willing to' accept the"" heavy administrative' responsibility . which ' will be placed upon the ..members of this Board. Honourable .members-on this side .of the Committee .are only acting according to their customary policy in supporting, this amendment. We always contend thattlie people .most concerned by the administration of a Board such as this should have direct representation upon it. Let us suppose for a moment that three names are submitted to the Minister. Probably he will have no personal knowledge of any of them. Therefore, he will have either to leap in the dark or else obtain information from some outside source. From whom could he obtain information that would be of value to him? - - Mr LISTER - He could get it from the Pastoralists Association.",60
241,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The Pastoralists"" Association is responsible for nating the three men. If , as the honourable member for Corio suggests, it will be requested to give additional information respecting one'man, it might just as well select one man in the first instance. - Mr LISTER - Eithe r the Minister will have to get additional information from the Pastoralists Association or else he will have to make a leap in the dark. '- Mr CUNNINGHAM - I venture to say that the opinion of the honourable member for; Corio carries no weight with the Government. The Minister says that the reason why three - names are to be submitted, and the selection of -*. one [41] . is to be left to the Minister administering the Act, is that it is desirable that he should retain a large measure of control. I fail to see how that end will be attained by nominating three men. The appointment of this Board is a matter of considerable importance. The Minister has given us no indication whatever of the remuneration these men will receive. How. much will the Board cost per annum ? The honourable member for Corio has pointed out that under paragraph d of clause 11 only a swagman will be qualified to' accept a seat on the Board. It is quite probable that the advice of an honest swagman would be more valuable to the Board than would that of many of the men who hold large interests in the Territory. A swagman would be moredesirable than the Kidmans and the Jowetts who, no doubt, will be' pulling strings to give effect to their own will in the administration of the Northern Territory land laws - - ",61
242,Mr JACKSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,The honourable member would prefer a swagman to them ?,61
243,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I remind the honourable member that he supported a leader in' this Chamber who for years carried his swag, and frequently slept under bridges and in the open air. I refer to the ex-Prime Minister, the Bight Honourable Wl M . Hughes. Many swagmen have risen to the highest positions in the land, and it is no disgrace to them that at one. period in ""their life they carried a swag. ' ' :",61
244,Mr JACKSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,I bave never suggested that it was a 'disgrace to any man that he carried a swag.,61
245,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"In view of nomi- what has been pointed out, we cannot accept the Minister's assurance unless he tells us. that it is his intention to strike out that objectionable provision which will block a small leaseholder from becoming a member of the Land Board. Mr M . CAMERON - It will also block a big leaseholder.",61
246,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,But I object to the .presence qf big leaseholders. It should be our endeavour to place small men on. the land. ' ',61
247,Mr BOWDEN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Surely the honourable member does not want a - man on the Board who is interested in stock and other matters that may come before the Board for decision ,61
248,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"There small land-holders on Lands Boards in New South Wales. They are appointed to these Boards because they are practical menThere is nothing to be feared from the presence of a small land-holder on such a Board. It is the big land monopolist who would withhold land from settlement that we have to guard against. As a matter of fact, this Ordinance should make impossible the recurrence in the Territory of any of those evils that have manifested themselves in the States. The aggregation of large estates in the Territory is an evil we can prevent.by having on an administrative Board, such as this Land Board will be, small practical men, who will be sympathetio"" towards other small men whose, claims come before the Board for consideration. We should also provide for balloting for lands. Grave dissatisfaction exists with the system of allocating the western lands of New South Wales by other means than the ballot, and there is grave suspicion as to the bona fides of many men who have been allotted land under the method adopted. The balloting system is the fairest, and if it be applied in the Northern Territory there will not be the same risk as is likely to occur if the Land Board is given power to allot land to applicants. Although a big land-holder in the Territory may not secure a position on the Land Board, a person may be chosen who has big land interests in Queensland or New South Wales, and whose interests bring him mostly into touch with the sons of wealthy men seeking holdings in the Territory. In such a case the small man would have very little chance of getting sympathetic treatment. Why cannot the Government trust the lessees to make their own choice? The only conclusion one can draw from the stand they are taking up is that they are afraid, that the man elected by the lessees may belong ti» a political party opposed, to them. The method of having three men selected by the lessees, and the Minister, who probably knows none os? the three, making a choice from among them, is absolutely opposed to all democratic principles, and in practice will be found to be entirely against the best interests of the Territory. It is certainly opposed to the opinions of the men already there. But, of course, it is only what we expect from the present Government, because, are whenever it has been a case of trusting the people or of ""putting something over them,"" they have never been prepared to trust the people, and on every occasion have put something over them. They have never accepted responsibility, but have passed it on to Boards, the salaries of the members of which are a heavy burden on the taxpayers.",62
249,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The Government, and not the lessees, will be responsible for administering this Ordinance.",62
250,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Of course, we expect the Government to do something at some time;. So far, this Government has been mainly noted for the fact that it has. kept the doors of Parliament closed. It has been doing nothing, and doing it very well. Ministers are certainly entitled to certificates of merit for the consistency with which they have done nothing since they were elected. It is not the desire of honourable members of the Opposition to delay the passage of the Bill more than is necessary, but we must let the Government know that they must preserve the rights of the men in the Territory. These people are allowed to have a representative in this House, but the Government are not prepared to give him a vote. They tax the people of the Territory, but will not allow those taxpayers to have a vote here)- a case of taxation without representation, if ever there was one. No one can say that the honourable member for the Northern Territory has identified himself with any party, or with the utterances of any party here, in this House. He has merely asked for a fair deal for the people he represents. When the Bill to enable the Northern Territory to have representation in this House was being debated, one of the reasons advanced in favour of it was that the representative of the people there would be able to advise the Government and the House generally on matters concerning the Territory of which the Government and the House might be* ignorant. There are other matters about which Ministers know nothing, but they certainly know very little about the Northern Territory; and yet the whips are cracked when the honourable member for the Northern Territory gives his opinion as to what should be done, and the Government express their intention of forcing a Bill through contrary to his advice. They^ have taken up this attitude because of certain conversations at Scott's Hotel with representatives of big pastoral companies who do not want any one else in their vicinity. The same evil was experienced in Queensland until there came into power a Labour Government sufficiently strong to break it down. The Commonwealth Government have acceded to the dictates of a few interested individuals, and framed this Bill in accordance with the desires of those people. They have inserted a clause which absolutely prevents the voice of the people of the Territory from being heard, and they declare that the Bill will be passed whether it meets with the wishes of the honourable member for the Northern Territory or not. That honourable; member might just as well not have been elected if his advice is not to be taken in connection with the only Bill which may bring about some good for the Northern Territory. He is the only person in this Parliament who thoroughly understands the Territory. Having been forced to earn his living there for a great number of years, his opinion should carry the utmost weight in this House Mr B. RILEY - He was elected by the people of the Northern Territory.",62
251,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes , after a keen contest, in which the big pastoralists spilled oceans of money in order to prevent him ' from coming to this House. Yet the Government flout his suggestions on this Bill. If they carry on in this way, the effect of their legislation will . be that nothing will be done for the Territory; and it will remain as it is today until a Labour Government repeals the obnoxious provisions of this Ordinance. When that is done, no doubt, we shall hear the cry of repudiation, as it was recently heard when a strong Government in Queensland took steps to right a wrong Bommitted by a corrupt Administration of the past which sold the birth right of the children of the State for many years ahead.",63
252,Mr KILLEN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Repudiatio n was only name for what was done in Queensland. ,",63
253,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"We would expect the honourable member for Riverina, who is a big pastoralist, to sympathize with his fellow monopolists in .Queensland. As a matter of fact, the honourable member admitted in this House that he repudiated the taxation he owed .to the Commonwealth.",63
254,Mr KILLEN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,No .,63
255,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes , and the honourable member used his vote here to avoid having to pay the taxation which had been passed by this Parliament in the interests of the people generally.",63
256,Mr KILLEN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,No .,63
257,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I speak without any feeling in the matter. I realise that gentlemen of the type of the honourable member are disciples of private enterprise with themselves as that private enterprise. They believe in using their ability to increase their own bank balances, which is quite in keeping with their policy of self first, self second, and, if there is anything left, self third. The people can come in afterwards. We claim that it is right for the Government of the country to protect the interests of the people. In all ages Tory Governments have been ready to sign away the rights of subsequent generations. In this Bill the thin end of the wedge has been inserted in the form of a provision which will prevent the people who are most interested from having representation on the Land Board. Mr E. RILEY - Will not the Government accept the amendment?",63
258,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"No . I sympathize with the Minister- (Mr Atkinson) because the steam-roller has been put over him. He has been told that he cannot accept any amendment. It is another exhibition of the "" strong man .act "" on the part of Senator Pearce who piloted this Billthrough the Senate, but is not in attendance to be* consulted by his colleagues when this veiy important measure is under consideration in a Chamber that is more truly representative of the people of Australia than is the other. If he were here to-night - he might be able to allay our fears, but as he is. not here the only thing the Minister in charge of the Bill can do is. to stolidly declare that he cannot accept any amend the ments. The manner in which , the Government conduct their business is open to censure. Only, a few days, after the Bankruptcy Bill had passed its first and second readings, and had gone through Committee in another place, the Minister in charge of it came down with no fewer than 49 amendments, most of which had been suggested at the instigation of an outside body. And yet Ministers and their supporters talk about , domination of the Labour t arty by outside bodies! - As the result of the - Minister's action even supporters of the Government in another place demanded that the debate be adjourned' t ill they had had an opportunity of considering the effects of the amendments. To a great majority of honourable' members on this side of the House administration ""in the Northern Territory means nothing personally, but we take the view that as the honourable member for the Northern Territory is in close contact with the people most affected by this measure,- his views should, receive careful consideration. The M i a ister has"" merely told us that he cannot acceptthe suggested amendment. gave no adequate reason for his decision j notwithstanding that the honourable member for the Northern Territory emphasiz-id that be had received a communication fromVthe secretary of the ""association most concerned stating that they wanted the amendment"". -' Mr ATKINSON - What does the honourable ' member mean by his reference to '-' the association most concerned."" Are there two associations?",63
259,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,I mean the Northern Territory Pastoral Association.,64
260,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,I can -' well understand that the' only association which the.Minister has in mind is that which - met at Scott's. Hotel while this measure was - under consideration.,64
261,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I think that the f-dmission by the honourable member' for' ""Northern Territory is a very strong argument for leaving the clause as it is.",64
262,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"But the M in ister has advanced no reason, for not accepting the amendment.",64
263,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,I said I did not think it was an improvement on the clause.,64
264,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"If the Minister, is. determined not to see any. improvement, of! course' it .will be impossible for me to demonstrate in what way the suggested amendment would, be an' improvement on the existing provision in the Bill . hope, however, that reasonable and helpfulcriticism from this side will receive due consideration. I can assure the Government that it will facilitate business in this House. As a land-holder all my life I can give the Minister an assurance that - the suggestion is a reasonable' one. The pastoralists of the Northern Territory, are not here to speak for themselves. Therefore, the Minister should accept the amendment and provide for the representation of the small land-holders on the Board. Mr M. CAMEHON - Why the small,' rather than the large, land-holders?",64
265,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"F o r the very adequate reason that the history of land settlement in Australia shows that when large land-holders have been appointed to membership of LandBoards, they have, generally speaking, taken a prejudiced and jaundiced view of the .rights of small settlers. As a result, the curse of land monopoly has been perpetuated throughout Australia"" and the small men' have been unable , to ""obtain justice .from the' He Land Boards. . There was a great deal of' corruption.in regard to land administration in New South Wales before; Labour made its influence felt. Largetracts of. valuable country were givenby Tory Governments .and' Tory Land Boards foj their friends for .practically nothing.'",64
266,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Unde r this Bill the small holder will have"" a vote as well as the large land-holder.",64
267,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,But the Billprovides that the small land-holder shall not secure representation on the Board.,64
268,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,I never said that ,64
269,Mr CUNNINGHAM,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The Bill does. In clause 11 of the Ordinance there is this provisionA member of the Board shall be deemed to have vacated his office if (d) he, any way, directly or indirectly; is interested in any land, other than as a place of residence for himself or his family, in the Northern Territory, or in any matter which may arise in connection therewith under this Ordinance, or . engages in any live-stock transactions for the sake of gain, or any other business. That .provision will prevent any holder securing representation .on the Board if he owns more land than is necessary for the residence of himself or his family. It is a negation of the prin I ciple of justice.",64
270,The CHAIRMAN,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL, The honourable ' member's time has expired.,64
271,Mr WHITSITT,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"D a r w in) [ 1 0 . 8 ] - I am surprised at the speech of the honourable member (Mr Cunningham) who has just resumed his seat. ' He assumes that the large land-holders are vile persons, whose one desire is to' dominate the Land Board and do an injustice to other residents in the Northern Territory. The Territory has already cost the Commonwealth £8,000,000. There are about 3,000 souls there now, and I doubt if there are 200 lease-holders. I doubt also if the honourable member for the Northern Territory represents twenty lease-holders. I suppose there are not more than 1,000 electors in the whole of the Northern Territory. I am getting fed up with all this talk on the part of the honourable member about "" D a r w in , Darwin, D a r w in . "" I want the Government to stand up to their responsibilities in the interests of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, and to have a voice in the determination of who shall be their representatives on the proposed Board. I do not want to see any ""sundowners "" on it , because, in my opinion, a man with any brains would not be a "" sundowner."" I want on the Board men of broad vision, men who have endured the hardships of the Northern Territory, men who have tackled the difficulties of pioneering in the home of the dingo, and have made their holdings reproductive. That class of man is not usually found among the party opposite. I ts sentiment does not lend itself to the building of ""men of the bull-dog breed,"" who have made Australia's name. the Minister will reject the amendment.",64
272,Mr LAZZARINI,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"""Werriwa) [10.11] I wish that I could say as much in as short a time as the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. I have listened to many feeble replies from M in isters, but the answer given to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) is about the weakest I have ever heard. The amendment in no way detracts from the value of the clause; it simply alters the method of electing a representative of the pastoralists. The only reason given by the Minister for objecting to the amendment is that he wants to reserve some control.",65
273,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,I stated that the amendment would not improve the clause.,65
274,Mr LAZZARINI,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable gentleman also said that he wanted the Minister to be able to exercise some control. In what way, I ask, can the M in ister do that? He may as well put the three names in a bag and pick one of them out, unless he is to be guided by [42 ] information from interested sources, and , 1 it seems to me that that is just what the Government wants. It desires to retain only sufficient control to enable the Minister to appoint a representative that will suit the big interests which the Bill is designed to protect. No threat was contained in the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition. He simply indicated that if the Ministry intended to oppose reasonable amendments it must be prepared for a fight over the Bill . The Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden) indicated, by interjection, that he considered the amendment an unreasonable one, since the representatives of the soldiers on the Repatriation Commission were elected in a similar way to that provided in the Bill. From the Ministry's point of view, a more unfortunate comparison could not have been made, for it is a moat telling argument in favour of the amendment. The fact that only today the association of small pastoralists in the Territory requested the honourable member for the Northern Territory to press his amendment is ample evidence of its importance. The reply of the Min-. ister in charge of the Bill confirms my impression that the measure was not drafted by the Government, but by representatives of the big squatting interests I hope that of the Northern Territory at Scott's Hotel. This is not the first time that legislation of this kind has been practically drafted by outside bodies.. It shows that the Government desires to be in . a position to veto the appointment of a person who may be nominated, but of whom they do not approve. They wish to be able to appoint a representative who will , perhaps, be in the employment of the big interests, or who, for some reason or other, is prepared to work for them. The clause deliberately destroys what might be termed a democratic feature of the measure. The Minister will have the final word as to the personnel of the Board, so that a small lessee, conversant with the needs of the smaller men in the Territory, can be precluded from appointment. I have no doubt, therefore, concerning the source from which the measure has emanated, and in whose interests the Government is acting. I fail to see how any one can object to the appointment being made by election. Members of this House are elected. The people whose interests will be affected by the operations of .this Board should have the right to elect their representative. the Minister persists in his refusal to accept the amendment, his action will he tantamount to refusing to accept a basic democratic principle. He has said that if one man stands out from the others by his votes, the Minister will exercise his common sense and appoint him.. If that assurance can be accepted, the objection to the amendment falls to the ground. He evidently wants to get control of the three men on the Board. wants Government interference by a Government that does not believe in Government interference. He wants to appoint two men, and to say who out of another three shall be the third man. clause as it is, and with clause 11 in the Bill, there might as well be no reference to the representation 1 the Northern Territory. We might as well say that the Board shall be appointed by the Minister. The members might ad well be appointed in Melbourne, or Timbuctoo. It will be a Board that will perpetuate the chaos and blundering of the past. The speech made by the honourable member for the' Northern ritory is clear evidence of the necessity for a representative of the' Northern ritory to be in this' House. No one in the House knew anything about the requirements of the Northern Territory the honourable member came here. jsole object is to enlighten and assist the Government and honourable members determining questions of this nature. has given us his opinion, and has substantiated that opinion hy a from the only organization, and yet the Minister tells him that he does not know anything about the subject. If . that is the attitude Government, what is the good of. having a representative of the Northern This is not a party political question. does not relate to a principle which has been well fought out on the hustings. is merely a matter of administration, detailed work, and the Government render the Bill valueless if it fails to meet the wishes, not merely of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, of the people there. This debate has tended to confirm the suspicion that I have felt for a long time, that the Bill is nothing more than an attempt to assist Ves'tey's and other big landed interests in Mr Laszarini. the Northern Territory. The GovernIf ment, having taken its instructions from those interests, has determined not to budge an inch, whatever proposals may be put forward. It Will have to answer for the consequences.",65
275,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Swan) [10.27] - I cannot recall a debate in which there have been so many suggestions of ulterior Minister's motives as there have been in thediscus'sion of this Bill . It is astounding that charges of ""Doodling "" and* He corruption should be levelled by somehonorable membersagainst others. I am astonishedthai; honourable members oppo=site have remained so immaculate in a country in which', according to them-, there With the is so much wickedness. I am inclined to think, however, that they are protesting too' much;, in fact, after hearing the speech of the interests of of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, I am convinced that they are. I ask honourable members to consider for what pur poise the Board will be Sydney,- appointed. We are not electing a committee for a cricket or a football club', butare considering the appointment of a Btfardto perform important duties in the Ter- Northern Territory. If honourable members will look at clause 13 of the Billy Ter- they will see that the Board, under the control of the Minister, will be charged with the general administration of this. Until Ordinance relating to the Crown lands of His the Northern Territory. Who has to accept the responsibility for the administrain tion of the Territory ? I say the Minister He and the Government have to do that. My objection to the clause is that the Ministelegram ter for Home and Territories (Senator concerned, Pearce) has definitely promised that if three names are supplied' to him, he will select one of them. Only specialists should' of the be appointed for this work. They must beable to classify land, and they must bo Territory? men of undoubted probity. The M in It ister will have to depend upon them, and' their responsibilities to him will be veryIt great. He, and he alone, should accept of the responsibility of appointing them. will Mr Fenton - Unde r this clause, one man can run the whole show.",66
276,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I do not think so. but Mr STEWART - At any rate, he will ' ' be appointed by the Minister.",66
277,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"If I had my way, I would strike out all the words after the word ' ' Minister "" in sub-clause 1. A Bill will probably be introduced shortly toappoint a Board of Governors for the Commonwealth Bank. Do honourable members opposite contend that members of that Board should be elected?",66
278,Mr NELSON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,What will be the cost of the Board proposed in the Bill 1,67
279,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"I do not know. The Minister stated that the control of the Northern Territory would be placed' under a. Board. I find it difficult to understand why two Boards should be considered necessary. The Board will have an enormous amount of work to do in classifying land, and the Minister will have to look to it for advice in opening up and developing the Territory. I have been pleased with the recent reports of the Minister concerning his efforts to develop that country. I am not so optimistic as he is regarding the success of closer settlement, but I believe that he is on the right track. If a Board is to be appointed, the Minister should be responsible. I cannot understand why the Minister should be willing to transfer his powers' to others.",67
280,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,Does the honourable member contend that pastoralists from the Territory should be appointed?,67
281,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"The Minister should endeavour to obtain men with large experience. . Mr Charlton - Clause . 7 provides that the pastoralists may nominate three persons, but clause 11 stipulates that they may not bo persons who have any interest in land in the Territory. Three men from Bourke-street could be appointed.",67
282,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,The object of the Minister is to prevent any person who has any interest in land or stock transactions withi n the Territory from being appointed to that Board.,67
283,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,That means that a practical man from the Territory cannot be on the. Board.,67
284,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"No . It is neither necessary nor .advisable that a man from the Territory should be appointed. The Board will 'have similar functions ' to those of a Court. It will take evidence, and will make recommendations as to the persons to whom leases should be granted; and it would be im.proper to have on that Board any man who is directly or indirectly interested in' land there.",67
285,Mr FENTON,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,That is the kind of man who will be nominated.,67
286,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING FOR DEPARTMENTAL,"Me n wit h knowledge of that type of country should be appointed. If anything goes wrong, the Minister will have to accept the responsibility ; it is he who will bo charged with maladministration. The Board wil l act similarly to Judges and magistrates, and its members should be highly qualified. They should have a knowledge of land to bet able to classify it . If any mistake has been made, it has been in the direction of allowing the pastoralists to make three nominations. The responsibility should rest with the Minister. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) considers clause 13, which sets out what the Board will be required to do, he must conclude that its members should be appointed by the Minister. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.36 p.m.",67
