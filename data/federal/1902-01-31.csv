1,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Macquarie) What does the Prime Minister intend to doin regard to future Mondays?,14
2,Mr BARTON,Unknown,I stated the intentions of the Government a night or two ago.,14
3,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,The right honourable member must recognise that to. sit every week from Tuesday until Friday is a great tax upon honourable members. In one or two divisions only 27 members out. of a House of 75 were present.,14
4,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Member s should all be here.,15
5,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"No doubt; but the fact shows the difficulty of getting members to come here, even with the present number of sitting days.",15
6,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The Government want to get the Tariff through.,15
7,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"It is no more a pleasure to the members of the Opposition to stay here and fight against some of the proposed duties than it is a pleasure to other honourable members to sit here and support those duties; but we are prepared to do it in the interests of our constituents, however unpleasant the task may be. . I suggest that, before the Prime Minister makes up his mind to resume Monday sittings, he should see if some better arrangement cannot be made. I think that most of those who come here from other States are prepared to meet every morning at half past ten. Practically our mornings are wasted at the present time.",15
8,Mr BARTON,Unknown,The work of administration could not be carried on under such circumstances.,15
9,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Some consideration should be paid to the convenience of honourable members who come here from other States. No doubt, morning sittings would be inconvenient to Victorian representatives.",15
10,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,Unknown,The Victorian representatives will be quite willing to come here.,15
11,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The arrangement which I suggest would give the Government more time than they will get by sitting on Mondays, and will be more convenient to honourable members who come from long distances.",15
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Why not discuss matter when it is proposed to sit on Mondays '(,15
13,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"We shall have no other opportunity to discuss it, because the House has already carried a motion making Monday a sitting day.",15
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The general question of sitting on Mondays is not before the Chair. The question is whether we shall sit next Monday.,15
15,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Would in order for me to move as an amendment that the House meet at half-past ten a.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 1 27 N'2",15
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"No . The motion now before the Chair is in effect that the House do not sit on Monday next, and I cannot allow the honourable member to discuss the question of sitting on Mondays generallv.",15
17,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Would it not be competent for the honourable member to move, asan amendment, that, after next Monday, we do not sib on Mondays at all 1 It will not be necessaiy for the Government to move in the matter to insure further Monda}' sittings, because of the motion which we have already passed, and no private member will have an opportunity to raise the question.",15
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Such an amendment as the honourable member suggests could not be moved. The only amendment permissible on the motion before the Chair would be an amendment fixing Tuesday or some other day as the next day of meeting, or altering the hour of meeting. The only amendment that I can accept is an amendment relating to the next sitting day. Standing Order No. 41 provides that a motion for fixing the next day of meeting may be moved at any time without notice by a Minister of the Crown ; but there is nothing to prevent any other member of the House from moving a similar motion upon notice.",15
19,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Bu the could never reach it.,15
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That is not a matter which I am called upon to consider. Upon the motion now before the Chair I cannot allow more than an incidental reference to anything beyond the next day of sitting.,15
21,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The House agreed to sit on Mondays upon the understanding that the arrangement was to hold good only until Christmas time. It was thought that, by taking that course, we should be able to get through the Tariff by the Christmas. In view of that fact, and as it is impossible for any private member to raise the question, I ask the Prime Minister to give the House an opportunity to come to some determination in regard to the hours of sitting for the remainder of the session. I hope that my right honourable friend will give us an opportunity to say whether we should not meet at half-past ten upon the present sitting days instead of meeting upon Mondays. it be Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN - Eleve n !",15
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I cannot allow this discussion to proceed. The question before the Chair is whether we shall adjourn until Tuesday next. If the motion is lost, the House will meet next Monday.",15
23,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Will it not in order to show that by adopting another - course the progress of public business will be facilitated ?,16
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member in doing so will not be making an incidental reference to the matter, but discussing the whole question.",16
25,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I do not wish to take up any unnecessary time, but my sole desire is to facilitate the despatch of public business. members on this side of the House are equally anxious with the Government to bring the Tariff discussion to a close, and if the Prime Minister will consider the suggestion which has been made as one way out of the difficulty, we shall be quite prepared to allow the motion to pass without further discussion.",16
26,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether it will be in order to move an amendment, adding to the motion the following words : - "" And shall thereafter, until otherwise ordered, meet on' Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays only."" I would urge that Standing Order No. 41 does not preclude the possibility of an amendment being moved. My sole desire is to have the matter discussed in an orderly way, and there is no suggestion of want of confidence, in the Government, or any desire to take the business out of their hands.",16
27,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"On the point of order, might I suggest that this is a motion for a special adjournment, and that the sole question before the Chair is as to what shall be our next sitting day. Therefore, any mention of the other sitting days would be irrelevant to the motion.",16
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am prepared to give a ruling at once, and I desire to give it forthwith, because it is practically a repetition of the ruling I have already given. Standing Order No. 41 does not preclude the moving of an amendment. I quoted Standing Order No. 41 in connection with quite another point, but the whole practice of Parliament is entirely against permitting any such amendment as that suggested by the honourable member for Bland. Further, the amendment is irrelevant to the question at issue, which is whether the next sitting day shall be Tuesday. suggest to honourable members that, if it is the desire to ascertain the will of the House upon the general question of sitting days, be there is a very easy way of doing so. If the Government discern that it is the will of the House that an opportunity should be given for discussing the question of sitting days generally, they can easily afford that opportunity next week, on an honourable member bringing forward a motion specially dealing with the matter.",16
29,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Of course, that would be entirely within the discretion of the Government ; but I now desire to know the proHonorable cedure to be adopted in securing a disagreement with your ruling, because it seems to me this is a matter which ought to be discussed, and there seems no other way of enabling us to arrive at a decision.",16
30,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I would suggest that the feeling of honourable members could be tested by moving that the House should sit on Tuesday next, at twelve o'clock. The Governmentcould make their ownarrangements with regard to subsequent Tuesdays.",16
31,Mr BAKTON,Unknown,"I will not submit to have the control of business taken oiit of our hands.  we carry this motion, private members will have no opportunity of bringing the matter under discussion again unless the Government introduce it. I have a decided objection to sitting on Mondays. I am one of those members who attend here every sitting day, and, as I desire to go home sometimes, I do not want to be placed in the position of having to neglect my political duties in order to do so. After I come here on Tuesdays I am prepared to sit right through the day in order to transact public business.",16
32,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"What about honourable members who are here all the time 1  bers who are living in Melbourne and have their families here are in a much better position than are those whose families are in other States, and who have to travel backwards and forwards at the end of the week.",16
33,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"We have had to make some sacrifices in order to bring our families here.  Parliaments and in this Parliament tends to show that public business is not expedited by increasing the number of sitting I would days. If the Government are prepared to say that they will afford honourable members an opportunity of considering the advisableness of commencing our sittings ab eleven o'clock on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, instead of sitting on Mondays, I should not object to the motion.",16
34,Mr WATSON,Unknown," On looking up May, I find, as I expected to find, that you were quite correct in the ruling you have given, Mr Speaker, and as, in view of the standing orders, any disagreement with your ruling would be rather unfair to yourself, I do not propose to go any further in that - direction. I hope, however, that the Government will consider the fact that our present sittings involve a strain upon honourable members for a large number of hours on each day, and during the week as a whole, and that when we are engaged in considering the technical details of the Tariff, it is difficult to maintain for such long hours that mental tension which is necessary in the interests of the country. I sympathize with the desire of the Government to finish the session as soon as possible, but I would urge them to consider, not the convenience of honourable members, but the extra strain which would be placed upon them if we sat on Mondays.",17
35,Mr CONROY,Unknown," There should be no question of any implied censure upon the Government in connection with this .discussion. All that is desired is that reasonable consideration should be shown for honourable members, and that an opportunity should be afforded of discussing the whole matter. I am quite sure that honourable members are already called upon to sit longer than is good for them, and that some honourable members are not able to stand the constant. strain. If the Government would afford us an opportunity to consider the question of the hours and days of sitting at some future time, I should be satisfied to allow the motion to pass for the present.",17
36,Mr THOMA S,Unknown," Whils t we are perhaps entitled to consider our own convenience, we should also bear in mind the position occupied by those honourable members who come from Western Australia and Queensland, and who are not able to go to and from their homes at the end of the week. Personally, I am prepared to sit on Mondays if it is considered necessary. I am in favour of morning sittings, but I recognise, that, whilst sitting here from ten o'clock in the morning until eleven o'clock at night would not put any great stress upon private members who are freB to go and come as they choose, it would impose a very heavy strain upon the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer, who have to be in the chamber during the whole time the Tariff is under discussion. I favour Monday sittings for a few weeks because I think they would enable us to get through our work all the more quickly. I am not one of those who believe that the longer we sit the less work we do. It would suit my own convenience not to sit on Mondays, because I could then spend a day longer in Sydney at the end of the week; but I am ready to consider the interests of those who are far away from their homes, and cannot visit them week by week. If the Government think it necessary to ask the House to sit in the mornings I am quite prepared to fall in with their wishes; but some consideration must be paid to the extra work that would be thrown .upon Ministers.",17
37,Mr MCDONA LD,Unknown," I do not wish to appear selfish in this matter, but I think that honourable members representing the very distant portions of the Commonwealth have studied the convenience of those who are more favourably situated in every possible way. It is quite true that a number of the representatives of the more remote States have removed their families to Melbourne; but that course has been rendered compulsory owing to the prolonged nature of the session. It was impossible for honourable members to allow their wives and families to be separated from them continuously for eight or nine months.  to remove one's family.",17
38,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Some honourable members have had to take that step and to sacrifice their businesses as well. I realise the difficulty which the honourable member for the Barrier has pointed out in regard to the strain which falls upon the two Ministers in charge of the Tariff. I recognise that when the House is sitting they have to remain continuously at the table whilst other honourable members can occasionally leave the chamber for a little recreation, and I sympathize with the Ministers in the arduous position which they occupy. At the same time, I think that some effort should be made to close the session at an early date. I am willing to do my share of the work, and, if necessary, to sit night after night. But I realise that it is perhaps not a good thing for the sittings to be too protracted. I know that the strain which falls upon the New South Wales representatives in travelling to and from Sydney is very intense, and must be quite equal to that which would be imposed upon them if the House met upon an extra day in each week. I repeat that I have no desire to be selfish in this matter, but I should like to see some arrangement made by which the course of public business might be expedited.",17
39,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown," As a representative of Queensland, I wish to saythat it is not possible for all of us to bring our families to Melbourne. In my own case six months elapsed between the time of my departure from my home and the date of my return to it. Whilst I hold that we do not expedite business by sitting for an unreasonable period on each day, I think that we will accomplish that end by sitting upon a greater number of days. If we sat upon five days of the week for a briefer period than we have been doing, I believe that more rapid progress would be made. The idea which has been promulgated' by the New South Wales representatives seems to me rather a selfish one. Of course they are willing to meet upon Wednesday, Thursday and Friday mornings. Under such an arrangement they will be allowed an opportunity of returning to Melbourne on Tuesday morning, but they altogether lose sight of the fact that Queensland representatives are present in Melbourne the whole time. I think that every honourable member who has undertaken the responsibility of representing his constituents, should feel that he is compelled to transact the business of the country as expeditiously as possible, especially when such an important matter as the Tariff is under consideration. If we meet upon five days of the week for a shorter period than has been our custom, we shall secure an interval of rest which will enable us to return to our labours refreshed ; but if on the contrary we sit all night, as we have done upon several occasions, we shall come back jaded and unfitted for legislative work.",18
40,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) I think with the honourable member for Kennedy that we ought not to be selfish .in this matter. Honourable members ought not to overlook the fact that representatives of New South Wales and South Australia require to visit their homes occasionally in order to give some attention to their businesses. They do not go home for pleasure. To undertake such a long railway journey every week is anything but a pleasure, because they have to submit to the constant oscillation of the train, which constitutes a very great strain, upon the nervous system. For honourable members representing distant States to insist that because they cannot reach their homes occasionally the representatives of New South Wales and South Australia shall be denied that privilege would be very selfish indeed. I hope that the House will sit from ten or eleven o'clock in the morning until not later than ten o'clock at night. .That will give Ministers an opportunity of attending to official work.",18
41,Mr BARTON,Unknown,Does the honourable member seriously think that the business of a Minister's department can be transacted in one day each week ?,18
42,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Unde r the existing practice, Ministers have a couple of days weekly in which to attend to departmental matters, and I take it that when only two of them are constantly present in the chamber, the others have an opportunity of transacting official business during the sittings of the House. Out of consideration to the New . South Wales and South Australian representatives, I hope that honourable members representing the distant States will not press for Monday sittings.",18
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I shall offer no objection to the proposal to sit upon another day each week. At the same time. I do not imagine that the adoption of such a course will contribute to the greater despatch of public business. My experience is that the greater the strain to which honourable members are subjected,, the more discussion is provoked. If the business of the House is to be properly transacted, ample time for preparation must be given to honourable members. However, I feel that the Government are entitled to have some say in the matter of prescribing the time which shall be at their disposal for the despatch of business. I urge the Prime Minister to consider whether the work of the session is likely to be expedited by the-House sitting an extra day weekly. My experience is quite to the contrary.",18
44,Mr REID,Unknown," I suppose there will be no objection to the carrying of this motion. Whilst I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that we must always consider the Government in matters of this sort, I think that a reciprocal obligation rests upon the Government to - study the convenience of honourable members generally. That spirit has been shown upon both sides, and I hope it will always be exhibited. The proposal to sit on Mondays raises a question between members who live in Melbourne and those whose homes are in the other States. For honourable members residing in this city the proposition is a most convenient one, but for those whose homes are elsewhere the practice of meeting on Monday would prove most inconvenient. I hope that the Ministry will take the matter into consideration, and see whether they cannot meet the convenience of honourable members who have occasion to visit their respective States. To attend here on Mondays would be a very severe strain upon the New South Wales representatives, whilst the practice would operate still more harshly in regard to the representatives from South Australia. Personally, I should prefer to sit later when we are here, but that would be inconvenient to honourable members who reside in Melbourne.",18
45,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,It would be too great a strain.,19
46,Mr BEID,Unknown,"No doubt to those who live in this city it is very important that we should adjourn at eleven p.m. I used to think that we did so on account of the sweet reasonableness of the Government, but I begin to suspect that the practice arises from other considerations. I shall be perfectly satisfied if the Government will take this matter into consideration, with a view to seeing what can be done. I think that the motion should be carried as a matter form.",19
47,Mr R EDWARDS,Unknown," I am as might anxious as is any honourable member of the House to bring the session to an end, because, much as I like to live in Melbourne, and much as I love my fellow members, love my home and my State still more. I am anxious to get through the business soon as possible, with a view to attending the coronation ceremony; but I do not think that to add another sitting day would tend in the direction of shortening session. The strain on honourable members would be too great, and the work would not be so well done. Unless the extra sitting day is added at the unanimousrequest of honourable members, the suggestion should not be persisted in ; and I hope the Government will not force honourable members to attend here five or six days a week unwillingly.",19
48,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,It is better to sit on five days for eight hours than on four days for twelve hours.,19
49,Mr FISHER,Unknown," There is another side to the question as presented by the honourable member for Oxley. There must be some finality to the first session of the Commonwealth Parliament. I happen to differ from a great number of honourable .members regarding the personal strain entailed by discussing, over a number of days, the items of the Tariff. If there is light work to be done in Parliament, it is dealing with the items in the Tariff. Those who are conversant with a particular subject are quite able to put their views before the committee, and one man can present a case much more clearly than can three or four colleagues with inferior information. Personally, I prefer sitting a number of days to sitting late at night. As the Minister for Trade and Customs says, it is better to sit five days a week for eight hours a day than four days a week for twelve hours a day. I hope the Government will adhere to the proposition to sitfive days a week. I have been looking over the division lists since we resumed business after the New Year, and I find that generally less than two-thirds of the members of the House have voted. Pairs have been made for nearly all the members of the House at one time or another.",19
50,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,Unknown,A great many of the pairs have been in the House.,19
51,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"This pairing is perfectly of legitimate from the point of view of honourable members from New South Wales, who as well be in Sydney as in the divisions, if properly paired. I mention this to show that it would be no inconvenience, from a parliamentary point of view, if New I . South Wales members stayed at home a day longer after being properly paired. Paras liament could go on, and every one would be more convenienced; if the business of Parliament is expedited thereby, the people of the country will unanimously approve the the extra sitting day.",19
52,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"Hunter-Minister for External Affairs - I do not wish to go beyond the latitude which you, sir, have very properly allowed to other honourable members, but I must say that I admire very much the suggestion of the honourable member for Wide Bay, who may be regarded as the latest authority on ""pairs."" I agree with the - leader of the Opposition that matters of this kind always require grave consideration on the part of the Government, who have to bear in mind not only the convenience of honourable members, but the absolute necessities of public business; and, of course, in all the Government do they rely on the support of honourable Without any objection on the other side of the House, Monday was, in November, granted as an additional day. To a speech which I then made. I shall no further refer than to say that I gave no indication that this additional sitting day was to be granted only up to Christmas. As a matter of history we have sat only twice on the Monday, although that additional day was granted in November, so that the Government cannot be accused of pushing this matter too far. The Government wish to have this additional day during the discussion of the remainder of the Tariff; but, when the Tariff is finished, if it be found that for the remaining business Monday is not required, then Tuesday will be reverted to as the first sitting day of the week. The Government can make no fairer offer than that; but in the meantime we find the Monday necessary. The alternative presented to us by the honourable member for Macquarie would mean that, in order to finish the session, or, at least, the Tariff, we should have to sit during the mornings of the week. I venture to say that that course is not possible without a blocking of the public business of the country. That is not transacted in this House only, and it would be impossible for affairs, which are the outcome of Parliamentary deliberation, to be carried out under such conditions. We could not execute the mandates of Parliament, or carry resolutions into effect. We could not put Acts into operation or administer some require hourly vigilance-I one specially-unless we had some time during the day for that purpose. able members ought to give some consideration to the Government, as well as to their own convenience. I am a New South - Wales member, and I am sure that my colleagues in the representation State all desire to go home; but owing to the large portion of time consumed by Mr Barton. sitting in the House, I have been from home for. ten weeks on one occasion, and for six weeks on another. Honourable members will admit that by adjourning 'at a reasonable hour, say, eleven o'clock every night, which would give seven hours and a half of actual sitting, we shall dp better work than if we work only on four days a week and sit until half-past one in the morning. W it h ten or eleven hours sitting we should be so much more weary as to be less fit members. than if we sat on Mondays for a reasonable time. It is not convenient to sit at night until the trams and trains have ceased sitting running, and honourable members have difficulty and expense in getting to .their homes. I hope it will be recognised that the Government at this stage are not making any undue call on honourable members. The members of the Government themselves participate in the extra labour, and it is not likely that, they would make a proposal of this kind unless prompted by the necessities of public business. I hope honourable members will look at the question in that light. If , when we have finished the Tariff, we . can see our way to doing without the extra sitting day, and bring the session to a close within a reasonable time, the Government will consider the advisability of commencing the week's sittings on the Tuesday. Question resolved in the affirmative. MEDALS TO TROOPS.",19
53,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Referring to an answer previously given by the Prime Minister, I desire to know whether it is the intention of the Government to carry out the promise made by the Premier of the State of New South Wales that a memento or medal would be presented to the I m perial troops who visited Australia on the occasion of the swearing in of the first Governor General. This matter has been them- before the public for some time, and it is know of desirable that definite action should be taken. Honor- Mr BARTON - I will tell the honourable member what my knowledge of the matter is. The honourable member has already been - told that no promise was made by the Commonwealth Government, and he has of that learned that there was an intimation made in this connection by the present Minister for Home Affairs when he was Premier of New South Wales. We do not know whether the N e w South Wales Government in t e n d to carry out that in t i m at i on or promise ; but the matter, as i affects the Commonwealth, stands in this position. W it h regard to the issue, n o this medal, but of some medal to A u s t soldiers, a reference was made some time ago, to the I m p e r i al Government, and it was ascertained that it was not considered desirable by that Government that medals for special and distinctive services should be given to parts of the forces of the Empire, when such medals were inapplicable to others who had taken p a r t in the same campaign. That is with i-eference to war service ; and I take it that the same principle will apply, of the I m p e r i al Government, to any offer of the k in d made in N e w South Wales. shall consider the matter with the Minister for Defence, who unfortunately, is at present confined to his bed ill , and I shall t e l l the honourable member for Robertson the result privately , so that he may take such action Bamford, F.

Question so resolved in the negative. A m e n d m e nt negatived.",21
61,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Macquarie) I move That the following exemption be added :"" Steam ploughs."" In America steam ploughs are coming into general use, and greatly facilitate the mical working of the farms. I have seen a report from a New South Wales officer who recently visited America, in which attention is drawn to the wonderful strides which agriculture has made there owing to the introduction of steam ploughs, and it is pointed out that if the farmers of the Commonwealth wish to compete with foreign producers, they must use the latest and most improved machinery.",22
62,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," Tractio n engines have already been placed upon the free list, and there is therefore no need to make steam ploughs exempt, because a plough can easily be adapted to steam traction by a local manufacturer. We have placed a duty of-15 per cent, on ploughs drawn by horses, and therefore it would be unfair to allow ploughs drawn by steam tractionto be admitted free, since both horses and steam-engines are exempt.",22
63,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Macquarie) To save time, and, as I hope that another opportunity will be given to reconsider the whole question of agricultural machinery, I withdraw the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr WILKINSON) proposed - That the following exemptions be added:""Rakes unci ploughs, combined, and strawsonizers.""",22
64,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I understand .that rakes and ploughs taken separately are both dutiable; but it is now proposed to place combined rakes and ploughs on the free list. Surely the missing link between the rake and the plough could be supplied by Australian manufacturing genius. There is a duty on rakes and ploughs, because they can be made within the Commonwealth ; but there is to be no duty on combined rakes and ploughs, because they cannot be made here- cannot be connected within the Commonwealth. It seems an extraordinary position to take, but I do not mind my protectionist friends giving me as many texts as they like for future comment.",22
65,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I do not care to give a vote upon a matter of which I am ignorant, and I should like to know what strawsonizers are.",22
66,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Sprayin g machines. .,22
67,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I should like the Government to consider whether they econoare acting rightly in consenting to combined rakes and ploughs being placed on the list of exemptions. If these machines are admitted free the local manufacturer of ploughs will have to compete at a disadvantage with the importer who brings in the combined rakes and ploughs, because a premium will be placed upon the use of the imported article. The result of passing this amendment would be to compel one to turn round and vote for all similar articles being admitted free. I trust the Government will decline to draw a distinction between articles that are intended to effect the same purpose.",22
68,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"In view of the objections which have been raised, and the fact that has been mentioned that combined rakes and ploughs will probably come into competition with other implements which are being made here, we shall limit our consent to the admission of strawsonizers free of duty.",22
69,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,I would suggest that the proposed exemptions should be put separately. Amendment amended accordingly.,22
70,Mr WILKINSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," The combined rake and plough is a special implement which is found to be very useful in the cultivation of maize. I do not know that they are manufactured within the Commonwealth, although I see no reason why they should not be, except that they are subject to a patent. The strawsonizer is very useful, especially to fruit-growers and others who have to deal with insect pests in the more tropical parts of the Commonwealth. Anything that we can do to minimize the difficulties of our agriculturists and horticulturists in this direction should be done.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Amendmen t agreed to. Amendment (by Mr WILKINSON ) agreed toThat the following exemption be : "" Strawsonizers."" Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melb o u r n e ) - I desire that ships' fittings should be placed on the free list. N at u r all y every - one knows that I am interested in this matter, but I hope I shall be able to put for w a r d fair reasons w h y ships' .should be exempted from d u t y . First , ref e r r in g to propellers, bosses, and blades, I m a y explain that when steamers leave the hands of the builders these articles are in variabl y put on board in duplicate. All ! ask is that the duplicate parts which come o u t with the steamers should be placed on the free list, and there is no desire to diminish local employment. w h i c h I have named should be admitted AYES. free, because they are part of the ship's fittings, and as the ship herself comes in free of duty , it would be very invidious to charge a d u t y upon the fittings which may never be Smith, S. landed. These duplicate parts are almost invariably carried by the steamers from por t to por t in case of accident, and it is therefore not unreasonable to ask that they should be exempted. In dealing with this particular question we have to bear Tellers. in m in d that the provision in the Customs Act relating to the payment of d u t y upon ships' stores has caused a very NOES. heavy burden to be t h r o w n upon local shipowners. They are c o n t r i but in g £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year to the revenue as a result of that law, and some consideration ought to be extended to them by exempting from d u t y the small articles whic h I have enumerated. I therefore move That the following exemption be added :"" Ships' fittings, being propellers, bosses and Tellers. blades.""",22
71,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I take this opportunity of put t in g upon record my proPAIRS. test against the way in which certain Agahut. articles have been placed upon the exemption list. A l r e a d y this morning we have voted in the dark upon t w o divisions. For example, we have had no definitio n of w h at the term "" grain mills "" includes. There are many classes of mills which m i g h t possibly come under that definition. Since that vote was taken the committee have given another in reference to a matter concerning which honourable members were equally in the dark. No w we are asked to give at h i r d vote under somewhat similar circumstances. To m y mind, it would be very much better if we were given a clearer added- definition of the term "" ships' fittings"" before we are asked to vote upon this it e m . I should like to k n ow what the it e m in cludes.",23
72,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I think that the committee will be acting wisely if they in sist upon receiving more in for m at i o n before fittings v o t i ng upon the amendment. Personally, I have no objection to an original duplicate screw or the bosses or blades of a propeller being placed upon the free list. But the amendment is comprehensive enough to perm it of ships' fittings being brought out in one steamer, and landed upon the coast, whence they could be transferred to another steamer which was in need of them. B y The articles sanctioning such a general provision, I fear that we m i g h t include some articles w h i c h the committee never intended to place upon the free list. In my judgment every article which it is desired to include in the schedule of exemptions should be specified.",23
73,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I think that the duplicates of articles used in the working of a ship would come under the heading of ""ships' stores,"" and that no duty would be collected upon them unless they were landed and taken out of bond. A ship's propeller could certainly be landed in bond, and would not be dutiable when it was taken out so long as it was again placed on board the same ship. The amendment, however, would not only admit free the propellers required for a particular ship, but would have the effect of placing all ship's propellers which are imported upon the free list. The argument advanced by the honourable member for Melbourne in favour of the amendment is that the local ship-owners compete with ship-owners who are not liable to the duties imposed by the Commonwealth. I think that is a perfeetly sound reason for asking that these articles should be included in the free list. strange to say, the proposal comes from an honourable member who has repeatedly refused to accord similar treatment to other people in other industries. Cannot Ave say, in reference to the farmer, that he competes in an open market with people who are thousands of miles away 1",24
74,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I voted in favour of exempting "" wire netting.""",24
75,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I talk about a menagerie, and the honourable member interjects-"" I voted for the monkey.""",24
76,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,I never voted for the right honourable member.,24
77,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"No , I should think I was more of the elephantine' species. The honourable member develops the cunning characteristic of the monkey in his conduct in this committee, because he is always looking after his own tail. He is largely interested in shipping, and consequently expresses the most statesmanlike views with reference to his own breeches pocket. That is my answer to the monkeyish interjection of the honourable member, whose term of political existence in Melbourne will be brought to an abrupt conclusion at the first opportunity, because even the protectionists look at my honourable friend great suspicion as one of the marvelhas lous converts of recent date. But his ships are concerned hesticks to his free-trade principles like a man. I am perfectly in favour of the distinction which he draws, because it is a fair one. I am not prepared to deny consideration to the ship-owners simply because the honourable member for Melbourneis inconsistent. But I would point out that when other large classes-suc h as the farmers in the wheat market-ar e exposed to foreign competition, and an endeavour is made to put the fittings of a farm, namely, agricultural machinery, upon the free list,, the honourable member asks- "" Can this machinery be made in the Commonwealth ?""' He changed his vote only yesterday upon that very question. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs assured .him that a certain agricultural implement could be made in Australia, and he immediately changed his attitude, and instead of voting in favour of placing that implement upon the free list, he turned round and voted to impose a duty upon it . Coming from a man of the admitted intelligence of the honourable member, these facts But, are really worth pointing out. In a matter concerning the class to which the honourable member belongs, namely, the ship-owners,, does he ask- "" Can propellers be made in Australia?"" ""We have some of the largest works in the southern hemisphere, which can manufacture these articles. Cannot Mort's Dock turn out a propeller ?",24
78,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Some of the small places, in Sydney turn them out.",24
79,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I should think so. Prom the size of the establishment and of the plant at Mort's Dock, I am perfectly sure that that company could manufacture propellers for the steamers in which the honourable member for Melbourne is interested. Yet, although he possesses the knowledge that these great industries can manufacture them, he coolly asks protectionists to ignore industrial establishments like Mort's Dock. I shall have to vote with the honourable member, but, from the inconsistency of his position, I feel that we are killed. The very association with the honourable member in a matter of this sort kills us dead. I am extremely sorry that I am in such bad hands.",24
80,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The form in with which the honourable member for Melbourne put the amendment is, as he himself where admits, altogether too large.",24
81,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Not for him.,24
82,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Yes ; I u n derstand, from the list with which my honourable friend has supplied me, that he does not desire all ships' fittings to be admitted free of .duty. He wishes that certain fittings-such as propellers, bosses, and blades-whic h are brought out in a ship, and constitute duplicate parts, shall be exempt from duty. But I would point out to the honourable member that these articles could either be kept on the ship or landed and bonded. Therefore I do not think it is necessary to make the exemption which is proposed. If we adopted the amendment the articles in question could be brought out by one ship, placed in bond, and subsequently taken out and used in a ship other than that in which they were imported. I would much prefer to see a provision inserted whereby these particular ships' fittings are to be admitted free only so long as they, form duplicate parts of, and are used in connection with, the ship in which they were imported. I wish to guard against their being landed here and used in - connection with another ship.",25
83,Sir MALCOLM,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"MCEACHARN - I should like to alter my amendment so as to make it read- "" Ships' fittings, being propellers, bosses, and blades, original or duplicate, supplied with any ship and to be used thereon.""",25
84,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,But they will be free without any exemption.,25
85,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I am not so sure of that. Difficulties have arisen in the past, and I think it would be wise to make the matter quite clear.",25
86,Mr THOMSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"North think we are only wasting time in trying to make distinctions in which there is no principle. If these articles come outas ships' stores, and are admitted free so long as they are used on the vessel, what more is required 1 Why should a ship-according to the protectionist theory-if - can be made here, beencouraged to bringthem out 1 Why should these foreign vessels be put in a different position from that of vessels on the coast, which have no duplicates, and have to obtain new propellers and blades in the Commonwealth t",25
87,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"If the articles not landed, we cannot charge duty 1",25
88,Mr THOMSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Then where is the need for this amendment 1 The exemption is there without the amendment.,25
89,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,I see no need for it myself.,25
90,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," The amendment will unjustly affect the competition between Inter-State boats and foreign going - boats. An Inter-State boat, which originally comes from home, may trade from twelve to twenty years on the coast, and during that time may require duplicate shafts or propellers many times over. If another shaft is wanted, the local boat is placed at a disadvantage as compared with a boat belonging to the Norddeutscher Lloyd or any other foreign line, which may bring duplicates from Bremen or America and have them fitted here. If the propeller of a foreign boat be broken she may refit here with her own duplicate propeller and pay no duty. On the other hand, a boat which has been trading here for some years cannot replace the first duplicate without paying duty. If we are to have ships' fittings free, they should be free all round, because it is desirable in this great maritime community that we should have the very best and latest of these appliances. I was rather astonished at the suggestion that there should be a difference made. The coastal, boats already suffer from distinctly unfair competition from the foreign boats, seeing that the former have to pay wages of £ 7 to £ 9 per month, as against £ 3 10s. to £ 4 paid by the latter; and the amendment proposes to still further handicap the local vessels.",25
91,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," On e cannot help noticing the spark of intelligence, in regard to fiscal matters, which the agriculSydney) - I tural and mining interests could not strike from the honourable member for Melbourne, but which has been struck from him by the interests of a particular shipping firm.",25
92,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,By the interests of the shipping trade.,25
93,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I shall say the interests these articles of the shipping trade generally, with which the honourable member, is connected or conversant.",25
94,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Ye t there is complaint, when I point out such things, on the other side.",25
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Why does the are Minister for Trade and Customs not tell the honourable member for Melbourne what he told the honourable member for Kooyong ?,25
96,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Why doss the honourable member for Melbourne not see that agricultural and mining requisites ought to go on the free list? I suppose it is because these latter are used by people in the country, who have to struggle for their daily bread, and are not worth the consideration of the distinguished member for Melbourne.",25
97,Sir JOHN QUICK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I should like some information from the Minister for Trade and Customs, first as to whether these articles, according to the law at present, are free or taxable ? Is it necessary to put in any special, exemptions to secure their immunity from taxation, if they are brought out on a ship and intended to be used on that ship and not landed 1 I want the Minister for Trade and Customs to answer that question. A second question is-Can these articles be made in Australia 1 I have heard the leader of the Opposition tell the House this morning that these propeller blades and bosses can be made in Australia, and the right honourable gentleman mentioned Mort's dock as the place where they are made. I want the Minister for Trade and Customs to apply to these articles the same test which he has applied in other cases, because we ought to have something like uniformity and consistency. We are bound to apply the same principle to these articles which we applied to mining and agricultural machinery, and we can claim from the Minister information on this branch of the question. If these articles can be made here at reasonable rates, why should there be any discrimination in their favour?",26
98,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," There is a great deal of force in what the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has said ; but there is another A'ery important consideration in connection Will this matter Will which the Minister ought to deal. When a ship is built in some other part of the world, and receives its fittings, there is no guarantee that there is not some latent defect in the original propeller, or that some accident may not occur. From knowledge gained in my profession, I know it is usual to furnish ships Will a duplicate propeller as necessary for tire safety of the passengers and the progress of the ship. If an accident occurs the second propeller may have to be fitted before a A'essel reaches the Commonwealth.",26
99,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,That peller would not be dutiable.,26
100,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"But there is introduced an element which it seems to me is i nature of an exception. If all goes well, as is usually the case, the duplicate propeller is brought out here, and must either be carried on the ship, or landed and placed in bond. So far as I can gather, the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer say that such propellers are notdutiable.",26
101,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"If the ship kept trading on our coasts, the propeller mightbecome dutiable, not being exported.",26
102,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"At all events, it is for the Minister to say what he thinks on this, question.",26
103,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,We say that itmust be used in the same ship.,26
104,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"It is reasonable that consideration should be given to thecircumstance that this additional propeller is not a matter of choice but a. matter of absolute necessity for the safety of the passengers. It is not at every portof call that propellors can be had, and duplicates must consequently be carried. I do not extend this consideration further than the duplicate, but this point is undoubtedly of great importance, introducing an element which gives much reason and force to the argument of the honourable member for Melbourne. This is not thecase, of a machine, which, if required, can be obtained in the Commonwealth at once, and in regard to which there should be norelaxation of the general rule. The whole: facts disclose exceptional circumstances.",26
105,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The question put by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, I understand to be, is whether the fittings of a ship, which are brought out in use or in duplicate, are dutiable unless landed. My answer to that is-certainl y not. I say further, that it is possible to place them in bond, and if they are intended to be drawn from bond for use elsewhere they may be considered as exported goods, and,, therefore, clear of the payment of any duty,, not being entered for home consumption. As regards a good many of the articles mentioned, they can be produced in Australia ; and one of the difficulties is that,, if these goods are draAvn from bond, not for export but for use in a ship trading here, the duty will be payable, as the goods will be practically entered for consumption prowithin the Commonwealth.",26
106,Mr HARPER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Supposing, as is a common case, a ship trades on the coast for n the two years under charter, and has drawn these articles out of bond for use within the Commonwealth ?",26
107,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Then they would be dutiable.,27
108,Mr HARPER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Althoug h the vessel was going out of the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth at the end of the charter ?,27
109,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Sh e was not going out of the jurisdiction if she traded here for a couple of years. What strikes me is that, to a very great extent, the provision now proposed is not wanted, but that everything desired will arise from the ordinary condition of affairs. We must be careful not to insert a provision which will give the foreign ship an advantage over the Australian coaster. Under all the circumstances, it seems desirable that the amendment should be withdrawn, for the reason, amongst others', that it is unnecessary, and, secondly, that it possibly goes too far in giving a preference of the character to which I refer.",27
110,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I can understand the last words of the Minister as coming from a protectionist, but I ' cannot understand the position of protectionists who are fighting to haveships'fittings placed upon the free list. It is remarkable that ships fittings are very largely manufactured in New South Wales. It is a daily occurrence for propellers to be fitted with new blades' at Mort's Dock. I point to that establishment as an illustration to Victorians of what may be done to build up an industry without the imposition of protective duties. At the present time they have almost perfected there a process for fluxing brass and iron together, which will enable more durable and lighter propellers to be produced, and this will almost revolutionize matters in that line. But, although so much shipbuilding is carried on in New South Wales, and particularly in my electorate, I am not going cap in hand to the committee to ask for assistance to the industry by the imposition of taxes upon the whole community. The progress of shipbuilding in New South Wales has been so great that within a short period that State is likely to become a powerful competitor with other parts of the world.",27
111,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I am inclined to think there is something in the case put by the honourable member for Melbourne. If an English steamer is chartered for the Inter-State trade, and brings out a duplicate propeller, she may put it into bond, but if on the way from Adelaide to Melbourne she loses her own propeller in a storm, she must take the spare propeller out of bond, and pay duty upon it beforeshe can use it .",27
112,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"But the words, which I asked the honourable member to. i nsert would get rid of that difficulty.",27
113,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"If an Australian-builfc-. vessel was being fitted out, the builderwould have to pay duty upon the propeller,, and why should we put Australian) manufacturers at a disadvantage 1",27
114,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"That is a very strongpoint, but, on the other hand, wedo not want to cause large vessels to go outside the Commonwealth to be docked in order tosave expense. The local ship-builder will, have to pay duty upon everything he uses,, whereas a ship can be imported from theold country properly equipped without it being necessary to pay a penny of duty upon her. There would be no difficulty undertime policy of which I am in favor; because the colonial builder would be abletoimporthis materials free, but, as the policy of my right honourable friend is to prevail, - somespecial treatment should be devised which,, while not handicapping our ship-buildingindustry, will meet the case which I haveput. Though, at the present time, only comparatively small vessels and an occasional steamer are built within the Commonwealth, the industry will, in the future,, become a very important one.",27
115,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,When a steameris built out here is the machinery locally made ?,27
116,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Not if the vessel is a largeone, and no builder could afford to pay a duty of 25 per cent, upon a vessel's machinery.",27
117,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Coul d not much of the machinery be made here ?,27
118,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"As a rule, it is all made by the one firm as one job.",27
119,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"We desire toencourage both the smaller industry of shipfitting and the larger industry of shipbuilding, and we have no desire to cause large vessels to go out of Australia to be docked. I am inclined to think that the best plan would be for the honourable member to withdraw the amendment, and to deal with the matter when we are considering a number of exemptions which are 'arranged, not according to the particular class of their manufacture, but accordingto the purposes for which. the articles are used. The Government have been by no means forgetful of this important matter. It has been brought under our notice in a variety of ways, and 1 trust that we shall be able to devise some satisfactory solution of the difficulty.",27
120,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I think it would be best for the honourable member to withdraw the amendment. The fittings which have been referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne fall very naturally under two heads-thos e which can be and are made in the States, and those which cannot be made here. Why should we not treat propellers as we have treated anchors ? Propellers up to a certain weight are cast in the States, but it does not cast manganese propellers beyond a certain weight, because the plant required is too expensive, and the demand too erratic and in-constant to make the industry a profitable one. In the same way, it does not pay to manufacture shafting of more than a certain - diameter. Of course, there are very few oases where a break cannot be repaired in our docks by welding or making a band, but in the case of a big vessel like a man-of-war, or the Grosser Kurfast, probably nothing oould be done until new shafting had been obtained. The idea of stimulating an in dustry which cannot be expected to make much progress for thenex.t50 years is absurd. Therefore, if the Government bring down - a list they should group the articles in - divisions, distinguishing those made of metal from those made of wood. Ships' fittings include a hundred things. Cabin - furniture would be included amongst ships' fittings ; stanchions are ships' fittings, and --smoke stacks and ventilator funnels are also fittings. Ventilator funnels, and perhaps - smoke stacks, are made here, and ships' compasses, which are also fittings, may be made here. These things, however, are not what - the honourable member for Melbourne has in his'mind, and the list of articles which he desires to have exempted should be brought - down and dealt with seriatim, on their merits.",28
121,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,That is the reason - why we asked to be supplied with a list.,28
122,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The committee might refuse to adopt a general amendment, be-cause of its vagueness, whereas if the - articles were submitted in detail the greater number of them might be exempted. If - the Government bring down a list showing which of these ships' fittings can reasonably be made within the Commonwealth, and which should be exempted, we shall have an opportunity of judging whether or not they should be admitted free.",28
123,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," Steam-ships nowadays are a net-work of machinery-of hydraulic, electrical and steam machineryand all engines and appliances would come within the category of ships' fittings. The ship building industry, which has assumed very large proportions in the State of New South Wales, should not be placed at a disadvantage in having the articles which go to make up ships subject to duty, whilst the ships themselves are allowed to come in free. Duplicate propellers are generally sent out pay to with new ships, but shafts are almost invariably stored at the docks or ship building yards, such as Mort's Dock and Engineering Works, and the Government Dock Yards in Sydney. I do not wish to see our industries taxed to the advantage of the foreigner, and upon this matter free-traders and protectionists should be able to stand upon common ground. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - In deference to the wish of the Government I shall withdraw my amendment, trusting to their promise that the matter shall receive consideration at a later period. As to the attack made upon me by the leader of the Opposition, I am quite sure that he would prefer that I should propose any ameudment in which I am interested, rather than ask some other honourable member to move it . I know that the right honourable gentleman intended to move in this matter, but if I think a thing is right, I have the courage to stand here and advocate it on my own behalf. I have no fear of the threats of the right honourable gentleman as to the effects of my action upon any future election.",28
124,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,I was only replying to a somewhat offensive objection made by the honourable member.,28
125,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,I admit I sometimes interrupt the right honourable gentleman.,28
126,Mr REID,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I do not object to that, so long as I have an opportunity of replying.",28
127,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I realise that my interjections rather help than interfere with the right honourable gentleman. I have taken a straightforward course in this matter; but I have noticed that, on occasions when there has been a desire on the part of members of the Opposition that a duty should be imposed, their object has been effected in an indirect way.",28
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Nam e one instance.,29
129,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I can name an instance in which the honourable member himself is concerned.

131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Parramatta) wish to say a few words in reply to the honourable member for Melbourne. He has - stated that I have moved the imposition - of a duty affecting my constituents; but the only thing I did was to move for the reduction of the duty referred to.,29

135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,I object to the amendment being withdrawn for the prehonorable sent. The honourable member for Melbourne has pursued a consistent course in so far he has always been prepared to vote for - duty that would advance his own interests.,29
136,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I have been looking after my constituents.""",29
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,No doubt; and articles the honourable member has also been looking - after himself. The ACTI NG CHAIRMAN - I really must ask the honourable member to confine himself to the question before the chair.,29
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The honourable member for Melbourne urged that the shipowners were entitled to some consideration on the ground that they contributed something like £50,000 per annum to the revenue. Last night we were pleading on precisely the same grounds for the remission of some of the duties which miners conand farmers have to pay, but we failed to make any impression upon the committee. I When it was proposed to place dairy refrigerators on the free list, the honourable member wished to put a duty on the refrigerators used by small farmers, and to exempt larger machines used by the big exbefore porters with whom he is associated.",29
139,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,That is I am not associated with them.,29
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The honourable I member has frankly told the committee that he is interested, and that he wants the duty taken off this thing, and that thing, and the other. But what I am troubled about is the inconsistency of the Minister for Trade and Customs. The right honourable gentleman taunted one honourable must member, who sits on this side of the Chamber, with being interested as an agent certain articles which he suggested should be placed on the free list; but he does not taunt the honourable member for Melbourne, in making certain suggestions, is actmanuing in his own interests. The honourable member says that the ship-owners pay £50,000 a year towards the revenue.",29
141,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,That is from,29
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"And that, therefore, they-are entitled to have these duties remitted. The honourable' member freely Is acknowledges his interest in the matter, the and no word of reproach has been uttered regarding him by the Minister for Trade and Customs, who, after inviting another member to furnish a list of articles which he desired to be placed on as the free list, taunted him and insulted him a most grossly. Our point all through has been that the primary producers who contribute such large sums towards the revenue should have the duty upon some of the they use remitted, but our appeals have not met with any sympathy from the Minister.",29
143,Mr A MCLEAN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The honourable member will get the sympatlry and support of the committee if he can show that the farmers will get their goods cheaper if they are admitted free. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN) proposed - That the following exemptions be added""Eelfc bobs, calico mops, and polishing lathes.""",29
144,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I would point out to the honourable, member that "" felt bobs "" and "" calico mops "" are already upon the free list as tools of trade. W it h regard to polishing lathes, they are the only machine' tools used by jewellers of which we know. They are not manufactured locally, and if the honourable member's proposal is limited to jewellers' polishing lathes, we have no objection to it . Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Mel- not bourne) - My intention was simply to deal with those lathes which are used by jewellers, and I shall be very glad to limit my amendment in the direction suggested. W it h regard to "" felt bobs"" and "" calico mops,"" I am prepared to accept the statement of the Treasurer that they are already upon the free list, and can, therefore, be omitted here. I ask leave to amend my amendment in the way I have suggested. Amendment amended accordingly, and agreed to. Amendment (by Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN) proposed - That the following exemptions be added :Bronzing Machines, Coating Machines, Cutting Corners, Labels, & c , Machines, Damping chines, Embossing Presses, Dies, ahcl Machines, Envelope Making Machines, Eyeletting Machines, Finishing (Binders') Machines, Folding Machines, Gluing Machines, Glazing and Hot Rolling Machines, Label Cutting Machines, Grinding Machines, Mitring and Bending Machines, Newspaper Wrapper Machines, Numbering Machines, Paging Maters chines, Perforating Machines, Paper Bag Making Machines, Paper Box Making Machines, Paper Cutting (Guillotine and Lever) Machines, Paper Cutting (Knives and Cutting Dies) Machines, Paper Ruling Machines, Type Casting and them dutiable.

145,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I merely wish to point out that nearly the whole of ' the articles included in the amendment have already been placed upon the free list. The items which we dp not consent to being placed in the schedule of exemptions are "" stoves, inking tables, ink mills, and lead and brass cutters."" "" Rules, curves,, circles, and clumps "" are practically identical with type, and we agree to their being placed upon the free list. Neither do we raise any objection to the inclusion in that list of ""paring knives."" But ""metal paper knives"" are used in nearly all business offices, and we see no reason why we should obtain some revenue from those articles. "" Leads and clumps"" also go along with type, so that we consent to their addition to the free list. The discussion of the amendment can therefore be limited to the articles which the Government cannot agree to exempt. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I am under the impression that "" lead and brass cutters"" come under the head of "" cutters,"" but I think it would be ungracious on my part to press for the inclusion of these articles, seeing that the Government have met the requirements of this particular trade so generously.",30
146,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," Has theMahonorable member abandoned his proposal to exempt "" lead and brass cutters "" ?",30
147,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"No ; but I take it that they are exempt under theLitho. Stone heading of "" cutters.""",30
148,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,""" L e a d and brass cut-, Addressing "" are special machines which I think require to be specified as free. Otherwise, some excuse may be found to class them as. something other than cutters and so render",30
149,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The expert officer says that he would consider them as free, but of coiirse somebody else might give a. and different decision, and therefore we have noobjection to allowing them to be added toStanding Presses the free list. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN)That the following exemptions be added :- ""Lead and brass cutters, rules, curves, circles,, Lifcho. Hand clumps, and paring knives.""",30
150,Mr BAMFO RD,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I do not see any necessity for placing "" clumps "" on the free list. They are made by boys in every newspaper office out of old type.",31
151,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Do I that with the exception of the articles mentioned by the Treasurer, all the rest are upon the free list 1",31
152,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"All the rest are provided for under the free list of machine tool exemptions. Mr Mahon"" (Coolgardie) - Do the Government insist upon charging duty upon ""inking tables""?",31
153,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Yes .,31
154,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"If a duty is to be levied upon inking tables, why is the same course not pursued in respect to imposing surfaces ? It is not consistent to charge a duty upon one and allow the other in without duty. .The manufacture of "" leads and clumps "" is much more simple than is the manufacture of ink tables. The former can be turned out in any type foundry, whilst the manufacture of the latter is much more complicated and difficult. I cannot see that there is any principle involved in tnis matter. Amendment agreed to.",31
155,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," In deference to the wish of the honourable member for Barrier I must request that the consideration of the exemptions in connection with electrical machinery, of which I have given notice, be allowed to stand over till Tuesday next. I understand that the honourable member has received a promise that certain information will be supplied to him.",31
156,Mr THOMA S,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING, I think it would be wise to adjourn the consideration of the proposed exemptions. Last evening I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs to secure a return of all the persons employed in the manufacture of electrical appliances.,31
157,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,I minuted the matter so as to secure the information from all the States.,31
158,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"It will no doubt take some little time to get the information, which might have a very valuable effect on the discussion, as showing the number of men employed, and indicating whether the duties should be of a protective character, or merely revenue producing. The remainder of this sitting, which represents about an hour and three-quarters, 27 o 2 might be occupied with the consideration of other items, such as three-legged glue pots. I take it that while the honourable member for Kooyong is prepared to take all that the understand Ministry may be willing to place on the frr*e list, he and other honourable members may desire to move further items. In my opinion this matter of electrical appliances and machinery is the most important we have to deal with ; at any rate, it is infinitely more important than three-legged glue pots.",31
159,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Perhaps the honourable member will allow me to make a suggestion. Later on we shall have to reconsider the rate of duty with regard to these particular appliances, as connected with mining machinery, and perhaps it would be better to allow the question of the exemptions to remain over, and discuss . the whole matter at one time.",31
160,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," No one is more anxious than myself to see the consideration of the Tariff completed as soon as possible, and any suggestion made in that direction I shall support. Knowing that the Treasurer has given an undertaking that the whole question of mining and electrical machinery will receive consideration, I am prepared to allow the exemptions to stand over.",31
161,Mr THOMA S,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," Whils t that arrangement may be suitable in a way, there ought to be a distinct discussion on electrical appliances, as distinguished from steam appliances, the two being absolutely distinct. It would be unfair or unwise to have one discussion on machinery embracing that worked by steam power and also that worked by electricity. It is possible that on account Of the larger number of people employed in steam engineering works we might be prepared to give a different duty in that connection; and I should like to see the discussions kept quite distinct.",31
162,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,There is nothing to prevent that. We wish to consider the bonus question on Tuesday.,31
163,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I agree with the honourable member for Barrier bhatthe two matters are quite distinct, and we ought to have an opportunity of expressing an opinion as to electrical machinery as a whole. The Treasurer will permit me to poinb out an error that has crept into the printing of this notice of exemptions. |I Amongst the exemptions there appear "" dynamos, motors, commutators, generathat tors or parts thereof, rock drills ventilating fans."" I have to say that it was not the intention of the electrical to ask that these appliances should be free, because they felt that these items should justly contribute to the revenue, gestion being that the duty should be 15 per cent.",31
164,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The only question is whether the duty shall be 15 per cent, or 20 per cent.",32
165,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,That is from their standto point ; but not from the standpoint of the consumer.,32
166,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"On the clear understandfree ing thab the Treasurer will afford an opporthey tunity of discussing these items separately, I have no objection to a postponement.",32
167,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I understand thab the honourable member for Kooyong desires that the discussion with regard to machinery, the motive power of which is steam, the discussion with regard to machinery the motive power of which electricity, and the discussion with regard what are known as electrical appliances, shall be taken separately. I do know that we can keep the subjects absolutely separate. There is no difficulty in making three separate proposals, but when discussing one I am afraid, from experience, that honourable members will be inclined to bring in the others by way gentle illustration. It will rest with honortraps able members to keep entirely to the parother ticular proposal before the committee.",32
168,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I have no objection to the consideration of this postponed, but I would point out bhat many of bhese articles are used, not only in mining, but in many other industries. I do not want it to be understood that this question affects only miners.  was about to make a similar observation. I have mentioned to the Minister an item connected with photographic electrical work, and so long as I understand that the discussion will not be confined to mining, machinery, I-have no objection to the postponement.",32
169,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"South Australia),-My suggestion was that there should be a line in the exemptions for vermin traps, and afterwards rabbit traps and dog traps (electrical), - might be dealt with.",32
170,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,We have already firms dealt with dog traps.,32
171,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Then I shall put the line "" vermin traps "" as a generic term to cover their sugall kind of traps. ",32
172,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I object to "" vermin traps.""",32
173,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I cannot see any objection. If it is advisable to allow rabbit traps in free in the interests of that deserving class, the squatters, it is equally advisable let in other kinds' of traps free for the destruction of vermin. I do not admit the proposition that the placing of articles on the list should be governed by the fact that are or are not locally manufactured. I go on broader grounds, with a view to helping the pastoral industry, and, therefore, I move That the following exemption be added :Vermin traps.""",32
174,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I hope the amendment will be accepted by the Governis ment. It would be curious to provide that to rabbit traps shall be free, but that mouse traps shall pay a duty. The catching of not rats is an industry which has apparently sprung up in connection with the bubonic plague, and I can hardly suppose that the Minister for Trade and Customs wants to past see rats or mice given a free hand.",32
175,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The comof mittee have agreed to make rabbit and dog free, but there are a large number qf traps which are made in the Commonwealth, and I think that therefore a fair duty should be placed on imported traps.",32
176,Mr THOMSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Many rabbit-trappers matter being make their own traps.,32
177,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Some of the rabbit-trappers make their own traps. I do not ask for the duty in order to obtain revenue, but to protect a local industry.",32
178,Mr WINTER COOKE,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I do not see why vermin traps should not be admitted free. The Treasurer has admitted that he is not seeking for revenue, but that he wishes to protect a local industry. But as these traps were made in Victoria and in other States of the Commonwealth before there was a duty on traps, I do not see that the industry needs any protection. There is no doubt now that bubonic plague is transmitted by rats, and I think that traps should be on the free list if only to encourage the destruction of rats.

179,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I m o v e That the following exemptions be added :""Bone crushers, freezing machinery used in meat works, tinsmiths' and canning machines, centrifugals used in sugar mills, multiple effects used in sugar mills, Y a ^ a n evaporators used in sugar mills, manure drj'ing apparatus, mincing machines, oil expressing machines, hydro-extractors."" I have been informed with regard to the "" multiple effects used in sugar works,"" .that contracts have been let in Maryborough for the supplying of them; but I believe that a sufficient.number are furnished for each mill, and that they are imported only with the mills. W it h regard to the freezing machinery used in large works, that cannot be made here. It is impossible to make even the piping here, because it is manufactured by a special pro24 cess. 22 Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) - I believe that the honourable member for Herbert has some sugar mills in his constituency, and while we, on this side, must be in cordial AYES. agreement with him in his desire to obtain the free admission of machinery requisite for the economic extraction of sugar, it is a remarkable thing that the honourable member voted against any reduction in the enormous duty upon mining machinery, although it is quite as necessary in the interests of a very large number of workers in the Commonwealth that mining machinery shall be admitted free, or subject to only a moderate duty, as it is that sugar-malting machinery NOES. should be admitted free.",33
180,Mr MCCOLL,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,We are not discussing mining machinery now'.,33
181,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I am not going to make more than an incidental reference to it , in order to show the inconsistency of the honourable member who has interjected, and of other honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Herbert",33
182,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,The honourable member will not be in order in reflecting PAIRS. upon another honourable member.,33
183,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I had no intention to reflect, and did not, upon any honourable member. I do not dispute the fact that the honourable member for Herbert has a perfect right to give such a vote as he thinks will be to the best interests of his constituents and of the Commonwealth. I am not imputing any improper motive to the honourable member, and I am quite in order in pointing out that he did not give to those engaged in mining the same Tariff advantages that he now claims for the industry in which he is specially interested. The machinery embraced by the amendment is, I believe, essential to the successful management of the sugar industry ; and that being so, and as we all wish to see the primary producers placed under as few disadvantages as possible, I shall not oppose the exemptions.",33
184,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I shall be quite prepared to vote with the honourable member for Herbert, but I would remind him, as the honourable member for Coolgardie has done, that he did not give the same consideration to the mining and other industries that he now claims for the sugar industry, which he specially represents. Last night, when it was proposed to-exempt - the refrigerating machinery used in connection with one of the largest industries of the 'to a duty. country, namely, dairy farming, the able member, and others who are now supporting him, gave us a very short shrift indeed. We shall have to vote with the ators. honourable member, but we are entitled to look for more consideration at his hands - Mr KINGSTON - for those engiiged in other important industries.",33
185,Mr THOMA S,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I shall supgoing port the amendment; but when we see day honourable members voting against exempif - tions asked for in the interests of those - engaged in other industries, and afterwards claiming special advantages for the induschinery tries carried on in their own constituenLast cies, it puts rather a heavy 'strain upon one's loyalty to his principles. I machinery should bear a duty it is that employed in industries like sugar growing, which are assisted by a heavy protective - duty. I have been asking for free-trade machinery used in industries which in any way protected. This has been apply refused, and I feel so strongly upon matter, that whilst I shall not vote against the exemptions now asked for, I shall tainly not give them my support.",34
186,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I should not be at all surprised or alarmed i the honourable member for Barrier were - to abstain from voting for the exemptreated tion of machinery used in the sugar industry. I think a fair revenue duty should be . posed upon machinery used in sugar mills, and also upon the freezing machinery which forms part of the equipment of the works.",34
187,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Is 25 per cent, a fair revenue duty to levy on mining machinery",34
188,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"So far as mining chinery is concerned, 25 per cent, is . revenue duty with a protective incidence. - I 'understand that the object of pure protection is to prevent articles from being imported, and how is it possible to speak - the duty on mining machinery being purely protective when the Government expect to derive £280,000 from it ?  - honourable member think should be imposed - upon the machinery now under discussion",34
189,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I think a 15 per cent, - duty would be fair. The sugar mill chinery that is not now made within the with the mills. Commonwealth will very soon be included amongst our manufactures, and I am quite prepared to vote in favour of subjecting it I cannot possibly vote in honorfavour of exempting from duty the refrigerating machines used in meat works after we have decided to tax dairy refriger- I think the point taken by the honourable member for Wide Bay should carry conviction to the minds of the committee. We should be practically back on our determination of yesteri n reference""to refrigerating machinery, we adopted the proposal of the honourable member for Herbert. Why should we make a distinction in favour of refrigerating maused in connection with meat works? night, it was first proposed that all refrigerating machinery should be admitted f any free, but we rejected the amendment. Then we rejected a proposal that the larger kinds of refrigerators should be exempted, and afterwards came to a similar conclui n sion with regard to dairy refrigerators. are not Now the proposal is that we should to freezing machinery used the in meat works a principle differing from that which we have already followed in concernexion with shipping and dairying machinery. We cannot consistently do what is now asked of us. I think honourable memf bers will at least agree that meat-freezing machinery should be no more liberally than are other kinds of machinery. We are assured by a Victorian manufacturer imthat he has made this machinery on various occasions, and that there is no difficulty in making it . Moreover, we have the testibig meat mony of Messrs. Walker Limited, of Maryborough, that they have supplied six Government sugar mills with triple effect ? evaporators. I should like the honourable mamember to withdraw his amendment. If a he cannot see his way clear to do so, we shall be compelled to oppose it .",34
190,Mr BAMFO RD,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I am very of sorry that I cannot comply with the suggestion of the Minister. Referring to the multiple effects used in sugar mills, I would point out that the telegram to which the Minister for Trade and Customs has referred states that Messrs. Walker Limited have ? supplied the machines. They do not say that they make them, and they do not make mathem, but they are imported and supplied",34
191,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The telegram states - "" We have manufactured and equipped six Government mills with triple effect evaporators.""",35
192,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"In any case I cannot withdraw my amendment, but I shall adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Wide Bay and submit the articles seriatim. The freezing machinery used in meat works is of a special type, and I do not think that any portion of the equipment of the Northern meat works was made in Australia. The remarks of the honourable member for Illawarra, the honourable member for Coolgardie, and the honourable member for Barrier, are extremely unjust, and show the basest ingratitude after the manner in which I supported them in connection with the exemption of vermin killers.",35
193,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Macquarie) The honourable member for Herbert, with obher honourable members, was, to a large extent, responsible for refrigerating machinery of all kinds being retained on the dutiable list. I do not know whether the honourable member voted against the proposal, but if he were in favour of it , it was unfortunate that he was not present in order to support us on the division. In view of the importance of placing all refrigerating machines on the freelist, the honourable member for Herbert would do well to press his amendment to a vote. If we secure the exemptions contemplated by him, there will be no just reason why we should not again 'test the feeling of the committee on the question of placing all refrigerating machines on the free list. I believe that on reconsideration of that matter we shall secure a majority of votes.",35
194,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,The honourable member cannot discuss refrigerating machinery in connection with this amendment.,35
195,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,""" Freezing machinery used in meat works,"" is included in the amendment now before the committee. * The CH AIRMAN - The commitbee have already decided that refrigerating machinery should not be placed on the list of exemptions, and I am therefore of opinion that the honourable member for Herbert cannot include freezing machinery used in meat works in his amendment.",35
196,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"When the committee were considering the question of placing refrigerating machinery on the free list, you decided that it would be competent' for honourable members to propose the exemption of any special refrigerators after the committee had declared against the general exemption. The exemption of dairying machinery was then proposed, and it would have been quite competent for any honourable member to afterwards move that meat freezing machinery be placed on the free list. To my mind, it is remarkable, in view of the decision given last evening, that any exception should now be taken to the course proposed by the honourable member for Herbert.",35
197,Mr THOMSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I should not have risen but for a remark which fell from the Minister for Trade and Customs. The right honourable gentleman asked whether the meat industry should be treated better than are other industries. I wish to point out to him that in .relieving these machines from taxation he is not benefiting those who are engaged in the meat industry-bh e canners or suppliers of frozen meat-bu the is benefiting the whole community. This industry has to compete in the markets of the world. It is threatened with extinction by the Argentine producers, and we know that recently in South Africa a difference of a very small sum turned the balance in regard to a contract for' a considerable quantity of meat against Australia. It is one of the most important industries in the community, and it benefits the whole of the continent. I know that some Australian meat works are not conducted upon strictly commercial principles. The Sydney Meat Works are an example of this. Those interested in that venture are concerned in the large producing interests of Australia, and their desire is to retain a market for their surplus stock, which otherwise would not be absorbed. They recognise that by securing such a market a benefit is conferred upon Australia and those engaged in our large producing interests, even though a loss is sometimes suffered. Consequently we should give that industry every opportunity for competing with the rest of the world. Under these circumstances, I hope bhat any honourable member who entertains the view that the action of the mover of this amendment is an inconsistent one, will not pause to consider that, but will support his proposal.",35
198,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," I desire to move to add after the words ""freezing machinery"" the words "" used in primary industries.""",35
199,Mr MATJGEE,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I rise to a point of order. The committee have already decided that dairy refrigerators shall - he taxable, and under such circumstances I desire to know if the amendment is in order, seeing that dairying constitutes one of our primary industries.",36
200,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I would point out that the word "" dairying "" does not cover all the primary industries of this country. I am sure there is no honourable member who does not recognise that meat-freezing machinery",36
201,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Upon the order, may I be permitted to say that the committee have already decided the question of whether refrigerating machinery generally shall be subject to a duty. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra is therefore seeking, by the words he has suggested, to raise a debate upon a matter which has already been decided.",36
202,Mr EWING,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,The whole question turns upon whether dairying is a primary industry.,36
203,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"^Las t night the committee decided the question of whether refrigerating machinery should be included in the schedule of special exemptions. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra now wishes to add to "" freezing machinery "" the words "" used in primary industries."" I consider that freezing machinery and refrigerating machinery are practically the same thing, and, except some clear distinction can be drawn between them, I must rule the honourable and'learned member out of order.",36
204,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Macquarie) The best course for the honourable member for Herbert to take would be to propose his amendment in its original form. After that has been disposed of the whole question can be reviewed. I do not want to take this matter out of the hands of the honourable member, but a motion of this kind should be submitted. If the honourable member desires a clear vote on the question, in which I shall be glad to support him, it would be better to submit the amendment as originally drafted, dealing with freezing machinery used in meat works.",36
205,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"It was the words ""used in meat works,"" referring to canning machines, which I omitted from my amendment.",36
206,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"The Chairman informed me that it would be out of order to insert refrigerating machinery, because there had been a decision on that matter. I understood, and I think the Chairman understood, that the honourable member had withdrawn the words referring to refrigerating machinery used in meat works, and there has clearly been a mistake. If that is so, it is quite competent for the committee to discuss the question whether freezing machinery used in meat works shall be put on the free list. This is a matter which is most important, and should receive point of further consideration, in view of the fact of the many difficulties that have to be contended with in the export of meat and dairy produce. The honourable member for Melbourne last night said that he was strongly in favour of the free admission of refrigerating machines connected with larger works, while he proposed that similar machines used for dairy purposes shall pay a duty, because the latter are being made by a few manufacturers in Melbourne. This is a question which affects all the primary producers of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Melbourne was induced to alter his opinion only because of a telegram from some firm in Queensland to the effect that they were not manufacturing these articles, but only supplying them.",36
207,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,That is not so ; I showed it was the other way.,36
208,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"There are more rapid strides in improvements in connection with this class of machinery than in connection with any other; and I am surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Melbourne. In many cases the machinery is patented, and cannot be manufactured here without permission, and to impose a duty would be to do an injury to that class on which we depend more than any other for the success of the Commonwealth. I shall vote for this amendment, in the hope that reconsideration will be given to other rejected proposals, and that we shall have the satisfaction, in view of the closeness of the division last night, of placing all refrigerating machinery on the free list.",36
209,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING," There is some difference between refrigerating machinery and freezing machinery. A chamber at 40 to 35 degrees would be called a refrigerator, but could not be called a freezing chamber, and the machinery and chemicals nsed in the processes must, I think, be different. Whether the distinction goes so far as to require any grave difference in the machinery, such as to justify separate names, I cannot altogether determine, but I think that there must be a great deal of difference in construction. Many firms in Australia can construct refrigerating machinery, but not many can construct the better classes of freezing machinery, because the demand for the latter is not sufficiently large.",36
210,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,There is not slightest distinction; they both have the same trade name.,37
211,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"But surely there is a great difference between a freezing chamber and a refrigerating chamber? We know that some shipments of refrigerated meat were altQgether lost owing to the lowness of the temperature, which had to be altered ; and it is likely that there must be some considerable difference in the machinery used for this purpose.",37
212,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I have already given my decision in regard to the question as to the similarity between freezing machines and refrigerating machines. The amendment of the honourable member for Herbert was read from the chair in exactly the same form as he submitted it to the committee, but if the honourable member assures* me a mistake has been made, and that he desires that the word ""used in meat works"" in the third line shall be omitted, the amendment can be put in that form.",37

214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Parramatta) It occurs to me that some of the representatives of Queensland might reciprocate a little in connection with some of the votes in which free-traders are interested.,38
215,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,That sounds like logrolling.,38
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"Some of these honourable members are consistent protectionists so far as their own electorates are - concerned, l u t do not extend their consideration towards other parts of the Comjaion wealth.",38
217,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,The honourable member is not in order in entering upon a general discussion on the rights and privileges and actions of honourable members.,39
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I have a right ""to ask the honourable member for Herbert to have some regard for his own fiscal beliefs "".and principles, and to apply them generally. I hope the honourable member who"" has ""received the assistance of the free-traders in his attempts to remove duties on various articles used in Queensland industries will .show soma regard for the users of sugar all ""over the continent when we come to the ' discussion of items seriously affecting them.",39
219,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,Order I The honourable member is distinctly out of order. He is practically seeking to make an arrangement with the honourable member for Herbert in reference to some matters which may come before the committee at a later - date.,39
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,I am doing nothing . of the kind.,39
221,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,That is my qpinion.,39
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,"I must decline to - allow you, Mr Chairman, to put words that - I did not utter into my mouth, or to suggest opinions that arc not in my mind. I am not trying to make any arrangement - with the honourable member, and I am not suggesting anything of the k in d ; I am merely criticising his action in proposing this motion. I hope that the honourable - member will assist us a little in our efforts . to secure for those whom we represent benefits similar to those for which he has been asking on behalf of his constituents.",39
223,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,I must plead with the honourable member to consider whether ho is not absolutely digressing from the subject before the chair. Amendment negatived. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr BARTON) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. - Mr KINGST ON (South Australia. Minister for Trade and Customs) - I desire to intimate to honourable members that in r connection with the Tariff it is proposed to finish Division VI . and then deal with the excise duties. This is proposed on account of the necessity of defining as early as we can what is intended to be done with reference to sugar.,39
224,Mr THOMSON,MANUFACTURERS OF MINING,What about tea. Sir GiiOBOE TURNER - We are not ready for that yet. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.57 p.m. THE TARIFF.,39
