1,Mr JOHNSON,APPOINTMENTS TO THE HIGH,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government have arrived at any decision with regard to the appointment of additional Justices of the High Court?,13
2,Mr DEAKIN,APPOINTMENTS TO THE HIGH,"I cannot yet make an announcement to the House, but shall be able to do so shortly. DIFFERENTIAL RAILWAY RATES.",13
3,Mr BATCHELOR,APPOINTMENTS TO THE HIGH,"I wish to direct the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to the following passage in the evidence of Mr J. F. Martin, of Adelaide, given before the Tariff Commission:I do not think Federation is going to hurt us at all when we get worked into it. The difficulty is to work into a lot of things. For instance, the railways k ill us. I will give vou an instance of unfair railway business. We can send a harvester from Adelaide lo Ballarat for JCSI but from the border, on our side, not a harvester is dropped. If we want to send n harvester across the border to Mantura, we have to pay ,£10. There are no harvesters used between Melbourne and Ballarat. Mr Tait, the Commissioner in Victoria, was too smart for our Commissioner. We wanted the thing altered, and our Commissioner wrote to Mr Tait, who consulted with the manufacturers in Victoria, and they said, "" Oh , no."" We can send them by ship for a little less. I should like to know whether the attention of the Minister has been drawn to the condition of affairs described by Mr Martin, and whether he considers that conditions so manifestly in restraint of trade should be allowed to continue?",13
4,Mr GROOM,APPOINTMENTS TO THE HIGH,"My attention has not been drawn to the statement quoted by the honourable member j but. at the present time, we are dn communication with the Victorian Railways Commissioners upon the subject of the rates charged by them. I have just received a reply from, them, but we are making further inquiries, with a' view to obtaining the fullest information. DESIGNS ACT.",14
5,Mr TUDOR,APPOINTMENTS TO THE HIGH,I wish to know whether the Prime Minister can inform the House when the Designs Act will come into operation ?,14
6,Mr DEAKIN,APPOINTMENTS TO THE HIGH,I shall be able to inform the honourable member within the next hour or so. CASE OF CAPTAIN CROUCH.,14
7,Mr JOHNSON,APPOINTMENTS TO THE HIGH,"I wish to know if the Vice-President of the Executive Council has, in accordance with his promise given yesterday, ascertained whether the Minister of Defence is willing that the .papers in what is known as the Crouch Surrender Case shall be laid upon the library table?",14
8,Mr EWING,APPOINTMENTS TO THE HIGH,"The Minister of Defence, as the honourable member is perhaps aware, is just now extremelv busy; but he assures me that he will look further into the matter immediately the pressure of public business is relaxed. TARIF F AGREEMENT: NA ZEALAND.",14
9,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon noticet. In view of the unfavorable report of the Committee appointed by the New Zealand Parliament to consider the proposed Reciprocity Treaty, is it the intention of the Government to proceed further with the matter? 2. If not, will the Minister at once discontinue the collection of timber and other duties levied in anticipation of the ratification of the treaty, and refund all amounts collected to date?",14
10,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : - As the duties are now being collected under resolutions both in New Zealand and Australia, such collection will be continued until the matter is disposed of in the New Zealand Parliament. If the treaty is ratified by that Parliament before this Parliament is prorogued, a Billto give effect thereto will be introduced, but should this Parliament prorogue before any definite decision is come to, the resolutions of this House will lapse, and duties will cease to becollected thereunder, in which case a ll such, duties collected to date will be refunded. 2. See answer to No. i . METEOROLOGICAL DEPARTMENT.",14
11,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"the Minister of Home A f fair s , upon noticer. Whether, in the Meteorological Department about to be established, it is proposed to retair> the services of those local scientific observers who have previously assisted the State Astronomers?' a. Is it intended to pay them for such services? 3. How many ""Second Class Observation Stations"" are there in Australia? 4. Is it proposed to hand over the careful and exact scientific observation work done at these stations to post-office employee's or other publicservants, and wil l they be remunerated for their trouble ?",14
12,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The answers to the honourable ahd learned member's questions are as follow:1. The organization of the Department of Meteorology can only be determined after the appointment of the Meteorologist, and upon consideration of such report as he may present. It may be assumed that it will be necessary for him to follow the practice that prevails in alf countries of accepting the services of voluntary observers in various parts of Australia. 2 and 4. No decision can at this stage be given as to payment for services of eitherpersons outside or within the Public Service. 3. Inquiry will be made to ascertain an answer to this question. NA CHARGES.",14
13,Mr MALONEY,QUEENSCLIFF CANTEEN,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice- 1. In reference to his reply to questions re canteen charges at Queenscliff on the 2nd inst., and his statement that the lists for 1905 ancT 1906 are attached, as such lists do not give the information desired, will he direct that there be produced complete lists of charges for allarticles sold at the Queenscliff canteen in July, T905, and July, 1906? 2. Are the two separate lists as set out in Hansard 1906, page 1533, correct?",14

In Committee (Consideration of Senate's Amendments): Clause 2Section one hundred and five of the Constitution is altered(a) by omitting the words '-"" as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or a proportion thereof according to the respective number of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth,"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words any part thereof "" ; and (i>) by inserting, after the word ""convert,"" 4he word "" redeem."" Senate's amendments After clause 1, insert new clause"" IA. The Constitution is altered by the addition of the following section :: The powers of the Parliament ing to the public debts of the States shall extend to debts incurred since the establishment of the Commonwealth. ' "" Leave out clause 2.",14
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Swap-Trea- . surer) [2.40] - I very much regret that the proposals of the Government, which were approved by this House, with regard to the amendment of section 105 of the Constitution were not agreed to by ""the Senate. The practical effect of the Bill as it has come back from the Senate, is to eliminate from section 105 of the Constitution the words "" as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth."" The section, if amended as proposed, would read- The Parliament may take over from the States 4lieir public debts, or a proportion thereof, according to the respective numbers of their population, as shown by the latest statistics of ""the Commonwealth, and may convert, renew, or consolidate such debts or any part thereof. It seems extraordinary that the House should be unanimously in favour of an important measure of this kind, and that in another place so much exception should be taken to its provisions.",15
16,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is not the Minister going 40 oppose the amendment?,15
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,15
18,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What will be the use of the Bill as amended?,15
19,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that it will be of great use. At the same time, I regret that the Bill which was unanimouslv accepted by this House should not have found favour in another place. This is a purely financial matter, and all parties wish to carry out the spirit of the Constitution with regard to the taking over of the States debts with the object of effecting a considerable saving for the States, and firmly establishing the credit of the Commonwealth. This was one of the objects of Federation which was prominently placed before the people when the Constitution was being considered by the several Federal Conventions. As honourable members are aware, section 105 was very carefully considered at the Conventions, and, in view of the important part that it played in connection with the acceptance of Fede""or ration by the people, no one would desire to ruthlessly or carelessly lay hands upon it. Honourable members will, of course, recollect that under the Constitution the Commonwealth was authorized to take over the States debts as they existed at the establishment of Federation. These debts relat- amount to ^something like £202,000,000 . The Bill as it is proposed to be amended by the Senate would enable us to do as we desire, namelv, to take over, not only the debts as existing at the time that Federation was established, but those which have since been incurred by the States, and which'represent an addition of £34,000,000 to the amount previously mentioned. This Bill will empower the Commonwealth to take over an additional ,£34,000,000 upon exactly the same terms iara we are empowered by the Constitution to take over £202,000,000.",15
20,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,O r more.,15
21,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes. The Bill , in the form in which, it left this Chamber, contained power to take over, not only the debts which exist today, but those which may be incurred hereafter. Mr MCLEAN ! - Will the Bill, in its present form, enable the Commonwealth to take over debts which may be incurred hereafter ?",15
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , if Parliament chooses to do so.",15
23,Mr MCLEAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think so.,15
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am satisfied. However,' that matter is not so urgent as is the acquisition of power by the Commonwealth to take over the whole of the existing States debts. I do not think we should object to the form in which the measure has been returned from the Senate, even if it does not go so fa r as some honourable members would like, because at the present time we have power to take over States debts to the extent of £202,000,000, and the 'Bill merely declares that we shall be empowered to take over an additional £34,000,000 upon the same terms.",15
25,Mr JOSEPH ICOOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the good of taking over that additional sum unless we can operate?,16
26,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member will defer his question until I have concluded my remarks, I shall be very glad to answer him to the best of my - ability. I repeat that, under section 105 pf the Constitution, we have power to take over £202,000,000 of the States debts, and this Bill merely provides that we shall be empowered to take over an additional £34,000,000 upon similar terms. I have prepared a short paper setting out the procedure that will be followed in the taking over of the whole of the debts, should this Bill become law, and be assented to by the people. That procedure would be as follows: 1. An Act of the Federal Parliament will be required to be passed authorizing the taking over of the whole of the States debts on a date to be named in such Act. 2. From the date named the Commonwealth will become solely liable to the bond-holders the annual payment of interest and sinking fund (if any), as well as for the redemption of the debts on maturity. 3. From the same date the Commonwealth will occupy in relation to such bond-holders the exact position previously occupied by the States, and will have sole control of all operations fur conversion before maturity, or redemption at maturity, as may be thought fit.",16
27,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That cannot be done without the consent ot the bondholders.,16
28,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Surely it can.,16
29,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It cannot.,16
30,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then the words of section 105 of the Constitution are without meaning.,16
31,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Commonwealth can convert the debts only when they fall due. It cannot do so whilst they are current.,16
32,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member will only permit me to proceed without interruption I shall be obliged. We do not intend to convert without the consent of the bond-holders, but we shall have to convert or redeem at maturity. We shall convert if we can make a reasonable bargain with the bondholders, but if not we shall have to pay them off when the loans mature.",16
33,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Treasurer says that the Commonwealth will solely liable to the bond-holders.,16
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I say that it will occupy the position which is at present occupied by the States. It is waste of time to be hypercritical over this matter.,16
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,All we ask is that the Treasurer shall be accurate.,16
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My statement is, I believe, strictly accurate. My paper proceeds4. The designation of the State slocks wilt not be changed, but will remain as at present, namely, New South Wales stock, Victorian stock, Queensland stock, Sc., & c , and will not have the Commonwealth brand full y upon them, or bear the name "" Australian consols"" until conversion. 5. The opinion expressed by the financial authorities consulted by the Treasurer in London that the Australian consols would in time, if not immediately, command a higher price than States stocks of the same denomination and currency, was based not upon any doubt as to the' ability of the States to meet their existing obligations with regard to their public debts, but upon the advantage of having one uniform stock of large volume, in which transactions would be numerous for investment purfor poses, which would soon become more popular, and would consequently command a higher price. 6. The Commonwealth will deduct each year from any amount to be jiaid to each State, the expenditure made' on behalf of that State, for interest and sinking fund [vide section 87 of the Constitution), and if such amount is insufficient in any case, the difference will be paid to the Commonwealth by the State (vide section 105 of the Constitution). I have no fear that any amount which may be due to the Commonwealth by the States will not be paid. I believe they will be just as anxious to pay the interest on their public debts through the Commonwealth, as they are to pay them direct to the bond-holder. Further, the alteration may have a good effect in the .minds of some persons, inasmuch as the Commonwealth Treasurer-realizin g that the States have a considerable amount of interest to pay to him upon prescribed dates-wil l do his best to make the amount as small as possible, and will do his best not to embark upon avoidable expenditure which would make the burden upon the States, in respect of the payment of interest, greater than was absolutely unavoidable. What does placing the "" Commonwealth brand"" upon the States debts mean ? It is an expression which was used by me in connection with the scheme for solving the financial problems of the Constitution be which I submitted to honourable members on behalf of the Government in the Budget speech. It may be said that for all practical purposes the brand of the Commonwealth is upon the States debts now, but, if this is so, the price does not seem to have materially increased in consequence. Nobody will suggest for a moment that the Commonwealth would permit anything to interfere with the solvency of the States. I can make that assertion with the greater freedom because I am quite satisfied that the States are fully able to pay all their obligations. Therefore, in saying that the Commonwealth brand is upon the States debts now, I am merely saying what the Constitution itself provides, namely, that the Commonwealth shall be the protector of the States.",16
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y a moment ago the Treasurer said that he did not intend to put the Commonwealth brand upon the States debts. What does he mean?,17
38,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I mean that it may be said that, theoretically, but not actually, 'the Commonwealth brand is already upon the States debts. as we take over these debts the Commonwealth brand will, legally and in reality, be upon them.",17
39,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,O r as soon as we take over anv part of them.,17
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am dealing with the whole of the debts. I know that public opinion is opposed to the Commonremain wealth taking over only a portion of debts.,17
41,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What "" take over "" mean ?",17
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In this case it debts. will mean the passing of an Act authorizing the taking over of the whole of the States debts from the date named in such Act. f i o m that date the Commonwealth will come solely liable to the bond-holders the annual payment of interest and sinkwere ing fund, if any. as well as for the demotion of the d.ebts on maturity.",17
43,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Anc l as to the bond-holders ?,17
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The bondNothing holders will not mind whether' they receive their interest through A or 13. so long they tret ct. It is generally sunoosed as soon as the Commonwealth takes over the debts there will be a. the price of our bonds owing to the enhanced security 'given by the Commonthe wealth, and that that increase will bond-holder. My own opinion is that until the designation or nomenclature of the bond is changed there will be no great increase in its value. The reason why the financiers in London consider that Commonwealth consols will command a higher price than State stocks is not because the security offered by the States is not sound, but because of the advantage which will be conferred by the establishment of a uniform Australian stock of large volume in which transactions would be numerous for investment purposes. It has been said that the powers conferred by section 305 of the Constitution are insufficient. All the arguments which I have heard advanced in regard to that point at conferences and elsewhere are to the effect that that section does not permit of the' whole of the States debts being taken over by the Commonwealth. That seems to have been the principal difficulty. The Bill , even as amended by the Senate, will overcome that disability. Mr GB EDWARDS' - It will not. The Senate's amendment will prevent us taking As soon over the whole of the debts.",17
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is absolutely in error. We should have to take over the whole of the debts at the one operation, but would not alter their designation until they had been converted. South Australian stock. New South Wales stock, and all other States stocks would as they are, except that the Comthe monwealth would pav the interest, and guarantee the redemption of the stock. does Mr DUGALD THOMSON - I doubt whether that would be a taking over of the",17
46,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no doubt whatever on that point. There is and nothing in the Constitution requiring us, beon taking over stock, to alter its designafor tion. It would be improper, even if it possible, for the Commonwealth to resay to a holder of State stock, "" You are the holder of Victorian stock, and we are going nolens volens to take it from you and substitute Commonwealth stock for it . "" of this .sort is contemplated. The principal reason why action has not been as taken during the last six years is that it that was considered advisable that when we dealt with the debts Ave should take over Wee increase in the whole of them.",17
47,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"- I expressed that view at Convention, but the right honourable go to the member did not share it with me.",17
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I fully recognise that if we could, for a considerable period, induce the States to cease borrowing on the London market, so as to enable our stock to become popular, and secure an enhanced price, a great advantage would be reaped. Whatever my opinion may be, the public opinion is almost unanimous that we should take over all the existing debts.",17
49,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the right honourable gentleman think that, if we did so, the States would cease borrowing?",18
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At the Hobart Conference, the representatives of the States said that they would refrain from borrowing, except through the Commonwealth, on . the London market. Our - great object is to take over the whole of the debts on the London market, ancl to gradually convert them into one Commonwealth stock. Two reports, which have been placed on the table of the House, indicate the pronounced advantage which would accrue to the States, even if in issuing new stock, we are able to raise it i per cent, better than the States. Such a saving, together with interest, would amount, in 1952, when the last loan would mature, to £27,000,000. Every one desires that this step shall be taken as soon as possible, and I have not the slightest doubt that we shall be able to borrow to much better advantage than the States, and to save more than J per cent. That is the view at which I arrived after discussing this question with the financial authorities in London. In these circumstances, therefore, I would urge upon honourable members the desirableness of our taking immediate steps to effect this great saving. Not one penny of the money so saved will go into the coffers of the Commonwealth,. The total saving will go to the States. I mention this fact to show that our sole desire is to act only tended by the Constitution, and to improve the position of the States.",18
51,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Would there be any harm in saying that the advantage would go to the people of the Commonwealth,?",18
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; the people of the Commonwealth and the people of the States are one. An attempt has been made to show that there is a difference between taking over the whole of the debts at the one time, as we should have to do under the Bil l as amended, and taking them over gradually, and net becoming legally responsible for them until each debt matures. Personally, I should favour the adoption of the latter course.. The designation of the debts would remain* unaltered, but the Commonwealth would become responsible for them. Unfortunately, however, we cannot take them over gradually. The members of another place seemed to be suspicious that more was. intended than was said. I can only say that there was no intention on the part, of the Government to do more than weindicated.",18
53,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why not giveanother place an opportunity to reconsider its decision.,18
54,Sir TOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We shall later on be able to consider that point. Although I favour the gradual taking over of thedebts of the States, I recognise that, having regard to'our bounden duty, we should be prepared to accept the Bill as amended by the Senate, rather than allow the matter to remain in abeyance for another three years. If it were allowed to stand over, the probability is that new difficultieswould arise, and that much dissatisfactionwould be. caused. I am therefore prepared to - agree to. the Senate's amendment, and to risk the chance of our incurring a slight loss as the result of the bond-holders being, able, between now and the date of the maturing of] the loans, to secure an enhanced! price for their stock. I am not sure that it would be a bad thing for us if , as the outcome of some Stock Exchange convulsion, Australian bonds were increased in> value by 1 per cent, or 2 per cent. I should not care who secured the benefit of that increase; I should know that outcredit had been enhanced - In dealing with a question of this magnitude, we cannot afford to consider whether some individual may benefit to a small extent. The Constitution intends that the States debts as in- shall be taken over, and we simjply ask now that we shall be allowed to do that which the people as a whole demand of us; that 'we shall be permitted to take over the total indebtedness, amounting to £202,000,000 , as at the date of Federation, as well as the debts, amounting to £31,000,000, since incurred. If we take over these debts, there will be nothing to prevent our holding out to bondholders the same inducement that we could offer them if we took them over piecemeal..",18
55,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is hardly so.,18
56,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We shall have control of debts amounting to £236,000,000.",18
57,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,As soon as we take them over the increased value_ will accrue to the bond-holders.,19
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What I said was that we should be free to make arrangements with the bond-holders.,19
59,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,As soon as we take over the States debts they become Commonwealth stock.,19
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is not so. The Commonwealth will become, liable to pay the interest and to redeem the stock, but the designation of the stock will not be changed. If we have Victorian J884'S, Western Australian 1893's, and so forth, the price obtained for them will not in my opinion be as good as that which would be obtained for one Commonwealth stock, which after - thirty years would be interminable. . When we obtain command of the stock we can treat with the bondholders equally as well under the Bill as amended as we could under the original proposal. We could convert any of the debts of the States, and on their reaching maturity we might either exchange them for a Commonwealth stock, or pay them off out of a fund raised by the sale of Australian Consols. The only alternative to the acceptance of the Bill as amended by the Senate is to defer dealing with this question for another three years.",19
61,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The tive is to secure the passing of the Bill as introduced.,19
62,Sir TOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How can we do that?,19
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We might, at events, try.",19
64,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are told that it is hopeless.,19
65,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should certainly prefer to see the Bill passed troduced in this Chamber, but rather than allow the whole question to be shelved for another three years, I am prepared to accept the Bill as amended.",19
66,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no urgency as to taking over the debts incurred since 1.901. The Commonwealth at present has power to take over all the debts up year.,19
67,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is a large sum maturing next year, which borrowed since 1901.",19

70,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mr Bent does not wish us to interfere in regard to them.,19
71,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am opposed to anything being done which will have the effect of preventing a referendum on this subject for three years to come - If that result is to occur, let the responsibility been another place. If the Commonwealth could borrow at J per cent, less than the average rate paid by the States, £ 1 , 3 8 8 , 000 would be saved by the canversion of the debts coming due in 1907.",19
72,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent that.,19
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Stil l we should not be able to make arrangements with the States in regard'to their non-borrowing in London, and other matters, .about which it is desirable to come to an agreement. In my opinion, it is the desire of the people of Australia that the Commonwealth shall, take over the whole of the debts of the States, and it is to carry that desire into effect that the Government have moved in this matter. The present is the best time to deal with i't. Let us not seek to put it off to "" a more convenient season."" It must be remembered that we are merely asking that the question may be referred to the people. Parliament can do nothing in the matter until the people have agreed alterna- to an amendment of the Constitution which will allow the Commonwealth to take over the debts incurred since Federation, as well as those which had been incurred when the Union was formed. I would rather pass the Bill as the Senate wish td amend it all than lay it aside altogether.",19
74,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why not re-insert the original provision?,19
75,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The whole Committee as inwould support that course.,19
76,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think that the Senate would accept it, and the measure is too important to be wrecked.",19
77,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It will be wrecked if the original provision is not restored.,19
78,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then those to that responsible must take the blame.,19
79,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The responsibility for was wrecking the present proposal would not be very much. It is not worth the paper it is written on.,19

I share with him regret that any alteration has been made the measure. There are two proposal before us. In the first place, it does not empower the Commonwealth to deal with debts incurred by the States after we have exercised the power of taking point. over the present debts. As I read the amendment, if in 1907 the Commonwealth took over all the debts incurred up to that time, it would not have power to take any that might be incurred afterwards.",20
82,Sir GEORGE TURNER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The says that it would have the power.,20
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne sure on the point?,20
84,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am sure about nothing in law; but as I read the provision there is not much doubt about it . second place, the Bill , as amended, will not allow us to take over the debts of the States in a piece-meal fashion, choosing and picking with regard to the state of the market, and the bargain that we can make. It is to this second defect that I shall ask honourable members to devote their attention for a few minutes. Under the Bill as amended we must take over all the debts of the States at one swoop.",20
85,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Or proportionately.,20
86,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is true, but no Minister would think of taking over the debts in proportion to population, so that I put that proposal on one side as impracticable. The Treasurer has frankly announced that if he had to administer the measure as amended by the Senate he would take over all the debts at one swoop. Under the Bill as it left this Chamber, the Commonwealth might take over such debts or such portions of debts as it might choose. A great deal would depend on the state of the market, and the terms upon which a conversion - could be made.",20
87,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think that the intention was to take over all the of the States as they became due.,20
88,Mr HIGGTNS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Under the Bill as amended by the Senate, the Commonwealth interfere with those rights. statutecould take over the debts of the States only tnto flatu; it would not have power to take over one debt one year and another",20
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable to and learned member think that the Conthe stitution empowers the Commonwealth to in take over debts unless it is going to do defects in the something with them?,20
90,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not; but I am not going to hang my argument upon that I think that the intention was that the debts should be taken over only for the purpose of conversion or redemption. But I wish to steer a narrow course. The honourable member for North Sydney asked over very pertinently when the Treasurer was speaking, what is the meaning of ' ' take Treasurer over"" ? The expression is a loose one; it is neither technical nor accurate, but merely a debating expression which, as such, was thrust into the Constitution by the Convention. I feel convinced that it does not mean that we can compel bondholders to accept the Commonwealth as In the their debtor in place of a State. There could be no intention to compel bondholders to accept a new debtor. As I understand the Constitution, the words mean that the' Commonwealth puts itself under an obligation to the States to see that their debts are paid. To my mind, there is no need for the expression in section 3 05. What was really desired was to give the Commonwealth the power to convert, or to pay off, the debts of the States; to say to the creditors, "" Here is your money,"" or, "" Here is, our stock."" But as the words "" take over"" have been used we shall have to work out our scheme by adopting the principle of faking over only at the time of conversion.",20
91,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Coul d we not determine by legislation to take over the whole or a part of the debts of the States ?,20
92,Mr HIGGTNS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Of course, the bondholder might be got to agree to accept a new debtor.",20
93,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He would not come into the case; it would be an arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. Mr - HIGGINS - The Commonwealth and the States could not arrange matters debts between themselves without reference to the rights of the bond-holder.,20
94,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The' - would not seek to If the arrangement were made, the bond-holder would have both the States and the Commonwealth as a security.",20
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,So that he would get an advantage.,21
96,Sir GEORGE TURNER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In any case, he will receive only his principal and interest.",21
97,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I wish to accept the position, taking the words as they stand, and to put before the Committee as shortly as I can a view which I have held in reand gard to the subject for some years past. We should not take over any obligation unthe loan? less we get something for it . The Commonwealth should not back the bills of States unless it gets something for it. classes of considerations would induce bond-holders to agree to convert. In - first place, they would consider the fit that would be conferred upon them by having a large uniform stock fo longer term, and with a sinking fund vision in connection with it . The advanbond-holders tage of a large uniform stock in a market like London-stoc k which would cover, haps,, £250,000,000-mus t be apparent to any one acquainted with finance. Then there would be another consideration, namely, the Commonwealth backing, which would be 06 material advantage to the bond-holders, particularly in connection with the sales of stocks. If the Treasurer is coerced into accepting the proposal of Senate, we shall have to give our Commontunity Avealth backing to the bond-holders for nomonwealth 3^ per cent, stock. thing. After all, conversion is a mere exchange. In place of a certain piece property 'held by A , you give him a cereffected, tain other piece of property, but you not, before you agree to the exchange, crease the value of that which you give to A . ' If two boys are swopping tops, it is not expedient for one boy to improve the other boy's, top beseveral fore he makes the exchange. ought not to give away for nothing the Commonwealth guarantee in regard to States debts. I wish to present a concrete instance or two in order that I may make mv point quite clear. From the list of debts supplied to us in connection with Budget papers, I find that a Oueensland loan, amounting to £ri.72'8,8oo. falls in 1915. The loan carries 4 per cent., and the annual interest pavment amounts to £469,152. If that interest charge could lie reduced by I ner cent., we could Queensland £ 5 8 , 6 4 4 per annum.",21
98,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not if Queensland could obtain the money for herself at 3^ per cent.,21
99,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am assuming that we could induce the bond-holders to take 3^ per cent, instead of 4 per cent, bonds ar. par. Other things being equal, if - we could reduce the interest charge by \ per cent., we should save upon that Queensland loan £58^000 per annum.",21
100,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable learned member means that that saving would be effected during the currency of,21
101,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am coming to that the point. I am not shirking anything. The Two Joan referred to falls due in 1915. Suppose that when the loan was apthe proaching maturity, that is, in 1912, benewe could convert it . Those who have had more experience in finance will r a agree with me that it is by no means proimprobable that a large bcdy of the would be willing to convert three years before maturity. The advanpertage of obtaining bonds having a long term, a sinking fund, and the guarantee of the Commonwealth of Australia behind them, apart from the question of their forming portion of a large uniform stock, would attract a great many of a certain class of investors in London. Let us assume that in 1912 we could go into the the market and give the bond-holders an opporto exchange their bonds for ComI f the whole of the loan could be so converted, a of saving of £ 5 8 , 0 0 0 per annum would be and for the three years of the redo maining currency of the original loan the in - saving would amount to £175.932. I say with confidence that, although it is not likely that we could, a long time beforematurity, make a big conversion, we could,, years before due date, make. some;, We if not large, conversions.",21
102,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We might be the able to make one conversion today.,21
103,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . There are two classes of bond-holders. In the first place the there are the speculators who buy for a rise, and, in the second place, trustees and due so forth. There is a third class of investors who do not operate much at present in Australian bonds, namelv, men of business, who use consols for the purposes of save financing. Possiblv, we shall be able to induce some of these last investors to deal in our bonds when we can offer them a lar ge uniform stock. It appears to be assumed that, under no circumstances, could effect a conversion before the due date the loans. I join issue upon that point.",21
104,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member thinks we can effect partial converto sions.,22
105,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes ; and a partial conversion would still give us a great vantage in the reduction of interest.,22
106,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The bond-holders say, may say ""We shall wait because you will here already."" .have to come to us directly.""",22
107,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; but in connection with a loan of £11,000,000 , there may sage : be thousands of bond-holders. Some of these will, no doubt, say ""We shall wait,"" but those who hold the stock in trust for charities, or infants, and so forth, when wealth they see that the Queensland bonds are f a ing due in three years, and that they will - have to look out for some new investment, will perhaps say: "" We should like to wealth security. take even a lower percentage of interest respect 'to a stock backed by the best curity that Australia can offer, and ing a term of thirty years, with no power of redemption even after the thirty years has expired, except upon certain notice."" Honourable members will agree that a number of investors would prefer a large uniform stock for a long term, with a sinking fund, and the Commonthan wealth backing, to bonds of £ 1 0 0 at par, bearing 4 per cent., but with only three more years to' run.",22
108,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We might convert now.,22
109,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; there would no power to do that under the present posal.,22
110,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; there would, if we took over the debts.",22
111,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If , as the Treasurer cents. proposes, in the year 1907, the Commonmonwealth stock. wealth took over the whole of the debts, including the £11,000,000 to which I have referred, and in 1912 the Treasurer went into the market, and asked the bond-holders to convert their bonds falling due in 1915, they would say, "" Thank you for nothing. The Commonwealth brand is on our bonds already.""",22
112,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We contend 'that they will say that in any case.,22
113,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What would the position if we paid them off?,22
114,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable membrand ber has not followed my figures. I am speaking of a conversion in 1912, three we years before the bonds f all due. The of Treasurer could not pay off the bondholders in that year. Suppose that in 1912 the Treasurer wished to convert the loan which I have referred, and mentioned the Commonwealth backing as a consideration which should induce the bond-holders adto consent to the conversion, the latter would, if his present proposal be adopted, "" The Commonwealth backing is The Treasurer grasped this fact when he was in London. His memorandum contains the following pasThe financial authorities whom I consulted in London were unanimous in the opinion that it would be disadvantageous to place the Commonbrand on State stocks before conversion, as such action would prevent the possibility of l lany profitable conversion, and would be making to the existing holders a present of any increase in price caused by the additional Commonin What is the Commonwealth, brand? If seI may judge from what the Treasurer havhas stated in his memorandum, he thinks that it is the word ""Australia""-that unless we stamp ""Australian consols,"" or something similar, upon a bond, the Commonwealth brand is not upon it. May I suggest that there is more than one mode of branding stock, just as there is more one method of branding sheep. Let us suppose that the big investors in London-wh o are very well advised-kno w that Western Australian, Tasmanian, Victorian, and New South Wales bonds are all liabilities of the Commonwealth-that be the Commonwealth, by Act of Parliament, prohas incurred the obligation to pay those bonds-it will not matter .to them whether they are Victorian 4 per cents., Tasmanian 4^ per cents., or Western Australian 3 per They will know that they are Com",22
115,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They will be secured by the Commonwealth guarantee.,22
116,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"E x a c t l y . The Treasurer has stated that the Commonwealth brand is upon the States stocks at the present time. With all respect, I venture to dispute that statement. There is no legal obligation on the part of. the Commonwealth, and the point at issue is, "" Upon whom does the legal obligation rest? "" If be we agree to the amendment which has been inserted in this Bill by the Senate, the of the Commonwealth will be placed upon the States' stocks. The point which we have to consider is not what we may think, but what will be thought in London.",22
117,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The States' stocks are approaching uniformity at the present time.,23
118,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite true; at the same time, there are differences between the values of States stocks. The experience of years is that New South Wales bonds command a higher price than do Tasmanian bonds.",23
119,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are rapidly approaching an equality in value.,23
120,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am very glad to hear it . The Treasurer is perfectly right when he says that the Commonwealth backing will be better than any other backing. To my mind that is indisputable. We have to pay regard, not to what we know of these States-no t to the fact that they are perfectly solvent, but to what others maythink, and we have to caterfor. their opinion. After all, the value of our bonds is a matter of opinion, and we have to meet that opinion as far as possible. When the bond-holders in London know that the States stocks are to be backed by the whole Commonweaiith, .that provision has been made for the establishment of a sinking fund extending over a long term, and for the redemption of the loans after a certain period",23
121,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do not the bond-holders know that the Commonwealth guarantees the States debts now?,23
122,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . Neither do we know that. There is nothing in the Constitution which binds the Commonwealth to maintain the solvency of the States. Let me give still another instance. In 1920, a Tasmanian loan of £5,206,500, bearing interest at 3J per cent., will f all due. The annual interest charge upon that loan is £ 1 8 6 , 4 7 8 . If by any means the Commonwealth were able to secure areduction of only J per cent, in that rate of interest, it would mean a saving to Tasmania of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 per annum- a very material consideration. Fortunately. Tasmanian secuities at the present time are sound in the London market. But it should be recollected that we have passed through very severe crises, and that under present conditions there is no country in the world which is more liable to huge fluctuations than is Australia. The right honourable member for Balaclava had to steer Victoria through a most difficult period, and I recollect that he had to look closely at every item of expenditure in order to make ends meet. We all sincerely hope that we shall never again have to pass through such a severe crisis. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that we may have to undergo a similar experience. I have heard Tasmanians say with great emphasis that that State cannot stand the burden of taxation which is at present imposed upon it, owing to the loss which it has sustaine< in its Customs revenue. Now, let us sup pose that in 1912 the Common wealtl thought it expedient to attempt to conver. the Tasmanian loan to which I have referred, or as much of it as possible. Surelv lit would represent a great gain to that State if the Commonwealth could reduce the rate of interest by even h per cent. ? Assuming that we could not 'get all the bond-holders interested in the loan to exchange their bonds for Commonwealth stock, we might induce a majority of them to do so. Of course, we all recognise that bond-holders will not exchange their security unless they receive in return something which is as good in the open market. What they would get in return in the case which I am putting would be a longer term for the loan, a uniform stock, a sinking fund, and the backing of the Commonwealth. We might advertise in London that all bond-holders interested in the Tasmanian loan of £5,000,000 odd which will mature in 1920. who wished to exchange their stock for Commonwealth consols, bearing \ per cent, less interest for a longer term, might do so by application at the office of the High Commissioner before a certain time. That would be a most desirable result to bring about if we could accomplish it. But the Bill in the form in which it has been amended by the Senate would not permit us to do that.",23
123,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear.",23
124,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am very glad that the honourable member for South Sydney approves of what I am saying.,23
125,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I want the Bill as it left this House.,23
126,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can assure the Trea surer that if he would return the measure to the Senate in its original form, the members of that body would not be so unreasonable-whe n the position had been more fullv explained to them-as to deny him the power which he seeks. I am thoroughly in accord with the desire of the Minister to get the measure passed. But I wish to get a Bill which will be useful. I cannot see anything particularly urgent in the matter of obtaining power to take over the £31,000,000 worth of States debts which have been (incurred since 1900. We ought not to seek to amend the Constitution unless we have some very urgent and important reason for doing so. It is much more urgent that the Treasurer should be enabled to make use of the conditions of the money market, and to operate whenever he finds a suitable time for converting.",23
127,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,U n d e r the would he not have power to convert those millions next year?,24
128,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . we take over-as he now proposes-al l the debts existing in 1907, when he wishes to convert them in 1912, the bond-holders will say, "" No, thank you. We have your obligation to pay already. you and not to Tasmania.""",24
129,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We should have to pass an Act of Parliament, and that would make the whole matter public property. Nothing of this kind can be kept secret, as legislation is necessary.",24
130,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no occasion for an Act of Parliament to be passed specifying that any particular loan is to be taken over. Then I find that in 1916 South Australia has a loan of £ 8 , 6 4 6 , 5 4 5 , bearing interest at 3A"" per cent., falling due. The annual interest charge upon that loan is nearly £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Commonwealth were able to reduce the rate of interest chargeable upon, it by \ per cent., it would relieve South Australia of the payment of about £ 3 9 , 0 0 0 annually. My point, therefore, is that we must not take over the debts before conversion, because the mere act of taking them over will give them the Commonwealth hacking. We should never back the States bills unless we can secure better terms-unles s we can sav to the bond-holders, "" If you wish to secure the Commonwealth backing we will give it to you, but it must be upon our terms."" If we do what the Treasurer proposes we shall be giving the Commonwealth backing to the States debts for nothing. He proposes that an Act shall be passed authorizing the taking over of the whole of the States debts on a date to be named in. such Act. That means a Jiolus bolus taking over of the debts. ther proposes that from the date named the Commonwealth shall become liable to the bond-holders for the annual payment of interest and sinking fund, as well as for the redemption of the debts on maturity. The honourable member for North Sydney saw the weakness of those proposals at once, and inquired how the Commonwealth would be liable. I think that the Treasurer means that the Commonwealth should become responsible to the States for the payment of their interest charges, as well as for the redemption of the principal when it falls due.",24
131,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that Bill, the words of the Treasurer were that the Commonwealth would become "" solely liable to the bond-holders."" Assuming that",24
132,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What is to be done in these circumstances? The only proposal made by another place is that, in addition to the power to take over at the one operaWe look to tion £202,000,000 , we should be at liberty to take over the debts, amounting to £31,000,000 , incurred since Federation. What is the urgency so far as the transfer of the last named debts are concerned? We shall gain nothing. If the Minister caused the Bil l to be restored to the form in which it left this Chamber for another place, we should have power, when the state of the market permitted, to take over loans, or such parts of loans, as we saw fit. In that event, some gain would be secured. My desire is that the Treasurer shall have a free hand. I have great confidence in his skill, and his capacity to deal If the with these matters. The closeness of the attention that he has given to them has provoked nothing but admiration from all sides. In order, however, to secure the passing of the Bill this session he is prepared to jettison the whole of the valuable cargo. If the Bill does not give us power to deal with each loan, and each part of the loan, it wilt be of no value.",24
133,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will it not give that power?,24
134,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . Under the Bill, as amended, by the Senate, the Treasurer has power merelv to take over £233,000,000, instead of £202,000,000. I am in favour of the Commonwealth Parliament having power to take over the whole of the debts, but, at the same time, I do not think anything would be gained from the exercise of that He fur- power. I do not like the idea of our giving, for nothing, this Commonwealth backing. If we give up this backing, we shall give up, for nothing, several millions of pounds. Everything will depend on the state of the market, and the tendency in London is for interest rates on stocks to fall. As funds come in from abroad, and wealth accumulates there, the tendency is for interest rates to f all.",24
135,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Man v think that interest is likely to rise.,25
136,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be just now; I am dealing not with the present, but with what is likelv to happen during fifty; .years. I repeat that there is no urgency as to the taking over of the debts, l f we could secure our object, whilst at same time considering, as far as possible, the wishes of another place, we ought to do so. The amendment made by the Senate seems to me to be due to some theory of the niceities of drafting rather than ""to knowledge of financial matters in London and Australia. At the same time, I should not object to the adoption of the phraseoargument; logy of another place if , by that means, we were able to secure the passing of Bill substantially as it left this Chamber. I would therefore suggest that the wording of the amendment made by another place should be left as it stands, but that should add to it the wordsiind to any part of the debts incurred, whether before or after such establishment, and without regard to the proportions prescribed by section 105 of the Constitution. The amendment, as it stands, provides that the powers of the Parliament relating to the public debts of the States shall extend to debts incurred since ment of the Commonwealth, and to these words, I would add those I have just read.",25
137,Sir GEORGE TURNER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Would not the honourable and learned member substitute for the word ""since"" the words "" at time after "" ?",25
138,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should have no obportant jection, but I do not wish wording of the amendment, unless it is absolutely essential to do so. My proposal simply means the addition of certain words Alinister. to the amendment; but it has been suggested to me that we should omit the word "" since."" and insert the words "" at anv after."" The provision would then readThe powers of the Parliament relating to the public debts of the States shall extend incurred at any time after the establishment the Commonwealth. That would still leave the proportions-prethe scribed.",25
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would still leave over the debts until the proportions fixed under the ConstituHe tion.,25

141,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not wedded to any particular words. My only desire is to deal with the substance of the Bill . I shall look into this matter very carefully, and later on, unless an amendment is proposed by another honourable member, I shall the next submit one to the Committee.",25

I am also surprised that the Treasurer should have displayed so much irritation a when some pertinent questions were put to him f.rom this side of the Chamber. We had no desire to break the thread of his we simply wished to secure information which, at the moment, he apthe peared to be failing to give. Honourable members generally will admit that the financial proposals of the Government have been approached from an entirely nonwe party stand-point. Every effort has been .made by honourable members sitting in all parts of the House to assist the Treasurer in discharging the very difficult duty allotted to him, and it certainly would be unfair to say that the criticism applied to the proposals of the Government has a party complexion. The discussion of the question in this House has, so far, been carried on upon the establishnon-party lines.",25

145,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is time so. The Minister today has been combating every argument that he put before us when he first submitted his proposals. If to debts there was one point upon which he was of clear at that time, it was that, according to his view, and to the view of most expert financial authorities of 'Great Britain, we should not take they fell due. pointed out that, unless we adopted that course, the bond-holders alone would reap the advantage of the transfer of the debts to the Commonwealth; that, if we sought to convert the States debts into Commonwealth stock before they fell due, we should run the risk of losing the profit which might otherwise be secured. right honourable gentleman now departs absolutely from the wise attitude which he then took up, and urges us to agree to the adoption of a system'which he himself has declared to be faulty. A proposal to amend the Constitution is one that should not be lightly discussed, and we should not appeal to the people in regard to any of these questions unless we have good reason for doing so. As the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said, it is most unwise that, for the sake of securing the slight extension of our constitutional powers which the adoption of the Bill , as amended, would give, we should disturb the whole Commonwealth by taking a referendum. It is unreasonable that we should seek a referendum concerning a proposal which, if adopted, would still leave our powers, in this regard, almost as ineffective as they are today.",25

175,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Can this for the payments made. Parliament take from the bond-holders of the States their claims upon the States?,27
176,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not to say that; but section 105 of the Constitution enacts that the Commonwealth must pav the interest.,27
177,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Commonwealth cannot become solely responsible to the bond-holders of the States without their consent. If the Commonwealth comes responsible at all, both it and the States concerned will be responsible.",27
178,Sir TOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I see the honourable member's point; but there is nothing in,27
179,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Commonwealth accepts responsibility, it will mean that during the currency of many of the present State loans-for a period of ten, fifteen, twenty, or thirty years-the bond-holders will have a double security, that of the States and that of the Comas section monwealth.",27
180,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Commonwealth will not be under any obligation to the bondholders, unless it assumes an obligation.",27
181,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At present it is under no obligation; but it can assume an obligation. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has pointed out what, in my opinion, is a fact: that after bond-holders have, for ten. twenty, or thirty years, enjoyed the security of the Commonwealth as well as of the States, they will have become accustomed to it, and, upon a Commonwealth loan being issued, will not be prepared to give worth more for at, seeing that they will then be offered only the Commonwealth security, instead of the Commonwealth and the State security. The attitude taken by the public in matters of this kind is largely one of development. They get accustomed to a certain state of things.",27
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that legally they will have the security of the Attorney- Mr DUGALD THOMSON - The States will continue to be liable.,27
183,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not legally, under the Constitution. I stand by the law.",27
184,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is perfectly evident that we cannot take awav the bond-holder his claim on the State, from though he can surrender it .",27
185,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Constitution says that the Commonwealth must pay interest, and deduct it from the revenues of the States, which have to indemnify us",27
186,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a provision for something which will take prepared place after a conversion.,27
187,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not see anything in the honourable member's quibble. Let us get on with the business.,27
188,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Nothin g in it ! It affects the whole proposal. The Treasurer's attitude is most extraordinary. beI am discussing an important part of this provision, and he says, "" There is nothing in it. Let us get on with the business."" The important advantages to be gained by it . establishing a Commonwealth stock are two. In the first place, one large consolidated stock takes the place of a variety of States stocks, and the public will be more ready to invest in such a stock; while, in the second place, the investor has, as a securitv, the solvency of the whole Commonwealth instead of that of a part. ing any conversion, those tendering for the loan are aware of these advantages. If they take up Commonwealth stock, they get a consolidated stock, and have the security of the whole Commonwealth, instead of that of a part. But if , prior to conversion, and during the currency of an existing debt, they are given, in addition to the security of a State, the security of the Commonwealth, they get accustomed to it , and when the conversion takes place, one of the inducements for offering a higher price for Commonwealth stock is wanting, and part of the effect which we desire to produce by conversion is lost. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that the use of the words ""take over"" in section 105 of the Constitution, is rather unfortunate. dcubt whether, without conversion, we can ""take over"" to satisfy the terms of the Constitution. We have to take over the liability to the bond-holder.",27
189,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How could we convert without his consent?,28
190,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We could convert without his consent when the debts fell due; but his consent would be necessary to ai conversion during the currency of the* debt.,28
191,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member thinks that ""the Commonwealth cannot take over the debts until it can convert them.",28
192,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not certain' that it can literally. Of course, it can do anything with, the consent of the bond-holders.",28
193,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is not pressing this point as an obstacle.,28
194,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It difficulty created by the amendment of the Senate. Under the original provision we could convert as the debts fell due with the out regard to proportion : but conversion becomes practically impossible when progiving portion is renuired.,28
195,Sir TOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We need not take a proportion : we can take the whole.,28
196,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It will become practically impossible to convert the debts fall due if the amendment of Senate is accepted. I am inclined to that the words ""take over,"" in the Constitution, refer to a conversion.",28
197,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If so, how could the Commonwealth take over a proportion ?",28
198,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that it could not. In mak- Mr HARPER - The words apply in both instances, which show that they do not refer to conversion.",28
199,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am inclined to think that my interpretation is the correct one; but I do not press it absolutely. However, the Senate's provision makes impossible the (conversion of Ihe debts as they f all due.",28
200,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not if we take over all the debts at once. The intention is by an Act of the Federal Parliament to take over the whole of the States debts on a date to-be named. We will then have complete control over the debts, and will occupy in relation to the bond-holders the exact position previously occupied by the States, and will have sole control of I all operations for conversion before maturing-wit h the .consent of the bond-holders --o r redemption at maturing as may be thought fit.",28
201,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No doubt, the Senate's amendment was made to prevent - any State receiving undue favour. Suppose that next year a Victorian loan amounting to £4,000,00 0 or £5.000,000 falls due. The Commonwealth says, "" We will convert that loan, and relieve Victoria to that extent."" Then, in the following year, when a loan contracted by Tasmania or Western Australia fell due, it should not be able to say, "" In the present condition of the London market Ave are not prepared to undertake to convert this loan; Ave will leave it to the State."" That is the intention underlying the provision in the Bill as amended by the Senate, making it necessary for the CommonAvealth to take over the States is a debts proportionately.",28
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is, if you do not take over the Avhole of the debts, and intention, is to take over the Avhole.",28
203,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am a reason why the Senate probably inserted the amendment. If the Avhole of the debts are not taken over, the responsibility in connection with them is to be assumed in a proportionate amount, withas out discrimination as between State and the State. Of course, that is impossible in think practice. Honourable members Avho say that "" take over"" must mean a certain thing, because anything else is impossible, are in a difficulty, because the Senate the phrase "" take over,"" and makes an impossible proposition, namely, that the debts, if converted as they f all due, must be taken over proportionately. When we alter the Constitution, we should amend it to make it as effective as possible in the interests of the States and_ of the Commonwealth. There are a sufficient number of difficulties in the wav. without our adding to them. We desire to remove the difficulties, and to make everything as simple and as easy as possible, not for the benefit of the Commonwealth only, but for that of the States as well. If it is not for the benefit of the States that their debts should be transferred, - there is no necessity for the provision in the Constitution. If it would be of advantage to the States to have their debts transferred to the Commonwealth, the easier and simpler we can make the process of transfer the better. It is now proposed to put before the people, not a complete and effective proposal, but one that will be hampering to the same extent as the present provision in the Constitution, except only as regards £33,000,000. We ought not to attempt to submit a question of such importance to the electors in an incomplete form. Rather than do that, I would send the .Bill back to the Senate in the hope that a reasonable alteration might be secured. If we could not induce the Senate to look at matters from our point of view, it would be better to refer the whole question to the people by special referendum after both. Houses had been able to agree to an effective provision.",28
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The proposed amendment will merely extend the power conferred upon us at present.,29
205,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . Rather than refer this very faulty proposal to the people, we should endeavour to embody in the Constitution a provision similar to that foreshadowed by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. I agree with honourable members who say that the word "" since "" should be removed from the amendment. If it is retained, it will have the effect of providing that the present powers of the Commonwealth in regard to the States debts shall be extended only to the debts incurred between the establishment of the Commonwealth and the present time. The Minister admits that the true meaning leaves of the word is a matter of opinion.",29
206,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think it is all right in the place it now occupies.,29
207,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that we should be certain as to the meaning of the terms used before making an appeal to the people. We should appear very ridiculous if , after the people had acceded to our request, it was found that the provision made was not sufficient for our purposes.",29
208,Mr HIGGINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,""" A stitch in time saves nine.""",29
209,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What is the difference between ""since"" and "" a f t e r "" ?",29
210,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The word ""since"" means from the establishment of the Commonwealth until the present time "" ; "" at any time after"" means at any time after, whether before now or after now. The word ""since"" applies to something that has taken place after some event, but before the period at which the word is used. I think that the attitude assumed by the Treasurer in the first instance was the proper one. He gave us the strongest reasons for taking a position in which he had the support of a number of financial authorities in London. I think that he has made an extraordinaryand unfortunate departure in asking us to accept something which he previously declared to be faulty and undesirable. I admit that towards the close of a session a good deal has to be done in the way of compromise, but in a matter that is to.be referred to the whole people we ought not to accept terms which will not enable us to deal with it in what we conceive to be the best manner. This is too big a question to be trifled with, and rather than support a compromise such as that now proposed, I.would prefer to postpone the whole matter until we can arrive at a more reasonable conclusion, and obtain from the people a more thorough and effective means of meeting the requirements of the Commonwealth. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [4.401 - I was amazed to hear the Treasurer, who cheered me through my speech upon the Budget, make such a complete surrender as he has done upon this imnortant ouestion. On the former occasion he was very firm in his determination not to make a free g if t to the bond-holders of the advantage arising from the Commonwealth guarantee, but to secure any benelits or profits that might arise from the conversion of the States debts for the taxpayers of Australia wbo have to pay the interest. Now he seems to be thoroughly scared, and' prepared to take anything he can get, so long as a referendum is arranged for. I think that it would be detrimental to the-interests of the taxpayers of Australia to adopt the proposal made by the Senate. We have to consider the taxpayers who earn the money to pay the interest on our debts, rather than those who hold our bonds after having received a good bonus for accepting them. If we are empowered to take over the whole of the States debts, and they are transferred to us, we shall, long before the time for conversion arrives, practically attach to all the loans1 the Commonwealth guarantee. who asks you to back a promissory note tells you that it is only a matter of form, but on many occasions I have had to pay up six or seven months after having attached my signature. If this is only a matter of form, why should we bother about the States debts at all? The moment we take over the debts the Commonwealth guarantee will be behind them, and, as the honourable member for North Sydney has suggested, the bond-holders will sneer at us when we ask them to consent to a conversion. The Commonwealth would be tied hand and foot, whereas the bond-holders need not negotiate with it. I am firmly of opinion that the moment the Commonwealth takes over these debts, or is empowered to take them over, it will be found that the bond-holders will not negotiate with us. They can continue to .negotiate with the States if the latter will give them better terms, and still the Commonwealth guarantee will be behind the debts for all time.",29
211,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And it ought to be.,30
212,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not deny that, but I hope that the honourable member will not give the European bondwealth. holders cause to think that this House is composed of fools. I am perfectly willing that the Commonwealth should guarantee the States debts, but I want to secure for the States the advantage of any appreopinion ciation in the value of their bonds as the result of the operation.",30
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But we shall have pay only the face value of the bonds.,30
214,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Commonwealth guarantee were not behind the debts of the States, the former would be able to go into the open market and purchase State bonds when money was cheap, handing over the savings thus effected to the States. But the moment the Commonwealth backing is behind the debts, the position will be similar to the guarantee of Rockefeller behind an ordinary individual. The bond-holder will not then be in a hurry to convert. What I desire to know from (he Treasurer is how he is going to effect the saving which he anticipates in the interest charges?",30
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Commonwealth will be able to borrow money cheaper than the States can upon the maturity of the loans.,30
216,Mr KING,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"O ' MALLEY - Let us supThe man pose that a bond-holder has £10,000,000 invested in Australia, upon which he is receiving 3^ per. cent, interest from the States. If the Commonwealth guarantee be given for the payment of that amount, is the bond-holder bound to accept 3 per cent, interest from us? Can he not say to the State, "" I intend to have either 3't per cent, or the cash-"" ?",30
217,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No . We would pay him off when the loan matured.,30
218,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A r e we not bound to give him 3J per cent, if he wants it?",30
219,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; we can pay him off.,30
220,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the Treasurer say that the guarantee of the Commonwealth is not behind the States debts from the day that we take them over ?,30
221,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that our guarantee will increase the value of their bonds very much until they have the Commonwealth designation.,30
222,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,To whom will the bond-holder look for payment?,30
223,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,To the Common,30
224,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the State be relieved from all responsibility?,30
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think so.,30
226,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am of that the Treasurer is labouring under a terrible delusion. The Senate has amended this Bil l in such a way that I to should like the Treasurer to explain how the Commonwealth could take over a Tasmanian loan of £1,000,000 if there were no loans falling due in the other States?",30
227,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is only if we not take over the whole of the States debts that we must fake over a proportional part of the debts of each State.,31
228,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am opand posed to taking over the whole of the debts. I want to be able to deal with this quesThe tion in the same way that private business men deal in their daily transactions. have no love for the bond-holder. He has the best advisers in the world when he negotiating, and he has the States at his mercy. I well remember an occasion, many years ago, when Canada was floating loan in London. I went to one of the principal investors there, and he said me, "" Hold back for a day or two, and shall force the Treasurer to raise the rate of interest by J per cent."" We did hold work out an effective scheme. back, and the late Sir John Macdonald, from fear that his loan might fail, raised interest by \ per cent. My whole heart goes out, not to the bond-holder, but to man who earns the money with which pay the interest. I warn the Treasurer that he will have to face angry electors he persists in the course which he is now pursuing. The honourable member for it. North Sydney has very properly asked, why should we amend the Constitution merely for the purpose of empowering us to take over the whole of the States debts? less an amendment be introduced into the Bill , under which the Treasurer will power to negotiate and to take advantage of the fluctuations of the for the benefit of the taxpayers, I shall vote against it.",31
229,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kooyong) [4-57-]-- I think that the question ot the transfer of States debts to the Commonwealth is into which it is unnecessary to import any partu feeling whatever. It is very able that every section of the House should listen dispassionately to any suggestions which may be submitted with a view to solving this intricate problem. The Treaa surer has himself to blame for the sive character of this debate. In the course of his remarks, he introduced quite a numlaw. ber of subjects which were unnecessary to its proper consideration.",31
230,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It takes a lot reasons to explain a ""climb down.""",31
231,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the right honourable gentleman might have dealt the subject from the broad stand-point the reasons which have induced him to recede from the position which he formerly do took up. Upon the motion for the second .reading of the Bill I pointed out that we were surrendering a very great. safeguard which was conferred by the Constitution, which prevented any partiality being exhibited towards any individual State. Treasurer interjected that there wasnothing in my contention, and proceeded to I urge reasons why the Bill should be accepted in the form in which it was subis mitted. I feel that many of the difficulties which have been experienced in dealing with this matter are directly due to the a limitations imposed by the Constitution. But the time has arrived when this great to problem should be satisfactorily solved. we The time has arrived when we must' appeal to the people to give us the power to I regret very much that this Bill should have been the amended in this way by another place, and rather than that an incomplete proposal the should be submitted to the people- a proto posed amendment of the Constitution which would not satisfactorily remove the if restrictions by which we are beset in dealing with this question- I shall vote against A Conference of States Premiers is to be held in Melbourne next week, ancl possibly, as the outcome of it, a satisfactory arrangement may be arrived at beUntween the States and the Commonwealth. If we ask the people to grant an amendhave ment of the Constitution which will stilT limit our power to deal with this question, money market we shall fool them.",31

233,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I . object to the extraordithe nary attitude taken up by the Treasurer, one who holds that the Commonwealth should at once take over the debts of the States, desirand that the individual States would thereupon be relieved of all responsibility in regard to themI cannot imagine how my right honourable friend can justify such proposal, except by some mental jugglery discurto which he is< usually a stranger.",31

235,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We might go so far as to 'sav that the Commonwealth Parliament of could pass a law by which it repudiated the debts, or that a State Parliament might do so. But I cannot imagine why the right with honourable gentleman should support such of an extravagant proposal.",31
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable gentleman should read Quick and Garran on this question.,32
237,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am taking a commonof sense view of this phase of the question.,32
238,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And I dealt with from the legal stand-point.,32
239,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the right honourable gentleman think .that the Attorney-General would support his view?,32
240,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He would say what I have said.,32
241,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I trust that he will be induced to speak to the question. We should make ourselves ridiculous in Great Britain if we proposed by an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament,32
242,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,An Act 06 the I m perial Parliament.,32
243,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is ridiculous to suppose that by an alteration of the Constitution we are going to alter the relations between the holders of the bonds and those who have issued them.,32
244,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"So long bond-holder is paid, what does it matter if the relations are altered?",32
245,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A contract was entered into with him, and if we altered it in any way",32
246,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We should not do so.,32

250,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,32
251,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In other words, we should release the States. My own view is that if the Commonwealth proposes to accept responsibility for the debts, it cannot, without the consent of each individual bond-holder, place the holders of those stdtks in a new position.",32
252,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite right, too. That is the basis of all contracts.",32
253,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Treasurer, in suggesting that it is possible for the Commonwealth Parliament to interfere with_ any such contract, has enunciated a. highly dangerous doctrine.",32

255,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"T t is absurd that any heat should be imported into this debate. We all have only one object in view, and are expressing our honest convictions as to the best course to be adopted. My desire is that we shall secure such an amendment the Constitution as will enable us to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the States it debts question. ,1 maintain, as I have done before, that the restrictions placed upon us by the framers of the Constitution are such as to make it very difficult to arrive at a satisfactory arrangement.",32
256,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was an oversight.,32
257,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. I think that the framers of the Constitution were under the impression that one of the first acts of the Parliament would be to take over the States debts existing at the establishment of the Federation. I hardly think they believed that we should allow six years to elapse before attempting to do so. They recognised that one of the principal objects of the Union was the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth, and they believed that we should speedily address ourselves to this important matter. Instead of doing so, however, we have as the been dealing with a number of minor questions, and allowing that which needs to be dealt with by capable and experienced men to remain in the background. Another suggestion made by the Treasurer was that the word "" since"" in the Senate's amendment could be read as meaning "" at any future time."" He held that, under the amendment, if we took over the debts now existing, we should have power twentv should yeajT9 hence to take over the debts then since incurred. Surely, that is a construction which nine out of ten persons would not place on the word. Why quibble over a word?",32
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who has been quibbling ?,32
259,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The right honourable gentleman has been unusually petulant this afternoon. If there is any doubt about the desirableness of using this word, why should we not substitute for it one that will not impose limitations?",32
260,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not object.,32
261,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Our desire is to submit to the people a proposed amendment of the Constitution which the humblest and least informed can understand. I shall feel that constrained to support such an amendment of the Senate's amendment as will enable us to deal with the debts either in part or as a whole. I trust that the Committee will decline to accept the amendment made by another place. The difference of opinion existing between the States Governments, as well as between the two Houses of Ithe Commonwealth Parliament, only tends to confirm my view that we need, as I suggested two years ago, to appoint a competent experienced body to deal with these matters. Had my proposal been carried out, much of the present difficulty would have been avoided. The Committee which I suggest should be appointed would assist the Parliament to frame a scheme that would be in the interests alike of the States and the Commonwealth. I fai l to see why there should be any difficulty in dealing with a matter in which every one is equally interested. The Commonwealth will not secure anv substantial gain by taking over debts of the States; the themselves will benefit by the transfer. The suggestion which has emanated from some quarters that only the Commonwealth will gain is, I think, a false one. I hope that the Committee will see that, whatever proposal is put before the electors, it is equivocal and plain, and, if acted upon, will be effective. In the provision coming from the other Chamber, there are limitations which I think will prevent the satisfactory solution of the great question before us, which deserves serious attention, and ought to be dealt with without further delay.",32
262,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mernda) [5.17] - It must be admitted that the debate has ranged over a considerable field, and that a good deal of what has been said would have been relevant in a discussion as to the particular means to be .adopted in settling the details of the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. But the immediate question before ns is an amendment made in the Bill by the Senate. I join with other honourable members in regretting that this alteration has been made. In my opinion, honourable senators might well have accepted the view which we put before them. Personally, I am convinced that no practical method p f taking over the debts will be found until we determine to take over the whole of them. A study of the question has made it apparent that no means excluding the taking over of any portion of the debts of the States will be found practicable. We have heard a good deal about, a difficulty in connection with the taking over of the debts arising from the value which it is assumed will be given to the States stock when it becomes known that the 'Commonwealth intends to convert. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne spoke very strongly on that point; but I think that he was in error. I cannot see how the Commonwealth can suffer if it determines to take over the debts of the States as they fall due, or earlier, as circumstances may dictate. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we determined to exercise the power given to us by the Constitution. Immediately we took over £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £10,000,000 of debts, it would be known in England that we must take over the whole of them. But that knowledge would not cause us to lose anything in connexiton with the transaction. the The honourable and learned gentleman furStates ther pointed out that our hands are tied in this matter, that the taking over provided for in the Constitution practically means that we cannot take over until we are prepared to convert, and that if we cannot convert we cannot take over. How would un- it be possible to deal practically with the debts of the States if that were so? Victoria has a loan of £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 falling due next year. Although we might have determined to take over the debts of the States as they fell due, that State might nevertherless be uncertain as to whether that debt would be taken over, and would have to make arrangements to meet the contingency of the Commonwealth not taking it over. In dealing with the subject in detail, the fears which possess some honourable members' minds are seen to be groundless. If the Commonwealth determined to take over the whole of the debts of the States, and made itself responsible at once for the payment of interest, neither it nor the States would lose a shilling. Those who have advanced money - to the States are quite content with the security which they possess.",33
263,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But if the .Commonwealth made itself responsible for the debts of the States, it would improve that security.",33
264,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If a security is as good as it can be, it cannot be improved by adding another security to it . A bond-holder would not accept 3J per cent., or even £ 3 19s. 9d. per cent., in exchange for a 4 per cent, bond merely to get the additional security.",33
265,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If there is no d if ference in securities, why can the United States borrow money at 2 per cent. ?",33
266,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At what discount? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The stocks are at a premium of 112. As a matter of fact, they return only if per cent, to buyers.",33

Loans which are at a premium tend as the period of their redemption approaches ; so that a loan which, ten years it Mr.'HARPER - No hence, might have stood at £110, might be even slightly below par within two or three years of its due date. All that would happen if we determined to take over the whole of the debts of them. the States would be that the Commonwealth would be in a position to arrange meet these debts as they fall due, either by redeeming them in cash or by offering sols. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honourable member for Bland overlooked the fact that There should be no delay. if States stocks rose in value, Commonlutely wealth consols would do so, too. The better the Australian credit, the higher would the price of our consols, and the .take over the whole of the debts. nearer they were to par, the more satisconvinced factory would be our arrangements. I could discuss some of the other that have been raised today, but I do not think it is necessary to do so.

Even if we obtained the ipower that we are seeking, it would not follow that we should be tied down to any particular mode of using it. We desire to secure a permissive right, and leave the next Parliament to deal with the details of the question as they may think best in the public interest. In order to meet the views of honourable members who think that we ought to have greater latitude than is afforded us by that part of section 105, which deals with the taking over of a portion of the States debts, and which every one agrees is absolutely unworkable, I propose that we should omit the on word "" since,"" and substitute the words "" at any time after.""

276,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"South Sydney) L-5-36.]--This is not the first time that certain means have been devised to enable the Government to climb down. certain that if the honourable member for Mernda had been the Treasurer upon this occasion the discussion which we have heard this afternoon would not have assumed such proportions' as it has. The honourable member has taken a business-like view the wholte question. He has given special study, and has brought exceptional abilitv to bear upon it . He knows what is he is speaking about, and has put the tion very succinctly before us. Honourable members on this side of the Chamber have frequently been accused of factious oppothe sition ; but when this measure was first brought down we had the spectacle preorable sented us-n o doubt a very surprising for honourable members on the Treasury ment benches-of an almost united Opposition rallying to the support of the Government in respect of a definite proposal for settlement of one of the most troublesome questions with which we have had to deal. By the aid of that support the Government were able to pass the Bill through this House with the full statutory majority. Then the measure was transmitted to the Senate, and altered in such a way that only members of the Opposition, but the majority.of honourable members on the Goner vernment benches, including the Treasurer, considered that the powers deemed to be requisite in dealing with this great financial problem would be seriously diminished. The Treasurer, in his introwere ductory remarks upon the Senate's amend of ment, expressed the deepest that it had been made; but at the be same time indicated that he was preto pared to agree to it . Very little inducebeen ment is offered to indenendent oppositionists to rally to the support of the Government on a 'great measure of national importance, when Ministers prove so weak as to give wav before the first breath of opposition, and make not the slightest effort to carry out their original intention.",34
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable memobject ber is not aware of all the difficulties which we have had to contend.,35
278,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"T am as well aware of them as is the Treasurer. Icow also that much greater difficulty would be experienced if we accepted the amendperly ment, proposed by the Senate. It would be like breaking a fly upon a wheel to submit the proposed amendment to the electors. It would be ridiculous to bring the whole machinery of the referendum into I feel operation in order to secure an amendment of the Constitution which would confer upon the Government of the Commonwealth very little more power than they already possess. I shall certainly not assist Ministers to obtain the assent of the statutory majority of to the amendment proposed by the Senate, it because I am firmly convinced' tjhat the consolidation of the States debts not to be satisfactorily accomquesplished unless we have a wider measure of power, and a greater sphere of operations than is provided for under Constitution. I am prepared to support the amendments proposed by the honmember for Mernda; but it would one have been much simpler for the Governto stand by their original Bill . In endeavouring to solve the difficulties connected with the States debts question one the business man after another, one trained financier after another, has been defeated by the anomalous position of the equation placed before him. No solution has been suggested that would come within the four corners of the Constitution. The conclusion unanimously arrived at is that somenot thing will have to give way before this question can be dealt with in such a. manas to avoid giving rise to serious trouble or inflicting injustice upon some of the States. We were told that the whole cost of Federation would be met by the saving of interest effected when the States debts consolidated. And although the cost Federation now amounts to something regret more than was anticipated, we should still able to save a sum more than equivalent the extra burden of expenditure that has imposed upon the people. When we came face to face with the question of effecting this saving, it was clearly demonstrated that we must have larger powers. After looking into this question, I have arrived at the conclusion that the consolidation of the debts should form one of a vast number of financial operations which will have to be, carried out with the one. of settling the financial relations of with the States and the Commonwealth. Among these will be the taking over. of the Northern Territory, and, possibly, the conI struction of the transcontinental railwaya work which the Treasurer, and very proso, has so much at heart. This is one of the works that I should like to see carried out, but in the present financiat muddle we can hardly approach the consideration of it. If we want to do anything of a practical character we must deal with the whole of the financial problems which immediately confront us, and make each of them a factor in the equation. is necessary that the Commonwealth should have not only the fullest powers with regard to the taking over of the States debts, but that it should be in a position to secure all the financial advantages derivable from the taking over of any part of the debts of a State without reference to other States. That is to say that if it be possible for the Commonwealth to effect a saving by taking over a portion of the debt of Victoria, it should not wait until it could take over a similar portion of the debt of every other State. We ought to empower the Treasurer to buy a single £.100 bond of any State whenever he thinks it will be to the advantage of that State and of the Commonwealth to do so. The Bill in the form in which it left this Chamber clothed the Treasurer with ample power in this connection. But in the Senate it has been emasculated, and the power which it was proposed to vest in him has been very much restricted. Under the amendment of the other Chamber the power conferred upon him is insufficient to accomplish anything. If it be said that its object is to safeguard States rights, my answer is that it is inconceivable that any Government or any Treasurer would consent to operate in such a way as to inflict injustice upon any State. We need to vest the Treasurer with the widest power to enable him to deal with this intricate problem. If the Government do not adhere to the Bill in its original form, I shall not assist them to obtain the statutory majority necessary to insure its passing. The amendment of .the honourable member for Mernda fully meets all the objections which I have urged. In effect, it brings us back to the position that we oc cupied when the Bill left this Chamber. If the Government do not adopt the straightforward course of returning the measure to the Senate in its original form, I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda. Though I believe that he is acting in the interests of the Government, he is the one honourable member above all others to whom we may fairly look for some light in dealing with'-a complicated question of this kind. I am glad that .he has evolved an amendment which will enable the Government to escape from the false position which they have taken up. Mr C. B. Edwards.",35
279,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [5.50] - I quite agree with the honourable member for South Sydney that it is necessary to vest It t'he Treasurer with large powers to enable him to deal satisfactorily with this question. I am clearly of opinion that when the Commonwealth takes over the State debts it must assume . responsibility for t'he whole of them. Further, I hold that for some time after the debts have been taken over, there should be a settled policy, so far as the borrowings of the States are concerned. If the Commonwealth assumes the whole responsibility of the States debts at a period to be specified in an Act passed by this Parliament, the States Governments ought to agree not to borrow upon any outside market for a period of years. Some condition of that sort seems to be an absolute necessity. But we have not yet arrived at that stage. The question immediately under consideration is the possibility of altering the Constitution to enable a future Parliament to legislate for the taking over of the whole of the States debts. I trust that the Government have not deferred action in this matter until it is too late. If they 'have, the responsibility will rest primarily upon them, because this is a matter with wlhich honourable members are exceedingly anxious to deal. I should now like to address myself for a few moments to those who believe that if the Commonwealth takes over the whole of the States debts, it! will by its act confer a large benefit upon the bond-holders. In my opinion that idea is an erroneous one. I have heard no argument wlhich would tend to show that any considerable appreciation in the value of those stocks would result. It has been urged that if the Commonwealth security were at a premium, the Commonwealth Government might be able to negotiate for the purchase of State 1 bonds at a price between that at which the Commonwealth security stood and that at which the States securities stood. But, as I pointed out upon"" a previous occasion, tihe States of the Commonwealth are six members of one family, each of whom have first-class securities. If they enter into a combination for a specific purpose, and have only one security, that security will not possess advantages other than those which are represented by the amalgamation of their several securities. The advantage derived would be due to the one denomination of their bonds. Undoubtedly that will prove a great advantage.",36
280,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In ten or twenty years it will make a Jot of difference.,37
281,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . It has been contended by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that the securities of some of the States possess a greater value than those of others. I interjected at the time that one of the happiest features of Australian securities is that they are all good. But since the establishment of the Federation the financiers in the old country, without making any noise about it, have been making those securities approximate more nearly to an equal value. beginning to recognise that they are Australian securities, although they belong to the several States. In support of my statement that the securities of the States are dai'lv approximating to an equality of value, I would invite the attention of honourable members to the following table, which sets out the market price of those securities in London on the 27th of September last:State. ii 3 Victoria 4 1920 Victoria 3* 19216 Victoria 3 1929.49 New South Wales 4 -933 New South Wales 191S New South Wales South Australia -939 South Australia 3 1916 Queensland 4 ' 9 5 - 4 105 IO o Queensland 1924-30 Queensland Tasmania 1928-40 IOO O Tasmania 1920-40 Western Australia 1920-35 100 o Western Australia",37
282,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does able member think that the existence of the Labour Party has had anything to do with the low price of New South Wales stock ?,37
283,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would remind the honourable member that whilst the Labour Partv were in office all our securities slightlv improved. I do not say that the improvement was due to the fact that we were in office, nor do I say that it has been due to the establishment of Federation. There is nothing to warrant the approximate uniformity of the price of States stocks of certain denominations, except the fact that the people recognise that the security is an Australian one. That being so, the argument of those who say that we ought not to take over the whole of the debts a,t the one operation, since the present bond-holders might secure some hypothetical advantage, falls to the ground. It is a very unlikely contingency. I take a Commonwealth view of the (question, and hold that the scheme submitted by the honourable member for ""Mernda is the best that has been presented to the House. We should at once take over the whole of the States debts, and at the same ""time, controlling as we do the Customs and Excise They are revenue, should discharge the true duties of a national Parliament. I presume that the Constitution places it beyond doubt that the States must provide the money necessary to pay the interest on their stocks. Without any amendment of the Constitution, we have power to require them, to make good the interest payments on debts taken over, and it is our duty to take, action as soon as we possibly can. I hold, however, that the Commonwealth will not, and ought not, to allow any State security to fail-tlia t in the event of a calamity 1 - 5 happening to any one State the CommonQE o wealth would be bound to come to its assistance, and to see that its obligations Year £ s. d. were met. The Constitution already pro105 o o qq o o vides for that being done. We have power SS 10 o to give financial assistance to a State, and 108 10 o the neople of any State have power to 9S o o 34 hand over the whole or any part of 3 ''935 86 o o 100 o o their revenue or debts to the Com34 87 10 o monwealth. The Commonwealth Parr 2 liament, I am satisfied, would never 3i 99 o allow anv State debts to be repudiated. 3 192247 86 10 That being so, it is unlikely that holders 34 89 o of States bonds would be ready, as the honourable and learned member for Northern 34 3 8S o Melbourne has said, to accept in exchange the honorfor them Commonwealth bonds of a lower denomination. It is absurd, for instance, to think that the holders of 4 per cent. State securities would be prepared, merelv for the sake of obtaining a Commonwealth bond, to sacrifice interest representing a total of over £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 . It is inconceivable that any honourable member should come to the conclusion that people would be prepared, merely for sentimental reasons, to exchange State for Commonwealth stock. Different people have different minds.",37
284,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Judgin g by the attitude of the Treasurer, some people have different minds at different times.",37
285,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think that an interjection made by the Treasurer was misunderstood by honourable members.,37
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has told us today that it would be a proper thing to do that which he denounced only a few weeks since.,38
287,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fro m an interjection made by the right honourable gentleman, I and others were led to infer that he considers this Parliament has a right to interfere with the contracts made by the States with their bond-holders. The right honourable gentleman told me subsequently that he did not intend to say anything on which such a construction could be put. I understand that we can take over the responsibilities of the States with regard to their debts, but that we have no right to interfere with any bond-holder who may think fit either to hold his security until it matures, or to give it up some time before it does so. We have no power to break any contract, and that being so, the bondholders are not likelv for sentimental reasons to forego any of their existing rights. I think that the consideration of this matter was delayed until too late in the session, and that the passing of the Bill has thus been endangered. I am prepared to accept even the amendment made by the Senate. I am ready indeed to agree to any reasonable amendment of the Constitution, so that those who are returned to the next Parliament will be clothed with full power to deal with this great question in a way in which they ought to have been able to deal with it long ago.",38
288,Mr HENRV WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Robertson) [6.10] - I dealt very fully with the States debts question on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, and am somewhat surprised that the Government are ready to accept an amendment made by another place which must tend to reverse the very policy which they then announced. The Senate desires to retain in the Bill the words which this House considered would impose an impracticable condition. The amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Mernda, and accepted by the Government, will, I think, satisfy the Senate, since it will show that our real desire is that the Parliament shall have power to take over all or any proportion of the debts that may have been contracted up to the present, or may be hereafter contracted. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the Attorney-General had in view an, amendment similar to that proposed by the honourable member for Mernda, and to put the position in a nutshell, I think that our desire is to stand by our former decision. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne dealt very elaborately with the advantages that would accrue to the Commonwealth if it were permitted to - take over the States debts a few years before they matured. He urged that persons having large sums invested in Australian stocks would not be willing to convert those stocks until a year or two before they reached maturitv, notwithstanding that we might offer them 'Commonwealth stocks that would continue in perpetuity. If he were familiar with the views expressed by experts in England, he would know that it is not likely that holders of States stocks will be willing to convert them unless they derive some advantage from the conversion. That is the view set forth in the memorandum issued by Mr Coghlan, the Agent-General of New South Wales, and Sir Edward Hamilton, who was Under Secretary of the Treasury when England's great conversion scheme was carried out, has expressed a similar opinion.",38
289,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wh v should they be prepared to convert unless some advantage is offered them?,38
290,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the point. They know that their existing security is ample and sound, and if they had any doubt on the point, they would need only to consult the financial authorities in order to be reassured. I am in favour of the Commonwealth taking over at the earliest possible moment all the debts of the States. We ought to open a register of converted stock, so that any person who desired to exchange his present holdings for Australian 3 per cents, might be able, without inconvenience, to do so. No man who held 4 per cent, bonds current for thirty years would take 3 per cent, bonds for them, providing he knew his security to be sound. To encourage his consent to a change, we should have, as Sir Edward Hamilton says, to offer him an inducement. The inducement which I would oner would be the cash value of his 4 per cent, bonds in 3 per cent, bonds.",38
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What does the honourable memBer mean by the cash value of 4 per cent, bonds?",38
292,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The cash value of 4 per cent, bonds in 3 per cent, bonds would be 3 per cent, bonds for the amount of the holding, plus the capitalized value of 1 per cent., at compound interest, for the currency of the stock. The advantage of this arrangement would be that it would make a certainty of having Commonwealth 3 per cent, stock in perpetuity. Under the scheme of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the best we could have would be a 3A per cent, stock, and we should have to pay £ per cent., or some other high percentage, to the financiers of England for underwriting and converting, with the further loss by issuing below par, which may approximate to the 4 per cent, formerly paid. I am in favour of taking over all the debts at the earliest moment practicable, and would be ready to register and inscribe loans for any amount. If a person holding 4 per cent, stock wished to convert, I would give him 3 per cent, bonds, plus the equivalent of 1 per cent, in cash, if he choose to take i in all probability he would prefer to take extra 3 per cent, inscribed stock in substitution. I did not know that this matter would come on to-night, and have, therefore, not got with me a good deal of actuarial information which had been prepared for me by my son Hastings. An enormous advantage would be gained by every State of the Union if the plan which I suggest were adopted. The cost of conversion and other financial charges comes to a very large sum in the aggregate, and this expense could be saved for all time. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne concluded his speech by making an excellent suggestion, which was that we should take over all the debts of the States according to the Treasurer's original proposal. It is believed by many, if not by the Treasurer himself, that that part of the Constitution which provides for the taking over of a proportion of the debts of the States, according to the respective number of their people, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, is impracticable, and an amendment has been submitted to get rid of the difficulty, which I think will meet the case. However, as we shall have an opportunitv to go more full v into the matter at another time, and as there was an exhaustive discussion during the Budget debate, I shall not say anything more at present.",38
293,Mr CULPIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Brisbane) [6.21] - The framers of the Constitution regarded the taking over of the debts of the States by the Commonwealth as something which ought to be done, and I agree with honourable members that the sooner it is done the better. But, in my opinion, in this matter we shall make haste by going slowly. The proposal of the Government relates to two distinct matters, which must be considered separately. In the first place, they wish to empower the Commonwealth to take over all the debts of the States incurred up to the present time. The second part of their original proposal was to empower the Commonwealth, if it is deemed desirable, to take over from time to time only so much of the debts as it may be convenient to deal with. If the amendment of the Senate be agreed to, however, the Commonwealth, if it does not take over all the debts of the States, will be obliged to take over a proportionaccording to the respective numbers of their people us shown by the latest statistics, as the Constitution originally provided. The t , though Senate's amendment also providesThe powers of the Parliament relating to the public debts of the States shall extend to debts incurred since the establishment of the Commonwealth. Upon which the honourable member for Mernda has moved a further amendment to insert the words "" at any time after "" instead of the word "" since "" I cannot see my way to vote for that proposal. Any one of t(he States may 'borrow extravagantly after the taking over of its debts by the Commonwealth, and I should strongly object to the 'Commonwealth making itself liable for those further debts. I am willing that the Commonwealth should be empowered to take over all debts which have been incurred up to the present time; but I do not think that it should be able to take over future debts.",39
294,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The whole thing can be fixed up after the matter has been referred to the people.,39
295,Mr CULPIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that we should be content to take over the debts incurred up to the present time. Personally, I should not mind very much if the Commonwealth took over only the debts incurred prior to Federation.",39
296,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are not now considering any scheme for the taking over of the debts, but merely a proposal to ask the people to alter the Constitution to enable Parliament, if it is thought desirable, to deal with the existing debts.",39
297,Mr CULPIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am quite aware of that. I am inclined to vote against the proposal to allow the amendment of the Constitution in this particular. I believe that the Commonwealth, in taking over the debts of the States, will increase the value of the stock ancl bonds now current, and that this increase of value will go to the bond-holders. The right honourable member for Balaclava has stated that this increase in value would amount to between £4,000,000 and £9,000,000. I think that it would be better for the Commonwealth not to take over any debts until it was in possession of funds to a moderate amount; ancl I am .not in favour of precipitate action. I shall certainly vote against the proposal to allow future debts to be taken over. Sitting suspendedfrom 6.2S to 7.45 p.m.",39
298,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [7.45] - There are very few subjects which present more scope for difference of opinion than the question of dealing with the States debts. We have heard a great deal about the possibilities of adding to the security of the bondholder by the transfer of the Sta'tes debts to the Commonwealth. At the very best, the whole of the assets would be taken over with, the whole of the debts. As a matter of fact, we shall not take over the whole of the assets. What the Commonwealth has to offer by way of security is the power of taxation- a power which the States also possess, except so far as Customs and Excise duties are concerned. In the proceeds of even the latter class of taxation, the States have an interest. They have, in addition, a number of tangible assets such as are not possessed by the Commonwealth. Even if the whole of the assets of the States were transferred, together with the whole', of their liabilities, no additional security would be given to the bond-holders. There might be some advantage in the transfer of 1 Lability from one State to another, but to the extent to which one State might part with, what I may call its solvency to another State, it would weaken itself. There is not the remotest possibility of the States repudiating their debts. In view of our exceptional recuperative powers, there is not the shadow of a doubt that the States will ever fail to discharge their liabilities to the fullest degree. The security offered by them must be regarded as of the highest character when it is considered that they have assets representing about £ 180,000,000, which, to a large extent, would reproduce the capital expended upon them. By amalgamating the assets, and at the same time amalgamating the liabilities of the States, we shall not, as a matter of balance, add a tittle to the security afforded by the whole. One State must be weakened to the extent to which it gives a portion of its security to others. There may, however, be some fancy advantage in having a stock of a uniform ""character, but this change cannot be brought about for many years to come. We shall have to earn a reputation for greater solvency, and by our administration and better financial management engender greater confidence in our ability to payup at any moment. I find it difficult to estimate the value of that greater security, because I regard the security of the States as sufficient. There will be no advantage in the transfer of the debts from the States to the Commonwealth, so far as security is concerned, except so far as purchasers may prefer to deal in a uniform stock. Some reference has been made to the wonderful benefits that would accrue from the Commonwealth taking over the whole of the debts at once. Referring to the proceedings of the Federal Convention, I find that I expressed some doubt with regard to the anticipations as to the wonderful increase that would take place in the value of Australian securities the moment that Federation was accomplished. The Treasurer was as sanguine then as he is now. When I asked the members of the Convention whether they were quite sure that the Federal security would be regarded as better than the security offered by the States, the right honourable gentleman made an interjection in the affirmative. He had a very rosy idea of the probable results of the conversion. In all cases of conversion, there must be give-and-take conditions. Compensation must be given for the surrender of the higher rate of interest during the unexpired term of the bond. I remember endeavouring to impress upon the members of . the Convention the desirableness of making provision similar to that now proposed to be - inserted in the Constitution. I said:Let us see what will be the effect of passing clause 9S. That clause provides that existing public debts may be taken over either partly or altogether. The words "" existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth"" have been taken from the Canadian Act. At all events, they are in the Canadian Act, and they are applicable there, but not here. In Canada the whole of the debts were taken over at once, and therefore it was perfectly right to say thai the existing debts should be taken over. Tf you are to limit the debts to be taken over hereafter to the existing debts of the Commonwealth, you may subsequently find yourselves position : That you will be unable to take over any new debts incurred by the States, or to take over debts the character of which has varied. I could not impress upon the members of the Convention the.desirableness of making the necessary amendment, and hence we are driven now to amend the Constitution in the direction which the Convention thought was unnecessary. With regard to the appreciation of securities, nothing conveys a better idea of what is likely to happen than a comparison of the various stocks. The French stocks running fo!r terms, approximately the same as German stocks, are higher by 8 or 10 per cent.(.because the French people have a greater reputation for thrift, and also owing to the fact that there have been large deficits in the German Budget of late. Of course, there is no doubt about the capacity of the Germans to meet their liabilities, but the public take into acconut considerations' such as I have mentioned. At the time of the Federal Convention, the New South Wales 3 per cent, stocks had a market value very little below that of the Canadian stocks bearing a similar rate of interest. Canada has been developing her resources very largely of recent years. During the last three or four years she has brought under agricultural settlement 13,000,000 acres, an area larger than the whole of the cultivated lands of Australia. She has settled 80,000 additional people upon the soil during the same period. Apart from the impetus that has recently been given to settlement in Canada, it must be'remembered that the Dominion has an exceptionally large sinking fund. One quarter of the total annual outlay in connection with the debt is representee! by contributions to the sinking fund. The aggregate liabilities of the Dominion and the provinces is less than £80,000,000. In view of these facts, taken in conjunction with the circumstance that the stock is of uniform character, it need not be wondered at that the Canadian 3 per cents stand at ,£98 or £99 at present. When we have got beyond that period of pessimism and cavilling through which we, like the United States of America, have to pass, we may exoent that our reputation for capable administration and financial management will give our stocks an enhanced value. In 1794, Washington' was obliged to send troops to prevent a threatened insurrection [210] in this against the Union in Pennsylvania. The spirit of secession was manifested in many been forms until, in 1828. President Jackson had to declare that if any attempt were made to repudiate the Customs duties, he would have to call out the troops to protect the revenue. The anti-Federal spirit was manifested, in one form or another, until the war of secession, when the States, having passed through the splendid crucible of a great national crisis, were welded together in sentiment and affection as well as by the parchment bond. I am doubtful if we can, under the Constitution, substitute the security of the Commonwealth for that of the States. The honourable member for Northern Melbourne stated that it could not be done, and that is a matter upon which there is room for difference of opinion. I find, by reference to the Annotated Constitution of the Commonwealth, that Messrs. Quick and Garran sayThe effect of the transfer will be to substitute the credit of the Commonwealth for the credit of the States-to make the Commonwealth the debtor to whom the bondholders wil l have to look, and to release the States from any obligation to the bondholders, imposing on them instead an obligation to indemnify the Commonwealth for the amount of principal and interest. That is not in accordance with the opinion of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. He now says that the debts should not be taken over in proportion to population. I find, by reference to the Convention debates, that he was the very member of the Convention who moved that that provision should be inserted in the Constitution. I am afraid that now that the Bill has been tampered with by the Senate, objection may be urged to its passing, owing to the fact that we have not properly done our work. If we wish to take over the whole of the debts of the States- a proceeding of which I doubt the policy-ho w are we to do it properly, if we cannot give the security of the Commonwealth-if , as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne says, that the taking over does not mean the substitution of one security for another? In the Canadian Constitution they substituted the Federal for the provincial security because they expressly declared that, after the transfer of the debts, the provinces would no longer be liable, but that the whole responsibility would be undertaken by the Dominion. They also adopted a method which, I think, should have been followed by us, namelv, that of pooling the debts. I endeavoured at the Convention to induce the representatives to consider a motion to that effect. In Canada, the Dominion Government took over the whole of the debts, and all the assets which related to the debts, and which were specially capable of. being seized in connection with them --the principal asset being the power of taxation. In almost everv case, the bonds' were directly chargeable against the Consolidated Revenue, and that was the principal security in addition to the assets in the shape of railwavs and Crown lands. - Where the indebtedness of a province was greater per head than the average indebtedness of the whole of the provinces, it was only fair that that province should be debited with the excess; but where the indebiedness of a province was less than the average that it should be credited with the difference. The whole of the debts were at once taken over by that operation. That is the plan which I venture to think we ought to have adopted. To that end I moved in the ConventionThat the existing public debts of the States shall, be taken over by the Commonwealth at the date of its establishment, and the interest thereon shall be a charge on the consolidated fund. Each State shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the amount by which its debts exceed the average amount Qf the debts of all the States, after such debts have, for purpose of ascertaining theirrelative values, been reduced to and expressed in a debt of the average currency and rale of interest of the debts of all the States. The Commonwealth shall be deemed to be indebted to a State in the amount so ascertained by which the reduced - debt of the State is less than the average amount of the reduced debts of all the Stales. The objection was raised that, by 'adopting the scheme which I have outlined, we should be making a present to the bondholders of the increased value of the Federal security - Experience has taught us how much that increased value is worth. Had that scheme been adopted, Victoria would have been credited with some £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, and South Australia, which was with Queensland at the top of the ""list, from the stand-point of its indebtedness would have been debited with an amount of £7,000,000 or £S,000,000. In other words, that would have reoresented the excess of its capital indebtedness over the average indebtedness of all the States. T do not wish to pursue the matter further, - but as we are walking Mr Glynn. so much in the twilight I thought that I would make mv contribution to the general confusion. I cannot see that there"" is the remotest good to be derived from passing the Bill ih the form in which it has been returned from the Senate. In addressing i meeting some time ago, the honourable member for Bland made a very valuable suggestion, namely, that the Commonwealth ought to be empowered to take over any portion of the States debts. Very properlv the Government included a provision to that effect in the Bill as it was originally introduced. That provision, which was the chief merit of the measure, has been struck out by the Senate. I understand that the Government intend to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda, which will practically restore the Bill to its original form, although its phraseology will be less explicit. The proper course for us to adopt is to take over so much of the debts of the States as will absorb annually an amount equal to the surpluses which have been returned to the States during the past five or six years. At the same time. I would allow the States a share of the Customs revenue hereafter, because there is no reason why they should not participate in its greater buovancv. Tf we adopted mv suggestion we should take over about £ r 20,000,000 worth of the debts of the States as they mature. .We might have to take over an additional £TO,OOO.OOO or - fi5,000,000. the in order to pay for the transferred properties.",40
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not so much as £15,000,000.",42
300,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that estimates were made ranging from ,£10,000,000 to £12.000.000. and I am speaking on thf basis of the old figures. My point is that we cannot gain anything by adopting any policv other than that of taking over the liabilities of the States to the extent of the sum that we ought annually to return to them.",42
301,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We cannot do that.,42
302,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We cannot do it unless we adhere to the Bill in the form in which the Government introduced it. T shall vote against the amendment of the Senate.,42
303,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [8.7] - Like the honourable and learned member for Angas, T presume that I may add a little to the general confusion that prevails upon this subject. In saying that I do not suggest that his speech added to the confusion. Far from it . There is no honourable member who throws more light upon anv subject to which he addresses himself than does the honourable and learned member for Angas, and nobody is able to present an historical view of any matter in the same complete manner that he does. I have been privileged to hear most of the speeches delivered this afternoon, and I confess that I am glad to seethe Treasurer-afte r all the fuming and petulance which he exhibited-com e round to a reasonable frame of mind, and accept an amendment which completely stultifies the attitude which he adopted earlier in the day. Sir loHN FORREST - I thought that the honourable member was going to make a non-nart* speech. ",42
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is a party speech?,43
305,Sir TOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Abuse .,43
306,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This afternoon the Treasurer abused me for half-an-hour in the most ill-tempered way, and refused to listen to any interjection, - no matter how pertinent it might be. I am afraid we wasting time in discussing this Bill. Had stocks we accepted the amendment of the Senate - as the Treasurer proposed-w e should bave stultified our previous action. In manner, if the Senate agrees to the pronot posal which we are likely to send it, its members will be stultifying their previous action.",43
307,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,T t is a question of stultheir price. tification whichever way it goes.,43
308,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I take leave to doubt whether the reconsideration which the Senate will give to this measure will amount to very much. I think that the for their redemption. action of that Chamber in returning the Bill with the amendment that it made was intended to be a polite wav of administerlegal ing to it its quietus for the session. I that I am mistaken. I shall be glad deed if the Senate accepts the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda, which will have the effect .of restoring Bill to its original form, except that verbiage will not be nearly so explicit it was. However, I take it that we are serious in the matter of seeking further power to take over the debts of the States, and therefore the obligation is cast upon us by every constitutional means to try to achieve that end. I differ the Treasurer as to what would be the effect of taking over the debts under the view at all. conditions which he outlined this afternoon. His speech was a complete contradiction of his Budget declaration.",43
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member explain in what way it was a contradiction ?,43
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall be glad lo do so. In his Budget the Treasurer told usTlie financial authorities whom I consulted in London were unanimous in the opinion that it would be disadvantageous to place the Commonwealth brand on State slocks before conversion, as such action would prevent the possibility of any profitable conversion, and would be making to the existing holders a present of any increase in price caused by the additional Commonwealth security. This afternoon the right honourable gentleman declared that by taking over the States debts we should obtain an additional security for ourselves, and he further informed us that we should be able to take over those debts without placing the Commonwealth brand upon them.",43
311,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I said that they will not have the Commonwealth brand are upon them until they become Australian,43
312,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say that the. moment they are taken over the Commonlike wealth brand will be upon them. It is the Treasurer who will out that brand up to upon them, but the bond-holders.'",43
313,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is upon the' States debts now, ancl it has not changed",43
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not upon them now. It would be upon them if we. made ourselves liable for the payment of the interest, and established a sinking fund, The Treasurer wishes to draw a distinction between the brandi'nf of stock in a responsible and. sense, and branding it in a nominal hope sense. Mv own impression is that we had inbetter adhere to the position which we took uo on a previous occasion. We then arrived at the conclusion that it would the be a great mistake to touch the States its debts unless we could confer some advanas tage urxm the States. Everybody is agreed that to nut the Commonwealth brand upon them before the period of conversion or renewal would be to make a present to the bond-holders of whatever appreciation in the value of the stocks might result entirely from from our action.",43
315,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not agree with that,",43
316,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member may not agree with it, but that is the opinion of every financier in London whom the Treasurer consulted. We must pay some attention to the views of these experts.",44
317,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The member has misunderstood me. 1,44
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The language is explicit enough.,44
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What does the honourable member mean by the term "" placing the Commonwealth brand on the States stock ""?",44
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Takin g over the debts of the States, and making ourselves responsible for them.",44
321,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,When we convert them ?,44
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What does the right honourable gentleman mean by the expression "" taking over the debts of the States""? He says he means making ourselves responsible for the interest, the working of the sinking, fund, and the redemption of the loans as they mature.",44
323,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Even loans treated would still bear the States brands. They. would be known as the Victorian "" threes,"" and so forth.",44
324,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Whateve r they might be called, we may rest assured that the keen financiers of London would know .what they really were. They would know tiiat another body with a presumably better credit had stepped in and taken over the responsibility in respect of them. ' Mr FISHER - How can the the Commonwealth be better than that of the States when it represents only an aggregation of their securities?",44
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a question which does not relate to the Bill now before us. The assumption is that the Commonwealth must have a better credit than the States. That is the view of all save those who wish to make an excursion into purely academic regions.,44
326,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I admit that the one denomination would be an improvement.,44
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Q u it e so. There is no accounting for the opinions of the people, but we know that the views of bond-holders make themselves felt in the variations on the Stock Exchange. That being so, we have to take account of the variations in the minds of those who hold our stocks, whether there is any reason for them or not. I am one of those who consider that there is solid reason at the bottom of the belief, in a Commonwealth appreciation over and above the State credit. I believe that we shall eventually have an improved credit, although I doubt if there will be an immediate improvement. Certainly no improvement will be effected by honourable the mere empty act of taking over these debts without our being able to do anything with them. We ought to be able to take over the whole of these debts, not for the purpose of immediately dealing with them, but in order that we might trv. if possible, to assume responsibility in respect of the whole London indebtedness. If we began at that point, and cut the connection between the States ancl the London market, we should immediately begin to make a better credit. The rest would be very easy. I should like to ask the Treasurer how, supposing he obtained the power to take over the whole of the debts, he would make himself responsible for the total interest bill in respect of them. We have not enough monev to meet the interest bill.",44
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I pointed out in my memorandum that if the amount at our so disposal were insufficient in any case, the difference would be paid to the Commonwealth by the States.",44
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who says that the difference will be paid by them?,44
330,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We find that provision in section 105 of the Constitution.,44
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That section provides that "" the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States."" But to whom would it be paid? credit of T doubt whether the Treasurer would be able to. say to the States, "" Under this section vou must hand over the money to me.""",44
332,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,T t might as well be paid to - the Commonwealth as direct to the creditors.,44
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The right honourable gentleman would be on safe ground if . on obtaining this power, he proceeded to deal with the debts by converting or redeeming, them at maturity.",44
334,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is what we propose to do.,44

341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I doubt whements. ther the right honourable gentleman could do anything in that direction. The debts should be taken over when, the Government proposed to begin to redeem or convert them. We should keep our credit for whatever it is worth until we wish to use it for States stocks. - Mr JOHNSON - What about all the [8.32] - I moveStates assets which are the foundation of the security ? Are they to be taken over ?",45
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,45
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"After all, we have the great asset-w e have control of the Customs and Excise revenue, and other powers of taxation. All this discussion, however, is quite apart from the Bill self. We are now seeking merely the power to take over these debts, and that power should be a complete one. limitations imposed by the Constitution, which experience has already shown to be unwise and irksome, ought to be removed. The Senate say that they must remain, and missioner the Treasurer proposed at first operate within those limitations. however, that the amendment moved by honourable member for Mernda will be carand ried and accepted by another place. have heard it rumoured that the Treasurer under himself suggested the amendment. Whethef he did or did not it cannot be denied that the honourable member has done the Minispursuant ter a good service. This is not, and ought not to be, a party matter in the strict sense. No other question has a tithe of its importapplications ance to the States and the Commonwealth. Until it is settled we shall have constant difficulty and irritation, and we shall even begin to realise the possibilities Federation. It seems to me that it is vital to the whole of our functions, and is the section one outstanding matter pressing for settleof ment. Every honourable member, no matter what his political views may be, must realise the importance of this question, and I am glad that the Treasurer is going to We make another effort to secure the complete powers without which I think he will not able to deal satisfactorily with this question.

SECOND READING.",45
344,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Indi-Attorney-General ) That the Bill be now read a second time. This is practically a Bill to amend section 29 of the Patents Act of 1903. An amending Bill was before the House last session, embodying other provisions in addition to those in the measure now before us. These provisions were, not, if I reitmember rightly, much contested, though the others were. The Patents Act of 1903 consolidated, so far as that could be done, The the laws of the States relating to patents. Section 29 provides thatApplications for patents may be lodged at the Patent Office immediately ""after the Comis appointed, notwithstanding that this to try to Act has not then commencedI hope, Under section 7, it was to commence ""on the a day to be fixed by proclamation "" all applications so lodged shall have priority I as prescribed, and the lodging of an application this section shall have the like effect ns the lodging of an application after the commencement of this Act, but any patent granted to the application shall be dated as of the day of the commencement of this Act. That section provided for the lodging of for patents immediately after the appointment of the Commissioner, to be arranged and dealt with as soon as the not Act commenced. But difficulty has been of caused by the words and the lodging of an application under this shall have the like effect as the lodging an application after the commencement of this Act. Section 67 enacts that a patent shall be sealed as soon as may beand not after the expiration of sixteen months from the date of application, or such further time as is prescribed, or as the High 'Court the Supreme Court allows. The High Court or a Supreme Court things could not extend the time except while is running on; the time .having expired, there would be nothing to extend. Some months elapsed between the appointment of the Commissioner and the commenceor ment of the Act, and doubts have now arisen as to whether the applications lodged during that period should be regarded as having a full sixteen months from of the commencement of the Act, or as having only six or eight months, the poswe sibility being that in the latter case tain persons have, in the confusion of ting things into working order, lost their rights.",45
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does it take so long to register a patent ?,46
346,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not now concerned with the merits of particular applications; but considerable time may be expended in complying with the requirements of the office, in order that it may be known ther an idea has been anticipated, and balance of justice would fall. what is the effect of an alleged anticipalimited tion. If anv fault is to be found, it .must he found with Parliament for not making its meaning clear. The point at issue micht be settled by litigation, gation would be costlv and uncertain, and we conceive it to be the duty of Parliament not to let any one suffer by reason of the ambiguitv of its laws. Clause 2 section provides thatThe Commissioner, or on appeal from him the Law Officer, may, in relation to any application for a patent made under section twenty-nine of the Patents Act 1903 :(a) extend the prescribed lime for doing act or taking any step, and (4) revive any application for a patent or any proceeding in relation thereto which has lapsed by reason of an omission to do any act or take any step within the prescribed time.",46
347,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why limit the operation of the measure to section 29 of the Patents Act?,46
348,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Because it is only in that section that Parliament has used ambiguous language.,46
349,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There are other complaints.,46
350,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , regarding the operation of other provisions in the Act; _ but they, have not arisen because of the phraseology of the Act. We endeavoured last session to pass legislation dealing with what may be cases of injustice, but we are or not in a position to advise Parliament as to whether it would be better to leave as they are or to make alterations. it Some inventors, because of some slip of their own, or of some misreading of the law, not due to its phraseology, may have omitted to lodge their applications in time, to properly follow them up.",46
351,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I understand that the congestion of business in the office has delayed the date the acceptance of applications.,46
352,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be so; but if extended the tinie in all cases we might cerdo great injustice to the public. Comgetpanies and individuals may have acted upon the supposition that so-called "" inventions "" were no longer the property of the alleged patentees,- and may have embarked capital in enterprises, believing that they were free to use them. These persons might be put in a very difficult position if Parlia-' ment were now to replace what had become public propertv in the hands of private individuals. However, I am not at present whei t a position to say on which side the We have the Bill to the amendment' of one section of the Act, with a view to correcting, without doing an injustice, an ambiguity for which Parliament is chargebut that litiable. We provide thatThe prescribed time for doing any act or taking any step may be extended under this although the time has expired. The powers of the Commissioner or the Law Officer under this section may only be exercised on application .made to him by the applicant for the patent within six months after - the commencement of this Act. Where any application for a patent has been any revived as aforesaid, and a patent has been granted pursuant thereto, then, if any proceeding is taken in respect of an infringement of the patent, no damages in respect of anv such infringement prior to a notification of .the revival of the application, published in the Gazette or the Official Journal of the Patent Office, shall be awarded. If any person has used a patented article prior to the notification in the Gazette, he will not be liable-for damages for an infringement of the patent, although in law there will have been no lapse of time between the application for and the granting of the patent.",46
353,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But he will not be allowed to continue to use it.,46
354,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not after the notification. He will then be in the same position as if there had been no lapse.. But we have no wish to make persons tortfeasors by retrospection. In view of the discussion last session, and of the small amount of time now at, our disposal, we have limited the Bill to an amendment about the justice of which there pan be, so far as we are aware, no doubt.",47
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [8.45] - The Attorney-General has stated that one reason for the introduction of the Bill is the delay which occurred in bringing the Act into operation, and that all sorts of misconceptions and mistakes were possible in the administration of a new Patents Act. consolidating the Acts of the States. Under these conditions we ought to deal leniently with any defects that have arisen, either through inadvertence, ignorance, want of time, or opportunity on the .part of .those interested an obtaining the registration of patents. There were some very debatable provisions in the measure .of last session, and as these have been eliminated, and - the Bill is really a validating measure, we should not hesitate to pass it. I do not see why we should not extend the scope of this amendment to the whole of the provisions of the Act, and do our best to remedy any injustices that may have arisen. In any case, I shall support the Bill.",47
356,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [8.47] - Per sonally, I think that the Attorney-General ought to extend the operation of the Bill. I have been informed by some patent agents that several applications which were received after the Act came.into force, and which therefore did not come within the operation of section 29, were not considered in sufficient time to enable a patent to be issued within sixteen months of the time the application was made. cases,, of course, a patent could net be [granted. Under section 48, unless the complete specification is accepted within twelve months of the date of the application, or such further time as is prescribed, except in the case of an appeal having been lodged against the refusal to accept, the application lapses. The specifications have to accompany the applications, and unless the specifications are considered within twelve months, the applications lapse. that the trouble has arisen owing to the congestion of business in the Department. Tf applications have not been considered through the inability of the Department to cope with the business, it will be very unfair to make the applicants suffer.",47
357,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The section which the honourable and learned member has quoted says, "" or such further time as is prescribed,"" beyond the twelve months.",47
358,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why has not the time been extended to enable the applications to be dealt with?,47
359,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wit h regard to section 29, the idea was that the applicant should have sixteen months from the commencement of the Act, and apparently some of the applicants, thinking that they had a good many months to run, did not think of asking for an extension of time.",47
360,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There must be something in the complaints of the patent agents, because representations have been made to other honourable members as well as myself by a number of patent agents of high standing, to the effect that applications were made after the Act came into force, and that they have not been dealt with because of the stress of business in the Department. They say that now there is no help for them, and presumably therefore the time has not been extended. It would appear that there has been some neglect on the part of the administration, and, if so, a reform should be brought about. Provision is made in section 54 that after the acceptance of a complete specification, and until the date of sealing the patent, the applicant shall have the same rights and privileges as if a patent had been sealed on the date of the acceptance of the complete application. That section enables an applicant to take action for an infringement of .patent rights, although the patent has not been granted at the time of the infringement, but the Bill' provides that he is not to take action with respect to any infringement prior to the In such notification of the revival. An infringement might take place after the application had been made, and before the lapse of the application. Had the specification been accepted at the prescribed time, the applicant would be entitled under a possible construction of section 54 to take action for infringement, but if it had not been accepted within the prescribed time would not be entitled to sue for any infringement. That seems to me to be unjust. I think a patentee should be I hear granted the right of action in respect to infringements prior to the notification of the revival. In connection with the administration of the Patent Office, requests have been made that the register of patents shall be kept up to date in the branch offices in the various States, as in the case of the head office in Melbourne. I understand that the records can be written up from the Commonwealth Gazette in each State by a clerk in four or five hours per week. Persons who have to make searches for patents in the various branch offices have to 'go through the Gazettes, and hunt up all the applications, whereas at the central office they have only to look up the record that is kept up to date. Why the Department should want to centralize all the conveniences in Melbourne I do not know. I trust that the Minister will see that the convenience I have indicated is provided.",47
361,Mr EISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [8.55] - As the Attorney-General has pointed out, this amendment has the narrowest possible scope. It is quite true, as some honourable members have indicated, that complaints have been made to the effect that injustice has been done owing to neglect or oversight on the part of officers, and, no doubt, we can provide the remedy for any mistakes that have been made by the officials. If , however, we attempted to arrange for a general indemnity in respect to all errors that may have been made, we should find ourselves placed in a very embarrassing position. Something should be done to rectify mistakes that may have been made Dy our officials. In cases where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Crown Law officers that patentees have been placed under disabilities owing to the action of the cers of the Patent Department, every effort should be made to put matter? right.",48
362,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That would be analogous to repairing a mistake made by Parliament itself, and I have drafted a clause which would have lhat effect.",48
363,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that we may safely extend the scope of the Bill in that direction, and endeavour to do substantial justice to ail. Mr K.VOX (Kooyong) [8.58] - I am glad that the suggestion of the honourable member for Wide Bay has been accepted by the Attorney-General. When a measure of a similar character was under consideration last session, it was represented that certain hardships would arise in cases of accidental omission, or through inability to comply with the necessary conditions owing to want of time and other circumstances. For example, many mistakes were made owing to the great confusion which arose owing to the sudden change that was made from the varying conditions previously existing in the States. I am quite sure that the Attorney-General merely desires to do what is right in this matter, and I am sure that he will do his best to remedy any errors of omission that may occur. .Surely the Attorney-General will admit that, in the multitude of interests which exist, there is a possibility of applicants being honestly unable to comply with the requirements of the Act. Of course, everybody will favour the granting of whatever powers may be necessary to meet cases in which there is the slightest indication of a desire to abuse privileges. I should like the Attorney-General to consent to the omission from clause 2 of the words "" section 29 of . """,48
364,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have a special clause prepared which deals with general errors and omissions on the part of officers of the Patents Office. ' Mr KNOX - Surely the applicant for a patent deserves consideration. I know from patents attorneys in Melbourne and Sydney that a feeling exists that many of their clients are labouring under an injustice. They are reputable men,48

385,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [9.15] - I think that the clause is a very good one, but I would point out that it will apply to the future. Perhaps it may be advisable to make it so apply, but it is not necessary to do so. Mr ISAACS.'-If it is just now it will be just always. Proposed new clause agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill passed through its remaining stages. PUBLIC SERVICE (TELEGRAPH MESSENGERS) BILL.",50
386,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [9.16] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a short measure designed to extend the retiring age of telegraph messengers from eighteen to twenty; years. It provides for the repeal of section 10 of the Telegraph Act 1901, under which the retiring age is fixed at eighteen years, and declares thatEvery telegraph messenger shall on attaining the age of eighteen years cease in the Public Service unless before attaining that age he passes an examination to be prescribed. Every telegraph messenger who before attaining the age of eighteen years passes the examination so prescribed may be allowed to continue to be employed in the Public Service as a telegraph messenger until he attains the age of twenty years when he shall (unless he has previously been transferred or promoted to some other office or position in the Public Service) cease to be employed in the Public Service. The Bill also provides that an annual examination shall be held. This extension of the retiring age is proposed on the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner. The present position' is that, in 'the absence of any vacancy in the service, these messengers must retire on reaching eighteen years of age, and many efficient lads, who, the Commissioner considers, would be suitable for the service, are thus compelled to leave it. It is proposed that they shall be permitted to remain in the service until reaching twenty years of age, provided they have passed an examination of a practical nature better designed to test their qualifications. It will be a practical examination, securing to the service the more efficient of these lads, and, at the same time, it will render unnecessary many of the examinations and appointments that now take place, and the writing of executive minutes in connection with the reappointments. Telegraph messengers now enter the service between the ages of thirteen and sixteen years. They are appointed as the result of a competitive examination in the first instance, the subjects being handwriting, spelling, and elementary arithmetic. If they do not pass in all these subjects, but secure half marks in handwriting and spelling, they ore allowed to act as messengers, but are not entitled to promotion until they have passed a fresh examination including the whole three subjects. The Commissioner anticipates that, in actual practice, all who pass the practical examination to be prescribed will be provided with positions before they attain the age of twenty, so that the Bill will prevent hardship being suffered by those whose merits entitle them to consideration.",50
387,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does he say how Post and many boys he hopes to absorb?,50
388,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Havin g regard to the increased age limit, he considers that the service will be capable of absorbing those who pass the examination, as they will only be to be employed the best boys.",50
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The increased retiring age will not afford additional opportunity for appointments.,50
390,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It will extend the time during which they will be eligible for promotion. Under the existing system, examinations are continually being held, and there are so many lads under the age of eighteen years that there is no possibility of their all being absorbed in the service. Since ist January, 1903, examinations have been rendered necessary in 720 centres to fill vacancies caused by the retirement of telegraph messengers, and no less than 4,531 boys have been examined for appointment. If this Bill is passed, it will have the effect of reducing the number of examinations; and I ask the House to agree to it as a fair and reasonable proposal.",50
391,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [9.24] - I am not going to oppose this Bill, but I doubt if it will have the effect that the Commissioner anticipates. The trouble is that the opportunities for appointment in the service do not multiply fast enough to enable these boys as they grow up to be absorbed. I doubt whether the position will be improved by retiring lads when they reach the age of twenty.",51
392,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Difficultie s must arise in either case.,51
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not sure that this Bill will cure the difficulty.,51
394,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A lad of eighteen is fit for nothingwhen he is sent out into the world after spending some years in ' the employ of the Department.,51
395,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And his chances of fitting himself for some other calling will be still further prejudiced if the age be increased from eighteen to twenty. Those who were transferred were allowed under the original Act to remain until they reached the age of twenty or twenty-one, and the same practice prevails in the Railway Department, where young men of twenty-one, being no longer juniors, are cast adrift, as there are no senior duties for them to fulfil.",51
396,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unde r this Bill, a lad would have a better opportunity of securing a permanent appointment.",51
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The trouble is that there are not sufficient vacancies in the service to absorb all these lads.,51
398,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we do not retire them until they are twenty years of age, it will be impossible to apprentice them to any trade.",51
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. A lad of eighteen has a chance of being apprenticed, but that chance is a poor one in the case of a lad of twenty. If the Commissioner thinks this course desirable, well and good ; but unless he can increase the avenues of employment he will, under this Bill, only increase the difficultes of the Department, and inflict a still greater injustice on the boys. - Mr DUGALD THOMSON (North Sydney [9.28] - I would remind honourable [211]- 2 members of the evils that were brought to light when the original Bill was under consideration.",51
400,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In New South Wales there was no examination.,51
401,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The difficulty arose not only in New South Wales, but in some of the other States.",51
402,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In Victoria there was at one time no age limit.,51
403,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is so; and the number of messengers was far in excess of the vacancies offering for their permanent appointment.,51
404,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some of these messengers in some of the States were over thirty years of age.,51
405,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. Some of them were married, and were receiving salaries altogether inadequate for the maintenance of their families.",51
406,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There were married men employed as messengers, and receiving only -£60 a year.",51
407,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There were men having family responsibilities, who received only youths' wages. The present difficulty may be accentuated, by this proposal to increase the age limit. No one wishes to see boys of eighteen ""turned adrift, but the service cannot possibly absorb all the lads. If the retiring age be extended to twenty years, these youths will be less fitted to follow any other calling, and even if they pass the examination, they may not succeed in obtaining permanent appointments. The Commissioner apparently hopes by the examination to so largely reduce the numbers as to be able to absorb all the successful candidates. If the examination is so stiffened that comparatively few can pass it, it may be higher than the examination which candidates for more important positions have to pass. That would be unjust.",51
408,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It will be a practical examination.,51
409,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Whil e I do not wish to oppose the measure, I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the difficulties of the case. What is to happen is that a large number are to be discharged at eighteen as at present, and of those who are retained a considerable proportion may be sent away at twenty, when they will be more unfortunately situated than if they had left the service at ""eighteen. I am doubtful whether the Bill may not make the position worse than it is.",51
410,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would not be fair to use the examination as a method of blocking appointments.,52
411,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would be a method of selection.,52
412,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no possibility of more being employed after the Bill passes.,52
413,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That will be so after the first two years, when the absorption will be at the same rate as at present. The successors of those who pass the examination within the next two years will be in no better position than are those now in the service. I think that the difficultv. which I admit to be hard to deal with, is not sufficiently met by the Bill, and my experience in connection with State services prevents me from assenting very readily to the proposal that the discharges shall take place at twenty instead of at eighteen. Debate (on motion by Mr DEAKIN) adjourned. NA (STATE DEBTS) BILL. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the report be now adopted.",52
414,Mr CULPIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Brisbane) [9.36] - When speaking in Committee, I pointed out that there are three proposals in regard to the taking over of the debts of the States. The Commonwealth may either take over only those which had been incurred at the date of the Union, for which the Constitution already provides, or it may. if the Constitution is altered, as originally proposed, take over the debts incurred up to the present time, whilst the Senate's amendment gives power to take' over both those incurred at the present time and those that may be incurred in the future. I am in favour of the taking over of the debts incurred at the date of the Union, and am not averse to taking over as well those incurred between then and the present time; but I altogether object to the taking over of future debts. Still, as this is not a Bill providing for the taking over of the debts, but merely allowing the people to say whether Parliament should be empowered to deal with the matter. I do not propose to vote against it, but will allow the electors to decide by referendum, as proposed. Question resolved in the affirmative, those voting beingBrown, T. Knox, \V. Carpenter, W. H .

418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As we are ahead of our business, while the Senate is in arrears, I suggest to the Prime Minister that tomorrow we should do what we can, and then adjourn until such time as the Senate will have completed what it has to do, unless there is the possibility of both Houses finishing this week. The outlook is not a very promising one, and I do not see why we should - linger on here waiting for business to come from the other Chamber.",52
419,Mr DEAKI N,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [9.46] - So far as I am at present acquainted with the progress of business, I think that the honourable member's suggestion will be well worthy of consideration. To-morrow we have the South African preference resolutions and two little Bills to dispose of. I move That the House do now adjourn.",52
420,Mr KENNEDY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Moira) [9.47] - I desire to direct the attention of the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs, to a matter of some importance. Some of the regulations under the Commerce Act apply to the export of butter, and I desire to state the position as it has been represented to me, and to mention certain facts for which I am prepared to vouch. When the regulations were about to be drafted, the Minister convened a conference of persons engaged in the export trade and of butter experts, which was held in Sydney. When the provisional regulations were drafted they provided for two .methods by which butter could be exported. Under one method what was known as a compulsory grade mark was required, whilst under the other method the exporters furnished a certificate in ing bearing a number corresponding with that appearing on the box containing the butter intended for export. All these arrangements were agreed to. Those who accepted the compulsory grade mark did so under Part V. of the regulations. Those who did not wish to have their produce graded accepted the alternative of the certificate in writing, which was supposed to give particulars as to the percentage of preservatives, casein, water and colouring matter contained in the butter. The exporters and the Department were agreed as to the conditions that were laid down. Some time afterwards, however, when the regulations were being put into shape, the exporters were told that they would have to supply the exact percentages in each case. Instead of merely stating that the butter contained not more than 3 per cent, of this, or that, or the other, they were required to supply particulars as to the exact proportions. A number of the exporters, accompanied by myself and other members, waited upon the Minister, and, as the result of the interview, it was agreed that merely the maximum percentages should be indicated on the certificates. All parties were then satisfied, and those who were engaged co-operatively in the shipment of butter, and upon whose account I am principally concerned, thought nothing further would be heard of the matter. But since the publication of the regulations, which were supposed to come into force on the ist of this month, information has been conveyed to the exporters that the certificate, which they understood was to be in writing, must be stamped on the boxes. I wish to know from the Minister whether he can give such information as will satisfy those immediately concerned, and enable them to carry on their export operations without interruption. I believe that the instruction which has been issued is due to some misinterpretation of the Minister's order, and I trust that the Prime Minister will see that matters are set right, and that an important industry is not unduly interfered with.",52
421,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"South Sydney) [9.52] - As this may be my last opportunity, I should like to refer to the case of Mr Hallam, a young telegraph operator in Tasmania, who has done some excellent work in connection with the Department. I asked for the papers relating to his case writsome three weeks ago, and I had hoped that they would be available long before this, so that I could speak with more assurance on the subject. I have taken a great deal of interest in the case of this voung man, because he appears to me to have displayed singular technical ability. I am informed that about eight years ago, of his own initiative, he erected a Marconi apparatus in Tasmania, and was able to hold communications with an incoming Russian vessel. This talented young officer was sent to Western Australia to initiate a long-distance telephone system there, and he also installed the condenser system. Later on ""He performed similar work in Queensland, and the honourable member for Maranoa has frequently made reference to the value of the services rendered by him. The honourable member for Coolgardie, who was at one time Postmaster-General, has also publicly acknowledged the very valuable services « rendered by Mr Hallam. I have brought this case under the notice of four successive Postmasters-General, each one of whom has told me that some public recognition should be made. Two of the Ministers told me that they were sorry I had mentioned the case, because they had fully made up their minds to deal with it. But nothing has been done. I recently saw a notification in the Commomoealth Gazette, which indicated that for all the services rendered by this promising young officer, which have been acknowledged over and over again, he has been granted a gratuity of £ 2 5 , and is being retained in the very subordinate position which he has occupied for a considerable number of years. I think that where our public servants show such diligence and special aptitude, and do valuable special work outside of the ordinary routine, some greater recognition should be given to them. I know that the_political heads of the Department say that nothing can be done in consequence of the matter being under the contiol of the Public Service Commissioner, and I suppose that if we were to see the Public Service Commissioner he would tell us that it was a case in which Ministerial action was required. I think that something should be done, and I take this last opportunity to appeal to the Postmaster General to suitably recognise the signal ability of this young officer.",53
422,Mr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Corangamite) [9.57]-I wish to emphasize the remarks of the honourable member for Moira, who has referred to a matter of great importance and urgency. The regulations relating to the grading of butter have been see-sawing about for the last six months, and the exporters, who are now approaching the busiest time of the year, do not know where they are. I was at a recent meeting of representatives of those engaged in the co-operative marketing of butter, at which an attempt was made to bring expert information before the Minister, and to induce him to bring into operation a workable set of regulations. It was then agreed that the certificates is^ sued by the Department should be numbered, and certificates should be sent h6me with the shipments, and that numbers corresponding witH those on the certificates should be placed on the boxes. The Minister promised Chat' that reasonable arrangement should be carried out, and all » the exoorters ask i's that the question shall be satisfactorily settled at once. I am wry glad that'the honourable member for Moira mentioned the matter, because it is one of very great importance.",54
423,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Franklin) [9.59]. - I have never been able to understand the want of action of successive Postmasters-General in the matter referred to by the honourable member for South Sydney. Mr Hallam, who occupied a somewhat obscure position in Hobart, - devoted the whole of his time to certain experiments. If he had applied his ability and energv to furthering his own fortunes, and had secured the patent rights of what was practically his discovery, instead of handing over the whole results of his work to the Department, he would have occupied a very different position. The work he did in Western Australia saved the Government many thousands of pounds. Up to the present, however, his serviceshave not been recognised. It is discreditable to the Government that, after four years of waiting, this officer should be granted the magnificent gratuity of £ 2 5 . If I were in his place, I should decline to accept it. I sincerely hope that the Government will yet see their way clear to grant him a sum which will be commensurate with his services to the Commonwealth.",54
424,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What has he done?,54
425,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He discovered a method of applying the condenser system, which practically revolutionized it, and made a success of what would otherwise have been a failure.",54
426,Mr MAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Coolgardie) [10.4] - Al though I do not know Mr Hallam personally, I wish to bear testimony to the excellent work which he performed in the Department, and to say that he did very useful work in Western Australia. The improvements which he recommended did not find favour with electricians there, who questioned their efficacy. But upon an appeal being made to the Postmaster General, that gentleman directed that experiments should be carried out, and, as a ' result, Mr Hallam established telephonic communication between Coolgardie and Lake Way, a distance of 250 miles, thus conferring an immense convenience on the residents of those places. As the result of his discovery, wherever there are telegraph lines the people are able to enjoy, to a limited extent, the benefits of telephonic communication, thus saving time and money. It was Mr Hallam's success in Western Australia which induced the Department to apply the system so generally throughout New South Wales and Victoria. I think that the Postmaster-General might fairly consider the claims of this officer. Certainly that has not been done upon the Estimates. I submit that the Department, instead of passing him over with an inadequate gratuity, ought to reward this man of genius with a substantial advance in the service. By so doing, we should make it evident to the rest of the officers that a good man, who puts brains into his work, will secure such substantial recognition as he would obtain outside. The Government might very well take a leaf from the book of the business and professional classes, who, if they' have an employee of special capacity, push him on, instead of keeping him back until his seniors die off. Not only in the matter of salary, but also in that of position, the Postmaster-General might very well decide to grant Mr Hallam a very .substantial advance.",54
427,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barker) External [10.8] - B y way of personal explanation, wish to say that I intended to vote in recent division.

I fully recognise the good service \yhich has been rendered by Mr anxiety Hallam and another Tasmanian offiform cer, who was his colleague. As a matter of fact, we have already given Mr Hallam a larger share of responsibility, and increase of salary. But I intend to bring his case, and that of the other officer whom I have referred, before my colprinciple leagues, with a view to ascertaining ther we ought not in some way to recognise the good servioe which they have rendered to the Commonwealth. I quite agree that where officers devote themselves to the vice, and are men of genius, they receive some substantial recognition in the way of promotion. Immediately portunity offers, in the interests of Department-apar t from considerations common justice-w e propose to do somecontends thing for Mr Hallam. Bearing in. mind the strong representations which have been made to-night, - I promise the honortificate able member for South Sydney that I bring this matter under the attention my colleagues.",55

431,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat--Minister of Affairs) [10.10] - So far as I am 1 acquainted with the matter which was menthe tioned by the honourable member for Moira, I his statement as to the circumstances surrounding the framing of the regulations under the Commerce Act is quite accurate. At the last moment, however, there has been a misunderstanding between my colleague and the honourable members who spoken. The honourable member for - I Moira has referred to the stamping of butter boxes under Part V. instead of under Part III . of the Act. It is evident, to from what he said, that the intention of I have the Regulation has not been made clear. As the Minister himself-in reply to a question the other day-expresse d his that the introduction of this new of control should be made as considerate as possible, I take it that his remark will cover cases of misapprehension a small of this kind. The Department is now preparing an addition to the regulations to which will enable effect to be given to the of concession which he has laid whedown in this, as well as in other cases.",55
432,Mr KENNEDY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it imperative that the information which is embodied in the cersertificate under Part III . of the Act shall be ought to stamped upon the boxes? an op Mr DEAKIN - As I understand the the position, that is where the difference of of opinion has arisen. The honourable member that what is to be stamped upon the box is the number only, and that the particulars are to be embodied in the cerbearing the same number, which will is to accompany it. The understanding of of the Minister was that this was to be done only under Part V. of the Act, and that under Part III . the information embodied the certificate should also be stamped on the box. As there has been a misunderstanding, the Minister admits that it is desirable that steps should be taken to allow the view which is entertained by honourable members to be adopted, at all events to experimentally and for a sufficient time. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.12 p.m.",55
