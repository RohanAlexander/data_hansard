1,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,Unknown,"I should like to know whether the Government have arrived at any decision in regard to the recommittal of the item "" tea.""",14
2,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"The Government are of the same opinion in regard to the necessity for a duty upon tea as they were before. They hold the strong belief that it will ultimately be found necessary to impose a duty of 2d. per lb. upon tea, in order that embarrassment may not'result to the finances of some of the. States. At the same time, they do not think that they can ask for a recommittal of the item now with any prospect of succeeding in re-imposing the duty. They have decided to watch the working of things under present conditions, and if they have any further proposal to make, it will be made next session. QUEENSCLIFF RIFLE RANGE.  Defence, upon notice I. What are the reasons why the rifle range previously used by the rifle club at Queenscliff was closed ? 2. What is the distance of the new rifle range from Queenscliff?",14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The old rifle range at Queenscliff was closed to ""303 rifles on account of the increased penetration and increased range obtainable from the weapon, and the dangerous position of the line of fire. 2, The proposed range is not more than 1£ miles from Queenscliff post-office.

8,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"The debate ' o n the second reading of the Judiciary Bill was postponed for a fortnight, which defers until after the Easter holidays.

11,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown," The Government realise that this there are a number of honourable members who, if they cannot leave Melbourne this afternoon, will not be able to reach their on homes until late on Friday, and as the Easter recess is a very short one, it is not fair to deprive them of any portion of it if we can avoid doing so. We have still to for deal with the timber exemptions and the duty upon empty match-boxes, which be diswere postponed, and I have also given notice of my intention to move the recommittal of a number of items. I think that the motion for the recommittal of those items might be allowed to go without debate, because honourable members, by agreeing to it, will not prejudice their right to discuss to the fullest extent any amendments which I move in regard to the items recomHonorable members have also given notice of their intention to move the recommittal of other items, and we have, as fur as we could, incorporated in our proposal so all the items which wo think should be reI f honourable members will now let us know what further items they desire to have recommitted, and there are not a very large number of them, I will see if I it can meet their wishes by allowing the it recommittal to take place without oppoour sition on our part. We cannot be expected to consent to the recommittal of a large part of the Tariff to deal with a great number of small items ; but if. the items which honourable members wish to have, reconsidered arc not too numerous, we shall be pleased to about meet their wishes. When the recommittals are agreed upon, honourable members who wish to get away this afternoon will be able to do so.",15
12,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown," I recognise that honourable members should confine their proposals for recommittal to items in regard to which there is a reasonable chance of altering the opinion of the committee.

I am told that combs and cutters are now being admitted free by the Custom-bouse officers, but to remove all doubt I think the words "" including combs and cutters"" ought to be added.",17
54,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Do I understand that the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V . L . Solomon, has given notice that the item tea be recommitted ?",17
55,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,Yes .,17
56,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I would ask for the of ruling of the Chairman as to whether the honourable member ought not to have given,17
57,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The Treasurer gave of his intention to recommit certain items, and then, with the concurrence of the committee, this afternoon, the standing have been so far departed from as to - allow honourable members an opportunity to intimate what items they also propose to ask to have recommitted. The recommittal must come from the House. Mr Speaker must decide the point raised by the honourable member for Kennedy. Sir GEORGE TURNER,-There seems to be a pretty strong feeling in the commit-. tee that as ash, oak, and walnut are used in the manufacture of the better and more valuable class of furniture, they might as well be placed upon the dutiable list. I do not include hickory, which is used very largely in the manufacture of vehicles. But, as we are making other kinds of timber, which are used in the manufacture of the poorer classes of furniture, dutiable, there are strong reasons why these woods also should be dutiable. I therefore move That the words ""ash, oak, walnut"" be omitted: Amendment agreed to.",17
58,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown," I m o v e That the words "" logs, not sawn "" be omitted. AVe have plenty of almost every kind of timber growing in the Commonwealth and need not import it in the log. We can cut our own timber.",18
59,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown, This is going back too far. I would ask the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs what they think about the amendment ?,18
60,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,It is very comprehensive. Teak and other woods that are not grown in Australia are imported in the log.,18
61,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I understand that the honourable member for Moreton desires t'.iat teak shall not be admitted free. I do not see why we should reverse the decision we have already come to. The committee thoroughly understood the principle of what was done, and I must ask honourable members to so vote on this amendment as to prevent timber in the log being removed from the exemption list. I shall certainly divide the committee upon the proposal.",18
62,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown," The attitude of the Government with regard to the amendment is that they will stick to the exemption list as it stands. There is ample protection in other ways in regard to the introduction of logs not sawn. The importation of timber in this form also affords some amount of employment to those engaged in cutting the wood. We have strong view's with regard to' the Queensland timber industry, to which I will refer later on Amendment negatived.",18
63,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown," This , seems to be the place at which to move an amendment placing New Zealand white pine Upon the exemption list. I move That the words "" of sizes 12 inches by 6 inches (or its equivalent) or over,"" after the words "" N e w Zealand pine, undressed "" be omitted. My object is to let in white pine duty free. I wish the committee to understand that I am not in favour of letting in kauri and other pines free, but simply that which is used in the manufacture of butter boxes and f r u it cases.",18
64,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,Kaur i is used for f r u it cases.,18
65,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"I am not interested in anything but white pine. The proposal of the Government is to allow a rebate on the export of butter boxes and f r u it cases, but that does not meet the case. This is a very serious item to the dairying industry of the Commonwealth. No doubt many honourable members will argue that the tax would be very small indeed per lb. of butter, but what makes the success of dairying is the studying of every economy that can possibly be effected. If honourable members were well up in dairying, they would understand that in milking a cow there would be no sense in leaving a couple of quarts of milk in the udder. The milk must all . be taken away if the dairy farm is to be successful. Similarly in other matters it is necessary to practise the utmost economy, and the added expense involved in the manufacture of butter boxes if this wood is to be taxed wiU'fall heavily upon the butter producers. The timber in question is imported some months before it is used. For instance, a shipment was introduced in a vessel of 233 tons. The duty paid upon the shipment was £250, and other charges made the importation cost £321 in all. The wood of which I speak was brought into the Commonwealth last November, and would not be used until November twelve months. I am aware that there is a proposal on foot to create a timber bond, but that would be unsatisfactory as a solution of the difficulty. This timber is planed in long lengths, and I cannot understand how a timber bond could be created unless the boards were cut up before they left bond to sizes suitable for the making of butter boxes. If that were done it would mean a heavy expense in handling the wood, each plank of which has to .go through the planing machine twice. If .it had to receive a separate handling in - bond it would mean a heavy expense. duty would amount to 2d. on each box. The Treasurer will admit that that is a fair ^estimate. I am aware that some honourable members will advocate a duty on this box timber. Probably the honourable member - for Richmond will do so. I happened to be in his district recently. He had said 'that the farmers there are protectionists who believe in using everything - grown as far as possible. There is a operative factory at .Byron Bay. When I - was there I asked whether local timber was used for butter boxes, and was told that it was unsuitable. I asked, "" Why not use the local timber f The answer was, "" We - do use it for the local market, but we - are afraid to risk it for export."" ,is a certain amount of ' doubt to its ,use for sending '- butter England. There has been a lot of corre spondence in the local papers on the subject, .and the Victorian dairy expert, Mr Crowe, .condemns the Queensland timber, which he - considers to be unsuitable. The New Zealand white pine is very useful for the purpose, but the Queensland pine is said to make the butter smell somewhat."" I am - aware that it is used in Queensland, but I - do not see why the Victorian and New South Wales dairying industry, which has .done so much for the prosperity of those two States, should be hampered in order to - create a demand for Queensland Perhaps in saying that I may be supposed - to be speaking in opposition to the protectionist point of view, but I confess' that I am getting rather tired of free-trade and protectionist speeches. I am certainly . advocating free-trade in butter-boxes, and the matter affects my electorate considerably. I hope that the committee will agree to this ""timber being placed on the free list. It has been said by many that the tax is a very small one. If it is to be continued, how-ever, the Colac Butter Factory will have to pay £400 a year in respect of the duty, and - other butter factories in Victoria will be .in a similar position. I understand that New Zealand white pine is delivered in Melbourne at 10s. 6d. per 100 super, feet, whilst Queensland pine is delivered f.o.b. for 13s. per 100 super, feet. - that charge freight has to be added, and -.1 think I am well within the mark in saying that the cost to the butter factories will Mr Manifold. be fully 50 per cent, in excess of the charge for New Zealand white pine. I have This studied that question, having been interested in the dairying industry for a considerable time, and I have also made inquiries as to whether the proposed rebate on New Zealand timber used for butter boxes sent out of the Commonwealth will meet the difficulty. I am led to understand that it will not, and that is my own belief. The manufacturers of the boxes will require locally interest on their money, and I am sure the co- duty will result in an increased cost of 2£d. per box. :",18
66,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Richmond).^In view of the fact that it isproposed to adjourn this afternoon, I do not desire to discuss the abstract question of free-trade and protection, and I shall confine myself to a stateThere ment of facts, unvarnished by any rhetoric. as If any protection is to be given to our to industries, it should be applied all round A solid phalanx of honourable members identified with the city of Melbourne fought for the duty on nails, and when the same honourable members oppose any protection being given to the timber industry of New South Wales and Queensland, those engaged in that industry are inclined to view their attitude with a considerable '- amount of dissatisfaction. We have nothing but feelings of the greatest gratitude towards the Ministers in charge of the Tariff. They have done their work fearlessly and valorously in the interests of Australia timber. as a whole; but the moment we come to a duty that touches some honourable member's own constituents, we find him thinking only of the position of those constituents, and forgetting his responsibilities to the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Corangamite was absolutely correct in saying that in the northern parts of New South Wales the local pine has not come into general use for butter-box making. Like every other local industry it has had to fight the prejudice of the exporters and of the community generally against everything that is local. The prejudice against New South Wales pine is such that if a Sydney exporter had his way he would not allow a particle of the local pine to be worked up into butter boxes; and as some of the factories in the northern parts of To New South Wales are run by southerners, there is considerable difficulty in overcoming the, antagonism to the local article. The facts of the matter are simple. The official reports received by the Government, which I have in my possession, show that the supply of pine available in New South Wales and Queensland is unlimited. Therefore the question resolves - itself into one as to the suitability of the timber for butter bos-making. The local article has been used by the Creamery - and Butter Company on the Tweed River for the last three years, without any fault being, found with ' it. Tests have been made by the department of Agriculture of New South Wales, and the analytical chemist reports that butter on being taken out of boxes made from the local pine is found to be just as pure and sound as it is when it leaves those made from New Zealand pine. The officer in charge of the northern forests of New South Wales speaks of the - supply of timber as being inexhaustible. If this timber can be supplied at the same price as that charged for New Zealand white pine, and is just as suitable for the purpose of butter boxes, what objection can there be to its use ?",19
67,Mr FULLER,Unknown,It cannot be supplied at the same price.,20
68,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Thos e engaged in the industry-undertake to do so. The weight of a butter-box made of local pine is 9 lbs. 15 ozs., as against 8 lbs. 12 ozs., the weight of a butter-box made of New Zealand pine, and that constitutes the whole objection to it. I %vould point out, however, that the weight of a butter-box made of the local article conies within the limit allowed to shippers. Even if the New South Wales or Queensland pine were found unsuitable, with the result that Victorian dairymen were called upon to pay this duty, the total increased cost would be at the extremest statement onethirtieth of a penny per lb. of butter. The Victorian dairyman has protection for his butter, his bacon, his cheese, and other products; but when the timber industry of New South Wales and Queensland asks for a tax, which at the very worse can be equal only to one-thirtieth of a penny per lb. of butter, he objects to pay it . I maintain that the New South Wales and Queensland pine will be found suitable, and that the only difficulty which has to be overcome is the prejudice against anything local. Now that the Government offer to allow a rebate on New Zealand pine used for butter boxes sent out of the Commonwealth, I appeal to honourable members to agree to this duty. If this pine were found in Victoria, what kind of a fight would be made for the duty? On behalf of those interested in the timber industry of New South Wales and Queensland, I would go so far as to offer to abandon the demand for a duty on timber used in the manufacture of butter-boxes, but seek protection against imported white pine used for other purposes. The honourable member for Corangamite bases his claim for the remission of this duty on the ground that it will injure the dairying industry. Those of us who are anxious that it should be imposed say"" Take your timber for butter-boxes free,"" and we .offer practically every thing that men who will not stand up to their fiscal principles seek to get. But let us give those engaged in the timber industry of Australia a fair opportunity in a protected market. I would rather see timber required for mining purposes at Broken Hill allowed to come in free, than flood the whole of the local timber market in the interests of that district. In the interests of a great Australian industry, surely honourable members will see that it is not a fair thing that timber coming in free, ostensibly for the purpose of being employed in the manufacture of butter-boxes, should be used for other purposes and destroy the demand for local timber.",20
69,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"I trust that in this matter we shall be at least consistent, and not make fish of one State and flesh of another. I think the Government can take credit for this : that hitherto they have done what they can for the purpose of treating all the States on the same principle, both in regard to the question of revenue and the question of protection. Where there is an industry worthy of protection in any State, whichever it may be, the Government areprepared to do what they can to protect it. They regard the timber industry of Queensland as one of the most important in Australia, and worthy at least of the encouragement which is proposed. And to what does this encouragement amount ? The honourable member for Corangamite has told us that the duty will involve an increased cost of 2d. per 'butterbox. But the honourable member's estimate is based on the duty originally proposed of 2s. Gd. per 100 super, feet. As it stands now, however, it is only Is. 6d. per 100 super, feet, so that he will have to reduce his estimate to l-!d. An outcry was raised that the duty would not meet the position of those who use butter-boxes. into its present form, and then, the representations, made to us in perfect good faith, that there was no timber to be found in Australia which would be suitable for butter-box making, we consented to a different reading of the duty, timber used for that purpose to come in free. At present the position is that an important industry in the great State of Queensland-third or fourth in magnitude among the industries of Australia-asks assistance, which at the most would involve an increased cost of 1-id. per bucter-box.' What would that be when calculated on the basis of 56 lbs. of butter, which a box of this description might beexpected to contain? The case which is made out against the imposition of this duty is that it will add to the cost of butter-boxes which have to be sent outside the Commonwealth, and that our butter makers' have to compete in the foreign market. To meet that objection it is proposed that a drawback equal to the amount of duty paid shall be allowed in respect of the imported timber used in butter-boxes sent out of the Commonwealth. Is it to be tolerated that a Government which has proposed duties such as we have proposed and carried, with the assistance of various honourable members, should be denied the support of those honourable when seeking to do a small act of justice to such a great industry as this? "" Live and let live ""-what is good for the Victorian manufacturer is good for the Queensland producer. Why should one industry be given consideration another denied any? As much as possible has been done for the puipose of protecting the butter industry. States Governments have from time to time taken this industry under paternal care, and have assisted it by providing bonuses and cheap freight, and in a variety of other ways. Has this interest now to be further coddled at the expense of another great industry ? Are the principles on which we have acted in dealing with the question of protection in other respects to be ignored in the present case 1 I should like to say a good deal more, but we all know the exigencies of the case in reference to time. The Government, however, feel very strongly on the question. It is necessary that there should be fair all round treatment of these national questions, and, having regard to' the fact that this is simply Mr Kingston We put it protection, we trust the item may be allowed believing to stand.  of the Minister for Trade and Customs is really an attempt, if I may be permitted to say so, to mislead the committee. The right allowing honourable gentleman talks about giving protection to the butter industry ; but can he, or. any honourable member, show me that under the Tariff protection is given to anybody connected with the butter trade in for Australia ? From start to finish everything has been done to saddle those engaged in the dairying industry-to make them pay as much taxation as possible. It is absolutely impossible to raise the price of butter one single penny by means of protection, seeing that the industry depends on the export trade to England and other parts of the world. We have to deal not only with boxes for butter which goes into the markets of the world. All butter sent from one part of a State to another, or between States,- has to be conveyed in boxes in the same way as butter sent to England ; and, therefore, the industry has to bear a tax not only on the boxes, on which a rebate is proposed, but on all boxes used in Australia.",20
70,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Supposin g that be so, what members does the tax amount to ?",21
71,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"It amounts to a considerable sum. If the honourable member for Richmond consulted the dairy farmers in his district, I fancy he would not advocate this duty. The dairying industry has and done far more' for the prosperity of New South Wales and Victoria than has timber growing. The Mr EWING - The dairymen of my district would be ashamed of me if I put the case their in any other way than that in which I have put it .",21
72,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I do not think so. I know that in my district there is a number of dairy farmers who have expressed great dissatisfaction with the proposals of the Government in this connection. The objection comes not only from the dairy farmers of New South Wales, but also from the dairy farmers of Victoria. Some time back when the Minister for Trade and Customs was waited upon with reference to this matter, he promised that, provided Dr Wollaston agreed with the representations made, he would remit the duty upon pine. Dr temporary Wollaston agreed to - the remission, but, strange to say, we now see the Minister for Trade and Customs standing up in support of a duty which will bear very heavily on an important section of the community.",21
73,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,What has Dr Wollaston to do with remitting duties ?,22
74,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"T can only take the reports I have read, and point to the fact that no denial has been given by the Minister, or by anybody else on behalf of the Government. This appears to me to be a class tax which will bear very heavily on one of the large producing industries of the Commonwealth. There has been a series of droughts which dairymen have had to fight and have fought cheerfully, and they have had their labour troubles to an extent equal to, if not grester than, has been experienced in other industries. AVe have seen from time to time during the last six months that a large number of dairy farmers have given up the industry in consequence of difficulties in obtaining labour, and, on the top of all these troubles, it is proposed to impose this tax. And why is the proposal made? Simply in order to develop the timber industry of Queensland. Protectionists and free-traders alike would be glad to see that timber industry progress and flourish; but we object to see it flourish at the expense of another, and, perhaps, more important industry. It is said that the Queensland pine is just as suitable for butter-boxes as is New Zealand white pine, and the honourable member for Richmond has alluded to the fact that the local timber has for some time past been used for this purpose in the northern part of New South Wales. It is, therefore, contended that the whole of the Commonwealth ought to use the Queensland pine. We know, however, that in the north of'New South Wales this timber is grown right alongside the factory, and would be used irrespective of the fact whether there is , or is not a duty. It will be admitted by every representative of Queensland that the pine forests of that district are a considerable distance from the sea-shore. honourable member for Wide Bay has mentioned that the large revenue of £85,000 odd is paid to the Government by those engaged in the timber industry-that is in bringing timber to Brisbane for exportation and for other purposes. But it must be remembered that the New Zealand forests are immediately pn the sea coast; and the freight for bringing pine from New Zealand to the Commonwealth must, in consideration of the commerce between the countries, always be smaller than that nt which it would be possible to bring pine from Queensland to New South Wales or other States. New Zealand sailing vessels bring over this pine timber at an average freight of 3s., and are always certain of a return cargo, there being a big trade in salt, coal, and other commodities. On the other hand, for vessels from Queensland there are not these advantages, and the lowest possible freight, from Queensland to Melbourne, for example, is 5s. by a sailing vessel.",22
75,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Still , we can provide butter-boxes at the price of the boxes made from imported timber.",22
76,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I know the honourable member for Richmond is prepared to do a lot, but what he says can be done, has not been done so far. At the present time the mills in Queensland are capable of supplying only 1,500,000 feet of timber, whereas the requirements of the Coinrnonweolth are about 22,000,000 feet.",22
77,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Nonsense ! ,22
78,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I am taking official records. AVhat would be the position of the dairy farmers if there were a shortage of timber for this purpose, and they had to depend on the supply from Queensland? While the dairying industry has done much in building up the prosperity of Victoria and New South Wales, I can assure honourable members that there is a very small margin of profit to those who are interested, and every imposition such as that now proposed tends to make their lot harder. One factory in my district uses 100 boxes every day, about one-third of which are for export ; and taking the tax at Id., this would mean £20 0 per annum.",22
79,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,What is the percentage on the box ?,22
80,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I have not calculated the percentage. If this expenditure be extended over the whole of the indusThe try, it is very heavy. In 1901, according to the latest statistics, there were manufactured in New South Wales 41,000,000 lbs. of butter, of which 10,000,000 lbs. were exported, and in order to provide boxes at the rate I have calculated, many thousands of pounds sterling would be required. The dairying industry has been a big success, not only in New South Wales and Victoria, but also in Tasmania and Queensland. It is a remarkable thing that, although they have in Queensland the enormous forests of pine, to which honourable members have referred, and are able to produce suitable timber for the making of butter-boxes, a very large quantity of New ' Zealand pine was, notwithstanding the duty of 4s. per 100 feet, imported into that State during the years 1900 and 1901, to be made into butter-boxes ; and in 1901 one New Zealand firm alone imported into Queensland over 7,000 boxes. Not only were the direct importations from New Zealand very large, but a great deal of New Zealand pine was supplied to Queensland from Sydney. Those facts are very remarkable, in view of what has been said as to the superiority of Queensland pine over New Zealand pine, and the facilities which they have in Queensland for making up the timber. I feel very keenly upon this subject, because from start to finish, throughout the Tariff, those engaged in the primary industries have been heavily saddled with the burdens of taxation, and they have been - given no compensating advantages. AVe cannot assist the dairyman by imposing duties upon his produce, and I , therefore, object to attempts to make dearer the materials which he has to use.",22
81,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown," The question with which we are now dealing is ix very important one, because it affects one of the most valuable industries in the Commonwealth-the butter industry.",23
82,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"And .the meat, the tallow, and the fruit industries.",23
83,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,"I think that nothing should be done to prejudice the butter industry, though, at the same time, I am anxious to do justice to the State of Queensland by assisting its timber industry. It appears to me that the proposal of the Government does not meet the case. I understand that they intend to allow a drawback upon the export of butter-boxes equal to the amount of the duty on the timber used in their manufacture ; but as a large number of small dairymen have their own separators and make their own butter, they will have to pay the duty, while the merchants who buy it and export it will obtain the drawback. If the Government can devise Si means which will secure the payment of the drawback to the individuals who pay the duty, I shall be prepared to support their proposal; but, if they cannot, I shall not feel. justified in jeopardizing an important industry for a doubtful advantage, because I do not know that it has yet been proved that the Queensland pine is as suitable for butter-boxes as is the New Zealand pine. I understand from the honourable member for Corangamite that, although they have white pine on the Richmond River, the local butter factories do not use it for their butter-boxes.",23
84,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Yes , they do.",23
85,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,"I am willing to give the Queensland timber the benefit of any doubt as to its suitability ; but, unless the Government can provide against the injustice to which I have referred, I must vote to place New Zealand pine upon the free list. A very little matter seriously affects the butter industry, and during last year a few adverse circumstances vastly reduced our export of butter.' Every State is interested in this industry, and it is an industry which has done a great deal to keep people in the country districts during the years of depression which have prevailed in the past. I hope the Government will look carefully into the matter, and, if necessary, postpone the consideration of the exemption, to give an opportunity for obtaining a solution of the difficulty.",23
86,Mr THOMSON,Unknown," The Minister for Trade and Customs seems to be very contemptuous in regard to the effect of increasing the cost of butter-boxes by 2d. each ; but I know that to increase their price by 2d. or 3d. is enough, under certain circumstances, to cut Australian butter out of the London market. The Government say that if drawback is allowed upon the boxes exported the whole trouble will be avoided ; but I wish to point out that the drawback allowed on the timber used in the boxes will not represent the duty originally paid. To the duty per 100 feet on imported timber, there must be added the holding charges to allow for seasoning, the loss through deterioration by cracking and in other ways, the off-cuts in makingup the boxes, the reduction by sawing and planing, and other expenses for which the Minister's proposal makes no allowance. The butter industry has been referred to as though it were the only one affected, but there are other large exporting industries which also depend for their success upon getting cheap timber. New Zealand pine is used in making meat cases, tallow casks, f r u it cases, aud for other purposes in connection with industries which have to struggle hard in foreign markets against the competition of the world.",23
87,Mr EWING,Unknown,Perhaps it would be all right if they could get a little more cheap labour.,24
88,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not know if the honourable member thinks that the labour employed in New Zealand is cheap labour, but if so I may tell him that the saw-mill employees of New Zealand are even better paid than are those in the Australian States. I have no desire to do anything that will injure the Queensland timber trade, but I have already shown that the present duty upon Queensland timber, instead of encouraging that trade, seems to have had rather the contrary effect, because the Queensland output of soft woods was, in proportion to population, greater before the duty was imposed than it is now. I would further point out to the representatives of Queensland, that the Government proposal, instead of benefiting the Queensland timber industry, is likely to prove harmful to it , because the makers of butter boxes will not stock two different kinds of timber for the purpose. They will be required to supply boxes for local use, and boxes for export, and that being so, they will hold only timber upon which tliey can obtain drawback. While the Ministry have considered one large importing industry to some extent, though not fully, they have not considered our other large exporting industries at all, and they seem prepared to allow the expenses of those industries to be increased at a time when no increase can be afforded.",24
89,Mr FISHER,Unknown," I think it would be somewhat unfair to let the statement that the Queensland pine is unsuitable for the manufacture of butter boxes for export pass unnoticed. When the subject was first discussed in this Chamber, the main issue was the unsuitability of Queensland pine for that purpose, but that has been abandoned, and today no one says that it is unsuitable.",24
90,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,It has been stated today that it is unsuitable.,24
91,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No proof has been given in support of that statement, and, on the contrary, we have testimony from London that Queensland butter exported in Queensland boxes has brought the highest prices in the market. The farmers and dairymen have excellent advocates in this Chamber, and their interests are not. likely to suffer on that score. I admit the statement of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra that the freight on timber is higher from Queensland 'to Victoria than from New Zealand to Victoria, but, with a larger trade, the Inter-Sfcate rates will be reduced, and Queensland timber will then be obtainable at more reasonable prices than those prevailing now. The whole question is whether Queensland pine can be obtained cheaply enough to allow it to become a substitute for New Zealand white pine. I have no doubt that in time Queensland pine will wholly supplant New Zealand pine, because we have the testimony of our own dairymen that it makes better and stronger boxes, and that the butter exported in such boxes brings higher prices than the butter exported in boxes made of New Zealand pine. It has been urged thatevenifthe users of butter boxes are granted a drawback in respect to boxes used in connection with the export of butter, the concession will not be sufficient, because a large number of boxes are used in the distribution of butter for local consumption. That may be quite true, but if we are correct in saying that Queensland timber is stronger and better than is the New Zealand pine, the boxes of which it is constructed, instead of being destroyed, will be returned, and will in the end prove very much cheaper than those made of New Zealand pine.",24
92,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"'Does not the honourable member think that the dairymen would find that out, without a duty upon New Zealand pine 1",24
93,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not wish to inteifere with the dairymen in conducting their business. I look upon the farmers as a most intelligent and able body of men who are quite competent to look after their own affairs, but it is our business as representatives of Queensland to brush aside the erroneous statements which have beeu made with reference to Queensland timber, and to support the reasonable proposal of the Government. The honourable member for Illawarra attached great importance to the fact that 7,000 butter boxes had been imported into Queensland, but I would point out to him that the Lowood Creamery Company alone are using over 1,000 boxes per week, .all made from Queensland pine. They sayThis timber (New Zealand white pine) splits with little or no cause; goes monUly very quickly ; does not present half as bright and clear a surface, and is otherwise greatly inferior to the Queensland pine, which latter on the other hand we find is fairly dense, very tough and strong; rarely splits, stands any amount of rough usage in transport without damage; does not tusto or discolour the butter : is just under regulation weight, and mokes an ideal box for the export of butter. Our company holds excellent reports from London as to the quality of the butter, and the superior quality of the boxes is specially mentioned. The chairman of the Silverwood Dairy Factory saysWe have found the Queensland pine very much better than the New Zealand pine for shipping, as the boxes hold the nails well, and being a harder pine it does not crack so readily as the New Zealand article. Here is a statement made by the manager of the Logan Co-operative Butter Factory, WoolloongabbaThe Queensland timber we have found to be quite free from injurious flavouring, and the batter has been opened in the London market sweet and free from injury in this respect, bringing the highest price for colonial butter in ber, 1900. We would certainly not export butter in New Zealand pine boxes under any circumstances, even if supplied here much cheaper than Queensland pine boxes. There is no'question as to the superiority of the Queensland timber, and there should be no hesitancy on the part of the committee in imposing a duty, even from a strictly revenue point of view.",24
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," No electorate in the Commonwealth will be more seriously affected by this duty than that which I represent. The proposal of the Ministry would have the effect of penalizing the fruit-growers and dairymen to the extent of at least l ^ d . per box, which is equivalent to from 4d. to 6d. per acre on dairying land, and from 5s. to 6s. per acre on orchard land. According to the ""Victorian estimate of the yield of orchards, the value of the f r u it derived averages £ 1 1 per acre, and, if in order to market £ 1 1 worth of fruit, an additional outlay of at least from 5s. to 6s. will be involved, as the result of this duty, I think honourable members will see that we shall be penalizing an important industry in a manner entirely inconsistent with sound ideas as to what is needed to produce national prosperity.",25
95,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"We cannot finally settle this matter today, and, under the circumstances, I suggest, with the consent of the honourable member for Corangamite, that we should pass the exemptions as they stand at present, on the understanding that we shall continue the administration on existing lines, and that we shall recommit the exemptions at a later stage.",25
96,Mr THOMA S,Unknown," If it were agreed that New Zealand white pine should be admitted free of duty, would it be competent for me to move that mining timber should also be admitted free ?",25
97,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,It will be quite competent for - the honourable member to move in that direction.,25
98,Mr ISAACS,Unknown, I understand that the Government are not asking the committee to arrive at a decision today ?,25
99,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"We are asking the committee to pass the exemptions as they stand pro forma, because we are bound to dispose of them before we can have them recommitted.",25
100,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"There seems to be some doubt as to the facts of the case, and I should like to know if the Minister could give us some details as to the suitability of DecemQueensland pine for the purposes of butter and f r u it packing-mor e particularly for butter packing-as to thequantity that could be supplied, and as to the possibility of granting a drawback in all proper cases. It will not be sufficient to provide for a drawback only in respect to boxes used for packing butter for export unless some proper substitute can be found for the New Zealand pine. Not only the export but the home market trade will have to be provided for.",25
101,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"I shall supply the committee with all possible, information upon the points mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Indi. On behalf of the honourable member for Corangamite, I shall ask leave to withdraw his amendment, and request honourable members to agree to the remainder of the exemptions pro forma, as they will afterwards be recommitted.

107,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I trust that the committee will follow me in what I have now to say, because I do not want to have any misunderstanding hereafter. Honourable members have in their hands /the printed list of exemptions proposed by the Government. I desire to add to them one other exemption, so as to alter the wording of item No. 134. I desire to make it read""distilled from barley, malt, molasses, either wholly or mixed with grape-wine."" That is to meet a difficulty which has been experienced. I now turn to the printed list which has been - circulated, and desire to move the recommittal of some of the items therein mentioned, together with the other items of which notice of recommittal has been given this afternoon. Those are-the notices given by Mr Kennedy, for a rebate of 3s. per owt. on sugar used in certain manufactures; by Mr V . L .

The timber exemptions are also to be recommitted; or maize, and to make perfectly certain that no mistake is made, and in order to meet the desire of the honourable member for Barrier, we also propose to recommit timber undressed, so as to allow an amendment to be moved with regard to Oregon in. sizes 12 inches by 6 inches and over. Another item which it has been suggested should bo recommitted is tea. I do not know whether the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V . L . Solomon, desires to proceed with that item. If so, the Government have already intimated that they will have to vote against the motion.",26
