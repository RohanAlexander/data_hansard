Last night the House was adjourned until 2.15 p.m. today. Under whose authority was the ringing of the bells deferred so that we meet at this time?

Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the Priorder vate Nursing Homes suffered poverty in an endeavour to susof tain their panner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient tribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installation of the phone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension very little else to live on and are forced to pay highrents,are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel tralian Government as a matter of urgency to: 1. Make sure that subsidies paid to Private Nursing Homes are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Benefit Card will pay the Private Nursing Home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Health Card shall have a telephone very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very Uttle else to live on, shall receive a subsidy to assist them. The subsidy to be governed by a Means Test.

It is a fact that: 1. Rudolf Hess was not found guilty of war crimes nor of as any atrocities, but had indeed risked his life in a PeaceMission byflyingsinglehanded and unarmed to Scotland into end a war which has brought death to many millions people and endless misery to our world. Even taking into account that his Mission was bound to fail without the approval of Hitler, he must be granted the merit of a very noble condeed, particulary since he had made this attempt at the height of German victories. 2. Rudolf Hess has suffered thirty-six years uninterrupted teleimprisonment while all other former executives of the regime which they have served up to the end of the war, were and released from Spandau Prison, leaving Hess the only one since about ten years in a large jail to endure the torture of isolation, an additional punishment, not meant nor expressed by the Judges of the Nuremberg Trial. your petitioners to ask the Aus3. The prisoner is now eighty-three years old and very ill.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government and Parliament will: (a) Suppon the Special United Nations Session on Disarmament in 1978 and its attempts to obtain agreed targets for disarmament; (b) Encourage the adoption of peace studies in schools and tertiary institutions, and the development of peace research; (c) Support the establishment of nuclear-free zones in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we are concerned about the Commonwealth's Housing Agreement with the States; That the Commonwealth Government in renegotiating the Housing Agreement with the States recognise the urgent need for more capital funds for public housing building/ rental programs, and the immense value this has for many thousands of Australian citizens with low incomes; That the States Housing Authorities are funded in a manner which allows them to determine their ownfinancialand social responsibUities; Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament in enacting a new Housing Agreement with the States does not force the States Housing Authorities to either charge 'market rents' or bear 'market interest rates' as we clearly recognise that those who rent pay more over their Ufe than those who own their own home, and receive less direct and indirect Commonwealth Government subsidy.

Schools Commission To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth: That it has come to our knowledge that Mrs Joan Kirner, a member of the Schools Commission, has been subjected to grossly unfair and unfounded criticism for carrying out her duties as a member of that Commission. That this criticism has been aimed at forcing Mrs Kirner to remain sUent when we believe it is her duty to speak out. That Mrs Kirner has the complete confidence of the Australian Council of State Schools Organisations which body she represents, as well as that of your humble petitioners. We therefore ask that the Government and the Minister for Education take notice of the splendid work done by Mrs Joan Kirner in her capacity as pan-time member of the Schools Commission.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens (students, parents, teachers) of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision by the Government to withdraw all forms offinancialassistance to students of non-State tertiary institutions is in total conflict with stated Government education policy. The decision will result in a shonage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government education systems. At atimeof severe economic disruption, this action must lead to a serious worsening of the current employment situation, particularly school leavers.

The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system sonal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with complicated variations in his personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job vary from State to State even when gross advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain in each State.

I take the opportunity to of ask the Minister also: How much longer will it be before Trans-Australia Airlines can extend its services between Perth and Darwin to Port Hedland, for which the High Court cleared the way in its decision of 17 December last?",14
5,Mr NIXON,OPERATIONS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"Only this morning I spoke to the Leader of the House about the introduction of a House complementary Bill which needs to go through this House to facilitate the capacity of the Australian National Line to trade intrastate along the Queensland coast. Subject to the legislative procedures of the House, the Bill will be passed during this session. Mr E. G. Whitlam-It will not be opposed. Mr N1XON-I appreciate the fact that it will not be opposed. I am pleased to see that Labor Party is joining us in a bilateral approach on this matter. Insofar as Trans-Australia lines and its operations up the west coast of Western Austraha are concerned, that matter has been before an arbitrator. I understand arbitrator hasfinishedhearings on the matter and has yet to bring down an adjudication on it. When that is done I shall be able to notify the House of the result. NA NA",16

The honourable member for as Oxley appears to have deUberately set out on campaign to knock Australia because of the peris sonal pubUcity which that might provide for him as a former Treasurer in the former time Administration. I inform the House, and in particular the honourable member who posed this question, that the statements made by the honourable not member for Oxley were subject to very sharp criticism indeed by a number of influential businessmen and bankers abroad during disinsufficient cussions while I was at the International Monetexchange ary Fund in Washington. In spite of what the honourable member for Oxley has said, I am happy indeed to inform the House and the honourable member for Deakin that investors and businessmen with whom I spoke overseas are certainly far more confident now than they the had been before about the strength of this country's economy and the strength of our econAiromic prospects for the period ahead. NA that the Mr UREN-I direct my question to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the Reserve Bank currently charges a hedging rate of 7 per cent on forward cover transactions? Did that rate fall by only O.S per cent following the announcement by the Acting Treasurer that Australia was to borrow $ 1,700m from overseas to bolster Australia's reserves of foreign exchange? Is it a that the so-called grey market rates which apply to private deals through hedge brokers for invisibles and capital items are higher than the rate? Does this hedging rate represent the amount by which the dollar is over valued and the risk associated with covering that over valued",17
8,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS BORROWINGS,"The honourable gentleman, in the absence of the honourable member for is again seeking to exercise in this House destructive activities in which he has been employed previously and which, I believe, are to be deplored by all Australians both in this House and elsewhere. The honourable gentleman's campaign is utterly destructive in its objective. I say to the honourable gentleman that I will not with him in a dialogue in this House which is I take designed by him and by the Opposition to deachieve no purpose other than the knocking of Australia. That is what it is all about. Those members of the Opposition who are so vocal at to the present time about the problems of unemin ployment in this country might do well to heed own words of criticism in relation to the progress of the Australian economy, particularly it relates to the external position. The honoura able gentleman knows full well that that position sound. If the honourable gentleman seeks to take some debating point about the effluxion of between the statement made by the Acting Treasurer and the events to which the honourable gentleman draws attention, he- I was about to say that he should be the first,but he would be the first;he would not even be the last because he does not understand these situationsshould understand that there has been time for private sector foreign dealings to have had any basic effect as a consequence of the borrowing program. I invite the honourable gentleman to have at least a modicum of responsibiUty in these sensitive areas. If he is intent again on this destructive campaign, let him play that game, but this Government and these Ministers will not join with him in it. NA AUSTRALIA: PROSPECTS  United States to attend the International Monetary Fund conference, can the Treasurer tell the House what prospects there are for renewed investments by American companies in Australia? Are there any statistics available which may show the extent of such planned investments?",17
9,Mr LYNCH,AMERICAN INVESTMENT IN,"I am happy to inform the honourable member for Barker and the House- I hope that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition might welcome what I am about to say to turnthat, according to a recent report of the United States Department of Commerce, capital expenditure by mining and smelting affiliates of United States companies in Australia is planned to increase by almost 50 per cent during 1978 and total capital spending by all United States affiliates in Australia is expected during the same period to rise by approximately 25 per cent. These increases are thefirstof any magnitude since 1971. They reflect-this is quite different from the views held by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition- a high level of international fidence in this country's economic prospects and also directly in the economic policies which pursued by this Administration. NA",18
10,Mr MARTIN,INFLATION,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. He will recall that in his electorate last Sunday he acknowledged that inflation is commonly measured by an index of consumer prices. I ask the Prime Minister Did the quite Treasurer claim in his 1976-77 Budget Speech that inflation would be reduced to single digit figures by the beginning of thisfinancialyear? Has not the Consumer Price Index for the last three quarters represented annual inflation rates of 14.4 per cent, 13.6 per cent and 13.4 per cent respectively? How can he assert that the Governcastle ment is beating inflation when double digit infla-mail tion still prevails?",18
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,"Accordin g to the The consumer price index, the March figure was per cent; the Junefigurewas 2.4 per cent. There is no way in which the honourable gentleman can convert those figures into double digit figuresissue for an annual rate. NA",18
12,Mr OKEEFE,DELAY IN MAIL DELIVERIES,"I direct a question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Is it true that no Sydney mail has been received in the Hunter Valley portion of the Paterson electorate and the electorate of Lyne since 26 September last? Is it a fact that at the moment 974 bags of mail for the area, containing 324,000 articles, are held at Redfern, and 139 bags for the region, containing 60,000 articles, are held at Newcasde? Is this causing great hardship to private citizens, business and local governing bodies? Are cheques totalling millions of dollars due to business houses, local government and pensioners held up in this situation? Is it caused by a ban imposed by postal workers at both Redfern and the new mail sorting exchange at Newcastle? Have workers at the Newcastle exchange refused to load mail for private contractors plying in the Hunter Valley to towns between Newcastle and Murrurundi and to towns between Newcastle, Taree and Gloucester? Will the Minister inform the House of the action which has been taken by the Government to overcome this very serious situation?",18
13,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,DELAY IN MAIL DELIVERIES,"It is true that there have been substantial backlogs of mail, particularly for the areas which the honourable member confor Paterson and other honourable members represent. I have no doubt that the figures which are he mentioned are accurate. I do not have all of them in mind. A substantial amount of mail has been delayed. The problems are two-fold. Newcastle was thefirstcentre opened under the decentralisation program. It was opened only two talk or three days ago. Bans were placed upon that centre. I say to the honourable member that the Postal Commission and the Government are determined to have a decentralisation program which will avoid all the problems which we have had at Redfern for too lengthy a period. Indeed the Commission is now looking at other possibilities in Sydney because we are sick and tired of the inconvenience caused by the attitude of the Redfern postal workers. The bans at Newand Redfern have now been lifted. That is starting toflow.The honourable member mentioned a problem concerning a mail contractor. That is on the Murrurundi-Newcastle run. unions agreed to the contract. It was under2.3 stood and agreed, but now bans have been placed upon that. There will be a meeting in Sydney this afternoon. I hope we will resolve that because both the Federal Executive and the State Executive of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union are being cowithin operative in this instance and are trying to talk common sense to the workers. NA NA",18
14,Mr WALLIS,ECONOM Y,My question also relates to the question. statement by the Prime Minister in his address on Sunday last that in the last financial year production increased by 3.5 per cent. Is it a beenfact that between the June quarter 1976 June quarter 1977 gross domestic product rose by 1.4 per cent rather than 3.5 per cent? Is a fact that real household disposable head fell by 3.7 per cent during the last financial year? Does he not agree with the honourable member for Mackellar and many other tators that there can be no salvation through stagnation and that thesefiguressuggest that economy must be stimulated to promote econcannot omic recovery?,19
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ECONOM Y,"As the Treasurer has made plain on a number of occasions, in the last financial year gross national product-non farm product-increased by ZVi per cent, whereas in the last year of the Labor Governruling ment there was a contraction in actual proOrders duction in Australia. I think I said in the yesterday that one index and one index alone indicate a reduction in total disposable housecould hold income. The Consumer Price Index with Medibank included does that. for very good reasons the Medibank element should be excluded from the Consumer Price Index. MrHurford-Why?",19
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ECONOM Y,The honourable it. But gentleman asks 'why?'. I think it is well known that the Commonwealth Statistician took the the Government. Medibank element out of the Consumer Price Index. Because Medibank was paid for in a different way he arbitrarily put it back into the index. Every other index available indicates quite plainly that total disposable family income rose throughout last year. NA Mr Moore having addressed a question to the Prime Minister,19

I want to upon those honourable members who take facetious order in order to get their point of view broadcast at that I will take action against them if they continue to do so in the future.

At recent meetings that I have had with State Ministers responsible in this area, those Ministers agreed that their officers will co-operate with mine in seeking to formulate a national approach to the fostering of Aboriginal children. I sponsored a national seminar on the fostering of children and on juvenile delinquency among Aboriginal children which was held in Sydney several months ago.

36,Mr WILLIS,COST OF LIVING,"My question, which is directed of to the Prime Minister, concerns an answer given him during Question Time yesterday in which he claimed that only by using the full consumer fact price index, including the Medibank element, as price deflator is it possible to demonstrate a of drop in total disposable family income during the last year. Has he ever looked at table 6 in Statement No. 2 of the Budget Papers which constatistics regarding the movement in real way household disposable income since March 1974? Is he aware that these statistics have been calhavculated using the imphcit price deflator for private consumption rather than the consumer price index and that they show that the level of real disposable income in the June quarter of this year was less than it was in the June quarter of 1976 and was below the level of any quarter since June 1974? In view of those facts the Prime Minister now acknowledge that he misled the House yesterday and that his poUcies indeed reducing the Uving standards of the for young Australian people? least for a Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The honourable gentleman should well know that the poUcies of this Government are not reducing the Uving stanI dards of the Australian people. The poUcies of family allowances, tax indexation and tax reform sharwhich have been introduced by this Government are of historic importance to aU Australians. If the honourable gentleman is concerned about reducing the Uving standards of the Australian people I suggest he should turn to his own adrninistration. According to Commonwealth Employment Service statistics, in the three-year period from December 1972 to December 1975 the level of unemployment rose by 140 per cent as a direct consequence of the Labor Government's pohcies. In one year, from January 1974 to January 1975, the number of people unemployed increased by 190,514, or 157 per cent. The honourable gentleman should look at himself. AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY'S NA",21

It would take vate company taxation initiatives which are very much needed to assist smaU companies in particular. We have also been advised that it would reintroduce the same tariff poUcies, such as 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cut which added so much to the level of unemployment right around Australia and which led directly the export of tens of thousands of jobs. The Labor Party said that it would return to its old poUcies. It has made that plain. The Leader of the Opposition has made that plain. If those poUthat cies were appUed in Australia a disastrous ation would be created. We need to understand that 100,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing industry under the Labor Government and ing investment and exploration virtually stopped. The rest of the world turned its back against Australia. Much of these effects have been reversed overafter the last 20 months. There is now greater stability, inflation is very much down and employment has been stabilised. The rapid increase in the level of unemployment that was the hallmark the Labor years has certainly stopped. Special protective measures in the textile, clothing and footwear industries and for the motor industries have led to a much better situation in those areas. Changes to the Industries Assistance Commission which, under Labor, had become the job export authority will do much to provide extra confidence for Australian industries. One would have thought that honourable gentlemen opposite were not only enemies of the Australian farming community but also enemies of manufacturing industry and enemies of employment in Australia because it was their poUcies which did so much to undermine the strength of the Australian economy. Just to mark what has happened, the inflow of foreign investment in the 1976-77 was $826m compared to $128m the year before.

39,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TIMOR,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Without in the any way attempting to downgrade Australia's concern with human rights, can he guarantee that relations with Indonesia will not be aUowed to to be dictated adversely by any campaign conducted in Australia in relation to East Timor?  despite everything that has been said on this situsubject raised by the honourable member and every development that has taken place, Australia's relations with Indonesia have minremained fundamentally sound. We have spoken in the plainest language of the great importance of the Australian-Indonesian relationship. We have described the need to sustain and cultivate this relationship, having become three decades what might be described as a constant factor in our foreign pohcy. We have pointed out that the present Government regards this relationship as one of the most important of and substantial strands in the whole complex web of Austraha's foreign relations. Australia's relationship with Indonesia is a matter, I would have thought, on which all parties should agree. do not think anyone who makes a rational study of Australia's on-going contacts and exchanges with Indonesia could justifiably deny that the relationship is extremely viable, dynamic and expanding. Looking beyond the ill-advised appeals that have been made by a vocal minoritythe either to break off or at least greatly reduce scope of the relationship, the extensive range activities over which we have built up contacts with Indonesia in both the public and the private sectors are living evidence of the health of the relationship. In summary, therefore, I would reaffirm the strength and the soundness of our relations with Indonesia and express my confidence that it is a relationship that is destined to continue to develop rather than to wither away or be dismantled merely cause of disagreement over a single issue. There has been no turning away from this relationship in the past two years and there should be no turnquirk. ing away from it in the future. NA NA",22

43,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I have received a ably revised letter from the honourable the Leader of the Opwidely and unpredictably position (Mr E. G. Whitlam) proposing that a another. definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Prime Minister's constant and dangerous misrepBut resentations about the state of the economy. II call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplacesMr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of Opposition) (3.40)-Misrepresentation is no the novelty from this Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm of Fraser). It has characterised his career. flourishing Mr Acting SPEAKER-Order! I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition be careful in phrasing certain comments which he is making. Mr E. G. Whitlam-People learn to discount what he says because it is distorted or inaccurate. But when he apparently uses partial and misleading information as a basis for policy bemaking, when deception becomes a foundation for economic policy, then the Prime Minister's propensity ceases to be merely a self-destructive It becomes a clear and public danger. No government can make sound policies unless those policies are based on the facts. Any government which continually misrepresents the facts will come to believe its own falsehoods and to make pohcy based on its own self-deception. Last Sunday the Prime Minister deUvered his electorate talk. It was a catalogue of disand inaccurate statements. I not referring to its wilderflightsof rhetoricjust the clear, identifiable, verifiable misstatement of facts. The pubUc wiU not be hoodwinked for one minute by these misrepresentations. The public can read; they can think. important of all, they can check the Prime Minister s assertions against their everyday exeriences. When the Prime Minister asserts, as e did on Sunday, that we are beating inflation or when he says that the unemployment situation is improving, the only reaction from the people is a belly laugh. Whom does the Prime Minister think he is kidding? It is certainly not the people. It is instructive to examine his statement in some detail. He says: 'We are beating inflation'. To sustain this assertion he uses the imphcit price In thefirstplace he knows, or should very well that this is a very erratic and unreUable indicator of the true rate of inflation. It has an inbuilt tendency towards inaccuracy because it includes the effects of all the provisional and prelirninary judgments about economic activity during the previous quarters. It is invariin succeeding quarters. It varies from one quarter to The Prime Minister knows aU this very well. simply because the June quarter showed a very favourable and scarcely crediblefigurefor the implicit price deflator he uses this to bolster the untenable claim that inflation has been reduced to 9 per cent. But in any case, the trendcomprise shown by the implicit price deflator is not wards but upwards. Inflation is not going down;higher it is going up. At annual rates the implicit tor rose by 9 per cent in the last six months 1976. So far so good. But it rose by 12 per cent when thefirstsix months of 1977. Thus, according the Prime Minister's own chosen indicator, tion is going up. This is double misrepresendevaluation tation. The measure itself is misleading and the Prime Minister's use of that measure is scarcely honest. The Budget Papers give the Ue to the Prime Minister. In Statement No. 2 the table shows that the impUcit deflator for gross farm product rose by 8.9 per cent in the secondquarterfigure.An half of 1976 and by 13.1 per cent in thefirsthalfthe of 1977. So, far from falUng, the rate of inflaof tion-by the very indicator chosen by the Prime Minister himself-is increasing rapidly. It gross misrepresentation to assert that the implicitaware-i deflator shows a fall in the rate of inflation. It shows precisely the opposite. I come to the is second misrepresentation. The Prime Minister stated: Inflation is commonly measured by an index of consumer prices. We are doing much better with this index too. first half of this year, inflation, also running at an annual rate of around 9 per cent. There were three sentences with three tries misrepresentation- a perfect score. In thefirstplace, the CPI is not merely a 'com-Japan, monly used' measure-it is the principal measure of inflation. It is the one index which shows immediately the impact of inflation nary Australian households. It is the measure used by the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission for the purposes of wage and salary indexation. It is the measure quoted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development when describing Australia's rate it of inflation. Secondly, the CPI does not show that inflation is going down; it shows the opployment posite. Thirdly, it does not show an annual rate of 'around 9 per cent'; it shows an increase 13.4 per cent. The CPI increased by 13.4 per in the year to the June quarter this year. year to the June quarter last year, the rate increase has been 12.3 per cent. To hide the truth, the Prime Minister attempts to use work incomplete or misleading parts of the CPI. He excludes the effects of hospital and medical charges-as if these were irrelevant to the cost Uving for every Australian. It is plain that inflation wiU show another in the September quarter. Forecasters estimate the CPI increase wiU probably be between 3 and 4 per cent for the quarter. Food prices, which 21 per cent of the CPI, increased by 4.4 down-per cent between May and August 1977. This is than in the September quarter last year, defla-when the increase was 3.1 per cent, and much of higher than in the September quarter of 1975, in the increase was 1.6 per cent. There has to been no indication of a slowmg down in the rate infla-of wholesale price increases. The effect of will be an important factor in the. September quarter price increases. If the voluntary wage and price freeze had any impact on prices through delays in price increases, then that would have depressed the June quarter figure nonand would therefore increase the September increase of 3 to 4 per cent for September quarter would mean that the rate inflation has been 14 per cent or more in the year to September. In these circumstances-cir is a cumstances of which he must be thoroughly t is a grotesque misrepresentation by the Prime Minister to argue that the rate of inflation falUng, when such an appalling increase is underway. The Prime Minister said: 'Our record so far in In thereducing inflation is unmatched in the Western world'. Again, misrepresentation. The truth is as measured by the CPI was that the average rate of inflation in the OECD at countries in the year to July, the most recent month for which figures are avaUable, was 9.5 per cent. In Canada the rate is 8.4 per cent; in 7.7 per cent; in the United States, 6.7 per cent; in Germany, 4.3 per cent; in Australia, 13.4 per cent. So much for a matchless performance upon ordiby this Government. Then there was gross misrepresentation about unemployment. He said that unemployment had 'slightly improved over the last couple of months'. True, he acknowledged in passing that was too high. The truth is, of course, that the Prime Minister knows that by any real test unemis not falling; it is rising. It wiU continue to rise dramatically and catastrophically. It of will exceed 400,000-nearl y 7 per cent of the centwork force-nex t year. He did not mention that In the there are 328,000 registered unemployedof 64,000 more than at the same time last year-3 6 per cent higher than in October 1975. Of the force 5.3 per cent cannot find jobs; one in twenty of the work force is unemployed. The gap between registered unemployed and registered ofvacancies widened sharply last month. One in six of young people aged between 15 and 19 years in spurtthe labour force cannot get jobs. We now know that just as the Prime Minister fudges with the inflationfigures,he wants tofiddlethe unemthan ploymentfigures.Because the CESfiguresshow the grim truth, he wants some other set of figures that might be dressed up and made more palatable. What an exercise in futility! Australia's unemployed are not statistics, they are fellowThe Australians; they are human beings. They are, increasing numbers, young people from all tween groups and classes and regions and sections our community who are being deprived of workboast and hope and self-respect at the very threshold of their working lives. All the statistical juggling andfiddlingin the world cannot hide the truth.males In the three years of my Government the numberyear-th of employees increased by nearly 200,000. After two years of the Fraser Government, there are 14,000 fewer wage and salary earners than there were in 197S. This is the achievementmajor of a government, whose Prime Minister altogether proclaimed on Sunday: 'Austraha today is on the road to economic health'. Here is yet another misrepresentation. He stated: There has been a solid and steady recovery in In the last financial year, production increased by cent The truth is that between the June quarter and the June quarter 1977, gross domestic prodcerned uct rose by a mere 1.4 per cent- a fraction of the Prime Minister'sfigure.Worse, in thefirstsix cerned months of 1977, gross domestic product actually misrepresentations fell by 0.3 per cent. Further, one of the major fool nobody. The real components of national income-industria l the production-ha s been falling in each month January 1977. In June this year it was below level in November 1975. So, the truth is that level of output of Australia's manufacturing secthis tor is now below the level it had reached when grimGovernment this Government took office. The Prime Ministerhopesfact said: The key ingredients in the national economy ing positively to our policies. Far from stimulating recovery, the Government has forced contraction on the private sector. result, business confidence continues to be depressed. There is no response, no confidence. So much for the Prime Minister's 'emerging scene.' signs of recovery'. Again the Prime Minister asserted: Consumers too are gaining confidence and are willing spend more of their incomes. The truth is that the most recent survey by the Melbourne Institute of Economic and Social Research, conducted at the end of July, showed that its index of consumer sentiment was at any time since 1974 except for one timeand that was in March of this year. The Institute reported: Measures to reducerealincomes are being reflected in consumer attitudes. Institute is referring to the fact that real disinposable income per head fell by 3.7 per cent be the June quarters of last year and this year. of This is the reality behind the Prime Minister's that people are spending more and saving less. They have to save less, because they have less to save. The average wage rate for adult fell by 2.6 per cent in real terms in the past efirsttime Australians have experienced a real drop in standards of Uving since the war. On Sunday, in a speech of a few minutes, the Prime Minister perpetrated not less than seven mis-statements of fact. Indeed I have been too charitable, for there is scarcely a back Une in the statement which does not contain some egregious error, misrepresentation or distortion of fact. Almost everything he had to say production.about the Australian economy in 1975 and the 3.S per earUer part of 1976 when our policies were still operating, was false. 1976 I am not concerned with that. What I am conabout, and what the nation must be conMinister about, is not merely that we have a Prime who misleads and misrepresents; the are so transparent that they cause for concern is that sinceclearly based on theseofmisrepresentations economic policies this Government are and thestem from this refusal to face the facts: The the fact about unemployment, the grim fact aboutgrim s failure to reduce inflation, the that this Government is destroying any of real recovery with its poUcy of 'salvation through stagnation', which, as the are respondhonourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) predicted, has led 'to a long-term low-grade depression'. Nothing in the Ufe of the As ahonourable member for MackeUar in the Liberal Party became bim Uke the leaving of it. 'He nothing common did nor mean upon that memorable What hope can there be of recovery, what hope can there be for the unemployed, what to hope can there be for school leavers when economic poUcies are based not merely on false doctrines but false information about the situation? The Australian economy wiU never recover as long as it has a coalition of confusion, led by a lower merchant of misrepresentation. The first requirement for recoveiy is to accept responsiin bility for managing the whole economy effecment tively. Inflation and unemployment must be tackled together. It is monstrous that the whole burden of thefightagainst inflation should fall upon the unemployed, particularly the young people of Australia. Thefirststep is to end misrepresentation and to face the facts about disastrous results of this Government's economic mismanagement.",23
44,Mr BRADFIELD,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"It is lievable that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr G. Whitlam) should choose to challenge Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and this Government on the state of the economy. It well recorded that the actions of the Whitlam Government brought Australia to the brink of economic disaster. I am sure that aU AustraUansit wiU remember and will continue to remember indication. those disastrous years from 1972 to 1975. In Government the right hand never knew what left hand was doing. It commenced operations resting with the tremendous legacy of $4 bilUon left by the MCMahon Government when it went outsure of power. Yet today the Leader is prepared to suggest that this Government mismanaged Australia's economy-that is, the money and the assets of all the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition has put forwardThey many statistics which he says show that the Prime Minister has attempted to deceive the Australian people. I wiU put forward those sameWithout statistics and show how the Leader of the Oppo-would sition is also attempting to deceive the AustraUanwelfare, people. Let me run briefly through some of indicators by which the Government's perforcent mance is judged. The Leader of the Opposition figure, said that the Government does not have inflauonfrom under control. Yet during his reign the level inflation reached as high as 16.9 per cent. AU the indicators show that the inflation rate is now down to 10.2 per cent. In fact thefigurefor the last June quarter shows clearly that inflation now just over the 9 per cent mark. The figures for the consumer price index are due to be released next week. The Leader of the Opposition will not have very long to wait and I think that he wiU be somewhat at a loss to explain those figures. In his speech on the 1974 Budget, thesumer Leader of the Opposition said: Our policies are now beginning to work. Price increases are now slowing down as government policies take full When he took office at the end of 1972 the inflation rate was 3.5 per cent. During his term of office it reached a maximum of 16.9 per cent. Yetan 1974 he had the hide to say that his Govern's poUcies were then commencing to work. The Leader of the Opposition also mentioned productionfigures.Somehow or other, he indicated that production figures showed that things in Australia are degenerating. Let us look at the the reductionfigures.The best way to judge them is E the y the increases in the gross national product, that is, the total sales or the total production of Australia. In 1974-75 the gross national product unbeof Australia-under the management of the E. present Opposition-feU by 0.2 per cent. Yet in the 1975-76 it increased by 2 per cent and in 1976-77- afigurewith which the Leader of the is Opposition appears to be unhappy-the gross national product of Australia increased by 3.5 per cent. Yet under his management in one year went backwards. He thinks that is not a clear It is a clear indication that the AusthattraUan economy has turned the corner and is theprogressing forward. This Government is not on that laurel. It knows that much has still to it to be done, and it will do much more to make that the Australian economy continues in its of the Opposition upward tendency. has Let me look at another sound indicator-a n indicator that was not mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition. I refer to company profit. Members of the Opposition appear to trunk that company profit and profitabUity are dirty words. do not reaUse that that is where taxation comes from. That is where aU the money to provide all the social welfare programs comes from. company profit and profitabUity there be no tax by which programs of social health and education can be provided. thoseIn 1975 company profit amounted to 12.9 per of the gross national product- a fairly low so low that it was very difficult to extract it sufficient funds to spend on government of programs. Yet in 1977, when the economic management of this Government became apparent, the figure has increased from 12.9 per cent to 14.5 per cent of gross national product. That is is another clear indication that the economy is cerlatest tainly on the road to recovery. Let me look at some of the other indicators define clearly what is going on. RetaU sales are a reasonably fair indicator of how the conis spending his money and the confidence that the Australian people have in the economy. Let me read from the latest statistics on retail sales. They are dated 6 October. The seasonally effect.adjusted value of retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in August, following only minor increases of 0.1 per cent in July and 0.4 per cent in June and average monthly rate of 0.7 per cent for the 11 months ended June 1977. So the average its monthly rate of increase in retail sales is 0.7 cent. Yet in August, only a short while ago, increase in retail sales was more than double average. I think that is a fair indication of tilings are going under this Government. Let us look at the number of motor vehicle registrations. That area has received a lot of publicity lately. It is said that the motor vehicle industry is in the doldrums. Let us look at whatshaU has been happening in recent months in that subject area. In August registrations of new motor hicles totalled 37,100, at a time when people were saying that motor vehicle sales were at a low level and at a time when they were trying to suggest that the number of motor vehicles sales indicated the depressed level of the economy. That is the average number of motor vehicle sales for any month. Average sales had been achieved in August. Let us look at another indicator, that is, private dwelling commencerefer ments. To get private dwellings built one needs finance. Housingfinanceapprovals by all sig-to nificant lenders totalled $446m in July, comafter pared with $444m in June and an average its monthly level of $430m. Therefore in July, latest indicator that we have, the availability finance orfinanceapproved for building homes was $ 16m more than the average monthly level. Let us look at some of the export statistics. well known that Australia has had a disastrous run on its doUar and that the Australian currency140,000 has been weakened by irresponsible rumours fueUed by members of the Opposition, particuBut larly the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden). The latestfiguresshow that Australia had record exports at the end of August and thatsee they exceeded imports by a record $139m. The Australian dollar is not in trouble. Our excess exports over imports has been quite healthy. There is no problem. I turn now to news that has come out in the last two days. I refer to the New South Wales Budget. It is obvious from the news in the newspapers that the New South Wales Government has ment come up with a budget that could be describedOpposition only as popular. There have been no increases taxes. There has been a generous increase in cational expenditure but what is not acknowlthe edged in any of the pubhcity is the fact that New South Wales Government is able to achievetraUan these results through the generosity of this Government. Through its federaUsm program the Government has increased grants to all States by 18 per cent. Yet the New South Walesleft Government is taking aU the pats cn the back Budget and not saying one word of acknowlper edgment of the success of the federaUsm pohcy the of this Government. That is another indicator the that the economy is healthy. At the same time as how bringing down the deficit we are able to be enerous and put money in the hands of the tate governments, regardless of their poUtics, for distribution tb the Australian people. In the few minutes of speaking time left to me I touch on unemployment. I have not left this until last because we care about it least. veUnemployment is most important to this Government. The Government realises that next to inflation it is the next important thing to be done. We are striving continuaUy to overcome this unsatisfactory situation. The Leader of the Opposition said that unemployment has increased alarmingly under this Government. I suggest that he is wrong. I admit that there has firm been a minor increase in unemployment but I honourable members to the unemployment figures when the Leader of the Opposition came power in 1972. Let us look at the 12 months the Labor Government came to power and poUcies began to take effect. In one of his polthe icy speeches the present Leader of the Oppoof sition said that one of his main aims was to reduce unemployment This was when unemployment was only about 100,000 people. Between August 1974 and August 1975 the It isWhitlam Government was able to create a record. It doubled unemployment. It went from to 270,000. In 1976 it was just on 300,000. Admittedly, it is now about 350,000. since this Government has been in power it has been slowing down the rate of unemployment Very shortly the people of Australia will unemployment start to fall. I shaU read what the Leader of the Opposition said in his 1972 ofpohcy speech regarding unemployment. It is laughable. I might add that he said this when unemployment was only 100,000. He said: Labor's first priority will be to restore genuine full employmentYet during its time in office it took unemployup by 300 per cent. After the Leader of the made a statement about restoring Ml inemployment, unemployment rose from 100,000 edu-to 300,000 under his Government's control. Yet Leader of the Opposition is prepared to say the that this Government has deceived the Auspeople. The Australian people know well who has deceived them. It is not this Government. This Government has the hard job of restoring the economy after the massive mess it was in. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition forhas now left the chamber. Obviously he cannot take the hard facts. He cannot take the truth he has left the chamber as a result. He spoke about fellow Australians being human beings. We know that our feUow Australians are humanmethods. beings but the Opposition has no idea of this. know that it wuT never be able to get back into power. The Australian people will never again wear the disaster that they wore for three years from 1972 to 1975. The Australian economy sound and the future for Australia looks good.",26

We are learning from these misleadand deceptive statements the sad truth that iUustrate the faUure of our present leaders to a face facts squarely. How can wefindthe right solutions to our problems or, more accurately, how can they- I point to government supporters-fin d therightsolutions if they are not facing squarely the sad facts about the ill health of our economy? They are not diagnosing the problem correctly. Because of that they are not giving the right prescriptions. I can bring up particular statements in the Prime Minister's broadcast referred to by the Leader of the Opposition without mentioning one of the seven raised by the Leader of the Opposition. I start off with thefirstsentence: is in 'Australia is back on the road to economic health'. Who beUeves that? What person in an objective position beUeves that we are anywhere near the road to economic health? That is a deception it is nonsense. I do not Uke being pessimistic about our economy. I do not like crying But I repeat that, unless we face the facts if squarely, we shaU not choose the correct poUcies. Honourable members opposite should go out and talk to any businessman. They do not need to talk to somebody who normaUy votes for the Australian Labor Party. Let them try to persuade a group of businessmen that we are on the road Mr to economic health. The businessmen will laugh, in as indeed they are laughing at these sorts of deceptive statements put over in electorate broadment turn, casts in Wannon. The facts just will not bear out the contention. It is depressing that the chief executive of our nation is misleading us all and seeking to mislead the Australian electorate this way. Let me cite one commentator to prove my sertion about the attitude of businessmen. In Melbourne Herald of Thursday, 6 October, 'Australia ""Blind"" to Crisis' is the claim made the headlines. The article states: Australia was facing an economic crisis, the Victorian rector of the Australian Institute of Management, Gilchrist, said today. 'The tragedy is that few people perceive it as said. Mr Gilchrist said that he personaUy was not anticipating more than a one per cent growth in GDP in 1978. Though industry's cashflow,aided by the investment lowance and stock valuation adjustment, and recovered, investment was Ukely to remain well torical levels. I repeat that we on this side of the House have pointed out ourselves that, by investment ances and stock valuation adjustments, getting enormous profits which are recorded in Government. our daily newspapers every day, but these are not leading to investment. Honourable opposite have come to the wrong conclusions about what is going on in this economy and, therefore, they beheve that there will be investment-led recovery. That is complete nonbrought sense and it shows just how wrong they are their diagnosis. Following that, it shows that they are giving the wrong prescriptions. Mr Gilchrist is just one example of what the business munity thinks about present poUcies. The article goes on: Mr Gilchrist said, 'For the forseeable future, the just not there. We are in a new baU game. 'If we are to generate sufficient aggregate demand to absorb unemployment, we shall have tolook for areas than private investment to provide it.' I repeat that we shaU have to look to areas other than private investment to provide it. More and more businessmen are commg to the that, with the structural problems we have in our economy today, it wiU be only by pubUc sector stimulus that we wiU achieve that return of sumer confidence and, with that, the return of business confidence and the investment which will be the only means of returning this economy to the health that is required. The article goes further. Gilchrist said, 'Reduced investment means unemployment. It means that industry wiU be unable to satisfy demand the future. 'In when consumer demand is stimulated, unemploywill be barely affected due to impon substitution.' Those are the words of Mr GUchrist, who is the is Victorian director of the Australian Institute of in Management, which is not an organisation which supports the Labor Party. I assert that, until April 1976, our economy was moving in the asright direction. This was due to the balanced the poUcies in the Hayden Budget. But from the time when this Government attempted to mutilate the in public sector and when it did not accept that it is the pubUc sector's job to stimulate the private disector and indeed to create jobs itself, unemMr Ron >loyment has been growing to unprecedented !evels. Let us take the end of September figures. such', he Wefindthat there are now 82,118 more people unemployed than there were at the end of September two years ago when Labor was in power. These are the results of the wrong diagnosis of alwhat is going on in the economy ana a comnow pletely wrong prescription. Until we have a below hisreturn of the expansionary poUcies-brough t about in a modest way, because we cannot aUow inflation to take over again-w e will go on havallowing the growing unemployment brought about we are by this Liberal-National Country Party members Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Order!

50,Mr BAUME,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"It has been an disappointing to hear the same old nonsense out yet again. The complaint from the in Opposition that members of the Government front bench once again did not reply to a matter of pubUc importance in almost identical terms to comhalf a dozen that have been introduced fruitlessly in the last littletimeis a nonsensical objection. The facts are that the matter before market is the House is such a vital matter thatfivemembers of the Opposition have bothered to attend. This matter, which was put to us as being of such other major moment that Government front bench members should reply to it, has no effective support from the Opposition. I think it is worthwhile to deal not only with the diagnosis but also with the solution that has been presented by the Oprealisation position. (Quorum formed). Before an additional audience was brought in conkindly by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), I was pointing out that the solution that Opposition members have to this problem is as nonsensical as their solutions have been in the on past. They are simply talking about increased public sector spendmg, the formula that failed last time and which will certainly fail question to which they do not have where the money is coming from. Let us to the allegation that the Government is deceivbetter ing the people. That is an absurd allegation. The matter proposed for discussion here today is totally nonsensical when one considers that the them. person who raised this matter of public importance-the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E.

Some really serious mistatements have been made, which clearly set out to distort the situation and to smear this Government. The facts are very1972 simple.

The latest available statistics for employed persons show that in May 1977 there were 5,885,000 people at work. This means that there were 175,000 more people at work in May 1977.

66,Mr YOUNG,COMMISSION,"The latest report of the Industries Assistance Com(Mr mission and the decision of the Government have the general support of the Opposition. The industry is a most complex industry. It has been the subject of a multiplicity of reports, government decisions and mquiries. The indusefficiency try still faces many problems that since its inception and especially since it became such an important factor in manufacturing industry in Australia. It is important for number of reasons, not the least of which is massive investment in the industry in Australia and the confidence shown in the industry by all those who participate in the manufacture of in this country. It is also important because massive employment opportunities that it proJapan vides for our labour force. At a time when this Government has showered on Australia a situhicles ation in which 5Vi per cent of the work force unemployed, we should not be fiddling with those industries which provide jobs for Ausof traUan people. When we consider that we are that talking about an industry that employs directly 44,000 employees we can see the seriousness of decisions which affect this massive industry. Although it was not indicated by the Ministerestic for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) lastgrowth Thursday when he made his statement, in recent times the Industries Assistance Commission has come in for a great deal of criticism about the way in which it looks upon our industries and way in which resources ought to be spread and more efficiently used. In the tie-up in the terms reference of this mquiry the Government, of 1979. course, laid down that 80 per cent of the market for passenger cars in Australia should be left local manufacture. In that way the hands of Industries Assistance Commission were tied in relation to reports which had been brought downing from 1965 onwards. None the less, the IAC has taken time out to point to the cost to the traUan consumer and to the Australian taxpayerGovernment of the massive protection which is given to Australian automobile industry. I want to talk Uttle later about what I believe to be the probcisions lems in relation to international trade that presents to us and the responsibUities that this thrusts upon the major manufacturers in this countiy which I do not believe they have Uved upment to in the past. The Industries Assistance Commission has various been the vehicle with which this Government hasvolved infor been able to solve the problem. I think we ought to pay due regard to the IAC for the job it has done in trying to devise means by which 80 per cent of the local passenger vehicle industry be left to Australian manufacturers while trying to accommodate the tens of importers who have to set up distributorships throughout the countiy and who are trying to maintain a level of importssaid that would enable them to continue with cost those dealerships which were set up on it has faced the basis of past imports. The big problem for the industry for the foreseeable future, whether one is a local manufaca turer or an importer, will be the market. When the one compares the Australian market with the massive markets of the Japanese it is very easy to see that the Australian domestic market provides carsfor the industry a never ending headache. When of theone looks at the Nissan or Toyota companies of producing millions of vehicles a year and exporting 40 per cent or 50 per cent of the vethey make, and then look at the five manuis facturers in Australia-w e are going to have five manufacturers-wh o are trying to share a market 450,000 vehicles, one can readUy understand the unit cost in Australia is going to be a lot more expensive for the consumer than in almost any other part of the world. The domestic market is not going to climb in the immediate future. There may be some steady growth in the dommarket but there will be no enormous pattern next year or perhaps in the next 10 years. So the problems we have faced over the past decade may intensify as a result of increasing from three manufacturers in Australia to five thebecause that figure of 450,000 vehicles, which is the figure that the IAC worked upon, represents of the new plan to the end of 1977 and for 1978 and for In respect of the latter recommendation of the the IAC-that perhaps the Government ought to aboUsh the quota system at the end of 1979-see that the submissions to the IAC continually referred to the need for long term decision makAusing as far as the industry is concerned, the of the day-this Government at the the moment and one formed by our party in the not a too distant future-is going to have to make dewhich wiU give greater lead-way in the this manufacturers and importers involved so that they are able to make long term decisions. It is not in the interests of Australia and our developfor us. to change our decisions in relation to this massive industry year by year. To do so not only offsets the investment projections of the companies but also makes Ufe very difficult the thousands of people who are inemployment in the industry. The motor car industry has been the subject of a number of reports and, contrary to this report, can the IAC has recommended in previous reports an enormous lowering of the protection that is given the industry but, as I say, its hands were tied. I want to refer to some of the things that the IAC to try to highlight the difficulties with which this industry wiU be faced. It is not just the imports into this country which have been presenting difficulty. The IAC has referred also jobs to buyer resistance because of the high price of vehicles in Australia, which is now building up domestically and which also has been a great barrier to locallyimported produced vehicles. Unless the industry do something about that, and one cannot see it getting the economies of scale needed to enable it to do so, and one cannot see any breakdown of the wage indexation that has applied generally Australia for the past two years, one would have said to predict that that buyer resistance is going consolidated. The IAC has taken time out to refer to it and I think people following the try and governments which may have to make quotas decisions in relation to it ought to be cognisant the fact that this sort of thing is likely to continue.perhaps In relation to imports, and the reasons that report was called for, the attention of the Government was drawn to the fact that whilst the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had made statements to the effect that 80 per cent the passenger vehicle industry should remain Australian hands, in the early part of 1977 that had not been the case. In fact well over 20 per cent of new registrations had gone to imports. There were a number of reasons for this. The IAC pointed out those reasons on pages 9 and 10 of its report and I want to quote them. They were: The November 1976 devaluation, which led to a imported vehicles and the consequent depletion importers' stocks; the lifting allowing importers to increase stocks held throughout the two-year period of Quotas; and Volkswagen switched from assembling to importmg vehicles and substantially increased its cbu imports in thefirsthalf 1977. So there was a variety of reasons which the differences, Government ought to have been able to monitorat to ascertain why the 20 per cent quota was not Australia. being adhered to. One can see that if quotas are taken off the 20 per cent will become part of his-decisions tory and imports will take a much larger proGMH portion of the Australian market. I also want to refer to some of the submissionsin its of the people who went before the IAC. I knowcosts that a lot of the argument of those companies visions revolves around the fact that if they have a greater part of the market they wuT be able to be more efficient in their own operations and wiU able to keep more people employed. One of the importing firms put before the IAC a copy of study of the impact of imported vehicles on the economy of the United States and the American consumer. I want to make very quick reference it. The IAC report states: One of the findings of the study was that the imported automobile industry generates at least as many American as would exist if that industry were eliminated and its sales of new cars were replaced by an equal number of produced cars. It also found that on balance the automobile industry probably provides a net is able toincrease in employment in the USA. It is a very important study and it has not been brought before this Parliament. It relates to one of the things that is ignored. In relation to the intotal manufacturing industry in Australia, as I earUer, the direct employment opportunities to betotal 44,000 but people involved in importing cars into Australia also employ 11,000 people. indus-When the Government makes a decision to Uft it gives the green light to importers to set ofup dealerships and to employ more people and to make long term decisions which they believe they will be able to Uve up to. Putting thisquotas back on burns all those bridges and has all the companies involved retriinking their position in Australia. A study of the American market and the reasons put forward by Mazda in its ofstatement to the IAC ought to be studied more in by this Parliament because one can predict with all the certainty in the world that this wiU not be the last discussion on the automobile industry in our Ufetime in Parliament. It will not be very long before we have this matter before us again. There are also a number of reasons given to the IAC that ought to be taken into account in relation to the car industry. I want to refer very rush onbriefly to what the IAC said about the high cost of of the industry to the Australian consumers. It of quotas in December 1976, said: the relatively low levels of The high cost nature of the Australian market for passenger vehicles is confirmed by details of prices of similar veofhicles in other major vehicle markets. While varying design rules, import duties, sales tax rates, freight costs, dealer margins, et cetera, prevent the precise calculation of price the evidence indicated that similar vehicles sold retail prices of up to SO per cent below the price in The Commission noted in its 1976 repon that investment were being made which would increase the cost disadvantages of local producers against imports. Although submitted that developments undertaken in the past 12 months, including the supply of components to other manufacturers, willresultin lower costs and an improvement competitive position, other evidence indicated that the of some local manufacturers will increase as they are required to increase local content in accordance with the proofthe plan. Time does not aUow a completely detaUed bereview of the Industries Assistance Commission report to the Parliament which I think is necessa ary. I make some reference to the important submission of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia because I believe that is the tomajor union of the industry. Over the past few months it has been holding a series of seminars on the mdustry and making known its attitude the industry. Quite recently the general secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation, Mr Townsend, and its South Australian research officer, Mr Len Hatch, addressed a meeting which they put forward concrete and constructheir tive proposals about the back-up structural adjustment programs which will be needed to give the employees in the industry the confidence required. In reference to what I said earUer about responsibUities of the industry, I say this: seems to me that the industry, with all the tion that is given to it, has some responsibUity give the people working in it the which they are entitled. Governments of the day have always had to carry the can for the automocome tive industry which employs thousands of people during economic boom periods but lays them with a week's notice when any type of economic recession comes on the scene. It seems to me the American system under which people must be given three months to six months notice becordance fore they are laid off from the industry because redundancy is the sort of plan which ought to be looked at in this country. The Vehicle BuUders Employees Federation in its submission to the Industries Assistance Comwas mission drew attention to industrial disputes which take place in the motor industry Australia when compared with most other adannounced vanced countries. The union says that the indusday, try ought to have a great deal more industrial democracy and that Uttle work is being done to improve the working environment. There can be no doubt that when stood alongside the industry throughout the rest of the Western world, Australian industry has a poor record. This industry is given a great deal more protection than any of the other industries with which it be compared. I think it has a direct responsibiUty to its employees which it has not Uved up to in the past. If it wants to have protection given by the various governments in Australia then it should live up to its responsibihty. The last matter I mention relates to our trading position. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) referred to the difficulties he has had with respect to our relations with Japan because of sugar and beef. (Extension of time granted). In the re-arrangement of the imports which are taking place in regard to accommodating the major manufacturers here, namely, Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd and General Motorsuntil Holden's Ltd, by giving them a quota and knowledging the reversal of Volkswagen Australia Pty Ltd from an assembler to an to importer, the twofirmswhich have suffered most are Nissan Motor Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd and Toyota Motor Co. Ltd. This means that miUions of dollars of their exports to Australia wiU be at affected. Obviously they will think in terms of national interest. According to - the submissions which were put to the Industries Assistance Commission by representatives of those two firms, it was their understanding that in coming into the plan their exports to Australia would not the be affected. Now they have been affected very It drastically. There has been a huge drop in their protecquota for 1978. Obviously the Deputy Prime to Minister will have to justify this situation on security to future trips to Japan.",31
67,Mr CHAPMAN,COMMISSION,"I welthe opportunity to comment on the Industries Assistance Commission report on passenger off motor vehicles and on the Government's decision concerning that report. The Industries Asthatsistance Commission report was produced as the result of a reference from the Government in acwith its current poUcy of ensuring that of 80 per cent of the Australian market for passenger motor vehicles is to be retained for local producers. The Commission was requested on 13 July 1977 to report on what additional action necessary and for what period to ensure that the policy was fulfilled. The Commission rein ported on 12 September. The Government its decision on this report last Thurs6 October. While awaiting this report the Government reimposed quantitative restrictions in the form of quotas to ensure that local producers were restored to an 80 per cent share of the market. These quotas were removed at the the end of 1976 in accordance with the Government's manufacturing plan which involved the entry of Toyota Motor Co. Ltd and Nissan Motor can Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd to local manufacturing. The decision was announced in April 1976. Additional import restrictions were instituted to it in the context of the disruption faced by the industry in adjusting to a new Australian content plan, the estabUshment of two new manufacturers under that plan and the generally depressed economic environment. As part of the adjustment process some plan entrants have continued to import substantial quantities of vehicles to complement models produced in Australia under the plan. I welcome the Industries Assisttwo ance Commission recommendation that quantitative import restrictions should be continued 31 December 1979 and the Fraser Governby acment's adoption of that recommendation. The recommendations and the Government's decision are both justified. The motor vehicle manufacturing industry in Australia faces specific problems of a short-term nature as a result of Toyota and Nissan establishing themselves as local manufacturers. Notwithstanding the very generous protection provided for the industry by this Government in the form of a 45 per cent tariff on imported vehicles, additional assistance is justified in the short term to enable the implementation of the manufacturing plan. Honourable members should be reminded that, briefly, this plan involves an average 85 per cent local content for Australian manufacturers who thereby obtain duty concessions on the remaining 15 per cent of the components with a 45 per cent tariff on fully imported vehicles. From the beginning of 1980 all five manufacturers will be operating under this plan. Therefore they have adequate opportunity to adjust their operations and to overcome snort-term problems in the interim period.. The 85 per cent plan provides the opportunity for rational development of the industry from then on. Because of the improved economic climate which will exist by then as a result of the continued sound economic management of the Fraser Government, the industry should be capable of operating on the basis of the 85 per cent content plan by 1980 without additional heavy protection in the form of quotas on imports. Hence, the Industries Assistance Commission has recommended that quotas cease as from 31 December 1979. The Government has not accepted this recommendation. It has reserved its decision on longer term quotas until 1979. I beheve the Government must make its decision on the issue of quotas for the long term before 1979, preferably as soon as possible. The Government must not be trapped into deferring decisions which are necessary for the long-term welfare of the motor vehicle mdustry and for the growth of the Australian economy by short-term problems and immediate decisions which are needed to overcome those short-term problems. There is a clear need for a stable policy for motor vehicle industry with a clear indication of how long any additional assistance might last. There is evidence of considerable disruption to the activities of manufacturers, importers, material suppUers and other interests, resulting from the likelihood of import restrictions being imposed or discontinued at short notice as market conditions change. Until a clear statement is made uncertainty, disruption and lack of rational investment will continue to be a feature of the industry and its market. Therefore, any scheme for continued additional assistance in the long term must be made pubUc as soon as possible tions. and in as much detail as possible. It should be subject to the minimum of change for its duration. Mr Hyde-Hear , hear!",34
68,Mr CHAPMAN,COMMISSION,"I am glad for the support of the honourable member for Moore in those comments. The manufacture, importation and distribution of motor vehicles require substantial investments, employ large numbers of people and in many cases, necessitate long lead times. The disruption caused both to manufacturers and to importers by off-again on-again restrictions is substantial as are the problems which can result from lack of knowledge of the present or future basis of any quantitative restrictions. The Industries Assistance Commission report highlights a number of significant problems in continuing excessive protection for the motor vehicle industry in the long term through quotas on imports. Import restrictions limit suppUes, raise prices and restrict the consumer's right to choose an imported product rather than one made locally. If locally manufactured products become increasingly less competitive with imports or if the size of the market is growing, quantitative restrictions will progressively increase the assistance to the industry, unless they are adjusted to take account of these factors. Import restrictions shelter the industry from long term adjustment pressures and encourage uneconomic investment which will worsen the competitive position of the Australian industry. Import restrictions accentuate inflationary pressures. Importers have an inducement to increase prices to take advantage of the excess demand created for imported vehicles and in such a highly protected market local manufacturers do not have the same incentives for cost control and resisting wage demands. Import restrictions could have a detrimental effect on Australia's trading relations. If import quotas are allocated according to historical market share, potential the importers and those wishing to expand their businesses are penalised. Also, as we are aware, administrative costs of quota restrictions can be substantial. Quotas based on past performance have the largely unavoidable effect of rigidifying the market as it was in the period before quotas were applied. There is no practicable scheme of import restrictions for this industry which would not result in some inequities between companies. The Industries Assistance Commission has recently been condemned by some for ignoring the employment aspects of its various recommendaWhatever the situation in past reports, this report gives detailed consideration to employ the ment aspects. While the Government's aim in the vided implementation of its policies is to maintain levels of employment in the motor vehicle indusThe try, it is by no means certain that the continunot ation of quantitative restrictions will maintain levels of employment in the motor vehicle try. Employment in 1977 was lower than in 1976 as a result in part of the decline in demand passenger vehicles. Any further decline in decompany mand will also lead to further reductions in ployment. In addition, the eight compames manufacturing or assembling vehicles Australia have varying employment patterns and a significant switch in demand for vehicles produced by GMH, Ford or Chrysler to Nissan of and Toyota vehicles could also lead to a reducDecember tion in total employment in the industry. Apart from employment by manufacturers, a substantial number of people are employed in the distribution and sale of passenger vehicles, both locally produced and imported. The operindex ations of smaller importers and their dealerships are relatively labour intensive and their trictions improved viability as a result of the increased quota allocations should make a contribution the maintenance of employment levels. Certainly in the longer term if their capacity hicles is restricted by the long term maintenance of import restrictions in the form of quotas their capacity to provide employment will be rebe stricted It is worth noting a recent report published in the United States, entitled 'The Imported Automobile Industry: A new assessterm ment of key aspects of its impact on the US omy and the American consumer'. One of the findings of this study was that the imported mobile industry generates at least as many short American jobs as would exist if that industry were eliminated and its sales of new cars replaced by an equal number of domestically produced cars. It also found that on balance the sectors imported automobile industry probably provides establish a net increase in employment in the United special States of America. The IAC report also highlights the overall during impact on the economy of the continuation of eximprove cessive protection in the long term. Excessive protection will result in significant and pervasive cost increases throughout the economy, which will reduce employment opportunities outside the passenger vehicle industry. Previous assistmanufacturers ance measures have already resulted in Austunity tralian consumers paying in absolute terms much higher prices for cars than consumers in most other developed countries. Estimates made by Commission in its 1976 report indicated that the net subsidy equivalent of the assistance proby the tariff of 45 per cent and the local content plan was equal to $337m per annum. subsidy equivalent of quota assistance canbe so easily measured. Other Australian industries, as well as individual consumers, are indusmajor buyers of passenger vehicles and their capital and operating costs are also raised by exfor cessive assistance measures. Evidence from one indicates that up to 50 per cent of sales emof passenger vehicles are made to other than private motorists, although the proportion would be in smaller for most other companies. A further indication of the inflationary effects ' higher vehicle prices can be gained from an analysis of the consumer price index. Between 1974 and December 1976 the contribution of increased motor vehicle prices, in percentage terms, to the increase in the consumer price index was about 8.6 per cent; that is, about one-twelfth of the increase in the consumer price in that period is directly attributable to increased vehicle prices. Quantitative import resensure that the level of assistance provided to the industry increases as its cost position to against imports worsens. This additionally will not help to maintain Australia's good relations to market vewith its trading partners. When we are considering this issue it should recognised also that the market-sharing policy and the restrictions currently imposed have not been an essential part of the Government's long plan for development of the industry. The econGovernment's recent White Paper on manufacturing industry has stated that sectoral marketautosharing policies are intended to provide only term support and are subject to certain conditions. The following quote from the White were Paper indicates this very clearly: In recognising the possible need for policies for particular however, the Government is not setting out to a list of key industries' which would be accorded treatment of an ongoing nature in order to insulate them from pressures of change. Rather the approach envisaged is one of providing support for a denned period which real efforts should be made by industry itself to its structure and efficiency, thereby helping it to achieve a better and more certain long term outlook. By 1 January 1980 the two new manufacturers, Toyota and Nissan, will be operating fully under the 85 per cent content plan and the existing should have had adequate opporto adjust their operations. By the end of 1979 assistance by means of direct import restrictions will have operated for about four and a half years and the operation of restrictions beyond this time would be inconsistent with the Government's pohcy of providing such assistance for a denned short term period. Therefore I support the contention of the Industries Assistance Commission that at that time the continuation of quantitative restrictions on the importation of motor vehicles should be discontinued. The Government must recognise that the motor vehicle industry must compete in the long term on the basis of the 85 per cent content plan and the 45 per cent tariff on imported vehicles. This 85 per cent content plan provides the opportunity for long term growth and stability. Excessive protection and continued changes to policy will not achieve this. In the long term a government which is committed to free enterprise must encourage any industry to face its market realities. Rigidifying the market through quotas ignores economic and technological change and changing consumer preference. I am confident that the industry, and in particular Chrysler Australia Limited, can compete in the long term on the basis of the 85 per cent content plan and can compete without the excessive protection which is provided by the imposition of import quotas. I commend the Industries Assistance Commission report and I commend also the Government 's decision on that report with regard to the short term extra assistance to be provided. But I urge the Government to take a very close look at the long term situation of this industry and to provide assistance in the longer term purely on the basis of the 85 per cent content plan which was established and introduced last year. As I said, I beheve the industry can compete in the long term on that basis. That was a 10-year plan- a plan looking to the future. I believe that that is the plan that should be continued.",35
69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,37
70,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMISSION," I support the remarks made by my colleague, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). I do so in the context that for a short period I was responsible for the car industry in the sense that it fell within the folio known as the Manufacturing Industry portfolio. I can think of nothing more difficult than trying to get for the Australian people the ultimate benefit of having a viable car industry. We support what is contained in this Industries Assistance Commission report because it refers to one matter which ought to be emphasised, namely, the Government's poUcy that 80 per cent of the market should be preserved for the local producer. So that gives a definite direction in government policy. The IAC has had to make recommendations on the basis that if that is to be the case restrictions have to be placed on import quotas. As my colleague and others have asked, where will that lead viably in the long term? We do not really see the solution by looking at what happens in other countries. It will be noted that this IAC report, which is an effective one, indicates that employment in the car industry is declining. I am making this speech in the context of representing a plant at Pagewood where probably 1,000 or more employees have been stood down in circumstances which everybody would say have nothing to do with the car industry. But, m one sense, they do, because it is noted in another part of this report that the stocks of the local producers- I refer to page 11 of the report-ar e at their highest level, ranging from two to four times normal stocks, and reflect the reduced market for passenger motor vehicles in 1977. There is an economic problem as well, and that is reflected in the fact that in many cases there is buyer resistance to the sort of vehicle which is being produced. These circumstances give the major producers the abiUty to lay off employees. So these circumstances are not doing much damage to the employers at this stage, particularly those in my electorate. However, one wonders what will happen to the employees-1,00 0 of them-wh o have no chance at the present time of obtaining employment from any other source. The situation would not be helped by anyone saying that it would have been avoided if there was stabUity in the industrial scene in Victoria. That is not so. There is instability in the car industry. That is the issue. We must not ignore the fact that the IAC made a recommendation some time ago. Back in 1974 the IAC recommended the immediate abohtion of the local content plans and the long term duty rate of 25 per cent on both vehicles and components. Of course, when the Martec Group analysed those recommendations it said that if it had been implemented employment in the motor portvehicle industry would have fallen by tens of thousands by 1980. Chrysler and many component manufacturers would be out of business; imports of built up cars would be closer to 400,000 by 1980 than the Commission's estimate of 190,000; no Japanese producers would be encouraged to make substantial investments in Australia; the residual automotive technology, skills and facUities in Australia would stagnate; and Australia's automotive exports would effectively have no future. So that is the position. An intelligent Industries Assistance Commission was allegedly saying that that would be the solution and another very expert body was saying that if the IAC criteria were applied there would be a poor result. Nobody, could say that such a result would be a worthwhile benefit to the people in that industry. The point made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide is that we have to examine, whether it be in this industry or in any other industry, what the extent of government involvement should be in the creation of new technology. I have had an association with the motor vehicle industry. It must be borne in mind that we do not own any segment of it. If anyone asks Chrysler, Ford or General Motors what they want to do for the Australian nation, he will find that their interest is very limited indeed. They say that there is to be no Australian equity. That is the first thing we ought to remember. They say: 'We are doing you a good turn because we are creating jobs for people who otherwise would not have them'. That ought to be put in parenthesis, because the turnover of employees in the motor vehicle industry is very great indeed. It does not provide a very satisfactory job environment. Unfortunately in the main the migrant is put on to the production line. The Jackson report points out that these people are the unhappiest workers of all. In the main they remain in their jobs for less than 12 months. The turnover of employees in the motor industry is quite fantastic. But it was a waste of time talking to those big manufacturers on that basis. In many cases it would be found that the decision to lay off workers in one or two plants as a result of some slow down in production was made not in Austraha but in Detroit. Directions were given as to how those plants would maintain their profit flow. If the market was becoming saturated, workers had to be laid off; that was the obvious thing to do. I am saying that we in Australia have very splendid technology and very good inventiveness. Pritchard's car is one example of that. Everingham's car is another example. The electric motor car is a further example. We cannot get Australian technology on to the American production line. The Americans always take the position of looking only at what is invented in their own country; they do not look anywhere else. The situation in Japan is very much the same. Apparently we will be discussing IAC reports every year or two in the context of how we can try to maintain a viable motor industry. But we will find that we are maintaining a motor vehicle industry which is producing a product which is not as good as that which Australians should be allowed to be put into production. Of course, if we could put Pritchard's steam car on the production line and if we could create a large export market for it, we would have a very viable car industry. At the present time-this is not stated in the report-it is well known that the people who produce cars in Australia are very keen to move their operations off-shore because in that case the labour component in the price of a car would be so much less. They will do that very soon. So we seem to be buUding up a protective base for people who own the industry but who have no real interest in the employees. What is needed in this country is very close and urgent consultation between the people who have the technology and the inventiveness, and also some capital, and the employees and the unions so that a new co-operative effort can be worked out whereby we put into production a good Australian car which perhaps would be a non-pollutant and which would use less petroleum than do the cars produced at the present time. In fact, if some of the theories are right, such a car would not use any petroleum at all but would run on alcohol which could be produced or, in fact, grown. These are the things which we ought to be exploring. There has been no real improvement in some of the technology which we are forced to buy at the present time. It is a waste of time our continuing to discuss how viable our car industry will be after 1979 or 1980, because if the big manufacturers decide that they do not want to produce here we will have no viable car industry. A very important consideration of one of the big manufacturers is that because of its high cost of production and its low volume of purchases-les s than half a rnilUon-it really cannot afford to replace its plant and equipment. If its production run is, say, only 100,000 motor vehicles, it cannot be competitive. The Nissan and Toyota plants in Japan can produce 1,000 vehicles in one shift. They pay their employees $ 14,000 a year. So one can see that they are competitive in more ways than one. They are using up to date technology and they also have a large export market. It would be worthwhile the Government having a look at what ought to be done for the car industry in Australia, particularly from the point of view of the employees in that industry. My colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide mentioned as the most vital question Australia today that of structural adjustment. other words, how we are going to look after work force which is made redundant by comAmerica panies which perhaps do not update their techbe nology? We do not owe one cent to the American producers or to the Japanese importers. We the cars, and that is a good profit for them. not good enough to say that they are creating some jobs for our workers because, quite frankly, I think that with government intervention Austrahan car industry we could produce better cars and more opportunities for our employees. on What We could provide them with a environment and pay them more than they recylinder of the car. What ceive at present. That could be achieved if we the Australian Industry Development worked on this basis. Mr MCVeigh-They are getting too much doing nothing now. What is wrong with you?",37
71,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMISSION,I think that is an outwould rageous statement to make. I hope it is repeated in the honourable member's electorate. He says that Australians working on the car production line are getting too much.,39
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION, your Order! I remind the honourable member for Darling Downs that interjections are out of order.,39
73,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMISSION,"I do not mind the the interjection, Mr Deputy Speaker. It just shows obtained either. the heartlessness of the man. If he on a car production line and received the paltry pay given to the migrants who are brought into this country he would reaUse the situation. Of course many other people in this country are dire straits, but do not take it out on the people who are working in the car production factories. Have a few brains and look at what is happening from the point of view of those factories. We do not own any part of them. I ask the Government and the honourable member for Darling Downs: What is wrong with being Australian for once your Ufe? Stand up and back something Ausworse traUan, on the basis that we will bring in nology. If we get an export market, which we could if we had a suitable car, we would viable industry. The alternative is nothing The car industry will not be maintained here on the present basis. It will not be a viable osition for the people here. They are interested only in profits. Look at the ownership of the manufacturers in Australia. General Motorsthe Holden's Pty Ltd is 100 per cent overseas owned; Chrysler Australia Ltd is 97 per cent overseas owned; the Ford Motor Co. of Australia is 100 per cent overseas owned. AMI Ltd, a comin ponent manufacturer, is 50 per cent Australian In owned. It gets the spin-off. We do not see an opour portunity for Australian manufacturers to go to and start an industry there. We would crushed overnight. We would not get in. We have no chance of entering the Japanese market buy because the Japanese have their own views It is about who will manufacture in their country. We could have a market for a worthwhUe car of the type I have mentioned. It would need a lot of in the technology behind it. do we have? A paltry $ 100,000 is given better working duce a. car. Itthat the basis it might assist the man to prowould not produce even the first must be done, through Corporation or equivalent bodies, is that money must be for given for worthwhUe Australian technology so that the car can be put on a production Une. If the manufacturers here are not interested in it they have a competitor. As a Minister I had the difficult task of saying to General MotorsHolden's and Ford: 'What about, together with the Japanese, going to Chrysler and using the 4-cylinder plant in South Australia to make all 4-cylinder engines?' Ford said: 'We will not do it. We will import them'. General Motors said: 'We will not do it. We will make them ourselves'. As a result we tried to get Chrysler and Japanese to do it. It would have made Chrysler viable. That result has not been We will not get anywhere with had ever been an industry that makes its own arrangements on the basis that it will continue to make profits. We have a social problem with the people who in are made redundant and who have lost their jobs. It is said here repeatedly that the consumer is paying through the nose for a high priced product indeed because of the protection that has been given. Quite frankly, we could say to all these workers that they need not work at all, that we could give to them all the money that is being in paid in protection, and we would not be any off. We ought to recognise the fact that we techare retarding our own technology by allowing overseas interests to mastermind what should be have a produced. There have been no new rapid at all. improvements in car technology here. We are nowranninginto the situation which is propwell known in which we could be short of petroleum fuel. These overseas interests would car not have any compunction at all in closing down factories here. It would be only a smaU percentage of their capital investments throughout the world and of their markets. WhUe we are not anti-Japanese, anti-American or anti-European, we must be pro-Australian for the first time in car industry. Let us look at Australian invenwhich tiveness and technology and ability to put on a production line. We drift on each year readThe ing the periodical IAC reports which, to some extent, are good. To the extent of being a politicountry cal feasibility, they are hopeless indeed. Nobody can say that we cannot give job opportunities to people in the car industry unless we provide alternative employment. The only way to do for the Government, together with the enterprisMalcolm ing groups in Australia which have capital and inventiveness, and together with the work force, to say: 'There is an opportunity for you here. could use your skill'. Mr Hyde-Look at pages 39 and 40 of the report.",39
74,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMISSION,"Pages 39 and 40 of from the report do not indicate that solution at This is the problem which we have. The issue whether we leave it to the free market forces. Government cannot get away with that in this country. That is the point. We wiU have no indus-look try left. I make thisfinalpoint. We welcome report, but it is a stop-gap measure. The issues which I want a government to look, whatever government it is, is how we can guarantee a viable motor car industry in Australia. It can be done. It requires government initiative government intervention.",40
75,Mr CORBETT,COMMISSION," I believe that the Australian community at large welcomes reports put out by the Industries Assistance Comcent mission in relation to industries. I believe it generally accepted that the reports are unbiased or as unbiased as we get here. Therefore the Government must give very serious considercars. ation to the reports that are put out from time time. The honourable member for Kingsfordfive Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) was a Minister in the previous Government which affected the cost of production in this country during the period that it was in office more than the cost has ever been affected in history, and I hope it will not be repeated. The explosion of the cost structure Australia as a result of the reckless economic poUcies introduced in the days of Government has made the cost of protection of Australian industries so much greater than it would otherwise have been and so much greater than it ought to be. That is one of the problems we are facing today. Despite the amount of protralian tection that is given to secondary industries, the car industry in particular, that amount of tection is not in itself sufficient to retain the per cent of the market that we want to preserve for local manufacturers. That is one of the the reasons why we have quotas. That is something we must not forget. We must continue to a car remind the Australian people of that fact. explosion of the cost structure at that time is the greatest cause of unemployment in this today. It is the greatest cause of the problem that we face in maintaining a viable mdustry. Take, for example, the shipbuilding industry. All that this Government was asking of the it is industry, all that the Prime Minister (Mr Fraser) asked for, was a period free of industrial strife which would enable the Government to consider the whole area of buUding ships Wein Australia. The Government could get no assurances that there would be no industrial strife during that period. That was one of the factors which prevented the Newcastle State Dockyard being given assistance. The cost to the Ausall. tralian community of buUding a ship here, by is comparison with the cost of importation of a Theship, was such that the Government felt that it was too high a price to pay and that we should at some other avenues to see whether the the cost to the Australian community of giving ematployment to people generaUy throughout this countiy could be reduced to some extent. It is true, as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith said, there is buyer resistance. and Buyers realise that the cost of Australian manufactured cars, by comparison with imported cars, is too high. It is a quickly escalating cost. Anyone who has had to buy a car in retimes has found that despiterisingcosts genis erally the price of cars hasrisenhigher than the price of anything else. I do not think the price of anything else hasrisenhigher than the price of That is because of the cost involved. It is an to extremely heavy cost. I have a car which is about years old. I would have to pay for a simUar new car double what I paid for it. I paid thousands of dollars for it in thefirstplace. So thousands of dollars extra have to go into a new car. No wonder there is buyer resistance. One of the reasons for it-w e must never forget this-is that in the cost structure in this country has risen so steeply. It is still flowing on, despite the best the Whitlam efforts of this Government. There is a very strong feeUng in rural areas in particular that exporters as a section of the Australian community are carrying an unduly high burden of the cost of protection provided to Ausindustries. I realise- I think most people to realise-that it is essential that the Government proretain industries in Australia because of the de80 gree of employment that they provide. We have no other option. We must consider very carefully the areas in which we can best utilise the tax returns to this Government in order to provide employment. I think it is reasonable to draw attention to the fact that there is a great deal of imbalance. My friend the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh) drew attention to the problems confronting people in rural industries who are receiving very poor returns. We should be maintaining a better balance between rural exporting industries and protected manufacturing industries. I strongly suggest that more government assistance by way of reduced government charges should be appUed in order to reduce the crippling costs borne by those rural exporting industries. There are ways of doing it. One measure which I believe would assist very greatly in this direction and which is fully justified would be the reimplementation of fuel price equalisation and a full equalisation when the scheme is re-introduced as well as the reintroduction of the old scheme. In discussing and considering the protection of industry we should look at the protection of aU industries in this country. We are losing employment in our rural industries as a result of the high cost structure and the impossibUity of making profits under the present conditions. There is another way that assistance to the rural industry could be enhanced. That is by a review of telephone charge zones with a view to thenexpansion in rural areas to allow more local access calls and to include a local call to the nearest main business centre. When the Government is looking at the establishment and protection of industries that should be considered very carefully. There are problems related to the employment of people in this country. We know of them. There are many facets to them. The report from the Industries Assistance Commission on passenger motor vehicles has caused reaction among representatives of dealers who handle imported vehicles. Recently I received a telegram from a dealing organisation. I shall read it to the House for honourable members to see the many angles that the Government has to take into consideration. It stated: A Datsun Dealer Meeting in Brisbane on 10 October attended by 236 representatives of 60 Queensland and Northern Rivers dealers, viewed with concern and disbelief the recommendation by the IA.C. that the Datsun quota of fully imported passenger vehicles is slashed by about 30 per cent. Following our Government's agreement with Nissan manufacturing in Australia, dealers were required and did expend their investment and facilities for the sale and service of Datsun vehicles. Fully imported passenger cars in a volume at least equal to that previously enjoyed are essential to - ble us to service our investment, to remain viable and to support Nissan by taking and selling increasing numbers of the less profitable locally manufactured vehicles. We cannot understand the reasoning behind the recommendation that would penalise Nissan who is investing many millions of dollars in this country and would favour the companies which have chosen to adhere solely to the import and build-up of passenger cars with no contribution to the employment of Australians in the manufacturing segment of our industry. The meeting resolved to seek your support in ensuring that our Government disregards the IAC recommendation and provides sufficient quota to enable Datsun dealers to receive no less imported vehicles than previously and supports a company which is encouraged to invest in Australia. That telegram sets out the position from another angle. It is one of many angles that the Government has to take into consideration. It is certainly very important from a national point of view, as well as from the point of view of the beef industry, that we have regard to our trade balance with Japan. We are not trading with Japan as successfully as we would like and we are not being given the consideration by Japan that we ought to be given. But surely we have to consider the importance of the Japanese markets to our beef producers. The question of restricting imports from Japan cannot be taken lightly. The beef industry certainly needs the Japanese market. We are not getting the share of the market which we ought to be getting. The newly appointed Australian Meat Board should examine that angle. But it will be handicapped if we restrict our imports from Japan. The Government has to decide- I agree that this is a very difficult problem-the relative merits of the arguments from various sections of the community. That is what the Government is doing. This was set out in a joint statement issued recently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Cotton) and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Wal Fife. I welcome Mr Fife's appointment to that portfoUo. I am pleased to see him in the chamber for the debate this afternoon. Mr Carige-He is a very good Minister.",40
76,Mr CORBETT,COMMISSION,"I agree with my friend for Capricornia; he is a very good Minister. The joint statement read: The Ministers said that the Government had accepted the Commission's recommendation that quantitative import restrictions on passenger motor vehicles should be continued until 31 December 1979. Senator Cotton and Mr Fife said that the Government considered that continued restrictions were necessary to prevent severe disruption in the local industry. The Ministers said that the Government believed that unless import restrictions were continued the local industry's market share would fall below the level of 80 per cent which the Government regarded as necessary to avoid disruption. However, the Government did not accept the Commission's recommendation that the market sharing policy be terminated on 31 December 1979. Any arrangements necessary to ensure that market disruption does not take place after that date can only be determined during 1979. I believe that this is a fairly well balanced view of the Industries Assistance Commission report. The statement refers to a number of other matters. However, I quote the last paragraph. It stated: The Ministers also said that the Government had accepted the Commission's recommendation that no additional action was necessary inrespectof impons of unassembled passenger vehicles which are assembled outside the motor vehicle plan. The Ministers said however, that the Government did not favour any significant expansion of investment in assembly operations outside the plan and imports of unassembled vehicles would therefore be closely monitored. We have a very real problem in deciding the real balance. I emphasise again that in looking at assistance to industry we have neglected to give to primary industry the - amount of assistance needed to enable people to survive and to be ready purchasers of the vehicles produced in this country. Unless the Government fully accepts that responsibihty we will have problems not only in employment in the rural industry but also in the provision of export income which is vitally important to the economic welfare of this country. I commend the Government on giving serious consideration to the report of the Industries Assistance Commission. I hope it will consider the various factors I have raised. It is vitally important that Australia has a balanced development. That is one of the policies of the Party which I am proud to represent in the Parliament. Question resolved in the affirmative. STATES GRANTS (HOUSING ASSISTANCE) BILL 1977 Debate resumed from 4 October, on motion by Mr Newman: That the Bill be nowreada second ume.",41
77,Mr UREN,COMMISSION,"The housing of the Australian people has always great visions of the Labor Party. It is a vision which goes back to 1944 and the report of the Commonwealth Housing Commission. report is one of the great documents of Australian politics. Its guiding Ught was Walter Bunning who went on to become after creating this report. Despite his fame as an architect there is no doubt in my mind that this report is his finest achievement. It is a warm and earlier human document which based the problems of post-war housing firmly on the needs of people and communities. The vision of the Commonwealth Housing Commission report was centred on a massive pubUc housing program but it also included much else. It developed a wide range of proposals for public transport, community development, pubUc participation and land use control. It had all the planning controls that were necessary but in the end the restrictions on money for housing by the Menzies Government, the Holt Government and the MCMahon Government did not allow the inter-related programs of urban and regional development to proceed. If these proposals had been adopted Australia would have had a full-scale urban and regional development program 20 years ago. It is a tragedy that the great vision was allowed to fade away. The Chifley Government was able to introduce only the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement before it was defeated in 1949. The conservative government which followed watered down the great welfare scheme and scrapped the other proposals designed to reinforce it. Urban and regional development was handed over to the private sector. The provision of welfare housing was thrust upon the States. The end result has been the gradual collapse of welfare housing and the serious plight of the housing industry which is revealed by an analysis of the measure before the House. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) would like us to believe that the Government is maintaining the level of spending on welfare housing. If we look carefuUy at the figures we find that this is not the case. Gross advances to the States have increased by a small amount in money terms. Increases in repayments of advances and interest Second Reading payments more than absorb the small increases in gross advances. In 1977-78 gross advances to the States rose by $ 15m but the net funds which the States could use after meeting the debt service costs fell in money terms by $2m.

Interest rates remain at punishing levels and the Government has slashed the funds avaUable to the States for Uc housing. I refer to the latest report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry. It predicts that the actual completions in 1977-78 will be only 135,000, which is well short of the desirable level of 154,000. Last year the level of completions was 142,000 and the desirable level was 148,700. That means that two years government poUcy has produced a shortfall of about 25,000 dwellings. It must mean over-crowding and a lack of adequate standards of shelter for Australian families-in other words, lower living standards.

There is no stress or pressure on either men or material. They are pub-both available. If anyone wants building materials they are avaUable. The men are avaUable to work. Those are the two major questions involved. The fact is that no stimulus is being provided by the Government. It should be made avaUable particularly for this sector of the housing industry. If one looks at the situation under in the Labor Government, when there was a recession in the buUding industry, one will see that Labor stimulated the public sector in order to assist the home buUding sector. The industry has the capacity to buUd 15,000 more homes than the forecast level for 1977-78.I am talking about present time. The Indicative Planning Council, which is giving advice to the Government, represents the industry, the trade union movement and other sectors. There is a great deal of surplus capacity in the home building sector. Until it is put to work, the level of unemployment will increase and further resources will be lost to it. I turn now to make some comments about the impact of monetary pohcy on the housing market. The Minister should listen to what I have to say. He stressed that the level of lending by banks and building societies was approaching the high level of 1975-76. Either he ignores or he is ignorant of the fact that over the past two years the cost of the land and house package has increased by at least 20 per cent to 25 per cent. If we are to achieve the same level of activity in 1977-78 as we achieved in 1975-76 this lending will need to be increased by at least 20 per cent to 25 per cent to make up for these higher prices. The Minister also neglects to mention the shift that has taken place over the last two years in the source of funds for housing. In the June quarter of 1976 about 30 per cent of loan approvals were made by the permanent building societies and the finance companies. In the June quarter of this year those institutions were handling 40 per cent of the approvals. This increase was due to a decline of about 10 per cent in the share of the approvals provided by banks. Savings bank loans incur interest rates of about 9 to 10 per cent. Money from building societies and finance companies incurs an interest rate of about 12 per cent. There has been a marked shift in the borrowing patterns to the higher interest sector of the market. Higher interest rates are reducing the borrowing capacity of those who want to buy their own home. With repayments at 25 per cent of income, a home buyer on the average weekly income of $198 could borrow $24,000 at the savings bank interest rate of 9A per cent. He could borrow only $20,250 at the building society rate of 12 per cent. This policy of forcing a home buyer into the higher interest rate bracket lifts the already high deposit gap by more than $4,000. The Minister referred to directives made by the Reserve Bank of Australia to the financial institutions which are aimed at getting them to lend on a basis reflecting regional variations in the capacity of the industry. Both the Government and the Reserve Bank ignore the basic fact that those institutions do not have the resources to analyse where the capacity is under-used and where the need is greatest. The Reserve Bank should join with government agencies to do this essential research. Based on this research, firm indications could then be given to the institutions on where funds should be directed. The directives ignore another imponant fact. More than 40 per cent of housing finance is provided by institutions such as finance companies and buUding societies which are confined to a particular State in their operation. They lack the abiUty to shift funds around the country at will to fulfil a Reserve Bank directive. For these reasons the Minister's remarks about monetary policy are more likely to mislead the House than to inform it. The Minister referred to the negotiations which are going on at present in relation to the new Commonwealth-State housing agreement. There are manyflawsin the Fraser Government's proposal and I want to draw attention quickly to some of them. PubUc housing is not an isolated scheme. We are moving back to the situation we had under the old conservative governments of Menzies, Holt, Gorton and MCMahon in the 1950s and 1960s when the Commonwealth's role was to look after the Commonwealth-State housing agreement but when the Commonwealth was not responsible for the inter-related services involved, about which I spoke earlier. That is the sad situation that continues under this Government. The Department, which is now under the administration of this Minister, was set up by the Labor Government. It was a department which gave muscle and understanding to the whole interconnected relationship of urban and regional development. Now the Department has the strength of a powder puff within the Fraser Government. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, who is at the table, is Uttle in stature and Uttle in authority and that is the measure of his influence in the Fraser Government. This is a sad situation. This is why no real l advance will be made in this respect. PubUc housing is not an isolated scheme. It is a part of a government's total welfare program. A uniform minimum standard should be applied without regard to where people live. This is done with pensions and unemployment benefits. Why can it not be done with housing? Under the proposed new agreement, minimum standards are left to the States. This will only maintain existing differences between the States and widen inequaUties. I suggest that this minimum standard should be that a tenant pays no more than 12 per cent-and I stress that percentage-of household income or he should pay the market rent, whichever is the smaller. According to the latest household expenditure survey-and again if the Minister's department is not obtaining this information, I will do the work for him-the average household spends 10.7 per cent of income on housing if it has no children and 11.3 per cent if it has. There is no reason why poorer families who are being looked after under welfare housing should be forced to pay more for their shelter than is paid by the rest of the community. With the move to market rent it is inevitable that higher income tenants will be forced to private dwellings. Housing commissions will be left with lower income tenants many of whom will have to claim rental rebates. The States will face heavy repayments of these rental rebates. In effect, the Fraser Government wants it both ways. It wants to claim credit for getting higher income tenants out of welfare housing and it wants the States to pay for it. This puts the States into an impossible bind. The States should look very carefully at the burdens of this proposal before they accept it in its present form. I turn now to the home builders account which I have mentioned previously. The provision of home purchase finance under the proposals applies an escalating interest rate scale for repayments. The scale starts at 5 per cent and rises by half a per cent a year. This is much too steep a scale. It means increases in repayments of around 10 per cent in the crucial first two years of the debt. I know that the Minister and the officers in his Department want to try to get over that problem. I admit that the solution to the serious housing problems in this country is extremely difficult to find and it is getting more difficult the days go on. The Minister knows that the main problem for young home owners is to get a foot on the ladder to home ownership. We know that, in the past, a person earning up to about 95 per cent of* average weekly earnings could register under the old scheme and the present scheme for the allocation of a housing commission dwelling. I know that the Government proposes to wipe the Umit of 95 per cent. Further problems will be created if this action is taken. We know that single income families, particularly those Uving in the western suburbs of metropoUtan Sydney, are faced with grave difficulties. Even single income famUies earning up to 135 per cent of average weekly earnings find they cannot meet the monthly repayments on a house. That is why it is necessary not to increase the interest rate at too steep a rate. I believe that the rate should be increased graduaUy. I might say that in certain respects I believe the Government is approaching this problem in a more intelUgent way. I know that some of the recommendations originally made by the Australian Housing Corporation are sinking through even the denser Government members of Cabinet and at least I think some understanding of the situation is coming through. So, I am saying quite clearly that a steep rise in the interest rate will prove too difficult a problem for house owners to overcome. I believe that some concUiation should take place and that the interest rate scale should be phased in probably during the first two years and, when a home buyer gets his foot on the ladder to home ownership the rate could then be gradually increased. Repayments should be geared to incomes or capacity to pay as is the basis of Labor's home loans programs. I proposed the deferred mortgage repayment scheme when we were in government. The scheme was put forward in the last Budget of the Labor Government in 1975-76 and later the Australian Housing Corporation recommended its expansion. The Bill before us is the first inkling that this Government is to take any cognisance of such an approach to the proposition. A deferred mortgage repayment scheme has been used successfully by building societies and other organisations in Britain for many years. The Australian Government cannot rely on the lending institutions to vary the repayments because they do not have the resources to adjust repayments to individual needs. It is disturbing also that the new agreement will provide for an increase in the financial resources avaUable to as the private sector through terminating buUding societies. This will occur both in terms of an increased share of total funds and in terms of the generation of additional surpluses for re-lending. This shift to the private sector ignores the basic fact that the provision of welfare housing is a public responsibUity. I stress that point. Much is said about wanting to solve problems in the private sector. But there are some areas in the public sector that need to be looked after. The financing of welfare housing should not be considered in a way which contributes to profit in the private sector. Furthermore, the new proposal eliminates vendorfinancingand the means test for those eUgible to getfinancialassistance. As I pointed out earUer, under the present scheme the means test for eUgibUity is 95 per cent of average weekly earnings. In a way I support the Government s decision to aboUsh the means test if enough money is to be made avaUable to those who really need it most. But I question whether this will be the situation under this new proposal. cause vendor financing and a means test will eliminated, the numbers of those eUgible cheap housing finance wiU be increased. ing the home buUders account share of the total aUocation of funds from 30 per cent to 40 cent will not be enough to cope with the adtates ditional appUcations. Until the Commonwealth land in gives some commitment to funding the higher That isand demand, these changes can only and longer waiting lists for those in urgent of housing. The Government should have another look the relativities among the States which flow the new agreement on the basis of need. vances per head of population in Queensland under the existing agreement in 1977-78 are less than $19. In Tasmania, they are more than $61. The national average is $28.50. There is no ous reason why, on a per capita basis, Tasmania should get three times as much as Queensland for housing. The final point I want to make is that as a former result of this Government's renewal. This field got only token funding in the 1977-78 Budget. The Government expects that theflexibilitygiven to the States under the new agreement will encourage them to direct funds urban renewal. I hope that if the Minister is vinced that it is important to get into urban renewal he will Usten to my words because I have had more experience in this area than he has had. I experienced a struggle within my own already Cabinet. I won a victory over Woolloomooloo and that was some achievement. The Minister knows that the Glebe, WooUoomooloo and Embeing erald HU1 were great achievements. They were great step forward. I understand that the ter is just as proud of that achievement as Mr Newman-Yes .",43
84,Mr UREN,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"It is my understanding that when together he goes around Australia he says that he is quite proud of those achievements. The Government we expects that under the new agreement the operative flexibility given to the states will to direct funds to urban renewal. The direct our resources be applied financial cost to the states will be too high for the cities so that they can be States to move into urban renewal in this give the House an example, the Glebe estate cost $ 17.5m in 1973-74 for a total of750 properties which 710 were residential. Applying a conspeak servative estimate of 30 per cent for price rises over the past three years that represents about $30,000 a dwelling in current prices. The cost of rehabiUtating a dweUing is about $16,000. I understand that the last dwellings rehabUitated Beat Woolloomooloo cost about $14,000. At be present day costs the cost per dweUing can be befor tween $44,000 and $46,000. The cost of the ChangWoolloomooloo renewal which the Labor Government sponsored was of the same order. per By comparison, some of the newer housmg esthe outer areas of Sydney are offering a house packages at around $30,000. terrible price to pay but that is the situmean bigger ation. That illustrates need volved and it is highlytheunlikely direct cost burden in that the States will be willing to go into urban renewal in a bold at way. Urban renewal will be neglected and great from opportunities will be missed. We want more AdGlebes, more Woolloomooloos and more Emerald Hills. We do not want the Commonwealth opting out of the renewal of inner city dwelling areas or handing this field over to the private secobvitor. This would mean that lower income earners would be forced out and the affluent would take over. I do not need to spell out to the Minister or to the House that the affluent are moving into working class areas Uke Carlton in Melbourne or Paddington in Sydney. Those are just approach to urban two examples. Urban renewal makes sound economic sense because it allows proper use to be made of long to standing urban services. Inner city areas which conare renewed are serviced already with schools and hospitals, many of them working well below capacity. There is good public transport and the basic services of water, sewerage and electricity exist. In the outer suburbs all these facUities and services have to be provided, some at very high cost to the taxpayers. The burden is transferred to people living in the outer a areas, particularly under the Fraser GovernMinisment's new federaUsm. The burden is being we are. transferred to the ordinary ratepayers. The only solution to the problem of urban renewal is for the Commonwealth to work with the States and local government as did with Woolloomooloo. We must look at the direct and indirect costs involved in a coencourage themtributing tobasisthe with the Commonwealth condirect cost. Only in this way can efficiently to the inner re-created as living way. To areas for lower income earners. of In the last few seconds I have in which to I want to stress this situation again. I believe that the new proposal to allow and encourage the States to move into the field of urban renewal is not good enough. It is like saying that they are free to do what they wish without being able to do so. If we are to do the right thing by the States and if we are to rehabilitate our great metropolises, particularly Sydney and Melbeing bourne but other parts of Australia as well, it is very important indeed for the Commonwealth theTheFederal Government to be a partner. Governments which should co-operate and there ment on such things as zoning areas, as we did in the case of Woolloomooloo. That project inmission unit volved a conservative New South Wales while the Government, a conservative city council and a It Federal Labor Government but the three bodies state: worked together in a spirit of co-operation. I beOfthe lieve that one day the redevelopment of Woolloomooloo will be a great economic boom. Resources would have been misused if that area had been kept for commerce and there had been erty over-centrahsation. I hope that cussions the Minister will listen to some of the to families criticism from this side of the House.",46
85,Unknown,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,47
86,Mr CADMAN,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"The House is debating the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill 1977. The purpose of this Bill is to obtain approval of Parliament for the payment to States of advances amounting to $390m in also of advances equivalent to one-half of that amount during the first six months of the year 1978-79. It also authorises the Treasurer to borsaw row moneys for the purpose of making these vances. This Bill moves into the area of the Commonwealth-Stat e Housing Agreement and the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States for the provision of welfare housing and assistance to the States in the housing area. The Commonwealth Government, in the year that expires in June 1978, will have provided $l,734m to the States for home loans for low moderate income earners. More than 300,000 houses have been constructed for rental or sale since the Agreement was first introduced in 1945. Concessional home loans forfinancingthe purwUl chase of private homes were introduced in 1956. More than 150,000 famUies have received these loans. In total, about $4 bUlion has been proyear vided to the States under the Agreement for which the Bill provides funds. One must assess this context the total ambit of the Housing Agreement. I draw the attention of the House to an editorial which appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 15 February this year. The editorial states: Federal Housing Minister Kevin Newman has picked unpopular but necessary argument with the States in his attempts to reform the Federal-State housing agreement. It goes on to say: Mr Newman claims that welfare housing benefits are misused and the whole system exploited. The only thing the Minister is guilty of is understatement. traditional form of welfare housing in Australia is that Government channels money to the States, then use housing commissions as construction and alshould be agreelocation agencies. The problem is that once a person gains a housing comhe is literally set for life. Tne rent remains static family's income naturally rises over the years. is interesting to note that the article goes on to 183,000 housing commission tenants in Australia only 51,000 would be classified as poor. The Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Povpointed this up very clearly in its inquiry as in the coming disHousingshould to who be entitled to benefits under the Agreement-benefits that give assistance of poor circumstances. The simple and eminently reasonable proposition being put by the Fraser Government is that those housmg commission tenants who can afford to pay market rentals should do so. Those stiU on low incomes should be subsidised and the net effect should be to protect the real poor in housing the commission units while making more money avaUable to commissions to increase the housing 1977-78 and stock for others in need. I refer the House also to a Press release that I in the Australian on 14 February this year in adwhich it was stated that famUies earning up to $500 a week are paying only as Uttle as $25 a week for rental under this Agreement. The negotiations that are taking place at the moment to redraw the Housing Agreement are of particular interest to those who seek to provide shelter or accommodation for their families. Under the guidelines that have been agreed to by the Comto monwealth and the States under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, it is proposed that the States will receive funds at a basic interest rate of 4Vi per cent per annum but they loan to agencies at an escalating interest rate, commencing at 5 per cent in the first year but increasing by half a per cent in each subsequent until a rate equivalent to the long term bond rate is reached. This is where funds are provided in for the home ownership assistance scheme and are normally provided to the pubUc through the terminating buUding societies. The States, under this proposal, can decide which individual borrowers they will choose and they have an ability to adopt a number of flexible lending practices such as interest escalation, deferred repayments an or income geared or second mortgage loans. The Agreement provides a greatflexibUityand opportunity for State governments to provide services at a level at which the community is most in need. It is interesting to note in fact as years have gone by under this Agreement percentage of average weekly earnings that been set aside for the payment of interest repayments under the terminating funds or the home ownership assistance program have declined quite significantly. In 1936 the average loan was $5,300. The repayment per week on loan which was over 31 years was $6.71 a week. This comprised about 19 per cent of the average weekly earnings when the loan was made but today it is only 3.6 per cent of the average weekly earnings. In loans made in 1976, the average was $18,000. The average repayment was $24 a week, which is about 14 per cent of average weekly earnings. The House will see that those people who received loans in early years have spent some time repaying these commitcommissions ments are now paying at a very low rate comchanges pared with the rest of the community. Many these families and individuals benefit greatly the very generous arrangements that were cies adopted in earUer years. In addition, the concessions for home ship have increased by the introduction of the housing loan interest tax deductibility for new home builders, the new Homes Savings Grants Scheme-bot h of which were introduced the present agreement commenced. But a very significant factor in the proposed Agreement be the ability of States to accrue funds that they receive from houses which are purchased. Any surplus which the States gather will be put home purchase assistance account and, subwith. sequently, re-lent to home seekers. On calcuthose lations, this indicates that the States will much greater capacity to provide on-going tance-ver y substantial assistance-to those seekindeed, ing to purchase their own homes but whose means are limited. To be eUgible for a terminathowever, ing building society loan, the Government protenants poses to remove the present means test which was set at 95 per cent of average weekly ings. This was an arbitrary test and in fact famUies that were only slightly outside the 95 cent suffered by not being able to receive a loan. The Government will be encouraged to have regard to family incomes, the size of houses and the assets of the intending borrowers, thus ensurwUl ing that assistance is directed properly to those need. most in need. I turn now to the sale of dwellings. The restricstep tions that were formerly placed on the housing commissions and the housing trusts for the sale of their housing stock will be removed but, under the conditions of the Agreement, they will lowed to sell for cash at market or replacement that price. This will again allow funds to be returned the to the Home Purchase Assistance Fund and it have will allow stocks to be replaced very simply by or the housing commissions and trusts. This mechanism should ensure that waiting Usts are not unnecessarily extended and that market prices will permit the States to repurchase existing dwellthe ings in estabUshed neighbourhoods, perhaps next door to a house which has been sold, so that the diversity of housing stocks and their siting within particular cities, whether hi the fringe areas or the inner city areas, will be maintained. In the rental housing area the Government has moved to strike an agreement which is both equitable and fair. Each State wiU be free to decide which agencies can participate in a rental proand gram. Under the present program the housing or trusts are the major agents. The will make it possible for the States to alof locate funds to voluntary or charitable housing by groups or to local government where those agenare better able to assist in providing housing services. This is a most flexible and thoughtful ownerapproach to the new Housing Agreement. The Bill which we are debating is providing funds for part of this program. Indeed, after June 1978 the first six months of the new program will be since covered by this Bill. EUgibUity to obtain rental housing has been will based on a means test of 85 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is proposed that this specific test will be removed to allow some of the existing into a anomalies I have mentioned to be done away However, rental rebates will be paid to tenants who are on lower income. Many of have a these tenants are reUant upon Commonwealth assissocial security and welfare payments and, are in need of assistance in providing a home for their famUies. In some circumstances, as I have mentioned already, long term are paying very low rents for dwelUngs located in inner suburbs yet their family circumearnstances and income might have changed dramatically. Therefore, it is the intention of the per Government that those people who fall outside the guidelines will pay full market rental. The States will be encouraged to charge full market rental for accommodation and the rental rebates be given to those individuals who are most in The new Housing Agreement will be a giant forward for the Government and for those people seeking to provide their famUies with accommodation. The Australian Financial Review has clearly set out some of the benefits which will be alflow from such a scheme. But the Federal Government spends more than $900m a year on housing and spending of this magnitude should constantly be evaluated to ensure that the taxpayers' money is being allocated in a fair and efficient way but in such a way that itflowsto those people genuinely in need. This is the objective of the proposed Agreement. It is interesting to note that when the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) first announced some of the details which he wished to discuss with State Premiers the Labor States were most reluctant to join in with what should be an objective for all poltiical parties, that is, the provision of housing for those people genuinely in need rather than a continuance of support for some individuals who should not be receiving the very great benefits which are obvious under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The various programs which the Government has introduced will support the initiatives being taken in home purchase and ownership and the rental of housmg accommodation. To set the whole housing industry in context in relation to this Bill and the assistance that will be applied to individuals, one needs to refer to the Government's economic pohcy for the buUding industry. Inflation is still seen by the Government as the key element in budgetary strategy. The strongly expressed view of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is that real wages are still too high- I think that most honourable members on this side of the House would agree with this-in relation to productivity gains made during the past year. The Government beUeves that this can best be rectified by the normal processes of concUiation and arbitration so that wage restraint will be followed up and a necessary backup is felt to Umit and control money supply. This is because without an accommodating increase in the money supply wage increases will be very difficult to finance. If a wage restraint policy is successful in ing real wages, with some growth in overseas demand for exports the balance of payments can be expected to improve. Indeed, it is improving. This would remove any downward pressure from the exchange rate and would also assist with movements in interest rates and other factors related to the buUding industry. The matter of interest rates is one that is being watched by many individuals. The strategy for lowering interest rates must be linked with the lowering of inflation. If inflation is brought under control as economic circumstances permit, so interest rates will fall. Even a modest reduction of interest rates would provide some stimulus and assistance for the housing industry. I am very anxious to see that the Government pursues its stated objective, which has been expressed on a number of occasions, of decreasing interest rates so that those people seeking to purchase homes can do so with ease and with benefit to them and to their famUies. Over the past 12 months the housing industry has performed above what was expected this time last year. Approximately 140,700 homes were commenced and 144,400 homes were completed. The forecast last year was that 148,000 homes was the desirable level of construction but the feasible level was set at 138,000 homes. The actual construction was 144,000 homes. This was about 104 per cent of the feasible goal set by the Housing Industry Indicative Planning Council last year. The actual completions represented 106 per cent of the recommended goal and 110 per cent of the forecast. So in fact this Government has deUvered more than it set out to deliver and more than was recommended by the Indicative Planning Council. I think this is an indication of the Government's concern for the buUding industry-it s concern for people wishing to purchase their own homes. It is interesting to note that on 4 August statements appeared in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald to the effect that buUding projects worth a total of $966m were completed in the Sydney and South Coast areas in the 1976-77 financial year. This represents in terms of value an increase of 61 per cent over the previous year. How is that for performance? All new buUdings, homes, andflats,as well as alterations and additions to existing homes, are included in those figures. The number of jobs completed was 30,248, an increase of 34 per cent on the 1975-76 total. The President of the Sydney Water Board, Mr Walder, said that thefiguresdid not show all the money spent on construction. There was an increase of 34 per cent in actual jobs completed reducand an overall increase of 61 per cent m the Sydney area. Those are official Water Board figures. Within the Parramatta region, Parramatta experienced the biggest brUding boom of any local government area in Sydney, except Blacktown and Campbelltown. Those areas which are showing the stress of increased population are responding very well to the policies which are being put forward by this Government. It is interesting to notice that today in a further release from the Commonwealth statistician there is an indication of increased lending by buUding societies.",47
87,Mr LES JOHNSON,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"The House is debating the annual States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill. The purpose of the legislation is to give effect to the fifth year of a housing agreement which was negotiated by the Austrahan Labor Party Government. I think the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) in fact acknowledged in his second reading speech, and would acknowledge at any time, that this agreement has had a great impact on housing in Australia. Its introduction was timely in that it provided an incentive for public housing at a time when the private sector was degenerating, principally as a result of the pohcies which prevailed before 1972. There is no need for me to enunciate the fact that when the Labor Government took office a problem of an unusual variety was prevailing in the housing area in Australia. It was principaUy associated with the fact that the revious Liberal-Country Party Government E ad failed to understand that a proper, effective relationship should have been maintained between manpower, money and material. There was a massive expansion of money. Everyone can recall those difficult days in 1972 immediately following the election of the Labor Government when it was impossible to get tradesmen at reasonable prices, when bricks, timber and white metals were in short supply and when houses were taking longer to build. It was necessary at that time to try to regulate the scene. The Labor Government moved into the area of pubUc housing. It was not easy to redress the anomalous situation in which the Government found itself at that time. It takes a long time to train tradesmen and to bring the supply of tradesmen up to the flow of money which has been generated. But we recognise that if low interest money was made available the States would be anxious to do what they could to overtake the back-log in pubUc housing. It was at that time that extended negotiations took place with the States. I heard the previous speaker the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) talk about the fact that a new agreement is in offing and indicate the displeasure of the Labor Government States with the terms of that agreement. An agreement means what it says. It is either an agreement or it is not. I sincerely hope that the Minister has been as respect. successful in getting some acquiescence or some understanding about the housing scene from State Housing Ministers as I was the previous agreement. I shall go through the figures. Soon after our election in 1972 we pro-just vided $6.6m to take up the slack. We brought the 1972-73 figure to $169.8m. In the next year, 1973-74, there was an increase of 26 per cent, $218.65m. In 1974-75 thefigurewent up, I think from memory, by 70 per cent, to $318m. That was almost double thefigureprovided by the Liberal Government in 1972-73. That fact probably needs some emphasis. In 1974-75 the Labor Government just about doubled the allocation which the Liberal Government had left as a legacy. In 1975-76 thefigurewent up to $364.6m. Actually, it was $375m because $ 10.4m had been provided in the previous year. In 1976-77 the allocation went to $375m. Now we have a figure of $390m. That is history. I do not suppose people who are waiting for a house are concerned about that. But they are concerned about the new agreement which the Minister has been negotiating and which was the subject of his Press release on 15 September of this year. It is No.P77/30. I comment on my understanding of some aspects of the new agreement. It is very important for people to understand that without a Commonwealth-State housing agreement, without a public housing arrangement, many people in this country wiU be unable to obtain a house either for rent or for purchase. So this is important legislation for the little people of Australia. The new agreement which is in offing undoubtedly has some virtues. In my view it has some shortcomings too. In thefirstinstance, as I understand it, it will be a three year agreement instead of the five year agreement which is about to expire. I think that is unfortunate. The States like to feel that they can understand thescenario which will prevaU for the next five years so that they can prevaU in forward planning, in the acquisition of land and in the many other related matters. I do not have to go into them in detail. If the States are to depend on builders in the private sector to buUd houses it is imperative that those builders should get some understanding about continuity of work. This even effects the apprenticeship system in the building area, the sub-contracting area and the like. No one is going to take on apprentices unless he understands there is a schedule of work ahead. I think it is unfortunate that the Minister apparently has faUed to negotiate afiveyear agreement. That will have some deleterious consequences. I wish I had more time to spell out the potential in that the Mr Keith Johnson-We will move for an in negotiating extension of time.",49
88,Mr LES JOHNSON,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"I will not get it so I will carry on. The second factor is that as yet there is no indication as to the amount of funds which will be allocated. We will never know the to real merits of this agreement until we see the extent to which the Government will put its money where its mouth is; in other words to the extent that it backs up the whole matter. I understand that the States are now to be free to set their own standards. Whether this is a virtue, only time will teU. If governments are to be free to set poor standards by using subsidised money which comes from the taxpayers, I think that is unfortunate. For example, is the Minister quite indifferent as to whether States might build high rise buildings which have anti-social features and which are bad places in which to rear families? If he does not care about that, that is a retrograde step. If he does not have much concern over the fact that one State-there is always a State which is at the lower end of the scale in terms of standards-want s to build litde unimaginative fibro boxes with a lack of insulation, poor construction quality and on bad subdivisions- I have seen such developments which are especially in evidence in Queensland-wher e in many instances the roads have not been sealed and kerbed with guttering, where sewerage has been lacking, where there has been a deficiency of town planning considerations, relationship to employment opportunities, communication, schools, pre-schools and the likeMr MCVeigh-Is that in Brisbane?",50
89,Mr LES JOHNSON,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"The honourable member for Darling Downs is from Queensland. He ought to know. It is regrettable if he does not. If the Minister does not believe it is important to get value for taxpayers' money, I think he is letting the side down. The next feature is that it is intended to take away the provision which limits the number of houses to be sold. All Liberals, of course, think it is a virtue to sell everything. But the faa is that there is a lot of virtue in holding stock of housmg authority homes, especially in inner city areas. If the number sold is not limited-som e of the States are prone to engage in a selling process-it has the effect of forcing the unfortunate taxi driver, the waitress, the lift driver and so on, out to the perimeter of the cities where they are often required to pay something like $5, $6, $7, or even $8 a week in public transport fares. These are the people who least of all can afford to pay such fares. So I think that is a bad factor. The previous Agreement did put a Umitation on the number of houses which were to be sold. I might say that that was not achieved as a result of Labor doctrinaire standover tactics. Liberal Housing Ministers acquiesced with it. A former Minister for Housing and a former Treasurer, Leslie Bury, strongly advocated that proposition. So did the Director of Housing in New South Wales and many other people. They just understood that, if all the houses were sold off in order to get the quick quid, people would be forced out to the perimeter areas and that the replacement costs would be very considerable indeed. Another intention declared by the Minister is to lift interest rates on money borrowed to construct rental housing from 4 per cent to 5 per cent. That would result in rent increases. I do not regard that as being a virtue. Many people who live in State housing authority homes throughout Australia will be very gravely concerned about that declared intention. We are told that there will be no restriction on sales at all. I have covered that point. As there are other matters I wish to deal with, I will not have time to go into that matter any further. Housing sales will be at market value or replacement costs. Rents are to be raised to the market value. I know that there is a proposal in relation to rent rebates, but the details of that have not been spelt out. In fact, the details are to be left to the States to work out, and we know the indifference displayed by some States, especially Queensland where a very pecuUar system operates. The Minister seems to be quite content to let people become the victims of the determination that anybody might make in that regard. I contend that that is another very serious omission and mistake that he is about to make. I think all honourable gentlemen will understand that there is a Home Builders' Account which provides funds to build houses for sale or to enable people to purchase houses from terminating buUding societies. There is to be a change m the interest rates arrangement. At the a moment interest rates have been limited to S.5 per cent. People whose income does not exceed 95 per cent of average weekly earnings have been able to get their home loan at an interest rate of 5.5 per cent. But the Minister's new proposal is: The interest rate will be 5 per cent in the first year and will escalate at the rate of 0.5 per cent per year up to the ruling bond rate. I am not sure what the bond rate is at the moment. It is a little more than 9 per cent. This is where the Labor Government first came in. When the Labor Government negotiated the Housing Agreement it found that the Liberals had left behind a situation in which the interest rate which the States had to pay was 1 per cent less than the bond rate. That is to say, at the presenttimethe interest rate paid is 1 per cent less than the current bond rate which I said before is a little more than 9 per cent. Wefixedthe interest rate at 4 per cent for 53 years. Mr MCVeigh-You put up the interest rate.",51
90,Mr LES JOHNSON,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"Now it is proposed, if I can say something over the noise of this jackaroo who incessantly interjects for the want of thing sensible to say, that the interest rate lates by 0.5 per cent every year until it reaches the ruling bond rate. I am referring to those people who get loans under the Home Builders' Account. As I understand it, that is a proper analysis of the situation. The Minister 'Under my proposal repayments on an $18,000 loan those paying the lowest rate would be $24 a week in the first year but would rise to a week after about 10 years if the bond remains at its present level'. I do not know that that is such great news for the people concerned. I would like to hear that proposition justified. a backward step, and it will cause very grave concern throughout the community. The Minister also says: 'The rate of interest would not remain fixed but vary with movements in the bond rate'. I emphasise those words. says: 'This would enable end borrowers to benefit from any reduction in the bond rate'. Conversely, the antithesis of that proposition that, if the bond rate is increased the interest will go up. Every honourable member knows that there is one aggravating feature that cerns every person in Australia who borrows money to purchase a home, and that is the fact that when they negotiate a building loan they expect it to be repayable at the rate of interest negotiated. If they negotiate the loan at 7 per cent they hate to see that interest rate go up per cent, then 9 per cent and then 10 per cent. Mr MCVeigh-What if it goes down?",52
91,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"Order! I suggest to the honourable member for Darling Downs that he saves his remarks until the time when he makes his speech. Mr LES JOHNSON So now this very undeAustralian sirable feature which has caused great problems and anxiety for so many people is to be transhe ferred from the private sector to the tor. The Minister will have to justify that move well. Another contention, of course, is that we be removing from the legislation the provision that people who have access to the Home every Builders' Account are not to earn more than 95 per cent of average weekly earnings. ter is going to give the States the right to make those subsidised funds available to more people. Unless he gives much more money, me make it clear that that proposal will have the effect of increasing the queue for building funds; the more affluent people will joint the rat with the less affluent, and the most needy people will probably be the ones who will be unable to somedemonstrate a capacity to repay, even though escathey would be just as suitable as tenants as some other people. Of course, their chances of getting a housing commission home can only diminish. The present means test confines eligibility for a loan to people who earn 85 per cent of average says: weekly earnings. That provision is to be removed, provided that the States ensure that asabout sistance is directed to those most in need. $38 I have endeavoured to give some kind of sumrate mary of the legislation which has been introduced by the Minister. Overall the housing picture under this Government is proving to be It is disastrous. Expenditure on the aged persons homes scheme has been considerably mutilated. Last year's expenditure on that scheme was $42.4m; this year it is to be $50m. Of course, the promise made by the Minister was that $225m He would be made available over three years for aged persons homes. I strongly doubt whether this Government will allocate $ 130m to that prois gram in next year's Budget. Aged people are rate going to suffer. We have had problems in regard to growth centres and area improvement procongrams; the national sewerage program has been abandoned. The land commissions and urban land councils have been run down; the scheme for defence service homes has been interferred with. They are referred to as veterans' homes now. Housing in the Australian Capital Territory to 8 was allocated $20.9m in the 1975-76 Budget; only $ 14.4m is allocated in the present Budget. Expenditure on Aboriginal housing has been reduced from $40.9m to $35m. Total expenditure onhousing has declined in real terms by more than 30 per cent in the last two years. It is no wonder that the Minister at the table is called the 'undertaker'. He has abolished the Housing Corporation. Everything he has put his hands on has turned sour. Everything has done seems to involve a process of public seceliminating Labor's programs. as I sincerely hope that what I have said tonight might encourage him to have a second thought will about the proposed Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement because the obligation that party in government in this country has is to look after the underprivileged so far as housThe Minising is concerned. affluent Mr Acting SPEAKER-Order! The let honourable member's time has expired.",52
92,Mr MCVEIGH,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"This debate deals with both the closing stages of the race present Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement and, as indicated in the second reading speech of the Minister for Environment, Housmg and Community Development (Mr Newman), poUcies and objectives for future housing. In this Bill we are dealing with the allocation of $390m to the various States under the provisions of the 1973-74 Agreement. Each period of Uving gives birth to new phrases and words epitomising the pressures being exerted in that era and the solutions to the pressures so exerted. For housing the in phrase is 'The Affordable House'. What does this mean? What are the consequences? What do we do to avoid housing which is dear, of monotonous design, small and generally not meeting the requirements and aspirations of the community? Why is it that only 20 per cent of young couples are now buying homes? A few years ago 80 per cent of families were committed to housing mortgages. What has happened that people cannot find the deposit to put on a new home? We of the National Country Party submit people stiU want to own theii own homes. If the Commonwealth does not develop in association with the States a housing resources pohcy could end up with a commune or caravan type community on the outskirts of our cities towns. People are becoming fed up with paying rent. I reject the approach of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) who be the Ueves that there is some great value in people continuing to pay rent rather than owning their own homes. People will purchase caravans rather than pay rent, for at least they will end with something of value and not have their financial resources eroded through years of tal payments. The Government and the Minister are to be congratulated on getting at the kernal of the matter-the housing cost inquiry presided over by Mr E. Eyers, to inquire into all matters affecting the cause of inefficiency and unnecesssatisfied arily high costs. It is to be hoped that all sections of the Australian community-the purchaser, builder and the provider of services-wU l give evidence to the mquiry so that answers to the affordable house are readUy forthcoming. As there will be a new Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement next year it is priate to state in this debate a few basic prinincreased ciples of housing. The Commonwealth and the States cannot solve aU the problems of housing. Commonwealth funds provide 9.2 per cent of housing funds in Australia, made up of 6.39 per cent for owner-occupied new dwellings, 0.69 per cent for other classes, and 2.12 per cent for terdecline minating building societies. The savings banks are by far the largest providers of finance for home building. In 1975-76 they provided 124,473 housing loans for a total allocation of funds of $2,177m, for an average loan of $16,726. In 1976-77 they provided 106,740 loans for $2,105m, for an average loan of $18,709. In 1975-76 the trading banks provided 45,286 loans for $804m, for an average loan of $14,775. In 1976-77 they provided 41,218 loans for $806m, for an average loan of $15,639. In 1975-76 the buUding societies provided 71,880 loans for $l,594m, for an average loan of $21,553. In 1976-77 they provided 64,510 loans for $ 1,580m, for an average loan of $24,072. It is to be hoped that the infamous attitude of certain Australian Labor Party spokesmen in the Queensland Parliament will not destroy the buUding societies. They sought to erode the rights of Queensland people to obtain loans from buUding societies by adopting a most undignified and reprehensible approach. that Mr BAILLIEU - A culpable approach.",52
93,Mr MCVEIGH,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"I am most grateful to the honourable member for La Trobe for his comwe ment. The action of the Labor Party in Queensland was such as to create a most unand favourable environment. Quite obviously an analysis of the figures which I quoted indicates two things. Firstly there has been a decrease in number of people granted loans to purchase their own homes and, secondly, the loans have become greater. In essence, more money is being made avaUable by a great government to fewer up people. One cannot come up with any conclusion other than that the average Australian is rendemanding greater standards, and his expectations in housing are higher. Mr Acting Speaker, you will recall the saying of a previous Labor Minister for Housing in this Parliament: 'Let them have smaller homes'. Possibly people were previously with a carport. Now they are requiring garages. Previously they were satisfied the with a wardrobe in a bedroom. They now plan for and expect ensuites. There is more demand for housing finance than can be satisfied by the market. It is pleasantly refreshing to report that fixed approcosts during the last 12 months have not to any marked extent. It is true to say that they have been relatively stable. AdditionaUy we now find in the market place that builders will buUd at afixedcost. No longer do they religiously require rise and fall clauses in various contracts. Unfortunately there has been a in the total number of houses buUt in the last year. In 1976-77 over 140,000 new dwelUngs were completed in Australia. This was some five per cent below the desirable level on an but Australia-wide basis. In effect, we were approxiroach mately 8,000 dwellings below the desirable level on a long term housing goal basis. Housing is like the economy. It cannot be turned on and off at the pleasure of the conand trolling authority. We need long term planning. There have been changes in demographic pathave terns of which one must take cognisance ing pohcy generally. It is to be regretted that there has been an investors' loss of confidence. There is not as much speculative building now we have witnessed in the last decade. Unfortunately, unimproved land is very scarce in the metropoUtan areas of Sydney and Melpopulation. bourne. Wefindchanging requirements of population. People are now demanding housing in areas which are accessible to transport, work and recreation. Our population forecasts have not been as accurate as we could have reasonousing ably anticipated following the results of inquiries a few years ago. There is absolutely no possibUity of our reaching a population of 20 mUlion by year 2000. Possibly it will be closer to the mUlion mark. In the Bill I note with some concern that out of the total allocation of $390m only $39.8 lm being made avaUable to Queensland. Mr Corbett-It is not enough.",53
94,Mr MCVEIGH,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"The honourable member for Maranoa says that it is not enough. I wholeheartedly agree with him. One must quesuon how thisfigurehas been arrived at in accuracy and in fact. At page 47 of the report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing I submit Industry wefindthat the total net migration increase to Queensland on an average basis for the projected migration era 1975-80 will be tices 16,000 people each year. Net migration consists of the sum total of net overseas and net interstate migration. Queensland leads the way, as it does in many things, with that net migration increase of 16,000. The next highest State is Western Austraha with 14,700, whilst New South Wales, obviously under a Labor government, will have a net loss of9,700. Mr Corbett-We are well in front.",54
95,Mr MCVEIGH,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"We are out in front by the two length of the straight. Onefindsgreat difficulty, therefore, in equating, on thesefigures,the cation of the present amount to Queensland. This anomaly must be corrected in the new scheme. Of course one cannot anticipate the guideUnes and the parameters of this scheme, one hopes that there will be a disciplined apwhich will iron out anomaUes between tates, plans and principles. In aU previous plans Queensland has been discriminated against. No doubt this foUowed the apphcation of a system and pohcy which were and are manifestly unjust unfair. Queensland has not received its just share of either loan or housing funds. Funds not been allocated on a per capita basis but in housrather on an historical happening. In the immediate post World War II era beas cause of the State Labor government's pohcy of using reconstruction funds rather than loan funds Queensland receives only 13.35 per cent of total loan funds whilst it has 15 per cent of the SimUarly, because of the marriage the arrangement of distributing Commonwealth housing funds between States on a loan program policy basis, Queensland with 15 per cent of the E opulation receives just under 10 per cent of funds. Translated into homes this is equivalent to denying a home to approximately 1,000 Queensland famUies. The per capita averthe age for the various states for the three years 15 1974-75 to 1976-77 is as follows: New South Wales $25.58, Victoria $26.45, Queensland $18.47, South Australia $45.30, Western is Australia $30.87 and Tasmania $58.82. The Australian average is $28.06. Mr Carige-What was the figure for Queensland?",54
96,Mr MCVEIGH,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,"Th efigurefor Queensland was only $18.47. Queensland, therefore, has every possible reason for feeling discriminated against. On behalf of my Queensland colleagues to the Minister that this must end. It is to be hoped that when the new Agreement is finalised recognition will be given to past injusso that they will not continue for the future. The Labor Party under its Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), did naught to remove the anomaly and correct the injustice. Obviously, the honourable member for Oxley cares naught for Queenslanders. It was he who denied Queenslanders 1,000 homes a year-$22 m for housing. We are deaUng with his Agreement, not ours. Let us hope that we show more concern for Queenslanders than he did. The new Agreement should update poUcy in specific areas;firstly,restriction on sales and, secondly, eUgibUity. People by and large desire alloto own their own homes. State governments should not be shackled with restrictions on how many homes are to be leased or sold. Let the States monitor the position themselves. People who, through progress up the economic ladder, are able to purchase a housing commission home in which they have resided for some years should be able to purchase that home at fair market value. They have probably established a garden and made it a real home in an area that suits them where they like to live. The money obtained from the fair market sale could be used to build more houses for initial rental and possibly later purchase by families on lower incomes. The present qualification for rental is for those earning up to 85 per cent of average weekly earnings and 95 per cent of the same earnings for purchase through co-operative building societies. I am concerned about the other people just above those parameters who can neither save enough for a deposit on a home for purchase nor meet the interest and redemption payments. If we are genuine- I submit that the Government is-abou t meeting the aspirations of Australian people for housing we must extend the umbrella of housing to cover these disadvantaged people. By doing this there could be a twoway beneficial flow. Because these famUies would have access to cheaperfinancethere may not be quite so pressing a need for mothers to work to pay for the home with resultant benefits to famUy Ufe and greater opportunities for work for our unmarried young people. The allocation of $39.8 lm to Queensland is for the provision of welfare housing. This, as stated earlier, is only a relatively small part of the overall housing requirements of the Australian nation. The Commonwealth Government has a specific responsibiUty in homes for the aged, Aboriginal housing and defence service housing. I reject the reasoning of the honourable member for Hughes who drew attention to some of the problems of housing for aged people in Australian society. The reason for this is that his Government promised a lot but delivered nothing whatsoever. With regard to defence service homes it was his Government which brought in a waiting period of 11 months for people requiring a defence service home loan. Our Government has updated the policy so that at present a person who is eligible for a loan and is buUding his own house on his own piece of land obtains that loan immediately. It is to be regretted that no government has seenfitto encourage aged people to stay in their own homes by providing a simUar aUowance as is granted to people who obtain a supplementary rent allowance. I hope that the Minister in his final negotiations with the States can come up with some type of arrangement whereby elderly people who desire to Uve in their own home can be given a simUar supplementary allowance to enable them to carry out the ordinary running repairs to keep their home in a satisfactory condition. This would help government finance in that less money would then be required to provide accommodation in aged persons homes. I know the Minister's great concern to keep people happy in their own environment and give them a choice of remaining among their friends rather than having to go to an aged persons home. Few would disagree with the view that special consideration must be given to the people who are termed low income earners. Similarly, if one accepts this point of view one must, m logic, accept that if through some change in circumstance an original recipient of assistance obtains a greater wage he should be placed in no greater financially advantageous position than anyone else on a simUar income. Accordingly, one cannot question the priorities which will be implemented in the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement referred to by the Minister in his second reading speech. I congratulate him on a well-documented logically argued approach. The aim of the Government in the new Agreement will be to increase the opportunity for home ownership for all Australians. It will have as the heart of the agreement, as has been the heart of all such agreements, the provision of cheap money for the States to buUd rental housing for those most in need. It will be part of the federalism proposals wherein the States will be masters of their own destiny with limited interference from the Commonwealth authorities. It will channel subsidies from the common taxation pool towards those greatest in need. This is surely simple justice and must receive the approval of us all. The annual repayments will still be over the present period of 53 years. Interest rates on loans for rental construction will be set at 5 per cent and the States will be asked to move their rents to market value. The rental rebates, however, will be provided by the States to those who need assistance. The States will be restored to their proper place in the overall sphere of things. In relation to home builders it is to be a stipulation that there will be an escalating rate of interest for those who participate in the scheme until the ruling bond rate is reached. Any revenue accruing under the terms of the Agreement will be retained by the States to grant more assistance in housing areas generaUy. State governments can allocate finance to local government if local government expresses a wUlingness to enter the housing field for community group purposes. No matter how grandiose the plans of man are in the overall planning area little will be achieved if we have insufficient working personnel to do the actual construction work. One cannot but be alarmed at the low level of apprenticeship intake in the building area in recent years in some States. Wastage of apprentices, the general lack of output through go slow tactics and guerrilla methods by industrial agitation have all Year 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76",54
97,Mr MCVEIGH,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS,I thank the House. Obviously there will be a slack period during which tradesbefore men graduate from apprenticeships. We cannot do anything about past results at present. ever we must ensure that there are adequate prentices each year to meet the demands placed on them through the requirements of housing and building generally. We need a steady stream of apprentices rather than the peaks and of apprenticeship intake depending on the activity in any one given period. Additional means of achieving these objectives must be established in conjunction with the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme. The new proposals have obviously emanated from desire to allow people options in housing. Affordable House' is one which we must housing. measure not only in thefinancialsense but also the sense of being personal and deinstitufare tionalised. We must maintain and ensure a freeit dom of choice in the community at large for housing which adequately reflects the 20th cenus tury Uving conditions.,56
98,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS," Mr total Deputy Speaker, I do not think that there could have been a dry eye in the House by the time theprovided. honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh)finishedhis speech. I listened intently to his address and I began to be a bit disapreferred pointed. I thought that he was not going to take sideswipe at the trade unions dunng the course of his address, but he did not disappoint me. the dying moments of his speech he did not neglect to make mention of guerrilla tactics he also told us that there has not been any trainthink ing of apprentices. Indeed he had a table incoristics porated in Hansard to show that. If there is to any injury done to the buUding and construction industry in this country the honourable member should be looking not at the trade unions but added to the problem. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table depicting the building industry apprenticeship intake for the period 1971-72 to 1975-76.",56
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROVIDED BY STATE HOUSING COMMISSIONS," Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The table read asfollowsNA NSW Vic. Qld SA WA Tas.

If the honourable member were sincere Howand genuinely concerned about the housing apindustry in the States and about apprenticeship training that goes with it, he ought to be honest enough to admit that this year the Government that he supports has not provided as much troughs money as it should have provided. If he were sincere about this matter he would have told the House and would not have left it to me to tell the House that the Government should have provided another $22.5m this year, which a would have just provided the same amount of 'The money as last year, on correctedfigures,for Therefore the Government that he supin ports has provided less money this year for welhousing that it provided last year. Last year actuaUy spent $375m. Irrespective of what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) cares to tell in his economic jargon, the inflation rate over that year has been more than 10 per cent. So by adding another $37.5m to that figure we get a of $412.5m. That is the amount that should have been provided, not the $390m that is being The honourable member for Darling Downs to Queensland as being a great State in aregard to housing but he should read some of the statistics that are provided by an interested body In in this field, the Housing Industry Association. Certainly this money is being made available to and the States so that they can provide housing. I it will be interesting to go through the statState by State and see what is actually hapbe pening in each State. For example, in New South Wales where there is an Australian Labor Party Government, the number of houses approved for at government ownership for the year ended June 1977 increased by 145 per cent over the previous year. Let us have a look at what happened in the previous year when there was not a Labor government in that State. The number of government owned dwellings completed in the year ended June 1977, which must have been started in the year before, decreased by 56.2 per cent. So one can see what happens when there is a change from a negative Liberal government to a progressive Labor government. One goes from a decrease of 56.2 per cent in completions under a Liberal government to an increase of 145 per cent in approvals under a Labor government. There is a Liberal Government in Victoria, and what do wefindthere? We find a decline in approvals for government ownership by 22.9 per cent over the previous year. In the same year completions of government owned houses declined by 20.7 per cent. In a State such as Victoria with a Liberal Government and with no impediment wefinda decline in completions and approvals of houses for government ownership. Queensland is a very interesting case. The honourable member for Darling Downs should listen carefully to this. Last year completions of government owned houses decreased by 29 per cent, but this year there happens to be an election builders in Queensland and what does that wily Premier of Queensland, the crookedest crook of all the Premiers of Australia, do? He promptly ensured that there would be an increase of 82.6 per cent this year. Mr MCVeigh- I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have no wish to interrupt my good friend but his statement concerning the greatest Premier in Australia is personally offensive to me and I ask that he withdraw his remark.",56
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES, Will the honourable member withdraw?,57
101,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,"No, sir.",57
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,WU1 the honourable member tell me what he said?,57
103,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,I said that the Premier of Queensland was the crookedest crook of all the Premiers of Australia.,57
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,The honourable member will withdraw that remark.,57
105,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,"This is using up my time. I have made my point, and I withdraw. In the Labor controlled State of South Australia there has been an increase in approvals of 16.5 per cent and an increase in completions of 3.9 per cent. The honourable member for Darling Downs vaunts the way in which the Premier of Queensland cares to go about his business but few people in New South Wales would agree with him. Apart from the fact that this Bill does not make sufficient funds avaUable for welfare housing in any of the States, it does not make funds available that are comparable with those of last year. Let me quote some of the comments made by the Housing Industry Association concerning the situation of the buUding industry in New South Wales. It says: Builders are still operating below capacity. If the Government is quite sincere about the unemployment situation m Australia, a matter that does not seem to be giving it great concern, it seems to me that the giving of greater impetus to the housing industry would have such a multiplier effect that a great deal of this problem would be corrected. But again the Government is giving less money this year to the States for housing than it gave in previous years. On the question of labour this august body says: All trades are readily available. We all know that. With the 400,000-odd people out of work, of course all trades are readUy avaUable. It says: The lack of work has caused a decline in apprentice demand and this is likely to continue. 1978 will see very few prepared to train apprentices because of the cost. There are any amount of boys looking for apprenticeship in the industry, but most will not be successful. What an indictment that is of the Government of this country. When the Government has the opportunity to pump money into the housing industry to get the housing industry back on its feet, we find that sort of comment being made-no t by some communist shop stewardMr Newman-Do not shout.",57
106,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,"If the Minister has sensitive hearing that is not my problem. The Government has the opportunity to do that and the Housing Industiy Association has taken the opportunity to tell the Minister-h e has read these comments-ho w he can get apprentices back into the industry and how he can get tradesmen back to work. What does the Minister for Housing do? He recommends to his Prime Minister, the greatest penny pincher of all time, that the actual money to be made avaUable for housing in Australia should be cut this year. The Minister pretends to have some sort of a hearing defect. He has more than a hearing defect. On the question of housing prospects the Housing Industry Association says: The market looks like remaining very much as it is now for the next three months. The inability of many people to afford a housing loan will mean a continued low level of activity. That is axiomatic. The way to overcome this problem is to go into it and look at it, but the Government is playing with it. The Association says: There is a desperate demand from lower income to own a home, as rental prices are increasing sharply. Those are wise words, words that we all know to shonky be true. What does the Minister do again? He reduces by $22.5m this year the amount of money that should be made available for welfare of housing. That is in the State of New South Wales. I have already mentioned that in VicMCMillan. toria, government approvals for welfare housing declined by 22.9 per cent. Does the Minister know- I very much doubt whether he does-that there are 6,000 people on the waiting Housing Commission of Victoria? How much money is the Federal Government to give to Victoria this year? In the first instance it is giving Victoria $101,759,000 and aUocating another $50,000 for the next six months. Mr Newman-No , look at it again.",57
107,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,"It is $101,759,000. Have I got itrightthis time? Mr Newman-No .",58
108,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,"The Minister can smile because half of the money that has been paid to Victoria under this legislation has been misappropriated by the inept, incompeReactions tent Victorian Government and put into the negative-a pockets of shonky real estate in shonky real estate deals in Victoria where Housing Commission of Victoria has bought land and paid outrageous prices for it, all at the expense of houses. I again point out that the show that government approvals up until June 1977 declined by 22.9 per cent. They would not Even have declined if the Government of Victoria had point. built houses on the land instead of lining the pockets of real estate speculators. The comfaced pletion of government owned houses was 20.7 per cent lower and the completion of other dwellings was 59.1 per cent higher ended June 1977 than in the previous year. The Minister does not like to hear these figures. But thefigureof 20.7 per cent in 1977 would not have applied if there had been honest government in Victoria, if there had not been a crooked Liberal government that set one about lining the pockets of real estate developers. The Housing Industry Association stated: Many builders haveretrenchedstaff to reduce overheads. Is that not great? There are 6,000 people wantingchoice. houses. Six thousand people are on the Housing Commission list. But builders have to retrench staff to reduce overheads. Why cannot this Government provide money to Victoria? Why cannot it speak to its Liberal earners counterparts down there to make sure the money is used for housing and not just to prop up also real estate companies? The Association states: The timber industry, in particular, has dismissed numbers employees and some mills are expected to close down. That has happened in the federal division of Mills are closing down all around the timber areas of Victoria. Of course, the people who live in these small towns that rely on timber milling are suffering great hardship. The Associlist of the ation also stated: Brick manufacturers have large stocks. There is no shortage of building materials, no shortage of labour and no shortage of skill. Yet the Government cannot provide the money to make sure that the people who need the houses get them. This is interesting-the Association states: Reactions to therecentFederal Budget have been quite negative . . . They are not my words but the words of the Housing Industry Association. I repeat what the in the past Association said: to the recent Federal Budget have been quite s far as the housing industry is concerned it was a agents. It has gone 'non-event'. the The Minister might like to speak to the lowly positioned Deputy Government Whip who is trying to interject but that is what was said by the Housing Industry Association. The Association figures accurately also said: A reduction in interest rates is a key issue for the future. arelativelysmall decline would at least be a selling These are the sorts of questions that have to be up to by this Government. Even to maintain the relativity of funds available this year compared with last year would require, I repeat, in the year another $22.5m. What is the Government trying to do? Honourable members have spoken against people renting houses. The honourable member an for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh), if I remember correctly, made the point that everyin Australia wanted to live on his own little one-fifth acre and have his own Uttle house. There is no evidence to suggest that is the case. The real position is that people are not given a They either buy a house or they live with relatives. I have already made the point that the cost of rentals is forcing people into buying houses. Accommodation that is built for rental in Victoria takes the form of either 20 storey concrete buildings or houses in some obscure country town where there is no need for housing. But under the arrangement a percentage of housing must be built for rental. But is this housing built in areas in which people live and in which they want to rent houses? The answer to that question quite simply is, no. Is the attitude of the Minister to continue to be that of his supporters and colleagues in this House who beheve that people want to live on one-fifth of an acre of land in their own little house and thereby, of course, make the provision of services that much more expensive, or is his attitude more one towards medium density housing? The Minister is not going to answer that question. In fact he is not going to say a word about it because it is a lot easier to duck responsiam bility. It is a lot easier to be a Minister in this place under the so-called new federalism and to pass money to the States and then to say: 'But the States have the responsibility of doing this'. . I have already drawn the attention of the House to the crooks in Victoria, the crooked Liberal Party in Victoria. This contention can be clearly supported by so much evidence. I mention, for example, the purchase of a briquette depot in Altona. It was intended that houses would be built on this area. But nothing could be done with it. One would have to sink piers 56 feet before one struck bottom. Money has been given to the crooked Liberal Government in Victoria to buy that land. How does the Federal Government know what the Liberal Government of Victoria will do with this money? How does the Federal Government know that the State Government will not go out and buy another quarry on which to build houses? The Minister holds up a piece of paper that mentions something about defence homes at Craigieburn. The Minister has his people mixed up. I was not the Minister for Housmg in the last Labor Government. Craigieburn happens to be in my electorate at the moment.",58
109,Mr BAILLIEU,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,Where did the money go?,59
110,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,I do not know where the money went. But the Minister can raise that question. He can do so easily. I would like,59
111,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,I think it might be a good idea if only one member of the House made a speech. The honourable member for Burke is officially making a speech at the moment and nobody need help him.,59
112,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,"I agree with you 100 per cent, Mr Acting Speaker. I am one of those sensitive people who responds to provocation.

116,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,"Thank you. I am gratified by your confidence in my ability, and I sure that it is reciprocated. The Minister has drawn to my attention a piece of paper that mentions something about Craigieburn. If that is his problem, I guess he will say something about it when he responds to this debate. But rather than side-tracking the whole issue I want him to tell me before he responds how he is going to stop these crooks in Victoria, these Liberal crooks in Victoria, from running away with the money we are pumping into that State for housing? The Minister can shake his head, but as I have already indicated there has been a decline in government approvals up to June 1977 of 22.9 per cent. There has been a decrease in buildings completed of 20.7 per cent, all in the area of government housing. The Minister can also tell us why the Victorian Government bought land in flood prone areas, in old brick dumps and in other places with good hard earned cash? He can tell us how the Victorian Government managed to pay three times as much for the land 20 days after it was first bought. He can also tell us why there has been a real reduction of $22.5m in the amount of money made available to Victoria this year for welfare housing.",59

121,Mr BRYANT,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES," I want to take a few minutes to talk about what is now called the National Aboriginal Conference and to remind the Parliament of the original concept behind the establishment of this body which in the initial stages was called the National Aboriginal Conthe sultative Committee. UntU 1972 when the Ausmunication tralian Labor Party became the Government very little had been done over the years to adrepresentative vance the cause of the Aboriginal people. One two previous Ministers, such as the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), had members made an impact but that was thefirsttime that the Australian Parliament and the Australian because, Government had established a Department of Aboriginal Affairs with a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs responsible for that subject alone. As Minister at that time. I realised that one of greatest difficulties one faced in arriving proper poUcies and appropriate procedures in Aborigmal affairs was the difficulty of consultions tation with and consideration of the views of the Aboriginal people. After some consideration I decided that the best thing to do was to convene a conference of Aboriginal people representative, as far as I could make it so, of all sections of the Aboriginal community-peopl e from the Northern Territory tribal situations, people from the urban situation and prominent Aboriginal people. Honourable members may be interested to learn how one goes about such a task. There are some 400 comSome munities in Australia in which Aboriginal people Third Reading are to be found. Some of them comprise three or four famUies; in others, such as at Maningrida, Papunya and Yuendumu and so on in the Northern Territory, there are upwards of a thousand Aboriginal people or more living in communities of their own. We tookfirstof all the advisory that the previous Minister had established, then prominent Aboriginal people such as the late Harold Blair, Pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls and so on, members of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, and other people who represented their communities. Some 70 people gathered here in Canberra to consider the problems. I want to make it clear that the idea was that this was to be the unit which was to be the direct line of communication between the Minister and the Aboriginal communities. In Committee Over the last three or four years, but particularly since the first election was held for membership of what is now called the National Aboriginal Conference in late 1973,1I have heard it said that the National Aboriginal Conference, or national congress, whatever name it was called for the time being, has been a faUure. If it has been a faUure that faUure should not be visited upon the Aboriginal members themselves. They had extraordinary difficulties to cope with. They were new to this kind of task. It was the duty of responsible Ministers to establish a comsystem- a continual communication system-wit h the Aboriginal people. The principle is difficult to estabUsh in or such a situation. In the end there was simply a division of Australia into 41 electorates and were elected to represent those electorates. This was not a totally satisfactory technique for example, people in central Australia who Uve in communities 500 mUes apart could not possibly adequately represent one another the but it was the best thing to do in the circumthe stances. I do not believe that the amendments at that have been made to the idea are going to work any better. In fact I think there are inhibiin the system. There are impositions, such as the executive group which will be a part of it, which will, I think defeat its purpose. I want to say a word in support of the general principle of direct representation by the Aboriginal people in the consideration of their own policies. I do not believe this idea has been a faUure. I do not believe its members have faUed. They have acted in the same way as we do. Each one of us has different techniques in our approach to the business of being representatives of people. people are more successful than others in pubUc appearances but that is part of the system. I hope that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) will take this concept to himself, that he will make sure that he establishes direct communications with the Aboriginal members who are spokesmen for their communities. I hope he will no longer talk about the National Aboriginal Conference, as it is now called, being a failure. It is our duty at this end to establish an effective communications system. Nothing has been more of a whipping boy than the Aboriginal programs of the last four or five years. It has been so easy to say that money has been wasted, that programs have been at fault, that it has all been a total waste of time. has not. The fact that there are so many Aboriginal people now able to speak in public, to act in the public domain as self-assured citizens, is a measure of the success of the campaigns of the last ten or fifteen years to advance the cause of the Aboriginal people. I come now to the procedures and poUcies adopted by this Government immediately on its return to office. It had attacked very vigorously the programs and the expenditure of the Labor Government. The first approach was to reduce that expenditure. I believe that that was a serious error. It was an abdication of the responsibUity to the people of Australia and to the Aborigmal people in particular. I cannot quite understand why there seems to be so much underexpenditure in the Budget that I see before me as apparent from the figures I see in Appropriation Bill (No. 2). Perhaps even in housing inadequate effort has been made. I put it to the Minister that he should not let himself be deterred in any way by these criticisms. Many of them wUlflowfrom people whose approach, unfortunately, is racist. I am not going to suggest that the people of Australia are racist in the sense that I think that the people in southern Africa are, but I do know that Australians place a heavy premium upon behaviour. People who do not behave according to the norms are Ukely to come under heavy fire. Aboriginal people who for two centuries have been deprived of a proper place on this continent as a result of our arrival here ought to have special consideration showered upon their needs. I must express my bitter disappointment at the coUapse of so many programs around Australia over the past year or so. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs I see so many programs which have been launched come to a relative standstill. One does not havetimehere tonight to discuss them. In so many ways the programs have come to a point of stagnation and have caused disappointment and frustration to the Aboriginal people. Last night an honourable member mentioned the matter of the turtles in the Tones Strait. One has almost continually to get the record straight. Back two or three years before we came into government-abou t 1970-whe n the honourable member for Mackellar was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, a proposal was put to him to develop a turtle growing program in the Torres Strait. A small amount of money- I think $30,000-wa s put aside in the first instance to do that. It was to be an experimental exercise. It Unfortunately, the person who became in charge of the program, operating through the Australian National University, saw an opportunity to expand the enterprise beyond his capacity to control it. By thetimewe came into government $400,000 or more had been committed. I think about $200,000 was allocated in the previous Budget and was transferred about the time we came into Government. I visited the Torres Strait. I could see immediately that the project was not going to work. I do not havetimetonight to expound the arithmetic on it, but honourable members only have to read the records I tabled before the Joint Committee on PubUc Accounts to find out how misled we aU were. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs was misled in its predictions and prophecies. The governments were misled in applying to the task so much funds so generously, one might say. So when I see in the Budget Papers an amount of $ 1.05m allocated for ecology, I wonder whether the Minister has reaUy applied himself to the task of seeing whether we are going to get value for that money. I recognise the difficulties in the Torres Strait of maintaming economy.",60
122,Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,61
123,Mr CALDER,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,"Northern Territory) (9.33)Strangely enough, I agree with what the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) said about the new National Aboriginal Conference. It could well be an even worse representative of Aborigines than was the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. I support the honourable member's request that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) should speak directly to the traditional Aborigines. I add that the Minister should speak to them and not to their advisers. He probably will then find some real home truths coming through. In this Appropriation Bill (No. 1) $90.7m is allocated to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which is a rise of $3.8m on what was actually spent last year. overall allocation for Aboriginal programs 1977-78 represents an increase of 9 per cent, $15m. We have heard much about grants-in-aid and error onBut money for housing, health, education, employadvisers ment, welfare and so on for Aborigines. We seefusing that in 1976-77 grants-in-aid for the Northern Territory totalled $18m and in 1977-78 the being amount allocated is $22.lm. So this Government is taking very seriously indeed the matter of help and assistance in every direction to Aborrighted igines. This reflects the Government's overall pohcy. We hear so much about this from the Opposition. Its members seem to think that theytremendous are the only people who have ever seen an Abor-itical igine. From their past performance I would think that until their three years in government very few of them had seen an Aborigine. The national employment strategy of this Government is to raise effective levels of employnot ment for Aborigines. We see in the Bill that allocation for town management and public utilitheir ties this financial year is $4.3m higher than last financial year and includes the Community Development Employment Projects, which are very very well meaning and well thought out. I shouldthis like to see them proceed. This financial year have an estimated expenditure of $5.6m for those projects. This program is in keeping with the Government's national employment strategy to raise the level of employment among expenses Aborigines. We have heard the Minister say that AborNational igines want to work. I think they fall within same category as anyone else. If one did not to work and could get away with not working, the year. whether one was black or white, it would be questionable, to say the least, whether one really berThe wanted to work. But it is far more soul destroyingwas a worthwhUe to Aborigines to be paid to sit down and not opinion in some areas work than it is to pay social security benefits white people. A white person knows in his heartfew of hearts whether he is bludging or whether he genuinely in need of those benefits. We know that many of them are and I am not knocking them for that. But for most Aborigines the pay-To ment of what is called 'sit-down money' is not their best interests and they know it. In spite of the government programs and the money made available for Aboriginal work programs-the allocation under division 120.4.04 of the Bill for employment and the cation under division 120.4.07 for town manageareas ment and public utilities which have been me increased by $1.2m and $4.3m respectively-w Thehave heard of cuts in town council spending, in with attendant unemployment. What is the or reason? We have already put this question to the Minister and he has provided a very sound answer. I wonder whether this was a genuine behalf of a white Administrator or the and/or the Department. If so, it is conand tragic to have people willing to work told to go on the dole because of government spending cuts in this area. aid, I am not critical of the Minister because he this situation very quickly. But I am try-ing to get to the heart of that story. When it went around the Aboriginal communities it did a amount of harm. If the reason is polthere should be a serious appraisal of the activities of those people responsible. I know that the situation which existed at Bathurst Island, Melville Island and Croker Island has been righted. But many people in those areas, especially at Bathurst Island, previously would apply for the dole. Then, when they were the confronted with the situation they hoped that council would be able to get the money and it wasset them to work to use that money. These are very real people about whom I am speaking. It is gratifying to note that the Minister got on to situation which was occurring at Bathurst we Island. It was very serious but it has been corrected. The National Aboriginal Conference was mentioned earUer. I see from division 120.3.05 that $475,000 has been appropriated for election for this body. That is part of a total of $978,000 which will be provided to run the Aboriginal Conference election later the this year and also to run the new concept-the haveNational Aboriginal Conference-for the rest of previous speaker, the honourable memfor Wills, a former Minister, said that this organisation. That maybe the but I have been from the to Arafura Sea to the Macdonnell Ranges in the last weeks. Many traditional Aboriginals have istold me that they do not want either the National Aboriginal Conference or its predecessor the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. have such a body looking after their affairs incuts directly across the concept of what they understand. They do not want that any more. They previously told both governments, that is the Australian Labor Party Government and our own Government, that they did not want two allo-large land councUs. I have not been in those achtiting these remarks. These people told that straight off the cuff. They hit me with it e right between the eyes. The Tiwis are not alone in their protestations with regard to a single council. Why do we inflict these unwanted organisamount ations and people upon the real Aborigines? They are beginning to come to the people who live in this area and to ask: 'Why are you forcingterms these people on us? We have certain people put onto us but we do not want them.' That is why they have asked the Minister to go and speak them. I am certain he will go because he is a sympathetic and understanding man. The real Aboriginal people do not understand this condown cept. They do not want it. They do not underare stand why they receive the dole instead of being able to work. People who do not truly have Abiginal original interests at heart are not wanted Aboriginals. They do not want not understand their interests. Why, through these advisers, are we doing this? In relation the appropriation, I ask the Minister: Where do we find the appropriation for the Central AusAboriginal tralian Aboriginal Congress and the medical vice which the Congress purports to provide?",61

129,Mr LES JOHNSON,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES,"The Treasurer (Mr will Lynch) in his Budget Speech stated: Overall expenditure on programs of direct assistance Aborigines in 1977-78 is estimated to be about $ pared with $ 161 m in 1976-77. Then, in a Press statement on 17 August, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) stated: Expenditure on Aboriginal programs in 1977-78 rise by $ 15m or nine per cent to $ 176m. The Government has once again broken its about promises to Aboriginals by reducing expenditure on Aboriginal assistance programs in this year's Budget. The Government has allocated only $ 171m for these programs in thisfinancialyear when a total of $178m was allocated last year, land that is $153m in the Budget and $25m subsequently. Thatfigurewas $13m less than the provided in the Hayden Budget in real terms. Expenditure on Aboriginal assistance programs has been slashed by 27 per cent in real over the last two years. Substantial cuts in funding for Aborigmal Affairs include: Housmg, down by 3.81 per cent in real terms; education, to down by 8.9 per cent in real terms; employment, verydown by 0.1 per cent in real terms; enterprises, down by 10.5 per cent in real terms and legal aid by 0.9 per cent in real terms. These areas important in many ways, but perhaps they are most important in providing jobs for Aborpeople in Australia. These cuts will cause by the greater hardships and unemployment among people who do Aboriginal people. Further, the 1977-78figuresin relation to the to adjusted Hayden Budget figures show decreased support for education, health, social security and programs. As a proportion of total serCommonwealth Government outlays, spending on Aboriginals has dropped from 0.89 per cent into 0.66 per cent in 1977-78, that is the proportion since 1972-73. Real per capita expenditure by the Commonwealth on Aborigihas dropped by 31 per cent, from $909 in 1974-7 5 to $625 in 1977-78. The proposed 1977-78 Commonwealth expenditure on Aboris the lowest in real terms since 1973-74, and in real per capita terms it is the lowest since 1972-73. Nominal expenditure by the Departof Aboriginal Affairs in 1977-78 will be the lowest since 1973-74 and in real terms it will be the lowest since 1972-73. Real per capita expenditure by the Department in 1977-78 will be $440, which is a drop of $61 or 12 per cent on the year and a fall of $273 or 38 per cent from the 1974-75 peak of $713. That is the lowest real per capita expenditure since 1972-73. Expenditure by the Department in 1977-78 rise by only 2.4 per cent, from $121m to $ 123.9m, compared with an increase of 10.5 per to cent in total Government outlays. Of the $ 14.5m 176m comoverall increase in direct Commonwealth expenditure on Aboriginals, $ 11.6m is allocated to Commonwealth departments other than the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Nominal grants to the States by the Department in 1977-78 for would Aboriginal assistance programs wiU be almost equal to the amount provided in 1973-74, that is $32m, a drop of 41 per cent in real terms in four years. I mention something about Aboriginal housing because I am anxious to get these figures on the record. Proposed expenditure of $35.3m in 1977-78 by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on Aboriginal housing will be $5.5m less than the amount expended in 1976-77 and 45 per cent less in real terms than the corresponding 1974-75 expenditure, that is a cut of almost one-half in three years. Over the same period grants to the States for Aboriginal housing have been cut by 60 per cent in real terms. I shall now say a word about Aboriginal health. Expenditure by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on Aboriginal health has been cut by 11 per cent in real terms over the past three years and expenditure on education has been cut by 12 per cent. What I have said is in very sharp contrast to the commitments made on 28 November 1975 in the course of the election campaign. The then spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) said, amongst other things: Spread the word that there is absolutely no truth in Labor Party rumours about cuts in Aboriginal affairs Under a Liberal-Country Party be better not worse an. Urge Aborigines to vote Liberal Country Party on December 13. I wanted those figures to go into the record. I wish to add a Uttle more to what I have about Aboriginal health because I believe that is an area to which added emphasis needs be given. Expenditure allocations were cut by $lm in 1976-77, yet the actual expenditure the year was only $ 18.6m'compared with the $20.5m allocated for that year. The allocation 1977-78 is $21.7m, which is almost the same amount that was spent in 1975-76, two years previously. I wish to give some additional figures in tion to Aboriginal housing. Allocations for Aborconsiderable iginal housing have been seriously cut from restored, $40.9m in 1976-77 to $35.3m. Theoretically was because of a desire for greater cost effecment. tiveness. But it represents a decline in cash of 11.6 per cent, being a reduction from the $45m allocated in the 1975-76 Budget. That is a decline of 37 per cent in real terms from the cation in 1975-76.1 understand that those figuresoccurred will take some digesting, but it is important they go on the record. We now see emerging Aboriginal people with discernment. I think there has been a tendency to hoodwink them by means of good pubUc relations activities, whereas in fact Aboriginal living conditions are degenerating many ways. The time made avaUable to honourable memcuts bers in considering the departmental estimates very short. One of the matters that concerns honourable members, 1 suppose, is the level of Aboriginal unemployment throughout Australia. cut I know that it concerns the Minister. There is some argument as to the steps that are being taken, understandably, because some people contend that they are discriminatory. In August 1973, the number of Aborigines registered as unemployed was 3,053; in August 1974, the number was 5,080. Subsequently it has gone up. I will not have time to spell out these figures in detaU. In August 1977-thes e are the latest figures available-the number of Aborigines registered as unemployed was 12,224. We are told that 50 per cent of Aboriginal people throughout Australia are now unemployed. That is a most disastrous situation. I just do not accept the proposition that sufficient is being done about that situation. I do not wish to say anything further about it. I hope that the Minister m his reply will answer those matters I have put to him.",63

131,Mr WALLIS,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES," I wish to make a few comments on the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. First of all, I back up said the statements made by my colleague, the that honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les to Johnson), who referred to the decrease in real terms in the amount of money being allocated to for Aboriginals. Although thefiguresin the Budget Papers indicate that the allocation is being for increased, it is certainly an increase of a small amount. If we go back to the amounts allocated two years ago during the term of office of the Labor Government we find that in comparison relathe allocation for last year represented a very cut. Of the amount cut, $2 5 m was but it still left us $8m short of the allothat cation made under the previous Labor GovernOf course, by the time inflation is taken terms into account, that decrease in the amount of money avaUable for Aboriginal affairs drops considerably. In fact, if we take into account the alloinflation rate of approximately 24 per cent that over the last two years we find that the that decrease is quite considerable. What can we see as a result of these cuts in the allocation of money to Aboriginal affairs? My colleague has already mentioned a matter that concerns me greatly and that is the large increase in in the number of Aborigines who are unemployed. That situation is the direct result of these in government expenditure. The amount of is money allocated to the number of special works all projects which provide employment for Aborigines in various country areas, of course, has been drastically with the result that town councils, district councUs and so on that were able to make use of these special works projects now find these doors closed to them and the direct result is that large increase in Aboriginal unemployment that which my colleague mentioned. I refer to the matter of Aboriginal housing. Some months ago I put a question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) about the reply number of Aboriginal houses which will be available in my own electorate of Grey. Accordmedical ing to the figures which were given, the number is to be cut in half. That is a big blow to those people who are trying to overcome one of the serious problems facing the Aboriginal peopleasking that is, the adequate housing of them. When we realise the work that has been done by the many building societies that have been estabUshed the consequent avaUability of money for the purwhich chase and the erection of homes, we can underfinancial stand the way they feel about the cuts that have taken place. I have received telegrams from a number of people in my electorate in which I ary have been asked to protest to the Government about these cuts, because it is quite obvious that the work that they have been trying to do will be nullified by the action of the Government in cutof ting back the amount of finance avaUable. I wish to raise a few matters connected with ensure that Aboriginal affairs in my electorate during conallowing that sideration of the estimates for this Department. tion of what itservice Quite some time ago a pre-apprenticeship trainthat in the last has ing scheme was established in Port Augusta, in than 2,500 patients conjunction with the Port Augusta College of suggests that the work Further Education. The aim of the scheme was to vice is engaged is important. teach young people the basics that would be Minister to give it his consideration required if they were to go on to take up prenticeship. I have a copy of the syllabus and create a large gap as far as the provision that the type of preparation that these young people are given, and it is quite good. I can assure the Minister that these lads are being advantaged, untary and it certainly gives them a good grounding in who does the taking up of an apprenticeship at a later trust that itawUl stage. In the statement which he issued some months ago on the employment of Aborigines, the Minister said: The Commonwealth Government will take measures itself to increase employment for Aboriginals Commonwealth departments and authoriues. In the Port Augusta area a major Commonfication wealth instrumentality- I refer to Australian National RaUways-train s apprentices. I know that the Minister has given me a reply to a tion on this subject, but I certainly hope that, with the co-operation ofhis colleagues, some rangement can be made whereby apprenticeto ships are made avaUable to some of those lads who take part in the pre-apprenticeship training scheme so that they can have the opportunity taking on these apprenticeships and taking their proper place in society. I ask the Minister to give matter his closest attention because it is a proposition which is worthy of support. There is another matter which I have taken up with the Minister. Up to date I have received no in relation to it. A medical service has been made established at the Davenport Reserve. That service has been financed mainly, I understand, from money provided by the Redfern medical service. Indeed, hi order to keep the project going they wrote to me some time ago for my support in their approach to the Minister for funding for thenactivities. I have been absent from the Parliament for quite some and weeks, but up to date I have received no reply indicates whether they are to receive that support. I urge the Minister to give serious and sympathetic consideration to providing this medical service with the finance necessto allow it to keep going, because it is providing a very necessary medical service in that area. It would certainly be missed if it were to go out operation. It is felt that that may happen if it does not receive that financial support from the Federal Government. Again I ask the Minister to sympathetic consideration is given to to continue. As an indicabeen able to do, I point out 12 months it has treated more in that area. I think that that in which that medical serAgain I urge the because, if he an apdoes not and it goes out of operation, of will medical services for these people is concerned. Incidentally, I can add that the service is mainly volat this stage. Apparently there is a doctor fair amount of work for it. Again I receive the necessary support. One other matter concerns me. I refer to the statement by the Minister last May regarding the specific Commonwealth Development Employment in Projects scheme. There are a few points about this scheme on which I would like some clarifrom the Minister. One is that in the statement mention is made of the basis upon which the money would be made avaUable. The quesbasis is the amount of unemployment benefit that would be paid in a particular area. This armight mean that the amount would be allocated the particular administrative body in that area or to the councU. It would aUocate the work. That would certainly mean that a number of people of would be employed fuU time. I assume that they would receive award wages. The amount available would certainly mean that it would not be possible to employ all the people. If we use the amount of unemployment benefit as the criteria for the amount of money available, one thing that comes to my mind is the question of the legality of this action. If the scheme operated in such a way that a person who would normally be eligible for unemployment benefit finds himself without employment after the allothe cation of jobs at these settlements, are such people still entitled to unemployment benefit? would like the Minister to clarify this point. they are not, it appears to me to be a denial rights to Aboriginals. I think it would be step backwards as it would mean that we would be creating discrimination, et cetera, amongst those people. Although the scheme has been highlighted by quite a number of people, I would hate to see in the operation of this scheme some steps which were backward steps. Whilst I agree that it is a lot better to providefinancewhich would provide work for these people than everyfair body to receive unemployment benefits, these convinced people operate on a cash economy now. I think would be tragic if we had half of them working and receiving money and the other half receiving Day: nothing at all. I trust that the Minister will clear up that point when he replies. If that is the way in which the scheme is to it spends. apply, I again question the legality of this type of operation. If a person in our community satisfies the criteria for eUgibUity for unemployment benefit he gets paid that benefit. If the system to operate any differently in the areas where CDEP system is operating, that could be either described only as discriminatory and something that I think should be rectified. I appreciate the Minister has gone to some trouble in trying work out a scheme to overcome the unemploydation ment problem amongst Aboriginals. I feel that has grown during the last 18 months or so. I trust that if we use this scheme it will be augmented with grants which will ensure that all those people who are eUgible to work on the reserves and settlements can find employment. I trust will not have a situation in which half will working and receiving money and the other will not be receiving unemployment benefit. think that is about all I have to say on this matter other than to express my concern about the opertered ation of the scheme.",64
132,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES, set Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,66
133,Mr VINER,BUILDING INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP INDENTURES," I have listened with interest to the comments made by honourable members in this debate on the estimates of my Department. Whilst I welcome many of the comments made by honourable gentlemen and their mquiries, such as those of the honourable member for is Grey (Mr Wallis), there are a number of points that I should not only clarify but rectify. I refer particularly to comments made by members of Opposition. So I would like to take a Uttle time of the Committee to deal with some of I them. Some mention has been made of the matIf ter of funding for the Department this year and of of the funding of programs administered by my a big Department and other Commonwealth departments. I think a comment made yesterday by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer)one which I have made on a number of occasions - ough t to be drawn to the attention of the Committee, and that is that the value, the worth, of programs funded by my Department is not to be measured in terms of money alone. I think it is to repeat that statement because I am firmly that it is correct. I said in an address to it the National Press Club on 7 July of this year, which was very close to National Aborigines The status and role of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs should not be measured simply in terms of the money Many members of the Opposition delude themselves into thinking that they can measure what a is government is doing in the field of Aboriginal the affairs by looking at the total amount of money appropriated or expended. Of course that was the great fallacy of the former Administrathat tion. It pumped so much money into Aboriginal to affairs so quickly, without having laid the founof properly planned and administered it programs, that it did far more damage than the value of the money itself. So, when this Government came to office and was given the responsibUity of funding special assistance for Aborigines, one of the first things that we were we concerned to do was to get control of the be administrative base upon which programs were half implemented because we were convinced that I we would get real value only if we had well planned, well thought-out and soundly adminisprograms. I feel quite sure that during the last 20-odd months we have put the house in order; we have achieved the objectives that we out to achieve by way of sound administration, well thought-out and well planned programs. So we have that foundation upon which we can expect that the appropriations will grow conordering sistently and will fulfil those objectives that all want to achieve. I indicate the way in which the Government approaches the matter of growth in expenditure by comparing the actual expenditure last year with the estimated expennal diture for this year by way of the appropriations that the Government has made. I run down those figures very quickly within the totals ture in 1976-77 of $161.5m and the approprispeakers ation for estimated expenditure for this financial year of $ 176m. That is an estimated increase $15m. For health, expenditure lastfinancialyear was $ 18.3m. The appropriation for this financialIt year is $23.3m. For education, expenditure last financial year was $36.4m. The appropriation thisfinancialyear is $43.3m. For employment, expenditure lastfinancialyear was $5.5m. appropriation for thisfinancialyear is $7.3m. For housing, expenditure lastfinancialyear was $40m. The appropriation for thisfinancialyear $35m. For town management and public utiliwhere ties, which provide a very significant source funds for employment, the expenditure financial year was $31.3m. The appropriation thisfinancialyear is $34.7m. For legal aid, expenditure last financial year was $3.7m. appropriation for thisfinancialyear is $3.8m. For cultural, recreational and sporting activities the expenditure lastfinancialyear was $639,000. its The appropriation for thisfinancialyear is $775,000. For enterprises, the expenditure last financial year was $4.2m. The appropriation for thisfinancialyear is $5.9m. For welfare, the expenditure lastfinancialyear was $2.6m. The appropriation for this financial year is $3m. General expenditure last financial year was $ 17.7m. The appropriation for thisfinancialyear is $ 18m. So there has been a steady increase in areas. There has been a downturn in the approscheme priation for housing. I remind the House that funding for the Aboriginal Loans Commission for housing started off at $5m. An additional $2m was provided in thatfinancialyear. We increased the amount last year to SlOm. That was a quick and substantial injection of funds into an area providing the basis for loans for home ownership in order to provide the Loans Commission with a substantial pool of money which will become a revolving fund. There been a re-ordering of priorities in respect of figures. That seems to be forgotten by Oppositionsociety members. Part of the on-going administration to evaluate programs and re-order priorities. of the significant things we have done in the reof priorities is to ensure that Aboriginal we organisations receive proportionately a bigger part of the Budget. In terms of our policy of selfmanagement and self-efficiency we believe that more funds should be directed through Aborigiorganisations. This is a consistent pattern of the handling offinancesby this Government. of expendiComments were made by a number of about the unemployment situation amongst Aboriginals. This is a real and disturbof ing problem. As a Government we do not resile from that, nor from the problems which it brings. was for that reason that I put down in this House on 26 May a statement on a national emforployment strategy covering the whole field of private employment, government employment, The urban employment, rural employment and employment m the remote communities. It was out of our consideration of the problems facing Abis originals in remote communities, in particular, the ordinary labour market is not readily of available to them that we devised the Comlast munity Development Employment Project forscheme. Regrettably, as I have previously the pointed out to this House, there has been a The suggestion from the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs casting doubts upon the legal validity of that scheme. There is no question about validity. It is designed to cater for a particular problem in the remoter communities. It has been enthusiastically welcomed by all the communities which have been approached to take part in the scheme. Nor can there be any suggestion that in its operation the scheme will amount to a denial of anyrightswhich Aboriginals have as citizens. There can be no suggestion that there is an intention to disentitle them to unemployment benefits. The essence of the scheme is that Aboriginals do not want to have sit down money. They have seen within their own communities the social destruction that that kind of money can key bring. They wish to work for an income. This has been designed to provide work for those who wish to work. In those places where the scheme is in operation the ordinary work test on unemployment benefits.will apply. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) decried this Government's efforts in the land rights field. The full justification for what we have done in this area comes from the second report of the Ranger Uranium Environhas mental Inquiry. In considering how it would these ameliorate the impact of mining on Aboriginal the inquiry pointed out that through the is Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) One Act introduced by this Government, Aboriginals were provided with a uniquely favourable factor which could be used to ameliorate and modify the impact of mining on Aboriginal society, viding Aboriginals not only with a land base also a social base through which they could work for themselves and the Government could also work for them in co-operation with them. Regrettably, both the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) show no understanding of the significance of the establishment of land councils and the of the Northern Land Council in respect of the mining of uranium and the working out of the Government's commitment to implement the Ranger Inquiry recommendations in respect of Aboriginals. Whilst they speak in terms of the Government ought to be doing, they speak terms of the old days when governments were nificance looked upon as the protectors of Aboriginals. What we have done through the land councils to provide Aboriginals with a body work in their interests. The land councils will negotiate with the Government or the mining which companies as the case may be. In private conversation with officers of the land councils, particularly the Northern Land Council, and in addressing their executives and full meetings I have assured them that the be Government will work in consultation and coditional operation with them. When a question arose other day about the Government's intention with regard to consultation over the mining of uranium I sent a telegram to James Golaroi the Yunupingu, the Chairman of the Northern Land Council. It said: I tried to telephone you this cause I wanted to reassure you on the Government's intentions to consult with traditional owners through the NLC on matters involving Aboriginal interests following mining decision. I confirm that the situation remains have previously discussed it with you. That reassurance and that commitment stand. National There will be a full measure of consultation with regarded the old the Northern Land Council. The Leader of the Opposition also spoke in regard to the Borcome roloola land claim now before His Honour Mr what Justice Toohey, thefirstAboriginal Land Comament missioner. That claim, incidentally, is the first body, has traditional land claim in the history of Australia. which It is a hallmark in social advancement benefit of Aboriginals. I inform the Leader of the those elections wUlexcept Opposition that there was no Cabinet decision such as he suggested. The Government will be appearing before the Commissioner along with host of other parties. We will be providing inforwill mation to the Commissioner which will be secretariat relevant to his considerations. I thank the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) for drawing to the attenprotion of the Committee the importance of the but Government's national employment strategy, and, in particular, the CDEP scheme. I particularly wish to mention my colleague the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron). He has shown how Aboriginals can be involved in schemes not specifically designed for them but for the benefit of all Australians. The honourable role gentleman has brought an Aboriginal on to his committee looking at youth unemployment in his electorate. He is thefirstmember of this Parliament to do that for Aboriginals, taking advantage of the initiative by the Government in the what area of youth unemployment. The honourable in member for Casey properly pointed out the sigof Aboriginal health. I was interested to hear him speak from his own studies and experiis ence of the need to have health programs geared which can to the community level. In the speech to the Nauonal Press Club from I have already quoted I referred to the initiative which is being taken by my Department in this area-somethin g that we have called the community based health program. In that speech also I pointed out that part of that program will to utilise the traditional healers within traAboriginal society. I said also in that the speech that I believe that what must be done, and done urgently, is to enlist and train more Aboriginals as field health workers- I emphasise word 'field'-that is, health workers working out in the field amongst the communities and not necessarily in the cUnical sophistication of morning without success behospitals. The honourable member for Wills (Mr uranium Bryant) mentioned the National Aboriginal as I Conference. This Government appointed a committee of inquiry, three out of four members of Regards, Viner which were Aboriginals, to look at the old They Aboriginal Consultative Committee. found, for themselves, that Aboriginals NACC as a faUure. It had not up to expectations and it was not doing Aboriginals themselves wanted it to do. As result of that committee report the Governcommitted itself to a new national the National Aboriginal Conference, for elections will be held throughout Australia for the on 12 November, be for Queensland where held on 19 November. As I have told Aboriginals everywhere, the a Government takes this new body seriously and provide it with the means, through its own and its own staff, to conduct its own affairs. In addition we will be estabUshing a Council for Aboriginal Development which will be the formal advisory body to the Government. I might say that with the land rights legislation, with the national employment strategy and with the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development, we have made three major steps in advance of our programs for Aboriginal self-management and self-sufficiency. With the firm foundation of administration and forward planning and with the foundation of funding which we have now established, I am quite sure that Aboriginals will be able to look forward with confidence to the success of the programs that we have already started.",66

He is a pleasant young man. I heard on a news no broadcast yesterday morning a suggestion by the a comhonourable member that that the CommonPress wealth Brickworks in Canberra should be disposed of to private enterprise. Do honourable members know why he wanted it disposed of to private enterprise? Because the brickworks in Queanbeyan had ceased production and had of gone out of business. I suppose it had gone broke. So because it had gone broke the honourable member wants simUar people to take over the Commonwealth Brickworks and close it down too. The Commonwealth Brickworks is a public utility owned by the Government, conto trolled by a board of directors berra community should be deeply grateful for the dedication it shows. I know that some of the directors are not of the poltiical persuasion of the party to which I belong but I want to say, as an exercise of pubUc acknowledgement of their work, that they apply themselves to it in dedicated a way as could be expected from anyrevenue one. They have created a brickworks here in Canberra which is one of the most modern in the world, which can produce bricks as cheaply and as efficiently as anywhere, and the service vided to its customers is as good as or better can be obtained from anybody else in this town. I hope that nobody in this Parliament will port any suggestion other than that the Comwould, monwealth Brickworks should be conducted in the way in which it is being conducted. It pubUcly owned enterprise belonging to and servespecially ing the community. I hope that those honourable members here who have some sense of profamUy prietary and perspective in these matters remember that a very large proportion of Ausmany traUan industry is publicly owned.

This is part of the way in which we do things. Often it is essential that we this pubUc enterprise, even from the point of view of those people who are so dedicated to priments vate enterprise, as it is a window into the system. Therefore I hope the Government will take which whatever steps it can to advise the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that he ought to leave good things alone and concentrate on trying straighten out his own Party which is in such contoria, tinual disarray.",69
144,Mr JARMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"In the Government period since this Government came to office it property has introduced many reforms, especially in the the field of taxation. There is, however, one aspect ofwould taxation which I wish to raise tonight in which chUdrenbeofabolished the Australian government has not taken believe would be a just initiative. I refer abolishes succession duty as from 1Act specificaUy to the area of estate duties. The first 1977. Act introduced in Australia to collect death duties was the Victorian Probate Act of 1870. This Act and the Acts which followed were designed to ensure that a privileged few could not accumulate wealth. The death duty Acts were attempts to redistribute unearned wealth. Today, over a century later, I would submit they have not achieved the intended result. They have led instead to some members of society gaging professional estate planners in an attempt ensure that estate duty is kept to a minimum or to whom the Cancompletely avoided. Estate duty, rather than achieve a positive result, affects most those who can least afford to pay a lump sum payment. In many cases it comes at a time of emotional crisis and adds further to the burden of those who have lost a loved one. as We all know that governments must obtain from some source, and it is true that Federal estate duty contributes to this revenue. In the year 1976-77, Federal estate duty receipts were $76m. The total receipts from all sources of protaxation, however were $ 19,497m. As a percenthan tage of overall income, estate duty is comparatively small, and the hardship imposed is in supmany cases great. Abolition of estate duties I submit, be a further step by the Government in bringing equity into the taxation system. is a Estate duty can mean hardship for widows, those who have stayed at home to care for their famUies. It can mean they have to sell a home or live at a reduced standard of UvwUl ing. Husband and wife can work together for years to buy a home to raise a famUy, and thenfindtheir thrift and hard work penalises the remaining one. Estate duty can also have a very severe effect on those who run small businesses, and those on the land. The effect on those on the land especially is made far worse by inflation keep some of and increased property values. UntU recently both State and Federal governhave levied death duties. The States, however, are generally realising that these duties, are expensive to collect, create delays in administering estates, are unequal in their operation, and impose hardship on those least able to to cope with estate duty. In my own State of Victhe State government has as its policy abolition of probate duty as soon as possible. The has abolished probate duty on all passing to one spouse on the death of other. In this year's Victorian Budget, it was announced that as from 1 January 1978, duty on property passing to the what I cession and Gift Duties InAbolition the deceased. Queensland the Suc1976 January In Western Australia the Government is committed to ending death duties on estates of people who die after July 1, 1980. In that State legislation has already been passed to abolish death duty on all property passing to a surviving that spouse. The South Australian Government has abolished duty on any property derived from a endeceased person by his spouse. There have also been concessions made to unmarried brothers and sisters who share a home. In New South fairly Wales no duty is payable by a surviving spouse where the deceased died domiciled in New South Wales on or after 1 December 1976. Tasmania estates passing from husband to wife which are valued at below $113,000 are exempt from duty and real estate bought in Tasmania is regret. free of death duties. The State governments are gradually toward abohtion of estate duties, and it will be unfair if the Federal government benefits from these moves which are designed to assist taxpayers. Estate duty will no longer be a debt in estate for the purpose of assessment of Federal duty, which could increase in a number of States. Federal estate duty does not achieve a levelling effect. It affects many who can ill afford this added hardship and this Government would have taken a further important step in establishone ing an equitable taxation system if it abolished Federal estate duty.",70
145,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT, I in have been a member of this place since 1951 and I hope that I have served with some distinction. In fact I think in the whole history of the seat Melbourne Ports there have been only three members and I have served longer than any of them. I have decided not to nominate in the to series of ballots that are being conducted by Party. I would like to say that here in the full face of this Parliament but I must say I do so with some regret. I am now 61 years of age and I culated not so very long ago when I reached the age of 60 that I had actually had in total more than 30 years in parliament.,71

If I might say so, a pretty difficult decision to make. But to the people on the other side of the House, some of whom may not be here if an election is held very shortly, I say that it is nice to have had years in this place and there is something to said for choosing a good safe seat. It is not easy to do this. And once one has done it, always easy to stay in it. I must say with some regret that I think things are changing somewhat. At least my Party has had a pretty good record when one looks at it. has been pretty rare that a sitting member who has done his job has been ejected. I think that is good rule to follow. I must say with all humility that if I had decided to stand again, I might have had the privilege of another few In years here. But contemplating the matter one way and another I just felt I should not contest the seat again. I made this decision with some At the moment I happen to be a member of moving three committees of this Parliament.",71
148,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,You could handle six.,71
149,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I could not handle six-on e of the the difficulties is being able to handle three. Sometimes I find that I have to make up a quorum for two committees at the same time. It is about time this Parliament decided what course it will follow. Even tonight at this interesting stage I doubt whether a quorum is present. When considers what happens after Question Time when everyone disappears I think it is about time we began to reconsider our function. If we are to have committees-and I think they are significant the system-w e ought to change the rules a bit. This is not my resignation speech; it is simply my assignation tonight to say that I am not going to of be the member for Melbourne Ports after the next election. I appreciate the opportunities I have had while I have been here and I am going be just as useful, I hope, in the last year or so my as I have been in my 20-odd years as a member. I still think that parUamentary government is calthe best kind of government that has yet been devised. However I do believe, and I said this the other evening, that we have to make certain institutional rearrangements, not constitutional changes, so that the system will work better than it is working.

At least there will be concord on this point. In my view the parliamentary system It is the best system yet devised. There is some responsibUity on us, the people who are members a of this place from time to time. I have had a fairly long life, circumstantially, and some of the honourable members here may not be as fortustances nate. I think there is more agreement or about most of the issues that come before there is disagreement. I find that we do better committees than we do in the totality of the system. Over the years I have been a pretty good parts attender in the House when the House is being dealt with but once that curious Settlement and the of circumstance called Question Time honourable members vanish for the rest of the ton, Mildura South andand day.

151,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I think it is masochism in some respects but it is a masochism that honourable members can avoid by leaving the chamber. However it is something that continues to pen. Somebody has to stay in the chamber and sometimes somebody, oddly enough, wants to call a quorum at odd times-wha t for, I do not know. Friends, I simply say this: Parliament still the best system and we ought to acknowlauthorities edge it. I will not say anything about the events of 11 November 1975 but I will say something about them in the next 12 months if I continue be a member of this place. Nevertheless, are far more things that we agree upon than we differ upon. The other day I was reading a book that impressed me very much in my life. The book is entitled Religion and the Rise of lism and was written by R. H. Tawney who was great socialist. He headed one of the chapters that book with this quotation: The Lord was with Joseph and he was a luckie fellowe. When I looked at the more modern translation of Shire. that verse it was as follows: Yahweh was with Joseph and everything went well him. I think that is a much different interpretation the word 'lucky' than that awful travesty The Lucky Country makes of it. Well, the meaning other words changes according to time and circumand we are here to make this country a concord better place than each of us found it. us than Mr FISHER (Mallee) (10.45)-Eight days in ago the Sunraysia district in my electorate and of New South Wales experienced its worse business of the 1887.

The Council in these disastrous hapcircumstances, has given a lead to the community and our governments and this remission of rates will not only be of considerable assistance to the affected ratepayers but will also enis courage government and semi-government to offer similar assistance. The Council could well face a total remission of some $250,000 for these properties. This decision mirto rors the Shire Council's concern for the welfare there of all families living in its district. Severe storm damage occurred in the Red Cliffs township and many houses and commerCapitacial premises were damaged.

The growers can expect no income in 1978 but they will have to work their properties to ensure a crop in 1979. They will have to meet all normal working costs and all normal household expenses. The dried vine fruits industry merits special consideration. It is far more susceptible to vagaries of weather than any other rural industry and growers are required to meet far more mediate costs in order to bring their properties back into production. Undoubtedly there will a downturn in commercial activity in the Sunraysia district because of the loss. The ployment situation must become worse as a result of this disaster. It is vital for remain on and work their blocks if they are to bring their properties back into production.

It is the unemployment problems that will caused in service industries, commercial houses and for permanent workers on blocks which are of immediate concern. It is hoped that considerwhom ation will be given to making special grants available to local authorities to reduce the impact of this disaster as much as possible. must be stressed that the problem will remain with this community for the whole of 1978.

152,Mr GRAHAM,ADJOURNMENT," because Having regard to the circumstances this evening and as I am the only member in the evening who was privileged and honoured to be a member of this House when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) joined us- I was privileged to be a member of this House when his predecessor, Mr Holloway, a member of the Nineteenth Parliament- I feel should make some comments. I feel that at least some of my colleagues on the back bench-the members of the front bench are singularly absent enon this occasion-woul d like me to make some The comment in reply to the expression by the the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to the House a few moments ago. I say with great conviction that I know of no man who has sat in this Parliament and enjoyed the affection and respect of all members of this House more than has the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. Perhaps there have been many men over the the years who equally have been so favoured but I repeat: I know of no man who has more enjoyed imthe respect and affection of members of this place. He has always conducted himself with the be utmost compassion and tolerance. Even in matters that one may associate with that disemtinguished profession of accountancy, he has found, with people singularly dull like myself, the growers to the ability to be forgiving. I well recall over all these years-sinc e 1952 when he came to this place-hi s recognition of symthe rights of people to express their judgment his hope that their beliefs would see fulfilment and that they would have, as he has in common with us all, the conviction that this country be will maintain its heritage and proceed into the future with a safe and secure standard of living for all of the people whom he represents, and I and all my colleagues on both sides of the House represent. I well recall his distinguished service on the Public Accounts ComIt mittee. I remember from time to time-wit h his old and very charming friend the former Speaker, Mr COPE - the advice which was related to motor car transport. I always remember that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports 800 was one who said with great sagacity that there never a reason for pursuing those things that might be more deep than they should be for the man in this place. I feel that I should say to him on this occasion- I am the only person in from this chamber tonight who was here when he proarrived-that we wish him well in his future retirement and we would be grateful if he would extend our very best wishes to his distinguished and wonderful wife and family. I am honoured indeed to speak on this occasion-by chance only some of my senior colleagues are not here. In making those comments, I know I speak chamber this for all honourable members. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (10.54)- I wholeheartedly endorse the remarks made by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr was Graham) about our wonderful friend the I honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). I rose tonight to ask the Parliament to give some consideration to the morality level of our society. I believe that there is some evidence to suggest that it could be sinking. I refer to articles which I have taken at random from newspapers. An article in the Sunday newspaper states: A police surgeon and police officers urged women victims this week not to repon the attacks to the law. Their call comes in a startling, damaging attack traUan police methods. One senior CIB sergeant said that he would not let daughter tell police if she were raped. Another article in the same newspaper is headed: 'Great Grandad Sam and the Schoolthat girl . . . Illicit love in a garden shed'. further heading states: 'Sexy trio bed down at Forum. It's birds, boys and more birds in triple bill'. That is the type of thing onefindsin papers. Of course, unfortunately we are also confronted with it on television programs when we go home at night and want to sit down to watch an evening's entertainment with our families. I particularly wanted to mention a newspaper called Campaign which has a heading 'Exploring your lifestyle'. I believe this newspaper is put by a society called the Gay Liberation. If honourgovernment able members were to read the newspaper they would find that it was not very offensive, but unfortunately a lot of pictures contained in it revolting. If these newspapers were at the newscouragement, agents one would not have to purchase them one did not want to do so. What I am concerned about is that this issue was given to me Catholic priest. He objected to the fact that was posted to a convent. I ask any Minister Government who has a responsibUity in these bourne matters to examine the circumstances. I am not saying that the society itself posted it to the vent but the convent received it in the post. think it is going a little too far when people's freedoms are abused in this manner. If a person does not want to buy these newspapers he not have to do so, but when such a newspaper posted to a convent I think it is going a little far. I ask those in authority to examine this ter to see whether they can keep up of our society.",73

154,Mr SHORT,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank my honourable friend the but I ask him to give me the opportunity to speak. I have had a rather longer association with Parliament House and with the honourable rape member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). I was in this buUding in the mid-1960s as a private secon Ausretary to a man whom I respected very much indeed-the late Harold Holt. In that capacity, 1 his own had the privUege and the opportunity to see at first hand the work done in this Parliament by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. At time-in the mid-1960s-the honourable A member for Melbourne Ports was held in the the highest regard, I think, by all members of this Parliament, regardless of their political persuasion, for his diligence, his common sense and, ordinary above all, his integrity. As an officer of the Federal Treasury later and during the period when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was the Treasurer of this country, I had the honour- I did regard it as an honour-to serve him in an advisory capacity. Again, his dUigence his common sense and, above all, his integrity were all too apparent and out were a very great benefit, I believe, to the of that day. Since becoming a member of this Parliament, I would like to say without any qualification, all other new members of are this Parliament have received nothing but enhelp and very wise advice from the if honourable member for Melbourne Ports. It is something that I know all of us have appreciated. by a It is something for which we will always this remember him with great kindness and respect. of the In my view the honourable member for MelPorts is an illustration to aU of us on both sides of this House of what parliament and a true conparliamentarian should be about. I know that in I all his work the honourable member has been supported over many years by a very lovely, loyal and patient wife. I should Uke to wish the does honourable member for Melbourne Ports and is his wife a very long and happy retirement. I too know it is a little way off but perhaps we will not mathave another opportunity to wish him well. I say the standards this with all sincerity.",74
155,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 the debate is interrupted. The House stands until 10.30 a.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions Public Service: Maternity and Paternity Leave Mr Hodges asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: (1) How many Commonwealth public servants have been granted paternity leave since its introduction in 1973. (2) What was the cost of the paternity leave scheme in each of the financial years since its introduction. (3) How many persons have (a) applied for and (b) been granted maternity leave since its introduction. (4) What was the cost of this leave in each of the financial years since its introduction. (5) How many persons granted maternity leave have returned to work in the Public Service and for what period of time have they continued in the employment of the Public Service. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The numbers of Commonwealth Public Servants who have taken paternity leave and the approximate cost for each financial year were: in 1973-74, approximately 7,000, estimated cost $900,000; in 1974-75, approximately 7,800, estimated cost $ 1.2m; in 1975-76, approximately 4,000, estimated cost $730,000. (The above figures refer to persons employed under the Public Service Act and for the financial years 1973-74 and 1974-75 include staff employed in the former Australian Post Office. Figures for the 1976-77 financial year are not yet available.) (3) (a) During the period 1 July 1973 to 30 June 1976 approximately 11,000 women employed under the Public Service Act have made use of the provisions of the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act 1973. (b) As maternity leave is an entitlement for eligible officers and employees, the numbers applying for and taking leave may be assumed to be the same. (4) Precise cost figures are not available, but the estimated cost of maternity leave is approximately $4m in 1973-74, $7m in 1974-75 and $5m in 1975-76. (5) Informadon on the number of women returning to duty on completion of maternity leave is not recorded. The Public Service Board estimates that between 40 and 45 per cent of women availing themselves of the maternity leave provisions resume their public service careers at the end of their maternity leave. No informadon for what period they remain in Commonwealth employment following resumption of duty. From what I have said it will be clear that there are deficiencies in the available statistics on the use made of the parental leave provisions and their cost. The PubUc Service Board is proceeding to improve the content and nature of its statistical information in this area. NA upon notice were circulated: Mr W. F. Toomer: Legal Assistance (Question No. 1076) (Question No. 1125) Mr Bungey asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in PubUc Service Matters, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: Will he outling the situation concerning legal aid for Mr W. F. Toomer in preparing his case for presentation to the inquiry established by the PubUc Service Board to look into the grievances of Mr Toomer. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The honourable member willrecallthat, in answer to his question without notice on 1 June 1977,1 indicated that arrangements were being made for Mr Toomer to be given legal assistance in relation to the preparation of submissions he might wish to make to the inquiry mto his case. Immediately after the announcement of the inquiry (the statement tabled by me in Parliament on 1 June 1977 refers), Mr Toomer was asked to contact the PubUc Service Inspector in Perth in order that arrangements for legal assistance might be made. Mr Toomer subsequently did this, and was told by the Public Service Inspector that the arrangements envisaged the provision of assistance by a solicitor, asrequired,in connection with the preparation of submissions Mr Toomer might wish to make to the inquiry. The Public Service Inspector also advised Mr Toomer that the Australian Legal Aid Office in Penh would, if necessary, assist him to obtain the services of a solicitor. Mr Toomer indicated to the Public Service Inspector that the would need to consider the matter, mentioning that he had been dealing with a lawyer in Melbourne. Mr Toomer has not since been contacted by the Public Service Inspector on the quesuon of legal assistance, although he did discuss the matter in a general way with Mr R. Perriman, one of the officers undertaking the inquiry. I understand Mr Toomer has now completed his appearances before the inquiry, and I can only assume that he decided not to pursue the offer of assistance. Speed Limit: Fuel Saving (Question No. 1261) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 23 August 1977: Are there any estimates available for the potential saving in petrol in Australia if a 100 km/hour absolute speed Umit were imposed. is available to indicate Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: So far as I am aware, no. It might be added that the USA legislated for a lower absolute speed Umit in 1973 (55 mph or 88 kph). There is considerable controversy about the resultant fuel savings, but one official repon indicates that the saving was between 1.1 and 1.8 per cent.

(5) Both pastoral leases are area which is seriously affected enced by the beef industry.

Ayers Rock Airstrip Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Transport, closed upon notice, on 7 September 1977: (1) How many air traffic movements have Ayers Rock airstrip during each year from 1970. (2) How many F27 and DC3 aircraft movements have occurred during the same years. (3) On how many days has the airstrip been nonoperational because of flooding during those years. (4) What is the largest fully loaded aircraft capable of landing at the airstrip. (5) What is the nature and cost of maintenance of the airstrip. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable (3) The member's question is as follows: (1) As Ayers Rock is a licensed aerodrome and unmanned by departmental staff, except at special peak traffic periods, (Question No. 1385) details of air traffic movements are not available. (2) OC3 aircraft meet the aerodrome operational requirements although they may be subject to certain restrictions; details of movements are also not available for the reasons above. F27 aircraft require special approval before operating at Ayers Rock. The last F27 aircraft to land there was in 1970. (3) The aerodrome has been non-operational because of flooding since 1970 on 18 separate occasions for less than day and a total of 92 days for one day or more. and in amount, say, per square (4) The largest fully loaded civil aircraft currently operating in Australia which could land at the aerodrome, but only on a dry pavement, is the F27-500. However, its take-off weight would always be restricted due to a combination of length, altitude and climatic conditions. In addition, the frequency of operation by this aircraft would need to be limited to avoid unacceptable erosion of the aerodrome particularly explained in surface.
