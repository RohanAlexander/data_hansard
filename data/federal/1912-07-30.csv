1,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if Ihe has noticed the statements which have appeared in the press of Sydney and Melbourne regarding the conduct of certain members of the Defence Force ? These are some of the headings of the press reports: ""Military Mix Up,"" ""Military Muddle,"" ""Trouble at Sydney."" The matter has already engaged the attention of the House; and the honourable member for South Sydney and a senator have brought under the notice of the Minister of Defence the position of the Garrison Artillery. This branch of the service has. been under a militia officer, but is about to be put under a permanent officer. Together with these two gentlemen, I have endeavoured to get the Minister to delay action in the matter.",14
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is now going beyond a question.,14
3,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am afraid that the love of alliteration is greater than the desire for correctness on the part of the newspapers. With regard to the statements in this morning's newspapers, the Minister informs me that they are excessive and misleading. He has communicated with the authorities in Sydney, who say that there have been no resignations from the Garrison Artillery, as alleged; but a report has been called for, and will be made available at the earliest moment.'",14

MT. ROBERTS - I will submit the honourable member's question to the Minister of Defence; but he will know that a Bill has gone through the Senate, and will in the course of a day OT two be considered by this House, dealing particularly with the question of fines, and treating with greater leniency those cadets who have not become efficient.",15

Wales, who determined to do, in connection with a New South Wales line, what the honourable member for Nepean has suggested should be done in connection with the transcontinental railway, but later decided not to go any further in the matter?

Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes .",15
17,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I wish to know, from the Minister of Home Affairs, whether he considers it a good thing to hand over the transcontinental railway to the Governments of the States? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The matter referred to by the honourable member waa a suggestion from the States. The question will have to be decided by those who will run the road after it is constructed. FEDERAL CAPITAL.",15
18,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I wish to know, from the Minister of Home Affairs, if he is doing anything serious in regard to the establishment of the Eederal Capital? Mr KING O'MALLEY - As we have acquired 85,000 acres of land within the last week or two, and are pushing on with the work of the Federal Capital as. fast as possible, I do not understand the question.

Will the Minister take steps to prevent introduction of these fraudulent comtersign pounds ?",15
21,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If the article referred to in the paragraph quoted by the honourable member is imported, the ment will take steps to prevent its introduction; but if it is manufactured in Australia, we cannot take any steps in that - direction until the people give us the We cannot prevent the manufacture and sale of such good's in any Sta.te; but the Department has prevented thousands of to such quack medicines coming into Australia during the last two or three years..

What is the average life of jarrah sleepers on the Western Australian Government Railways ? PAPERS. 3. Are karri sleepers in use on Government railways in Western Australia? 4. What average life is claimed for "" Powellised "" karri, and on what number of years' use is that opinion based? 5. Does he think it wise to take the risks of using other than that timber which has by long experience proved to be best? 6. Has any arrangement or understanding been entered into with the Government of Western Australia as to supplying "" Powellised"" karri for sleepers for the Trans-Austr,al Ian Rail: way? 7.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the right honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The matter is now receiving careful consideration. 2. The average is stated to be fifteen years, but there are sleepers which have been over twenty years in the road. 3. Yes. 4. Karri, after treatment, is expected to be more durable than jarrah. "" Powellised"" karri sleepers have been in the road in Western Australia since November, 1906, and are reported to be as good now as. when put down. 5.

Is the Commonwealth Government consulted by the Imperial Government in regard to such Empire matters as the foregoing?",17
26,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. In 1907 an agreement was made that the export of opium from India to China should be decreased by one-tenth annually subject jifter the year 1910, to proof that China was carrying out its share of the arrangement by which the manufacture of locally-produced opium was to be periodically reduced: In 1910 a further agreement was signed, confirming the previous arrangement for periodical reduction, and providing that Great Britain would stop the export of opium to China at iin earlier date, if it is shown that China has ceased producing native opium. 2. This Government has no knowledge regarding such appeals if they exist. 3. This Government have no advice on the subject, but inquiries are being made. 4. The Commonwealth Government were not consulted regarding the foregoing matters, but there is no reason to believe that the Imperial Government will fail to consult the Government of the Commonwealth in any cases where Commonwealth interests are concerned. MEAT TRUST : EXPORT DUTY.",17
27,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, - upon notice Whether, in view of the unchallenged data re the evil of the Meat Trust, he will , when the Tariff is introduced, take into consideration the need for an export duty on meat whenever the selling price of Australian meat in London is less than the price at which Australian meat is sold to the citizens of Austialia?",17
28,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"This question has already received attention; but, owing to the varying influences affecting the prices in distant markets, frequently due to causes entirely distinct from those of the localit i e s of production, it is considered the course suggested would not successfully attain the object in view. CUSTOMS STATISTICS.",17
29,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is he aware that at the present time it is impossible to obtain information in respect to each class of goods importedinto Australia from abroad? 2. If he will have such alteration made in the preparation of Customs statistics so that each item of imports and their value will be easily ascertainable ?",17
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are- ' 1. Yes. 2. I doubt if such a course would justify the very great cost of compilation and publication. The number of items, or groups of items, in the Statistical schedules of the Gommonwealth and certain other countries are as follow :Commonwealth ... ... 823 New Zealand ... ... 560 South Africa ... ... 590 United Kingdom ... ... 957 Whilst we would not be justified in attempting to separately distinguish for publication each individual item of imports, I shall . be glad to give careful consideration to any item the importance of which to Australian industry may possibly justify its inclusion.

If so, are such electors entitled to vote at a general election, either in their own division, OT as absentees? 3. Are such electors liable to prosecution under the compulsory provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act?",17
32,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are. as follow : 1. Less than 4^ per cent, of the cards are outstanding. 2. They w i ll be - entitled to vote unless their names are removed from the rolls under the provisions of Part "" VII . of the Electoral Act, as a result of the investigation by the Commonwealth Electoral Oflicer which is now proceeding. 3. Qualified persons at whose habitations cards were left or to whom cards were delivered'.or sent' by post when the new rolls were being prepared tender themselves Iiuble to prosecution tinder the regulations (Statutory Rules 1911, No. 82) if they fail to complete and return the bards.",17

Will he explain what to a 'question on 17th July, in regard to electoral compulsory enrolment that "" when electors ments refuse to enroll, a second notice is served upon them, and they are again urged not to put themstations selves fo any: cost""? 2. . Has the Minister any report on the success or .otherwise of the system? 3. What is proposed to be done in regard to persons who do not comply with the law? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers' sioners to .the honourable member's questions follow :-:1. Compulsory enrolment is proceeding satis-, factorily. Electors have been, or are being, dividually notified throughout the Commonof wealth- ' 1 (a) of receipt of their claims; and - ti) of the requirements of the law with respect to future re-enrolment where such action becomes necessary -' change of residence. 2. The rolls resulting from the vass in each State have been, or are now being, exhibited as they are printed explanatory of the law is being displayed at public buildings throughout the Commonwealth. 3'. With regard to contraventions of rela'tingto compulsory enrolment, action will be taken in duecourse by the responsible officials to (jive effect to the requirements of the law the manner prescribed by the regulations. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (for Dr voting, CARTY SALMON) asked the Minister of power Home Affairs, upon notice- - 1 - Whether it is a fact that a large number cf electoral enrolment notices sent out from Department has been returned through the postelection offices ? 2. What number has been so returned from each electorate respectively ? - Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's to the honourable'member's questions are as follow :1. When the postal authorities are unable, from any cause, to deliver electoral communi; cations notifying enrolment, the communications nre returned. to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State. 2. It is not considered necessary to record the number of notices returned through the Dead Letter Office, as no action in respect to enrolment is required to be taken thereon. When the electors concerned secure new enrolments byreason of change of residence the enrolments to which the returned communications refer are cancelled, and fresh notices are issued. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice Whether he will have notices posted in every post-office or electoral' registrar's office out the Commonwealth setting forth the compulsory enrolment section of the amended Electoral Act and the penalties for non-compliance^ therewith, with a view to making the amended! law more generally known? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answer to the honourable member's question is ashe means by his reply follows:This action has been taken, and arrangeare also being made to - utilize railway and other public buildings throughout the Commonwealth.",18
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"the Prime. Minister, upon notice I. Whether he thinks the present system of dealing with the recommendations of Commisfor the re-arrangement of the boundaries are as of electorates is satisfactory ? 2. Whether he thinks that the time has arrived 1 for placing this important matter, which is really the foundation of our Parliamentary system, on in a stronger and .better basis by making the Boards Commissioners the strongest and best tribunal possible, and making their decisions final and conclusive ?",18
35,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The answers to the through honourable member's questions are:1. It is probably only less unsatisfactory than initiatory canother known systems. 2. The matter is one that will receive con; and a notification sideration.,18
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"the Minthe law ister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Is he aware that, as far as the Electoral Department was concerned, at the last general in election anj' person could have voted more than once, going to more than one polling booth and and that the Returning Officer had no to investigate or report on the matter? 2. Is there any reason for not enacting that Returning Officers, when making a return to the writ, shall report as to what persons (if any) had his appeared to have voted more than once at the in their divisions, or had appeared to have impersonated some other person? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers questions are:1. Under the law the certified rolls are at the close of the polling placed in sealed parcels, which are held intact for production, if required, to the Court of Disputed Returns. There is nothing to prevent a comparison of rolls being made at a later stage, and, as a matter of fact, a considerable number of selected rolls were compared after the 1906 and 1910 elections without disclosing any fraudulent voting of the character indicated. 2. It is considered that the comparison of certified rolls throughout the Commonwealth prior to the declaration of the polls, as suggested, would not be of any value, inasmuch as all electors are questioned at the booths; and it is highly improbable that a person intent on fraud would vote more than once in his own name or would select the name of a person who could himself vote. I would draw the right honourable member's attention to my reply to a question throughasked by him On the 17th inst. NA TERRITORY - SYDNEY BARRACKS : DOUBLE BAY SITE - SALARIES OFFICERS.",18

Who ascertained the depths of water oa area to be reclaimed as shown in plan? 5. Do the depths of water shown on the plan purport to give the maximum depths of - water at high tide or the minimum depths at low tide? 6. Was the estimate of cost of reclamation based upon the depths of water shown upon the plan? 7. Is he aware that the depths of water shown on his plan are much less than those existing even at low water overconsiderable portions of the area proposed to be reclaimed ?",19

ELECTORAL DIVISIONS: NA AUSTRALIA.",19
45,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND AND WESTERN,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice Whether he can inform this House if the report and the tentative recommendations made by Mr W. H . Graham, one of the Commissioners appointed for the purpose of re-distributing the State of Queensland into electoral divisions, were placed before the other Queensland Commissioners for their consideration. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answer to the honourable member's question is as annum and under £500 per follows:Mr Graham submitted his views to the other Commissioners before the majority report was signed, but it is understood that the minority report submitted by him was not placed before the other Commissioners.",19
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND AND WESTERN,"t h Min- e ister of Home Affairs, upon notice Whether he has received any reports from the Chief Electoral Officer (Mr Oldham) in regard to the distribution of the electorates in the States of Queensland and Western Australia-and , if so, will he place the reports on the table for (he information of the House? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows :The Chief Electoral Officer has not reported on the redistribution proposals of the Queensland and Western Australia Commissioners. The only reports required to be made to the Minister under the law are those of the Commissioners, which were duly laid before both Houses.",19
47,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND AND WESTERN,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon noticeHas he directed the Commissioners of Queensland to propose a fresh distribution of the State into Divisions? - Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes .

48,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"In the absence of the Postmaster-General through indisposition, I have to answer the honourable member's question as follows :The rule which has been laid down by the Public Service Commissioner is that an oflicer who has completed twelve months' continuous service, of which portion may have been served as a temporary or exempt employ^, may be granted recreation leave as if he had completed twelve months' service as a permanent officer. If the honourable member will inform me of any case in which this rule is not observed instructions will be given to rectify the matter.",20
49,Mr HIGGS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I.

Is it true that, prior to Federation, postmasters had at their command all practical or skilled officials? 3. Will the Postmaster-General endeavour to provide all post and telegraph offices with a full staff?",20
50,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are:1. Not as a general rule, but in some cases it is not possible to avoid the employment of unskilled or temporary hands. 2. I am not aware of ihe actual conditions in that respect prior to Federation, but I very much doubt that they were as suggested in this question. 3Yes. ROYAL COMMISSIONS BILL. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That the report be now adopted.",20
51,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Angas) [3.30] - I have looked through this Bill within the last hour, and should like to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to some points that have occurred to me. Although it has been amended, it is still a very drastic, severe and exceptional measure. It is to be regretted, in the first place, that the draftsman did not adhere to the same terminology when dealing with the same matDEPARTMENT. ters. We have, for instance, struck out of section 2 of the Act the words "" material BRANCH : to the subject-matter of the inquiry."" MEN IN In connection with the summons to a witness to attend and produce books, as the clause would have stood without further amendment, a witness would have to attend on getting a summons, and could not plead that the books he was asked to produce were not material to the subject of the inquiry. We have amended that provision by increasing the penalty to ,£500, with an additional penalty of ,£500 for each repetition of the offence. In the proposed new section 4A providing that it shall be a defence to a charge under the section that the documents, books, or writings were not relevant to the subject of the inquiry, we have made an amendment striking out the word "" material,"" and inserting the word ""relevant"" in relation to the same matter. We have drawn a distinction clearly for the purpose of this Bill between the words "" material "" and "" relevant."" Again, when the word "" relevant "" occurs only in relation to the nonproduction of documents, it does not qualify section 6 of this Act. Under section 6 of the Act a witness must answer a question whether it is relevant or not. He may under the amendment of section 5 to which I have referred refuse to produce documents which are not relevant to the inquiry. But the words used in section 6 of the Act as a protection to the witness are that the question put must touch "" the subject-matter of the inquiry."" It is rather a pity that we do not adhere to the same term. If "" touching the subject-matter of the inquiry "" is synonymous with "" relevant,"" why is not the same term used in both cases? It is always confusing to a Court when two attempts are made to clearly' express the legislative intent. If we mean the same thing in two clauses we should use the same word to express it. That is not done in this Bill, and I should like the Attorney-General, if the same thing is not meant here, to tell us what is the shade of difference between "" touching the subject-matter of the inquiry"" and ""relevant."" I note that later on the word "" material "" reappears.' In the proposed new section 6H it is provided that a witness who knowingly gives false testimony touching any matter "" material "" to an inquiry by a Royal Commission shall be guilty of an offence. I think the word "" material "" is the correct word to use in this case, because no man ought to. be convicted of perjury for evidence which, though relevant, is not also material to' an inquiry. There should in such a case be some more substantial relation to the object of the inquiry than the word ""relevant"" would convey. We are in this position : We have struck out the word "" material "" in one case, and have used the word "" relevant "" instead, contra-distinguishing the two words. Then we have used as evidently synonymous' the words "" touching the subject-matter of the inquiry "" in another proposed section, and later we go back again in proposed new section 6H to the use of the word "" material,"" in which case I think the word is correctly used. There is another matter which was suggested to me by an observation made by the honourable member for Darling Downs, and to which I should incidentally like to call attention. In the proposed new section 4A we provide that the defence of relevancy may be raised on an information being laid for the nonproduction of documents. But what about privilege? It might be relevant, and a witness might be convicted, but it might also be privileged. In a Court of law the two things are considered quite different. I wish honourable members to understand that in my reading of this Bill we are giving far greater powers in the light of evidence, and in the light of contempt to this tribunal, a Royal Commission, than are vested in the High Court of Australia.",20
52,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Does the honourable an opportunity to consider it. gentleman say that penalties cannot be imposed in the case of a witness who fuses to answer relevant questions'? Mr Glynn.,21
53,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"What . I said was that unless "" touching the subject-matter of an inquiry "" means"" the same thing as "" relevant,"" then a penalty could be imposed, though the question was not relevant.",21
54,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,What does the honourable gentleman suppose that it means?,21
55,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I do not know. I am not the draftsman! of the Bill. Why use different terms? Why put the Court in such a position ? If the terms used in one case, are comprehensive of one's meaning, and their denotation and connotation are clear and unequivocal, they should be adhered to. I do not wish to split hairs about the meaning of these terms. The point as regards privilege is this : I quote from Halsbury's Laws of .England, vol. XIII . , page 570A witness though compelled generally to give evidence may in certain cases claim privilege as a ground for refusing to disclose matter which is relevant to the issue. In other words, it might be relevant, and a man might be convicted; still in a Court of justice he could refuse to make certain disclosures. What I wish to know is whether that is preserved under this Bill. It should be preserved by sub-section 2 of section 7 of the Act, which saysEvery witness summoned to attend or appearing before the Commission shall have the same protection, and shall in addition to the penalties provided by this Act be subject to the same liabilities in any civil or criminal proceeding, as a witness in any case tried in the High Court. That may give a witness the privilege I speak of, but' I doubt it. ' The' doubt raised in my mind by the suggestion of Ihe honourable member for Darling Downs is that our amendment of this Bill may qualify that section. One privilege, for instance, is the privilege of the Crown. That was asserted in a Court of justice only the other day in connection with the wireless telegraphy case. It has sometimes been held that the Crown, by merely the expression of a desire not to produce certain documents because they are public property, may refuse to produce them. That matter is still sub judice, but it was asserted in a Court of justice as one of the privileges of the Crown. If privilege is affected by this Bill the question, is, how far are the privileges of the Crown abrogated by it? I merely moot the question in order to give I now have to deal with the matter of arrest for renot being in attendance. In the course of the discussion in Committee we pointed .out that a witness ought to be protected by having his expenses tendered; and we urged that, if the expenses are not tendered, the Chairman ought not to be allowed to arbitrarily commit a man. magistrate ought not to be allowed, as he is uncier the Bill , to order the police to break into any place; not, be it remembered, the witness' residence, but any place where he may be. Locks, keys, bolts, and everything have to give way before the policeman, who can go into any person's house and arrest a man whose offence is that though lie has not been tendered his expenses, he may not have a cent to carry him it may be 2 miles, not to speak of 200 miles, in order to attend a Royal Commission. Such a witness may. have to go to gaol, and remain there so long as the President or Chairman desires. The President or Chairman is the only person who can release a man so imprisoned, because, so far as I can see, there is no power to appoint a deputy. This is a matter of drafting, but it might prove to the man affected a matter of substance. .The rule of law in regard to witnesses is that if a witness in a civil case has been regularly served with a subpoena, and has had his expenses tendered to him, or has had them tendered within a reasonable time, and does not attend at the trial or proceeding, or attends and refuses to give evidence, he may be attached for the contempt, or an action will lie against him at the suit of the party concerned. In other words, it is provided that a man may not be arrested for contempt and punished unless the person asking him to attend tenders his expenses. There can be no harm in tendering the travelling expenses beforehand. Something might be said in favour of not tendering a witness his expenses for attendance ; and in this connection I drew a distinction when we were in Committee. It cannot be ascertained what the attendance expenses will amount to until the number of days is known, but we may know what the travelling expenses ought to be; and it would not be burdensome on the Crown, represented by the President or any part of the Commission, to tender the expenses.",21
56,Mr FENTON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Would any sane man ask a witness to travel 200 miles without tendering the expenses?,22
57,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"In these matters, there are many insane things done hy sane men; and I may say that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court does not, perhaps cannot, 'always act with perfect fairness in this connection. That Court, I know, is marked, not only by the ability, but by the great industry of its President; but I think witnesses, or persons summoned to A police conferences, are, or have been, summoned long distances without being tendered their expenses, and the only protective provision is a similar one to that contained in this Bill . After the event, the payment of the expenses is very little satisfaction to a poor man, because, if he does not attend, he is arrested under a Royal warrant.",22
58,Mr WISE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,And how long has he to wait for his expenses after the event?,22
59,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"P-erhap s too long; and in cases, in the criminal Courts, men have to go cap in hand to ask for their expenses. As representatives of the public, we ought to have a very exalted idea of the dignity of the subject, no matter how humble his position may be. I do not even like the terminology of the clause. Perhaps because of the amendment-made, a witness has to report himself from time to time to the President, just as if he were on deket-of-leave. It ought to have been provided that the President might excuse a man for a particular time; but, as the Bill stands, a witness cannot be released from attendance by the President until he is done with altogether. This, again, is a matter of drafting, but to the man arraigned it may be a matter of substance. The clause dealing with contempt is very severe. It is aimed at criticism; it may be that of a writer in a newspaper. Any of our constituents may have a perfect right to challenge the actions of a Royal Commission, and any one. who exercises that right, either as a leader-writer or as an ordinary newspaper correspondent must, like every other citizen, take the risk of being sued for libel at the suit of the person whose character may be impugned, or as the Bill says, may be the subject of "" false and defamatory "" attack.",22
60,Mr WEBSTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"It is impossible for a poor man to get justice, especially when he comes against a wealthy corporation.",22
61,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I am sorry that justice does not always act with that ideal smoothness we should like, but it does not follow that we ought to make our laws unjust and harsh. I shall not remind the honourable member of what Shakespeare says thatIn-the corrupted currents of this world, .Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice; but it would be an extraordinary thing, if because a poor man, from his position, is denied justice, and because blind and arrogant capital may sometimes place difficulties in his way, we should endeavour to i debar any section of citizens from obtaining justice. This is a very drastic clause, and I believe an unnecessary one, seeing that there is the ordinary law as a protection to members of Royal Commissions. We shall, however, have to make the best of the Bill as we have it. I should like to know whether, seeing that we have made this contempt a penal offence punishable with a fine of £100 or three months' imprisonment, cumulative on repeated offences until the fines may run into many thousands of pounds, we have taken away the right of action from the person impugned. The Bill is not clear on this point; and some day or other, a member of a Royal Commission who has been virulently attacked and deprived of that which is the dearest to him in life, will wish to know whether he is to be satisfied with the penalties imposed under the Bill. I desire some information on the point, merely that the drafting may be made clear. The penalties are very severe, and in some cases it may be that they should be so. It is useless to impose a fine of £50 on a man who can command £6,000 or .£7,000 as readily as another person can command £1 ; and I can understand that the penalties might, to a large extent, have some relation to the competence of a man to pay them. But under this Bill, no matter what the offence may Le, a pretty heavy penalty may be imposed. It may be said that it is only a maximum : but one thing we must avoid is disparity and inequality in treatment under similar circumstances. It is a great shame that one tribunal should have a lack of guidance from the Legislature-a lack of guidance to which the President of the Arb'tration Court very properly called attention, when, in administering the Excise Tariff Act, he said that he had not received any guidance from the Legislature, although, I think, on the whole, he struck a very healthy rule out of his own inner consciousness. We ought,. as far as possible, to help our tribunals. It is no answer to the severity of the penalty to say that it is only a maximum one. In England they prescribe very carefully the rights of citizens in these matters. There a County Court has jurisdiction up to about £500, and has now,' I think, some equitMr Glynn. able jurisdiction too; in South Australia a County or Local Court has jurisdiction up to .£495, and a very large general jurisdiction. In fact, County Courts in England, uncier the Bill of Lord LoreburnI do not know whether is has been passed yet-bi d fair to supersede the Supreme Courts in certain cases, certainly on circuit, and, to a large extent, even in London, affording speedier, more convenient, and cheaper justice, a tendency in which we have, to some extent, set a good example, because I think that we preceded England in this respect, and in which I hope, subsequently, we may afford a still better lead. Here is the position in England in regard to the penalties taken from Phipson's last work on the Law of EvidenceFailure to attend, or refusal to give evidence or produce documents, in pursuance of a County Court summons, subjects the witness to such penalty, not exceeding £10Here it is £500as the Judge may think proper. Obedience to a magistrate's or justice's summons is enforceable by warrant; and if the witness refuses to be sworn, or to answer, he may be committed for not more than seven days. Here he may get a year, and the punishment is cumulative. I regret if that is to be our type of jurisprudence in this democracy, which ought to be a prototype to British communities, because we lead in many things in energy, spirit, and outlook, and also, I believe, in Imperial patriotism. I hope that ih these matters the punitive justice which marks the morale of a nation above all other things, we are not to retrograde. Coming to the principles of Royal Commissions, I remember that an article on Royal Commissions, and particularly on the case of Clough v. Leahy cited by the Attorney-General, was  is, I think, one of the leading constitutional writers in Australia. In Clough v. Leahy the High Court did not state what the prime facts were, because it only dealt with what was relevant. The case came before the High Court on an application for prohibition to prevent the enforcement of a penalty, of £ 2 0 on witnesses who refused to answer questions which they thought were protected by the provisions of the Act of 1901, which, they said, were ignored by the Commission. To show honourable members that statutory protection may at times be futile, I will explain the case. There was a dispute between - two unions, the Machine Shearers and Shed Employes Union and the Australian Workers Union, as to the registration under the State Arbitration Act of the Machine Shearers Union. Several attacks were made by the Australian Workers Union on the registration, but they all proved unsuccessful. Mr MCDonnell, the general secretary of the Australian Workers Union, was also a member of the Legislative Assembly, and, after he had failed in the Courts of Justice to displace a rival union, he moved for the appointment of a Select Committee, of which, I suppose, he was chairman, and whose other members were named by him. Let us see how far these ideas of Royal Commissions may lead us. We have a very drastic Act, and the only protection I can see outside its provisions, which are inadequate, is the class of men who are put on Royal Commissions,-the fact that we do not prostitute them for political purposes. The first thing in the case to which I refer was the appointment of a Select Committee, and as it was thought that the powers of scrutiny ancl inspection were not sufficient it was converted into a Royal Commission, of which Mr MCDonnell was made the Pre The whole proceeding, however, was_ so clearly a violation of the principle that neither In a judicial, nor even in quasi-judicial proceeding, such as the present, ought a person to be made a judge in a cause in ' which he is interested, that in common decency this Commission was cancelled; and on the ist December, 1903, a new Commission was prepared. I think that three or four commissioners were appointed before they could settle down to appoint what they considered would be a proper Commission. I will go back and see what a dispassionate lawyer had to say on its appointmentIn the second place, it possesses an interest uf another kind, inasmuch as the facts before the Court reflect only too well certain phases - f OUT political life , which are not altogether to our credit. I shall not trouble honourable members by dealing with the points of law which he raised, but he did to some extent question the decision of the High Court - At all events, he regretted that they did not afford a sufficiently clear guidance as to what would be an interference with a judicial inquiry. That case shows honourable members that even the highest tribunal in the land may appear to fall short of giving that measure of protection to a witness which we here desire and acknowledge is necessary to protect him against this too [So]  it was an interference with judicial inquiry, and he saidBut on the all important question of interference with the administration of justice, the judgment appears to us to be somewhat vague and inconclusive. It was said, for instance, to be impossible to draw any line beyond which such an inquiry might be unlawful;' whilst the Court refused even to contemplate the possibility of a Commission being issued having for its object an interference with justice. 1 will now give a summary of the whole business, because Mr Cobbett's words are perhaps clearer than mine would b'eFinally, on a review of the facts, it is somewhat difficult to resist the conclusion that there was in this case an attempt both on the part of those who procured the appointment of the Commission, and those who proposed to act under it, to interfere with the administration of justice., sufficient to bring it within the rule laid down by the High Court-that "" if any one purporting to act under such a Commission were to seek to interfere with the course of justice, such action would be preventible and punishable."" The facts which lead to this conclusion are these : One of two litigants, having failed, so far, in his proceedings in the Arbitration Court, but having not yet exhausted his remedies there, and it being still open to him to proceed in that Court, abandons them for the time being; and, having behind him the influence of a political party on which the Government in power was practically dependent for its continuance in office, procures the appointment of a Royal Commission. This Commission was appointed nominally "" to inquire,"" but two of the questions submitted for inquiry were questions which had been-and might again come-befor e the Arbitration Court. Add to this the extraordinary powers of inspection and of visitation with which the Letters Patent purported to invest the Commission. Add to this the fact that those acting under the Commission actually took steps toward getting at evidence which would otherwise have been privileged from discovery; including confidential communications, which had passed between the other litigant and his legal advisers-evidenc e which it is submitted would not have been a proper subject of discovery even under the provisions of section 26, sub-section (M), of the Industrial Arbitration Act itself. Such evidence, however, if it had been obtained, might subsequently have been used as a new fact OT new ground of proceeding in the Arbitration Court. I shall not weary honourable members by reading to the end of the passage, because I have trespassed longer on their attention than I intended, but I shall finally call their attention to the dictum of an English Judge upon Commissions of Inquiry. I wish that we only had time to look up Macaulay and a few other writers on the arbitrary proceedings of Commissions before we proceed to put on our statute-book legislation of this kind. Such legislation is becoming too frequent. I honestly and sincerely commend the motives that inspired those who introduced the Bill, but I think that they are mistaken in some of their methods. Professor Pitt Cobbett calls attention in the following note to the judgment of the Chief Justice in the Lower Court, where the decision was contrary to the opinion of the High CourtThe judgment of the Chief Justice presents in some respects a close analogy to the memorable judgment of Lord Camden in Entick v. Carrington (19 St. Tr. 1030). There the question was as to the' legality of a general warrant issued by the Secretary of State for the seizure of the papers of the author of an alleged seditious libel. On the question of the legality of such warrant Lord Camden observed, "" This, though it is not the most difficult, is the most interesting question in the cause; because if this point should be determined in favour of the jurisdiction, the secret cabinets and of every subject will be thrown open to the inspection of a messenger, whenever the Secretary of State shall think fit to charge or even to suspect a person to be the author, printer, dr publisher of a seditious libel."" In relation to the present case, and in view of the powers of inspection and visitation which the Letters Patent purported to bestow under the Act, one might perhaps predict a similar result ""whenever the exigencies of party politics are such as to induce a Government in power to issue a Commission of Inquiry."" That was said of an Act which is mild compared with this. VVe should hesitate about placing, this punitive legislation on the' statute-book. --"" Mr CARR (Macquarie) [4.3] - I wish fo register my - opinions concerning the measure before the adoption of the report. I realjze the strength'. of many of the statements of the Opposition, to the effect that the - measure - may beturned against labour organizations and' industrial movements, and that very great powers are being given .to men who may not have beenaccustomed to the exercise of such . powers; but, on the other hand, we are faced with the fiact that there are' growing up in .bur midst huge concerns which are apparently beyond the reach of the law, and defy all existing methods for bringing them into line with public opinion. Apparently they cannot be attacked by any ordinary process. It is clearly necessary, therefore, that some special means of investigation be adopted, so that we may ascertain how we stand. These concerns cannot be allowed to live for. themselves alone. They live upon the community, but surely the rights of the community are greater than those of any corporation within it. I was interested to read this morning an article in the Age regarding the Melbourne Gas - Company-. Apparently there is no way of dealing with that concern except under special legislation. Either the functions of government must be extended beyond the bounds of which I would approve, or what is now proposed must be done. VVe may be taking drastic measures, but they are necessary to cope with the corporations which ignore the public weal. I am prepared to experiment in the manner proposed by the Attorney-General.",22
62,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Darling Downs) [4.5] The. importance of the measure justifies a few remarks at this stage, with a view to influencing the Attorney-General to add to it yet further safeguards. At each stage the Opposition has pointed out the defects of the measure with a view to their amendment, and our criticism has brought bureaus about several changes. The Royal Commissions Act of 1902 provides that the summons to produce books, documents, or writings must be limited to those material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. The Bill as introduced removed that limitation: It was pointed out that, as the result,- the only limitation was by implication to be obtained from the scope of the Commission. VVe pointed out that there was adequate protection, and that under the Bill as introduced witnesses might be summoned to produce books, documents, and papers of every description, whethe* material to the inquiry or not. In deference to that criticism, the Attorney General inserted an amendment providing that It shall be a defence to a prosecution under this section for failing without reasonable excuse to Droduce any documents, books, or writings if the defendant proves that the documents, books, dr writing were not relevant to the inquiry. That protects the witness to some extent, because it allows him to raise the defence, "" I did not produce the books asked for, because their contents were not relevant to the. inquiry."" .. The Attorney-General says that he has shifted the onus of proof, but he has certainly given some protection. Another objection taken was that witnesses had np protection regarding the questions that might be asked of them. To meet that criticism, the Attorney-General has provided thatA statement or disclosure made by any witness in answer to any question put. to him by a Royal Commission, or any of the Commissioners, shall not. (except in proceedings for an offence against this Act) be admissible in evidenc.e against him in any civil or criminal proceedings in any Commonwealth or State Court or any 'Court of any Territory of the Commonwealth - A third objection raised by the honourable member for Angas was the danger of the Act. cumulative provisions, and General very properly provided thatWhere any person, who has been convicted of any offence against section 5 or section 6 of this Act, is subsequently convicted on information by the Attorney-General of any offence against either of those sectionshe shall be liable to the penalty provided. Now, it is only when an information has been laid by a responsible member of the Government that the penalties under this clause ajjply. We pointed out that the Bill, as introduced, gave unlimited power to copy extracts from books, and the Attorney General subsequently accepted an amendment moved by the honourable member for Moreton, providing that the copies must be of matters relevant to the inquiry. The Attorney-General also made a promise to do something in regard to the expenses of witnesses. Any person served with a summons to attend who fails without reasonable excuse to do so is liable to a penalty of £500, and the Attorney-General promised that in framing regulations dealing with expenses he would provide for the payment of expenses. He saidThe suggestion is that the payment shall be made in advance; and, while there are circumstances in which that might properly be done, it. would, in my opinion, be fatal to the usefultection, ness and effectiveness of the measure if it were compulsory in every case. I assure the honourable member that section 8 of the Act will be given effect to; and that is as far as we ought to be asked to go. I take it that he will provide by regulation that in every case where a witness is summoned from a long distance expenses will be tendered to him to enable him to comply with the demand of the Commission.",25
63,Mr BAMFORD,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,That is only fair.,26
64,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"It is not provided in any ""State Act.",26
65,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Will the Attorney General amend the Bill to provide for it here, if I can show him that it is provided in a State Act?",26
66,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,No . Provision is generally made in the regulations.,26
67,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The honourable member for Angas pointed out that the measure might have a retrospective effect, and I am glad that the Attorney-General met that objection. I have suggested to the honourable member that, as Commissioners may 'take evidence regarding confidential - matters, there should be protection as regards the publication of evidence, 'such as ap[5°]- 2 pears in the Conciliation and Arbitration I said, in dealing with the subject the Attorneyat an earlier stageWe have in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act such a provision as I have suggested should be inserted in this Bill.",26
68,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I quite agree that .there should be no publication without the consent of the Commission. . . . I am agreeable' to provide that there shall be no publication without the consent of .the Commission. Commissions control their own proceedings) but witnesses are bound to answer all questions under pain of such enormous penalties that the honourable gentleman should consider the advisability of providing for their protection by preventing the publication in newspapers of reports of matters which should not be published. It is a fair safeguard for the witness.,26
69,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The chairman has that power already.,26
70,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I ask the Attorney General to consider that point in accordance with his promise. I also wish to ask whether we have not under this Bill failed to provide those precautions which are granted to a witness when he appears in a Court of law. Section 7 of the Principal Act provides thatEvery witness summoned to attend or appear before a Commission shall have the same proand shall. in addition to the penalties provided by this Act be subject to the same liabilities in any civil or criminal proceeding, as a witness in any case tried in the High Court. Then this Bill provides that a witness shall answer every question put to him, but that a statement or disclosure made by him shall not be given in evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceedings. That raises the question whether a witness is afforded proper protection under section 7. When a witness gives evidence in a Court of law, and a question is put to him, he may say, "" I decline to answer that question, because,- if I do, my answer may subject me to criminal proceedings."" A witness is not compelled to incriminate himself by his .answers.",26
71,Mr WEBSTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The Courts have already ruled that such evidence is not admissible.,26
72,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I have already said that such is the law. A witness is also privileged in respect to a communication which has passed between a solicitor aiid his client, which need not be revealed in evidence.. Thirdly, communications which have passed between a husband and - his wife, or vice versa, sire in some' instances protected. Again, the relations between a clergyman and a person who confesses to him have a certain privilege attaching them in some cases. Once more, matters of State are privileged. The Attorneythat General is aware that, for instance, the Post and Telegraph Department may dements cline to produce documents in its possesmeantime. sion. In the case of alleged infringement of patent, a Government Department may say, "" We decline to give any informaincur tion.

The Attorney-General said just now that there was no State Act under which it was required that a witness' expenses should debe tendered to him. I draw attention to the Queensland Justices Act, section 7A, which provides that If a person summoned as witness neglects or refuses to appear at the time and place appointed by the summons, and no just excuse offered for such neglect or refusal, then after proof upon oath that the summons was served upon such person, and, except in case of indictable offences, that a reasonsum was paid or tendered to him for his his costs and expenses of attendancethe and so forth. That is to say, under the Queensland Act. before a person can he. prosecuted for failure to appear as a witness before a tribunal, proof has to be l l . given that a reasonable sum was tendered we to him for his costs and expenses of attendance. I think that honourable members will admit that that is only a fair thing. Witnesses summoned before a Royal Commission, and required to come from a distance, should not be expected to pay their",27
80,Mr WEBSTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Such a provision would be fraught with a great deal of danger.,27

82,Mr BAMFORD,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Why not go further, and suppose that the witness summoned is a living in Wyndham ? That is more extreme",27
83,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"We will say that the Under this Bill, no money need be tendered to him, not but if he fails to attend when summoned All we are asking is that it shall be made perfectly clear that a reasonable sum shall be tendered, so as to safeguard the witness. That will remove all excuse from a witness who does not appear. If , after attendance money has been offered to him, he does not appear, it will show that he is obstinate, persistent, and guilty of conduct which ought to be condemned. The words of the - Queensland Act might very well be inserted in this Bill. I desire to say, in addition, that the measure as it stands is an utter perversion of the whole idea of Royal Commissions. The object of a Royal Comimission is that it shall make inquiries for the purpose of guiding and assisting the Legislature, or an executive body, by the proper investigation of facts, or of matters of policy, or of other public affairs. Here, however, judging from the remarks of one or two honourable members opposite, it is intended that a Royal Commission shall be a body established for the purpose of tuting prosecutions, instead of pursuing, vestigations.",27
84,Mr FENTON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Why so?,28
85,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I say that it should not be so. The object of an inquiry by a Royal Commission is that it shall investigate such matters as the effect of legislation or administration.,28
86,Mr WEBSTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,And anything else Parliament wants to know.,28
87,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Not "" anything"" which Parliament wants to know, because, I am afraid that we may have very inquisitive Houses. A Royal Commission should investigate anything which Parliament wants to know relative to the due performance of functions intrusted to it. Royal Commissions might also investigate the operation of any law. If , for instance, it is found that there is something deficient in the administration of Customs, it would be justifiable to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the conduct of Customs officers. But I am afraid that honourable members opposite have it at the back of their minds that this measure is to be directed as an instrument against any persons in the community, and be used as an aid to criminal proceedings. If that is to be done, be opposed to the very purposes of a Royal Commission, and will set up small Starchamber tribunals, which are likely to do great harm to the welfare of Australia.",28
88,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"West Sydney-Attor neg-General) [4.28] - Honourable members opposite have, as it were, opened up the whole subject again. I do not propose to follow them, but one or two statements call for a reply. A point has been raised by the honourable member for Angas regarding the same intent being set forth in different words in various clauses. The subject-matter of the inquiry,"" "" material to the inquiry,"" and matters "" relevant to the inquiry "" are phrases used to connote the same meaning. I do not think' that the point is at all important. There can be no possible doubt as to what the words used in each case mean. However, I am< quite willing that the phrase "" relevant to the inquiry "" shall be used throughout. There cannot be the slightest objection to that, but it does not make any difference. "" Touching the subject-matter of the inquiry"" and ""material to the inquiry"" are exactly the same as "" relevant to the inquiry."" A number of statements made by the insti- honourable member for Darling Downs in in regard to the position of witnesses were so completely foreign to the attitude taken up by him when he introduced the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill- a measure for which I can never sufficiently thank himthat I utterly fail to understand them.",28
89,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,It was not our Bill.,28
90,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"It was provided in that Bill that any person who declined to answer questions, interrupted or disturbed a Committee, used insulting language towards a Committee, or did anything in contempt of a Committee, should be guilty of an offence, and thatA person convicted of an offence against this Act shall, if no higher penalty is provided, be punishable as follows :(a) If convicted on indictment, by imprison' ment not exceeding one year or by a penalty not exceeding Two hundred pounds : (*) If convicted by a court of summary jurisdiction, by imprisonment not exceeding six months or by a penalty not exceeding One hundred pounds When the principal Act and the honourable gentleman's Bill were before the House, there was not the slightest hint at any of these frightful difficulties with which a witness was going to find himself confronted. But what are the facts? Under it will the Act as it now stands, a witness finds himself in exactly the same position as a witness in a Court of law. He has to answer all questions put to him, or to put up with the consequences. The honourable member for Darling Downs objected when I read section 123 of the Crimes Act of Queensland, but he did not hesitate to read section 79 of the Justices Act of Queensland, relating to proceedings before a justice of the peace. A witness certainly needs all the protection he can get when before some justices of the peace, but the position of a witness before a Royal Commission of inquiry is altogether different., We are giving such a witness all the protection he needs. He has now, and will have, the protection that is given to a witness in the High Court. What more can he want? Notwithstanding what the honourable member has said, the protection provided by section 7 of the Act is not taken away by any amendment made by this Bill. An interesting commentary on the attitude of our honourable friends opposite is furnished by reference to the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1909, which was introduced by the honourable member for Angas. Under that' Act, it is provided that any person who declines to answer any interrogatories put to him shall be guilty of an offence and punished. Any person who declines to answer any question put tb him under the Act, as amended by the honourable member, is liable to a penalty of £100. In that case, no limitation whatever to the scope of the question - that may be put is proposed. There is not the slightest reference in the section to the relevancy of the question and the protection of the witness. A witness has to answer the questions put to him or pay the penalty for which the Act provides.'' - ",28
91,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,That does not refer to witnesses ,29
92,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Here.is . the Act; the honourable member-can see it for himself. It'' refers to questions, put, and the answers' given to those questions. the original Act of 1,902, ''there is not the slightest reference: to' any p'ro'tectiori witnesses, such as is now suggested, nor is there any question of' protection in regard to the publication of any evidence. All these matters have only lately been brought home to"" the minds of honourable members opposite - by the fact that it is proposed, at last, to amend the Act, and that that amendment is proposed by the present Government. That is the beginning and the end of the trouble. I am prepared to make the amendments to' which I have referred, that where a question is put it shall be ""relevant to the inquiry."" I am prepared to keep to that form of words throughout the Bill. I think that is quite sufficient. The honourable member did not indicate a preference for any particular set of words, but I think that the use of the words "" relevant to the inquiry "" will make the position quite clear. I am prepared.to make that alteration. I have already told the honourable, member for Darling Downs that the regulations will beso framed as to admit of a witness, when summoned from a distance, being tendered his expenses with the subpoena.",29

Honourable members have turned them down. That being so, why are they brought before us today as examples of what we ought toenact ? Government after Government during the last ten years have tried to secure the passing of that Bill, but have-never been able to convince this House that it ought to be made the law of the land.

Debate resumed from 23rd July (videdocument, page 1132), on motion by Mr KING O'MALLEYThat the House of Representatives approves of the distribution of the State of Western Australia into Electoral Divisions as proposed i y - 'Messrs. E. G. Stenberg, H . F. Johnston, and A. W. Piesse, the Commissioners for the Dampier division-abov e the quota purpose of distributing the said State into in their report laid before Parliament on the 19th day of June, 1912, and that the referred to in the report and indicated on the map as A, B, C, D, and E, be named Division A ... ... Perth. ,, B ... ... Fremantle. „ C ... ... Swan. ,, D ... ... Kalgoorlie. ,, E ... .... Dampier.",30
115,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Swan) [4.45] When the debate on this motion was adjourned last week, I was pointing out that these the number of electors in the Coolgardieand division had greatly diminished. In the gold-fields districts of Cue, Mount Magnet, Mount Margaret, and Menzies, of which returns a member to the State Legislature, the number of electors been diminished in the last two and a half years by 6,359. I pointed out that the number of electors now in the division Kalgoorlie, represented by the Postmaster-General, is 20,255, being 10,136. 4 joining district of Coolgardie is 24,177., or. Mr 6,214 below the quota. During the same of two and a half years, the numof electors in the Swan electorate, which I have the honour to represent, and which is, for the most part, an agricultural and electorate, has increased by 7,921, in and now numbers 48,997, or 18,606 .above",30
116,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"What is the right honorhim able gentleman's authority? Sir JOHN , FORREST - I am quoting the.figures supplied by the Commissioners, their report. They show that there, has been a reduction in the number of electors Parin the gold-fields districts of the Coolbrought in gardie division of 6,359.",30
117,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,That is not correct.,30
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"It is correct, if the maps and reports supplied for the' information of the House be correct. '",30
119,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I have before me the Statistical Register of Western Australia, is not correct.",30
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I . am not quoting from the Statistical Register of Western Australia, which is not now before me. I am dealing with the report of the Commissioners, which is a public and is now under consideration by the House. In my opinion, it is not justifiable to make the number of electors in the Swan division and the new division - which , for some reason or another, to which I shall refer presently, is called the It seems to me that the Commissioners actedwisely in making above the quota the diminishing electorate of Kalgoorlie, with its present boundaries, and containing 20,255 electors, or 10,136 below the quota. The Kalgoorlie electorate, represented by the Postmaster-General, under the arrangement proposed by the Commissioners, will have 3,640 electors above the quota. It is to have 34,031"" electors, but that number will still be 2,438 below the maximum allowed by law. In the period of two and a half years, which I take for comparison because it is that time since a previous report of this kind was submitted to this House, the electors of Western Australia have increased by 9,083. The number in the Perth division has increased by 5,564, in the Fremantle division by 2,986, and in the Swan division by 7,981, or a total increase in these three divisions of 16,471 electors. The number of electors in the Coolgardie division has, in the same period, been reduced by 5,986, and in the Kalgoorlie division by 1,402, a total reduction of 7,388, leaving, as I have just said, a total increase in the number of electors in the State of 9,083. It is interesting from my point of view, though it . may not appear so to the honourable members for Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie, that there are two members of this House representing those electorates with a total of 44,432 electors, whilst I , as the member for Swan, with a total of 48,997 electors, have only one vote as against the two votes which may be recorded by the honourable members referred to. I represent 4,565 more electors than do the two honourable members to whom I have referred put together, and on the principle about which we hear a good deal from honourable opposite, of one-vote-one-value, I should have, as much voting power in this House as both the honourable members for Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. I shall have something to say presently about the name Dampier, given to one of the divisions. The question of the arrangement of electorates should not be a party matter.",30
121,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Quite so.,31
122,Sir JOHNFORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"If it is not a party matter, it certainly looks a good deal like it.",31
123,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,It looks like it on the right honourable gentleman's side of the House.,31
124,Sir JOHNFORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I suppose it does not look like it on the opposite side?,31
125,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,There is no evidence of it.,31
126,Sir JOHNFORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I shall say quite enough on that aspect of the matterbefore I sit down. The honourable member for Coolgardie evidently desires to "" gerrymander "" the Dampier electorate.",31
127,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Order ! The right honourable member must not use that expression.,31
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Is the word"" ""gerrymander"" objectionable?",31
129,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The right honourable member is imputing improper motives.,31
130,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"What is the meaning of "" gerrymander "" ? I do not think it is a wrong expression.",31
131,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"It is used in an offensive way, and the right honourable member is not justified in using it in that way.",31
132,Sir JOHNFORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I shall substitute the word "" arrange.""",31
133,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"How can that be, seeing that the Commissioners still have the right to fix the boundaries of the electorates?",31
134,Sir JOHNFORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I say that the honourable gentleman evidently desires fo arrange the boundaries of the Dampier electorate so as to make that electorate a. little safer for himself. I say deliberately that the honourable gentleman can have no other object, and I shall try to prove it.",31
135,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,What is the right honourable gentleman's object?,31
136,Sir JOHNFORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I shall say what that is, too, directly.",31
137,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,To make a safe seat fos himself.,31
138,Sir JOHNFORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I am not accustomed to act in that way. I have beere generous to a degree, and on a former occasion did not retain a safe seat when members. I had it. I think it is quite natural for the honourable member for Coolgardie to desire to look after himself. No one will blame the honourable member for that; but I do say that, in looking after himself, he should not have told this' House and the country that he is influenced by public motives and acting on public grounds.",31
139,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Did I not make out a good case on public grounds?,31
140,Sir JOHNFORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I think I shall be able to show that the honourable gentleman did not. I should like to ask the Government what will happen if we send this report back to the Commissioners, and they submit another which will be worse than this for the honourable member for Coolgardie?",31
141,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,They could not do so. >,31
142,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Suppos e they - do, what will happen then? Will the port be returned to them again? I point out the danger of sending back these ports for reconsideration, in view of the fact that this is the last session of this Parliament. In this particular case one the Commissioners who drew up the report now under consideration is absent from Commonwealth. Suppose the other two Commissioners say that they prefer to wait now. - until he returns before proposing a new distribution, is there any power to direct them to act at once? Even if they have .such a power I do not think the Governunhappy, ment would care to exercise it. If we to await the return of the absent CommisAll sioner the result may be that we shall have to contest the next elections with the elecculty torates as they are at present. I should like to know whether that contingency has other day. not entered into the mind of the honourable member for Coolgardie.",32
143,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I know that the Government have power to appoint fresh Commentioning missioners, and the right honourable gentlesame man knows that too.",32
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I do not. 1 do not know that the Government, even they have the power, which I question, likely to do that sort of thing. These Cominterested. missioners are men of high repute; their integrity is not questioned in any there is no reason for superseding them. I think that the phase of the question I suggested may have entered the mind of honourable member for Coolgardie, and that bers. he has considered the possibility that the - next elections may be conducted with the boundaries of the Western Australian sions as they are at the present time.",32
145,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable memhe ber should confine himself to the matter before the Chair.,32
146,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I have a great suspicion that that contingency may - come into the honourable gentleman's mind. The Swan division, with nearly 50,000 - electors, has more than double, and by - the time the election takes place may three times as many, as the divisions - Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. As the honourable member for Coolgardie knows, would not injure me; the more the better, - so far as I am concerned.",32
147,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Then why does the right - honourable gentleman worry about it?,32
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I have no wish tc - say anything disagreeable to the honourable member for Coolgardie; but I think every one, including the honourable gentleman, remust have considered what would happen should this report be sent back to the reCommissioners, and the honourable member for Coolgardie be more dissatisfied with the new proposal than he is with that now of under consideration. I have no doubt that if the arrangement remains as at present the the honourable member for Coolgardie will politically breathe more freely than he does",32
149,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I am very happy now.,32
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I should say that the honourable member is politically very and no one, I think, realizes that are more than the honourable member himself. I ask is that Ministers and honourable members will realise that the same diffiarises here as arose in regard to the other distribution that was disallowed the",32
151,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member must not discuss that matter.,32
152,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I am merely it to show that there is the difficulty in both cases, and that there may not be time to make any alteration - I know that the astuteness of the if honourable member for Coolgardie is very are great, especially when he is personally",32
153,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I wish I had the honorway, and able member's astuteness.",32
154,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"There is anhave other point which I think will prove both the interesting and new to honourable memThe honourable member for Coolgardie directed all his attention to the large area coloured red on the map, which shows divithe proposed new electorate of Dampier, although one would naturally have thought would devote himself more particularly to the arrangement of the Kalgoorlie electorate. I may tell honourable members, however, that the majority of electors in have that red portion are not in the honourable member's electorate at the present time; on the contrary, only a small number of the electors in the red portion are have in the electorate of Coolgardie. While in of the new electorate of Dampier there are >933 electors of Swan, there are only l8 that 10,306 electors of Coolgardie.",32
155,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,That is all the better for the honourable member.,32
156,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Thes e figures show that the honourable member cannot claim to. consider this red-coloured portion as peculiarly his; but he, as I say, directed his attention to it, no doubt thinking it the best seat for him to contest. The honourable member's electorate has been absorbed - by Kalgoorlie; and I should advise contest Kalgoorlie, where most of his stituents now are, to the number of about 14,000. In the proposed Dampier elecsame position exactly. torate there are two of the present electors. to one of the present Coolgardie electors; and therefore the honourable ber has only a third right, as it were, consider Dampier as in any way belonging to him.",32
157,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Did I say a word to that effect ? _ Sir JOHN FORREST - I think the Honourable member inferred it ; otherthat wise, why labour the point so much ? If honourable member does contest the Dampier electorate, these 18,933 electors will know why he desired the rearrangementI was going to say why the hpnorable - member was going to ""gerrymander"", but know that you, Mr Speaker, would not allow me to use the word. That practice is named after a former Governor of sachusetts, named Gerry. , MTJ MAHON - The honourable member evidently very familiar with the subject.",33
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I made a 2,216 note of the fact. - Mr Laird. SMITH - What did that Governor do? - Sir; JOHN . FORREST - In 1812, fWishing to gain some advantage, he armargin ranged the electorates to suit himself. - I say, .the Swan electors in the new Dampier division will wish to know why - the honourable member for Coolgardie deber sired to arrange the electorate so as destroy their parliamentary power influence, and their community of interests, by adding over 3,000 miners to an agriculthere tural and pastoral district. I prepare the to Dampier. honourable member for the question when he seeks their suffrage.",33
159,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member's electors will wish to know a few things from him.,33
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I shall deal avoid with my electors presently. Why did we Parliament,Western have a long speech from the honourable observed. member on the desirability of removing a ever, we have certain number of miners of Cue and ""Perth,"" and ""Fremantle,"" Mount Magnet into an agricultural disboth Federal and State Parliaments; trict?",33
161,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Did not the honourable member himself put the miners into that division ?,33
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I am talking about what the honourable member desires to him to do. Why did the honourable member give conso much attention to that matter, and never mention otfter districts, which are in the Perth, with Swan 29,320 electors, is over 1,071 below the quota, and Fremantle, with 29,563. memelectors, and Swan, with 29,800 electors,, to are also below the quota, which is 30,391. _ Mr Mahon - Thos e are very fair divisions.",33
163,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"But they'are below the quota. Kalgoorlie is 3,640 above the quota; and the extraordinary thing is the honourable member for that conthe stituency, who, I am sorry to hear, is absent today in consequence of indisposition, wish to does not complain. I could understand that honourable member complaining about, having too many, electors; but I cannot I understand, unless there are some other grounds, why others, who have less than the quota, desire more. I may mention Masthat Kalgoorlie, although it has 3,640 above the quota, is still 2,438 below the is maximum allowed by law. If Cue and Mount Magnet are added to the Dampier electorate, then that electorate will be above the quota, instead of, as proposed by the Commissioners, 1,652 below the quota. There is not much difference in the figures; and I may say that in the case of the electorates of other States the is far greater than in the case of As Western Australia. No one who knows the condition of affairs would regard the arrangement proposed by the honourable memfor Coolgardie as either equitable or to justifiable. I do not desire to detain and the House; but I think I have shown that there is no reason at all why should be the proposed addition I should now like to refer to the question of naming tbese electorates. I do not know who suggested "" Dampier,"" The Commissioners did not suggest it in their report. Generally speaking, we should names which are used for the local and in all the States, except Australia, that principle has been In Western Australia, how""Swan,"" ""Kalgoorlie,"" all used for and it is often very difficult to know whether reference is being made to a State or a . Federal member. The name "" Dampier""' will, of course, avoid any such inconveni-ence, and something might be said in its - favour. Dampier was the first Englishman to see Australia, in the ship Roe-buck, and he named many of the chief physical features of the north-west coast, including Roebuck Bay, on which Broome is ;situated. After all, however, Dampier only saw the very tropical part of Australia, north of the tropic Capricorn, and - a very small portion of that; and, on the whole, I do not think this a very appropriate name. Why the division should be - called "" Dampier,"" instead of "" Swan,"" I am at a loss to understand. The name of this district ought not to have been changed, but there should have been a change in the case of the .southern district. The northern division con- members. tains the Swan River and the local electorate of Swan, and, as I have said, the portion .16 be absorbed by the proposed Dampier ^division contains 18,933 electors of the present Swan division out of the total of 59,239 in the whole new division. There are other reasons why the name "" Swan "" should be retained. The district contains rfnany historic places, including York, Northam, Beverley, Toodyay, Gingin, .Eongara, and Geraidton-al l prominent - names in the early days. There are also the Swan River, the Avon, the Canning, the Moore, the Irwin, the Greenough, the Chapman, and the Murchison, all conmected with the early Swan River settle-ment. The southern half of my present - electorate comprises the south-west corner of the continent, and it is associated, with Pinjarra, Bunbury, Busselton, the great - southern towns of Pingelly, Narrogin, 'Wagin, Katanning, Williams, Kojonup, - and Albany. Why should we not have a name associated with these places? I have several names I shall suggest to honourable ^members as suitable. First there is "" Leschenault,"" after the early naturalist. This - district was called the "" Leschenault "" district for many years; and to this day the name appears in deeds. Then there is ""Stirling,"" after the first Governor, and a name that has been given to one of the - finest ranges of hills in the country; """".Gregory,"" after the two early dis-tingui'shed explorers; and "" Australind,"" and "" Leeuwin."" Any of these names - would be appropriate to the south-west - corner of Australia. We may be asked what is in a name, but when we are about the business we might as well have an appropriate one.",33
164,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Why not a native name?,34
165,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I am afraid that some of the native names are much too long for the purpose. I should now like to make some general remarks in regard tb the practice we are adopting in dealing with the. redistribution of electorates. I regret that there has been an exhibition of party feeling . in connection with the re-arrangement of thedivisions. In my opinion it is deplorable. I . think that the systemought to be swept away and shunned as a poisonous, cancerous growth, injurious to us as a Parliament, both individually and collectively. Our action brands this Parliament as being unfit to act judicially in any matter personal to any honourable",34
166,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,What does the right honourable member suggest?,34
167,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Le t us make a tribunal so strong that it will be respected, and let its decision be final. It is time that the present system was swept away. It puts persons in a difficulty in which they do not want to be placed. I should like to know what honourable members opposite are trying to do. They have been trying to arrange the electorates of this country for party purposes.",34
168,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,We are only imitating the right honourable member's example in that respect.,34
169,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"That will not make it any better, even if the statement were true. What we saw the other day, we shall see now. What was done here the other day to help an honourable member who sits on the opposite side? What do honourable members on the other side want to do today but to help a member of their own party? How could the House be so unanimous as it was the other night against' the Ministry if the honourable member for Herbert had not been at work ?",34
170,Mr BAMFORD,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,That is not true.,34
171,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Order ! The right honourable member must not refer to that matter.,34
172,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I know that the honourable member for Coolgardie has been using all his influence. He has distributed a circular-h e did not send one to me-pointin g out the enormity of the proposed divisions by directing attention to this red piece of map which he wanted to have so arranged as to suit himself.,34
173,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,There is one of them here; I should like the right honourable member to read it.,34
174,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I am not Mr SPEAKER - Order ! going to read it. The honourable member is going to succeed in doing what his leagues didthe other night, when they said "" We must give a vote for Bamford.""",35
175,Mr BAMFORD,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I did not ask a man a vote.,35
176,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member arranged the thing very well.,35

179,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Order ! The right honourable member must not make that ment.,35
180,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"If I have made a statement which you do not approve of, sir, I will withdraw it and express regret. Honourable members seem to forget in that, in this matter, they are in a judicial position and one of great responsiwe bility. They have the duty of judging the work done by expert and well-qualified cers-the Commissioners.",35

197,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I shall quote the opinion of another man who I am sorry to say is not with us now, and that is the late Mr C. C. Kingston, in regard to the Parliament interfering with the work of Commissioners in arranging electoral divisions. Speaking on the 18th August, J903, he said, at page 3734 of HansardI know the mischief which results when members of Parliament are called upon to apply themselves individually to questions of this kind. Naturally, to a great extent, they lose sight of the principle underlying them, and pay regard to how they themselves may.possibly be affected. On the next page he said to honourable membersKeep the Parliament free from this question as much as you can, and you will get better results from impartial officers. On the 18th August, 1903, the present Attorney-General saidThe Commissioners are placed in a position outside the arena of politics, and their duty is to distribute the electorates under such conditions as will enable politicians to fairly appeal to the country. It would be a lamentable thing if politicians were allowed to divide the State into electorates to suit themselves. I would ask the honourable member, if he were here, whether he will say this to his supporters, and especially to the honourable member for Coolgardie. Then we have the honourable member for Gwydir. I wish he was here, because he rather poses as be ng always right. I shall read what he ; said on the 23 rd November, 1909, in regard to the arrangement of electorates by Commissioners. Speaking in the fulness - f his indignation-honorabl e members know how he does it",36
198,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Order ! The honorarable member's time has expired.,36
199,Mr WISE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Gippsland) [5.28] - It is rather to be regretted that the honourable member for Swan should have thrown so much party feeling into this discussion, particularly when we remember wnat took place three years ago when the last redistribution scheme was before us. On that occasion the then Prime Minister put the position, to my mind, very clearly, as far as members of Parliament are concerned. He said I rose to point out the fact that from the very first the Parliament has claimed a free hand in dealing with redistributions. It has left each decision to the individual conscience and judgment of honourable members. It has left each member to shoulder his own responsibility. On that occasion they decided to follow that course. The right honourable member for Swan, I think, took up the right position on that occasion. He said I feel justified in saying that the arrangement of the electorates by the Commissioner, a man I respect, and have a regard for, does, not commend itself to my judgment. I do not consider it is a good arrangement, and for that reason, if it goes to a division, I shall vote against it. That seems to be a matter of common sense. I have no personal or party interest to serve. My objection to the scheme is based on the reason which the Commissioners have given in their report. They sayThe Commissioners are of opinion that their first and foremost duty is to submit such recommendations as will secure in each of the proposed Divisions the nearest approach to .e >k, quota of enrolment at the time of the impending general elections in 1912. The Commissioners also consider themselves justifica in assuming that the provision contained in "" The Commonwealth Electoral Act "" for the creation of Divisions of equal electoral strength-o r as near thereto as circumstances will admit-in dicates an underlying principle and a desire on the part of the Legislature of giving to all votes, so far as possible, an equal value. Yet they set to work to divide the electorates according to what in their opinion will be their state in the impending general election in 1912. So far as 1 know there is not a general election impending in 1912; that is the first blunder that they made. If the Victorian Commissioners had been allowed to act on guess-work, this State would not have lost a member, her population at the present time entitling her to the full number given under the last distribution. The Victorian Commissioners, however, felt themselves bound to work with the figures obtained by the last collection of the census. Apparently, the Western Australian Commissioners did not consider themselves bound in the same way. - Sir.JOHN FORREST - They kept within' their maximum.",36
200,Mr WISE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Yes ; but that is a secondary consideration. They give four divisions less than the quota, and the fifth considerably more than the quota - The distribution of population now proposed is 29,320, 29,563, 29,800, 29,239, and 34,031; but if the allotment which has been suggested is made, the last two divisions would have 30,763, and 32,507- a more equal arrangement. Section 16 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides thatIn making any distribution of States Divisions the Commissioner shall give due sideration to(a) Community or diversity of interest; (b) Means of communication; (c) Physical features; (d) Existing boundaries of Divisions; and subject thereto the quota of electors shall be the basis for the distribution, and the missioner may adopt a margin of allowance, to be used whenever necessary. Had these Commissioners based their less scheme of distribution on the numbers in have . three the divisions at the time they made there would have been no need to use the large margin which they have used. They have distributed the population, not on basis of its actual location, but in ance with what they imagined would be its location in 1912, when they assumed there would be an election. . Mr Mahon - And they speak of being guided by the new quota.",37
201,Mr WTSE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Yes ; they sayAlthough it would appear on the figures availof able, and on the basis of the estimates made, that the enrolment in the proposed Division' "" D "" will at the time of the election be about 2,100 in excess of the then existing quota, Commissioners are satisfied that, unless entirely unforeseen circumstances arise, Division "" D "" as proposed will show no excess of the new quota. They have gone by guessing, which aptions. pears to be unjustifiable. I am not surwere prised that the honourable member for gardie has read the opinion of an eminent Melbourne counsel to the effect that they acted illegally in departing from the preof scribed quota on the hypothesis that there would be a change in the distribution of population at the time the next election came. That seems to me so wrong a basis for the Commissioners' scheme that I can-. not give my sanction to it, and for that reason, and for that reason alone, I shall vote against the adoption of the report. .",37
202,Dr MALONEY,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Melbourne) [5.36] I wish to protest against this proposed dis-: tribution. The difference between the populations of the proposed divisions is even greater than in Victoria, where the population is denser. I have already protested against the wiping out of two Victorian electorates. The difference between the largest and the smallest divisions in Western Australia is 4,792, whereas the difference between the largest and smallest Victorian divisions, outside the metropolis, is only 3,629, and inside the metropolis only 4,629. Thus the difference into is greatest where population is sparse and condistances almost limitless. This"" distribution by men who have ventured to be prophets is an infamy on the escutcheon of Australia.,- and I shall, therefore, vote against the adoption of the report.",37
203,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Perth) [5.38] - When Comever the reports of Commissioners on distributions of electoral divisions have been before the House, there has been more or nounced dissatisfaction, but when it was anthat instead of one, we were to Commissioners, I , in common it, with many other honourable members, thought that the referring back of reports would cease. Those who know the Western the Australian Commissioners are aware that accordthey are the best men who could have been found in the State for the work they were selected to do, and those who read their report carefully will see in it evidence of the most painstaking effort to perform their task thoroughly and impar-. tially. In the discussion of this matter there is no need for heat, even on the part Western Australian ' representatives. - The proposed distribution reduces my elec-. torate slightly, but it does not affect apthe preciably the strength of parties, and I do some not think that it will matter much to any one if the distribution is agreed to. I cannot understand how the Commissioners, could have made any other recommendaIt would be a great public scandal the report to be put aside, and the Coolold arrangement allowed to stand. The; honourable member for Gippsland made himself acquainted with one or two phases the proposal, but those who have carefully read the report know that his speech > amounted to an attempt to throw dust into the eyes of honourable members, and that by - emphasizing a few points, and ignoring, others, he made what was in many respects a misstatement of the case. In accusing! - the Commissioners of basing their schemei on conjecture he did them a serious wrong. They have proceeded absolutely in accordance with the law, and in no case have they ignored official facts and figures.",37
204,Mr WISE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,They have estimated what the population of the States will be at a future date.,38
205,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The honourable member gave the House to understand that the Commissioners assigned to one division a number largely in excess of the quota, while the others have assigned to them numbers much below. It is a fact that the "" D "" electorate has assigned to it a number 3,640 in excess of the quota, though that is little more than half the margin allowed by law. The Commissioners state their reasons for this allotment. They point out that the population of this electorate has been steadily decreasing, and that by the time the next election is held, the excess allotted to it will probably have disappeared. At the same time the population of the other divisions is increasing, the tendency being for the numbers allotted to them to increase to the quota. In all these cases the Commissioners have not gone beyond the limits allowed them by the law. They are instructed to get as near to the quota as possible. They have done so. They have given their reasons for making the redistribution in the way that has been indicated. A great deal has been made of a statement appearing on page 13 of the Commissioners' report as to "" the impending general elections in 1912."" It is quite obvious to any one that this phrase is either a printer's error or a slip of the pen. If the honourable member for Gippsland had looked at the top of page 13 instead of confining his attention to the bottom, he would have seen that the Commissioners point out there thatIt is considered probable that the .figures which will be available showing the actual enrolment for the forthcoming elections next year will proveand so forth. As this report was written in 1912, "" next year"" must mean 1913, and this passage shows that the statement lower down was a slip. It is regrettable that the honourable member for Gippsland, with that Pecksniffian air with which we in this House are now so familiar, should have gone to the foot of a page to detect what he regards as an error when there is at the top of the same page a line which, if he had observed it, would have put him quite right straight away. .",38
206,Mr WISE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Ha d the Commissioners any right to consider the matter other than according to the law ?,38
207,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The honourable member knows that the Commissioners have a perfect right to arrange, within the limits allowed by the law, for a levelling up of all the electorates at the time of the proposed election.",38
208,Mr WISE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"No , they have not. *",38
209,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"That they have a perfect right to do so within the limits allowed by the law is perfectly plain, and presents no difficulties at all.",38
210,Mr WISE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"1 prefer the opinion of Mr. Duffy, K . C , to that of the honourable member for Perth.",38
211,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"As against the quoted opinion of a gentleman in Melbourne who, I believe, is regarded as a constitutional authority, I have taken the opinion of other authorities who hold equally as high a position in constitutional matters as the gentleman referred to; and they inform me that there is absolutely nothing whatever in the contention that the Commissioners have gone beyond their powers.. The section dealing with the matter is so 0 plain that even an ordinary layman, may read it as he runsIn making any distribution of States into Divisions the Commissioner shall give due consideration to community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, existing boundaries of Divisions; and subject thereto the quota of electors shall be the basis for the distribution, and the Commissioners may adopt a margin of allowance, to be used whenever necessary, but in no case shall such quota be departed from to a greater extent than one-fourth more and of one-fourth less. On the first page of their report the Commissioners say that the total number of electors on the Commonwealth rolls of the State as for the. 19th December, 1911, was 151,953. They go on to show that the quota amounts to 30,391. According to the official return supplied by the Commonwealth Electoral Department the proposed subdivision D contained on the 19th December, 1911, 34,031 enrolled electors, or 3,640 in excess of the quota, while the margin allowed them by the Act is nearly double that amount. In what way, then, can they be said to have gone beyond the legal limits of the powers that they are supposed to exercise? They have given reasons why they have given this excess of 3,640, and any one who reads those reasons carefully will see that there is good ground for the case they have constructed. As I have said, the Commissioners want the rearranged divisions to be at the next election as nearly as possible level in their voting strength. be told by members of the Labour party - by gentlemen who profess to be the champions and upholders of principles and of equal voting power-that these Commissioners have done wrong in trying to equalize the voting strength of each electorate? If that is the ^position which - honourable members opposite are trying to take up, it is entirely different from the position which I understand was claimed, and which undoubtedly was for a considerable time advocated, by the Labour party. Now, however, it appears that they are prepared to accept a state of affairs which gives nearly double the voting power to one portion of Western Australia as against another, simply because the Commissioners who have been authorized to do the work under the Commonwealth law have carefully carried out their instructions, and have made arrangements, in addition, for a decreasing population it; the one case, and an increasing population in the case of other electorates. If , as it will I think turn out, this proposed rearrangement is sent back to the Commissioners with a suggestion for modification, what in all probability happen? They will have to take the most recent figures available to see whether the case they have constructed should give way or not. 1 believe that there are now in existence figures that prove that the forecast of these gentlemen as regards the voting strength of electorate D is correct, and that that process has ""been going on in the way they' - indicated that it was likely to do. If that be the case, and if the Commissioners find that their forecast is correct, they can but report accordingly to the Government j and it will remain for the Government to show in what respect the Commissioners have erred in making their recommendation. They have undoubtedly done their work well, and thoroughly, and it is for this House to consider very seriously before back this particular series of recommendations as to whether there is sufficient reason for the course which members opposite propose to take in this connection. The Commissioners have dea.lt with the possibility of an addition D electorate in 'consequence on the transcontinental railway. point to the possibility of a considerable number of men being required to carry on the work of constructing a railway, and set off this consideration as against the Mr Fowler. steady decrease in the mining population Am I to that has been going on for some years. But there is no likelihood that a very large number of men will be congregated in this democratic electorate to build the railway. At the very most, perhaps a thousand will be required. We are given to understand; however, that several thousands are expected there in a few months. A little while ago-onl y the other day, in f a c t - I saw a statement in one of the newspapers, from some one who is superintending the work in Western Australia- I forget whether it was Mr Chinn or not-pointin g out that for a good many months to come there would be comparatively little employment on the line, and that there would be very little grading and levelling work to do. If , as I understand, the Government propose to utilize machinery for that work, there will not be such a large number of men employed after all, and even the anticipation of the Commissioners will have been unduly optimistic. At any rate, I for one have no particular interest in this matter beyond the desire to secure for the next election a result that will be thoroughly representative, and will not ogive to one person who happens to be will elected any undue preponderance of voters over another. Moreover, I am anxious to conserve that very democratic principle in which I understood that the Labour party thoroughly believed and had always fought for, namely, an equality of voting strength in each electorate. I feel sure that those who take the trouble to read the report of the Commissioners carefully through will feel that they are unable to do anything less than endorse their recommendation.",38
212,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Riverina) [5.58] I regret that so much heat has been imported into this discussion, especially by the right honourable member for Swan. I feel sure that there is no reason why such statements should be made as that honourable members are not going to vote on this sending question on other than strict lines of justice. I have a lively recollection that some years ago, when there was a redishonorable tribution of seats in New South Wales, one of the essential elements in the instructions to the Commissioners was departed from, to inasmuch as they did not recognise comof work munity of interest. That created a conThey siderable amount of trouble at the time. A similar element is existent in this case. I have given a considerable amount of thought to the subject before us. and have read the report of the Commissioners very carefully indeed. I feel sure, and have no hesitation in saying, that the Commissioners have adopted an absolutely dangerous principle, which this Parliament should not allow to be enforced, in anticipating the position in which electorates will be in regard to population years hence. Their instructions, in accordance with the law, are to subdivide the State into electorates upon the basis of the existing enrolment. Instead of that, they have anticipated what the condition of an electorate will be a - considerable time hence. I intend to move an amendment before I conclude my remarks, because I consider that the Commissioners have done wrong in taking into consideration what is likely to happen years ahead. I would' point out to the honourable member for Perth that what the honourable member for Gippsland alluded to was no printer's error or slip of the pen on the part of the Commissioners when they spoke of elections taking place in 1912. If the honourable member will turn to paragraph 31 of the report, he will find another allusion to the year 1912. That paragraph appears on page 12 of the report.",39
213,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,How does the honourable member account for the reference to next year at the top of page 13 of the report?,40
214,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I have seen the reference to which the honourable member refers, but I would point out to him that, in paragraph 31, we have the statementAt the time when the new Commonwealth rolls are likely to be put into practical viz., about April, 1912. . . - 3iIn other words, the redistribution was made on the basis, not of the existing enrolment, but of the probable enrolment when the new rolls are likely to be put into practical use.",40
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,They say that the numbers will then be about even.,40

218,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"In their report, the Commissioners clearly state that when the elections take place, in 1912-and if we assume that the elections will not take place until 1913, their case is very much worsethere is going to be a considerable population in a part of the State in which there is practically no population at present. In thus acting, in anticipation of a probable influx of population to a certain area, are they not introducing a dangerous principle? T am glad that the honourable member for Gippsland pointed out that had the Commissioners thus been allowed to proceed with their distribution, in anticipation of the population twelve months hence, Victoria would not have lost a representative. In that case, however, the division of the State into Federal electorates was made on the basis of actual statistics.",40
219,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"And , undoubtedly, the distribution in the case of Western Australia is based on statistics as to population.",40
220,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Le t me point out to the honourable member that the Commissioners in this case have acted on the basis of an anticipated enrolment. They state, in paragraph 30, of their reportThere are, of course, always some electors who do not take advantage of the privilege of enrolling themselves, and, therefore, as will be seen, ""a slight discrepancy exists between the percentage of those eligible for enrolment and those who have actually enrolled themselves. For the purpose, however, of this report a conservative estimate of 50 per cent, of the total population will be taken as representing the proportion of enrolments at any time likely to appear on the electoral rolls.

In paragraph 33, we have the statementThe Commissioners are of opinion that their first and foremost duty is to submit such recommendations as will secure in each of the proposed divisions the nearest approach to the quota of enrolment at the time of the impending general elections in 1912. I submit that their imperative duty was to redistribute the States into Federal divisions on the basis of the existing, and not an anticipated, enrolment. I cannot too severely condemn the adoption of the principle which they have observed. I do not know these gentlemen. They may be well qualified to carry out this work, but I condemn the principle they have introduced, under which they anticipate from facts within their own knowledge that a place at present sparsely populated will be largely populated twelve months or two years hence. How is it possible for any one to say, more especially in regard to a community like that of Western Australia, what the floating population will be three months, let alone twelve months or two years, hence? Experience tells us that if gold is found in any district a rush immediately sets in, and that if the find proves to be a good one, a large and permanent population is established there. I have no desire to repeat the arguments that have already been used, but I feel that an injustice has been done in this case, just as an injustice was done in connection with a redistribution of my own electorate, which did not have regard to community of interest. My complaint is that the Commissioners have based their decision in this case, not upon the actual enrolment, but upon what they anticipate will be the enrolment twelve months or two years hence.",40

230,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Yes ; but not within the law; and in that view I am fortified by the opinion of a leading barrister in this State.,41
231,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The question of the margin of allowance is entirely subsidiary to other considerations.,41
232,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"There is a. number of considerations, such as community of interest, and means of communication, to which, under the law, regard must be paid. The honourable member for Coolgardie has already referred to the double journey that would have to be undertaken in certain cases by electors in the division of Dampier, and he and other honourable members from that State can deal, also, with the question of community of interest. contention is that the Commissioners have departed from the directions given them under the Act by basing their scheme of distribution upon an anticipated enrolment, instead of the actual enrolment at the time that the scheme was drawn up. I therefore move That all the words after "" That "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" in accordance with section 22 of the Electoral Act the redistribution be referred to the Commissioners with an intimation that due consideration does not appear to have been given to the diversity of interest and the absence of means of communication between the districts of Mount Magnet and Cue and the other portions of the proposed division ' D.'

The only reason advanced is that put forward by the mover of the original motion, and suphonorable ported by the honourable member for Gippsland, that we ought not to anticipate movements of population. This, however, is a consideration to which this House has always given the greatest possible weight. In every redistribution the same question has cropped up. The question of the probable redistribution of population has always been a determining factor in the decisions arrived at by this House - Those of us who have been here for some years will recollect the occasion .on which proposals for redistributing the two large States of the Commonwealth were sent back on the ground that a drought was in existence, and that, after it had broken, the location of the population would probably be entirely different.",41

240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"No ; they simply say that at the time this redistribution scheme is given effect to the populaback tion of a certain division; judging by the movements of population in the recent past, will be so-and-so. I do not see that they are disentitled to take - into account the movement of population. For instance, redistributing two or three very populous centres, ih each of which the number electors was very much over the quota, likely to develop very rapidly in the near future, surely the Commissioners would entitled to take into account those facts. Unless they were able to-do so, the elecwas torates would soon be out of To avoid anything of the kind, the Commissioners must forecast a little j they cut down below the quota, i electorates which are growing rapidly; while, at the same time, they may well keep a little above the quota those electhat torates which are not likely to increase, the surrounding circumstances of which dicate that they will not increase.

Here - we are dealing with a case in which the Electoral Commissioners are given a disonly cretion with a big margin within which to - exercise it - The margin was made so great under the Act in order that the movements - of population, as well as other consideraslight. tions, might be taken into account. I have .said that the schemes for the redistribution - they had not done so of two of the large States were set aside in by this House because the honourable member for Hume in submitting the motion of dealing with them argued very strongly and that the movement of population shown at the time would right itself the moment the be drought came to an end, and there would then be no need to raise the question which raised by the proposals for redistribuplumb again. tion then submitted.",42
247,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"That was only to deal must with electors who were temporarily absent f anything, from their holdings.",42
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I remember that controversy on the matter was so keen Sir George Reid resigned his seat, and and was re-elected for East Sydney. T?he inschemes of redistribution to which I refer were sent back to the Commissioners responsible for them, for a reason totally to that which is now submitted for returning these proposals to the Commissioners for Western Australia. We are asked to send back these proposals on the' to ground that the Commissioners had no right to anticipate the future movements of the population, and I repeat that it was of their main functions to estimate .the probable effect of the work they were asked to do. If we have heard the real reason for sending back these proposals, it seems to me that the case of those who support the amendment entirely fails. We should act in accordance with the decision of the Electoral Commissioners, who are imparoutside parliamentary influence, and object in the world but to carry out the duty imposed upon them. I have the division list before me in connection with the motion submitted in 1903,, and I find that nearly all my honourable see friends opposite voted, to send those schemes back,. because the Electoral Commissioners for the States referred to. had the not done what they now condemn the Electoral Commissioners for Western Australia for doing.",42
249,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,In the last Parliament honourable members opposite left their Minister of - Home Affairs on his lone,42
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"No doubt they; did some shocking things which we shall ' never hear the end of. I am concerned now in pointing 'out that honourable mem- ' bers who wish to send these proposals back' because the Commissioners have anticipated the movement of population in a degree, voted in 1903 to send back other proposals to Commissioners because. ;.., .' - ",42
251,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,How did the honourable gentleman vote on that occasion?,43
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I voted against sending the reports back. We should have a better argument than any we have yet heard for the 'amendment, because the Electoral Commissioners for Western Australia did nothing but what they were entitled to do, and enjoined to do in the terms of their appointment and under the Electoral Act. They were given a margin under which to do the very thing they have done, and which honourable members opposite now condemn. I should willingly vote that any proposed scheme of redistribution should be sent back to the Electoral Commissioners if an obvious and flagrant wrong were proposed, but in this case it seems to me that the Electoral Commissioners for Western Australia have done what the law directed them to do, and we should be without any justifiable excuse if in the circumstances we sent their report back to them.",43
253,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Queensland) [6.22] - I feel that the procedure suggested is not in accordance with the spirit of the Electoral Act. The proper thing to do is to accept or reject the proposed redistribution. The object of having Electoral Commissioners was that they should inquire into the conditions of each electoral division.,43
254,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Would the honourable member not have the House tell them where it thinks they are in error ?,43
255,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,No ; it appears to me that the amendment would be equivalent to the House directing the Commissioners as to how they should perform their duties. What is now proposed is that the Commissioners should be requested to make a redistribution on a certain basis.,43
256,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,That is in accordance with the Act,43
257,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"No , it is not. By the amendment the House requests the Commissioners to do something.",43
258,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,To do their duty.,43
259,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"No , the amendment covers more than that, because a special reference is made to particular districts. The words proposed to be inserted areIn accordance with section 22 of the Electoral Act the redistribution be _ referred back to the Commissioners with an intimation that due consideration does not appear to have been given to the diversity of interest and the absence of means of communication between the districts of Mount Magnet and Cue, and the other portions of the proposed division "" D . "" That the Commissioners br requested _ to make (he distribution on the basis of the existing rolment (and not by way of anticipation) so as to give each division as nearly as practicable an equal, number of electors.",43
260,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,That is asking them to do what the Act provides for?,43
261,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"VV e give an expression of opinion, and in the same motion request the Commissioners to do something which amounts to an intimation that they should carry out the opinion expressed by this House. That is not the intention of the Act",43
262,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Is there anything in the Act to prevent it?,43
263,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The Act provides that If either House of Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Commissioner to propose a fresh distribution of the State into divisions. According to the procedure we have laid) down for ourselves there should simply be an acceptance or rejection of a proposed redistribution.",43
264,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"This is a rejection, with an expression of opinion.",43
265,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"It is just that expression of opinion which is an interference with the Electoral Commissioners. If the House rejects a proposal for the distribution of a State, even the Minister in charge of electoral matters cannot express an opinion on the subject.",43
266,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Surely the honourable member will admit that we are justified ingiving our reasons for sending the proposed scheme back to the Commissioners.,43
267,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Honourable members are individually justified in doing so, but the procedure contemplated in the Act is. that a proposed scheme of distribution should be accepted or, rejectedThe idea was to appoint a series of Electoral Commissioners absolutely independent of Parliament to meet and consider the whole of the conditions of a State, and act. in accordance with the law we laid down. They were then to submit their proposed, schemes of distribution, which were to be published throughout the several States. Time was to be allowed for receiving objections, and when the schemes were submitted to Parliament it was for either House to accept - or reject them. If we reject the Commissioners' scheme it is for them to make a fresh distribution.",43
268,Mr MAIION,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Does the honourable gentleman not think it would help themif they knew what the House thinks is wrong in their scheme ?,43
269,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I think 'it is their dutyento take into account what individual members think on the subject. Individual members of this House have the right to object to the proposed scheme, and to give reasons for their objection, and the Electoral Commissioners would no doubt in the ordinary way pay attention to those objections, the same as they would to any other objections. But in dealing with the matter in the way here proposed, I think we are asked to express an opinion without complete information. We are asked to reject the proposed scheme for Western Australia as though we each had a knowledge of the whole of the conditions of that State, and we are asked to set our knowledge against that of the Electoral Commissioners, whose duty it was to specially investigate those conditions. If a manifest injustice were proposed it would be the duty of the House to reject such a proposal ; but we are asked in this case to express an opinion upon the question of diversity of interest and the absence of means of communication between the districts of Mount Magnet and Cue.",43
270,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,It should be Mount Margaret.,44
271,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"No , Mount Magnet.",44
272,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Moun t Magnet is connected by rail with Cue.,44
273,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Her e we have the right honourable member for Swan, who is certainly one of the best-informed members of this House as to the conditions in Western Australia, differing from the honourable member for Riverina. Perhaps the honourable member who moved the amendment can tell me where Mount Magnet is.",44
274,Mr CHANTER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member can see it on the map.,44
275,Unknown,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m.,44
276,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"As I have said, the spirit of the Electoral Act is that we shall appoint Commissioners, with the desire to, as far as possible, leave the question of the electoral divisions to an absolutely impartial body. Our idea was to improve on the old State principle of the Government forming a series of electoral boundaries and submitting these to the House for approval, by creating a body to deal with the matter judicially. perience has led us to the conclusion that it is better to have three Commissioners rather than one, and that these three Commissioners should consist of the Surveyor-General, who by virtue of his office and position necessarily knows a great deal of the country, and two other men of equal official position, such as, in some instances, District Court Judges or State electoral officers. The duty of the Commissioner* is to make a distribution of a State, to receive objections and give due weight to. them, and then lay their scheme before the House through the Minister. Of course, the object is not merely to lay the report on the table, and do nothing more with it ; the Act seems to indicate that it is the duty of the Minister to submit the report; and here I may say that I am sorry the honourable gentleman did not give us any information, but simply laid.the document on the table and left the House to worry through it. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is for the Commissioners to supply the information.",44
277,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Then I may take it that the Government's view is that this distribution is not a matter for us to interfere with, but one for the Commissioners whose duty it is to consider the whole question impartially. The section of the. Act contemplates our acceptance or rejection of any distribution; that, I submit, is the law. Of course, the action taken the other night in regard to the division of another State set a precedent which the honourable member for Riverina is now seeking to follow. That, in my opinion, is a very dangerous precedent, because the law is emphatic in requiring us to accept or reject; and, in the latter case, for the Minister tc direct a fresh distribution to be made. The amendment of the honourable member for Riverina practically supersedes the motion; the House is not asked to approve nor to reject, but to send the report back with a direction. That, I say, is not the spirit, even if it is within the letter, of the law. The scheme of the Electoral Act is not that the House shall direct the Commissioners as to what they shall do. If we are to take any action, it would be better to accept full and complete responsibility, and frame the divisions, rather than attempt to interfere with and try to supersede, the Commissioners in the way proposed. The amendment sets out that due consideration does not appear to have been given to diversity of interests and the question of communication with Mount Magnet and Cue, and the Ex- Commissioners are requested to make a distribution on the basis of the existing enrolment, so as to give each division, as nearly as practicable,, an equal number of electors. When we asked the honourable member for Riverina where Mount Magnet is, the only information he could give us was that it is on the map. A representative of Western Australia on this side, when Mount Magnet was mentioned, said that Mount Margaret was meant.",44
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,He is think.,45
279,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Probably so. - honourable member for Riverina has not, I think, that detailed knowledge of Western Australia necessary for him to advise the House as to what action we should take in - regard to the division of that State. would much prefer to see the House, if it .disapproves of the division, reject it straight out. The honourable member for Coolgardie did not conclude his speech with an amendment; he evidently thought, and wiselv, I fancy, that the proper thing was to reject the proposed division, and have the matter re-submitted to the Commissioners. But the honourable member has stepped in independently and superseded - trie representatives of Western Australia, It' may seem, Mr Speaker, more like asking your opinion on a question of law than raising a point of order, but it appears to - me a very doubtful action, after we have passed the Electoral Act, for this House, by resolution, to set aside that Act, and lay - down its own procedure. The preceding case which we considered was probably still more in conflict with the letter of the Act, - though, in substance, the cases are the - same. In neither case are we asked to - either, affirm or reject the report of the - Commissioners, but to send it back to them - with a request, in the present case, to make a distribution on the basis of .the - existing enrolment. How long is this to ,go on? It is certainly not a proper procedure. We ought certainly to hear an - expression of opinion from the Minister of Home Affairs on the proposal to refer the report back with the direction attached. I fancy the honourable gentleman must have - great doubt in his mind as to the propriety of the procedure; the anxious look on_ his face indicates that it is causing him serious trouble. The request or direction contained ih the amendment is not a just one, because the Commissioners appear t.o have taken into consideration the points there mentioned. Their report seems to indicate that they have made a fair endeavour to comply with the conditions of the law; and in regard to the quota, they appear to have done their duty. Undei the circumstances, I submit that we ought to reject the. .amendment.",45
280,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Melbourne Ports), r 7.5 5] - Victoria n members have been twitted with differing from theCommisCommissioners sioners, although we have not the advanaccount? - tage possessed by those gentlemen of knowing the distribution of interests and right, I other conditions in Western Australia. If I did not believe the Commissioners to be above reproach, I should have thought The they had gone out of their way to make a nice comfortable seat for somebody they knew. I admit that that is a very harsh thing to say; but my opinion is supported by the facts of the case. It seems evident I that the Commissioners found it impossible to make a division having regard to complete community of interests. They seem to have tried to keep as much of the mining interests of Western Australia as they could in one division; and, if that had been possible, I could have seen a reason why they thought it necessary to depart from the procedure always adopted in the past in arranging electorates. It is evident, however, that they found this impossible of achievement, and thus we have their proposal now before us. They have departed altogether from the previous distribution, and have apparently gone out of their way to make the division under discussion a peculiar one from the point of view of community of interests. It has been said today that in the case of Victoria the report was referred back for somewhat similar reasons to those which have been laid before us today. I ' have never yet known, in the arrangements in a State, a country electorate to get more voters than a city or a suburban electorate. No doubt the Boulder and the Kalgoorlie electorates contain very large cities, but in the rest of this country. there are purely mining towns. Away down in the south, of course, there are varied industries or callings. What does seem to me peculiar is that the Commissioners departed altogether from the previous method in redistributing the State. They assumed that the population would decrease, and that to my mind was where they made a great blunder. They had no right, I contend, to assume that division D would lose enormously in population during the next few years. However, that point has been dilated upon, and I do not wish to traverse the same ground again. It has been pointed out that in this division will be concentrated the. whole of the work-whic h will be considerable, of course-associate d with the construction of the transcontinental railway. That in itself must lead to an enormous, „ increase in the population.",45
281,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Can you say that the did not take that into - - ,45
282,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"We acknowledge reflect that a railway will increase the population in that particular country, especially durquite ing the course of its construction. It must attract thousands of men. There is no doubt in my mind that within the next twelve or fifteen months the population this country, instead of decreasing, will increased, by the construction of the railway alone, by close upon 2,000 persons. Again, it does not need a sage from Western tralia to tell us that in any part of such an enormous minings district as division at any time during the next year, or pernot done that. haps during the next few months, we may have an enormous increase in population. That possibility has already been stated, and, to my mind, conclusively estabelectorate lished. One ' reason why I think this distribution scheme should be thrown out is the fact that even if the Commissioners had the power to assume, which I doubt, that the population would decrease in the future, they showed great want of judgsioners ment in assuming that it would decrease within the next few years.",46
283,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I will bet the honourable orable member a new hat that their forecast turns out to be correct.,46
284,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Order ! - Mr MATHEWS - I am inclined to said suspect that the honourable member's wish 'is father to the thought. It would be almost impossible for any to represent either of these electorates D and E, which the Commissioners have planned out. It is impossible for a man to see the whole of an enorinto mous electorate, though I believe that the honourable member for Coolgardie has managed to get over most of that elecmade torate during his term here. I do not think it would be possible for one man to look after all his constituents. Certainly, question of accessibility was not considered by the Commissioners in cutting up this the Government. State. It has been pointed out very clearly that in some cases a man who wanted to to the centre of division D for an electoral the Greeks. purpose, would have to travel 1,800 miles in all. The Commissioners have not in any way conformed to the law laid down for their guidance, and I do not they can possibly expect their plan of redistribution to give satisfaction to House. If they had wished their scheme sent back for consideration I do not think that they could have taken a better course than they did to attain that end. I tion for them. admit, however, that they have endeavoured to.do their work in a manner credit on themselves and do justice to the State. They are only human, and as likely to make mistakes as we are. Seeing that they as officials know that there is a diversity of opinion on practically everything, I do not see why they or any of one else should take umbrage at their plan be being sent back, with a special indication from the House as to where they erred.",46
285,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,So long as no unfair reAusflections are made upon them.,46
286,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I think that the D honourable member will admit that I have,46
287,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Yes , the honourable member has accused them of readying up an for some friend. That was a remost improper reflection to make.",46
288,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"If the honourable member had listened to what I said, he would not have made that remark. I stated very clearly that we accepted the Commisas honourable men, and that if we did not, we might assume that they had done something for a purpose. The honmember has accused me of charging these gentlemen with having been guilty of dishonourable conduct, but I have done nothing of the sort. I have been as lenient with them as I possibly could, and merely that they had erred in their judgment.",46
289,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"No , the honourable memone man ber did more than that.",46
290,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Not only did they do that, but they did not take a common sense view in partitioning Western Australia electorates. That has already been explained from this side of the chamber. It is very apparent to me that this is to be a party question by the Opposition.

295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,You all went to which would gether by instinct.,46
296,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The Ministry must have come to the conclusion that there was something wrong with this scheme when it was submitted, but they seem to take a peculiar stand on almost every question which originates with officials. They have officials to carry out certain work, and when it is completed they accept their recommendation. I do not think that a responsible Government should do a thing of that sort, because officials can make mistakes. I wish to draw a distinction between the attitude of the present Ministry and that of the Ministry which had to deal with the previous redistribution of seats in Western Australia. We all recollect the sorry plight in which the DeakinCook Ministry 'placed their Minister of Home Affairs when, headed by the honourable member for Swan, they walked over to the Opposition side and voted "" No.""",47
297,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,There was no time then to rectify the scheme.,47
298,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Exactly .,47
299,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,And there is plenty of time now.,47
300,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Yes. I know very well that the Deakin-Cook Ministry wished that the Commissioners had arranged the divisions in Western Australia somewhat differently. I remember the honourable member for Swan remarking here on one occasion that the arrangement suited him personally, but he did not consider that it was right.",47
301,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I had some knowledge and experience of the matter, anyway.",47
302,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I - am not attempting to lead the House to believe that I would know how to cut up Wes""tern Australia into divisions; but I recognise that there is something peculiar about the way in which Division E has been cut out.",47
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The honourable member is talking against time, I think.",47
304,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The honourable member, of course, does not like my comments. I do not know whether he has his eye on the area of country indicated by a big red patch on the map. From my knowledge of the State, I should imagine that there is no other division which would suit him so well as that one would. He knows what he intends to do, but it certainly looks to me as if he had his eye on that electorate. At any rate, I suspect that there must have been some very nice gentlemen in Western Australia who, looking at the different divisions, said, "" It may be an accident, but here is a splendid opportunity for a politician of a certain bent of mind to get a really nice, safe seat."" At any rate, that is the view I take of the position.",47
305,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Is it a safe seat, do you think?",47
306,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"For the Opposition 1 certainly think it is, and I am strengthened in that view by the very fight which they are putting up for the adoption of this scheme. The Commissioners had no right to place.4,000 electors in an immense area like division D, which, according to the evidence we have, will increase in population. That is one of the things which satisfy me that they did not know what they were doing when they redistributed the State.",47
307,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member said a moment ago that they did it for a purpose. They must have known that then.,47
308,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I am afraid that the honourable member has not been following me closely.,47
309,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"It is hardly fair to watch this speech too closely, is it?",47
310,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I have .said nothing nasty. I hold that if honourable members do justice to their intelligence, they will reject Division D as it is shown there. During the last Parliament I rieard the honourable member for Swan say that the electorates should be constituted from the stand-point of community of interest, even if you had to take people out of one portion and go over and take the people out of another portion. That would be much better than the method which was adopted on this occasion.",47
311,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"A very good plan, too; but it cannot be done now.",47
312,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"If there is any portion of Western Australia which is likely to increase in population-that is, outside the city itself-it is Division D. 1 think that the House, in justice to its intelligence, should send the report back to the Commissioners with an injunction as outlined in the amendment. The House Will then be able to consider a better and fairer scheme of distribution than that now submitted.",47
313,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Ballarat) [8.16] - The amendment proposes to send back to the Commissioners this scheme of distribution, with an intimation regarding diversity of interests, and a request for a new distribution on the basis of the existing enrolment. I am not aware of any section under which authority is given to this branch of the Legislature, or, indeed, to Parliament, to instruct the Commissioners in any regard; yet this amendment goes the length of suggesting that the Mount Magnet and Cue districts, and other portions of proposed division D, be dealt with in a certain way. This is a departure to which attention should be directed.",47
314,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Is not the power to do this inherent in the House?,48
315,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The course now proposed is not contemplated by the Act. Its wisdom is doubtful, because of the partisanship which may be introduced.",48
316,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Does the honourable member contend that the Electoral Act limits power of the House?,48
317,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The Act contains provisions setting forth clearly the course to be followed. It contemplates no such interference as is proposed with the independence of the Commissioners.,48
318,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Is it not desirable that the Commissioners should know our mind?,48
319,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Shoul d they desire to do so, a perusal of the debate will make them acquainted with the views of each honourable member who speaks, and of the feeling of the House collectively. At all events, until the Act has been amended, I do not think that more is necessary or desirable. Again, section 22 prescribes that when either House passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution. We are not asked to disapprove of the proposed distribution, nor are we asked to negative a motion for its approval, though incidentally, as a consequence of passing this amendment, for whose terms there is no excuse or justification, we might be taken by indirect implication to have followed one of these courses. This irregularity may, or may not, be serious at this juncture, but must be taken into account in any future amendment of the Act.",48
320,Mr BAMFORD,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Herbert) [8.20] - I do not know that I shall transgress the rules of debate if I reply to some remarks made this afternoon by the honourable member for Swan'by repeating what I have already said in this chamber, that I did not canvass anybody for a vote in support of the motion which I moved in reference to the Queensland distribution - I give that assurance in absolute good conscience. told the Prime Minister that I would fight the proposal on the floor of the House, and only there, and so impressed were honourable members with the case that I made out that they voted with me.",48
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,They were impressed with the idea that they ought to give the honourable member a vote.,48
322,Mr BAMFORD,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I thank the honourable member for the interjection, and am sorry that he did not give me his vote. I have suggested previously, and say again, that the best method of distributing the electoral divisions of a State would be for the representatives of that State to meet and settle the matter in conclave. No parthe ticular party would obtain any advantage by that method. Each member concerned would take care that the interests of the division which he represented were conserved, and whatever was done would result in no detriment to future candidates. The party opposite is now following the example of the Labour party in taking a plebiscite in regard to candidates. That is going on in Victoria today.",48
323,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member must confine himself to the question.,48
324,Mr BAMFORD,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I bow to your ruling, sir, being one of the most submissive men in the House in that regard. The honourable member for Swan left it to be inferred that the honourable member for Coolgardie and myself have not studied the best, interests of the country. I say that we have, anJ for this reason : When a member who represents a majority of the electors who voted in his division speaks in this House in defence of their interests, he is consulting the interests of the country. There are on the other side a few members who were returned by minorities",48
325,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member is not confining himself to the question.,48
326,Mr BAMFORD,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The honourable member for Swan suggested that the honourable member for Coolgardie has taken up an attitude, and advocated a course, which is not in the interests of the country. I say that that is not so. When a minority of a minority says that such and such a thing should be done, the member representing the majority is within his rights in asserting that the interest of the majority should be studied; and the honourable member for Coolgardie is perfectly justified in saying that in the interest of the majority the electoral divisions of I Western Australia should be redistributed. Whatever the Leader of the Opposition says is said in the most courteous way, though on most occasions he takes the wrong position; but in the speech which he just made he was guilty of hair-splitting. He states that the course proposed is not in accordance with the Act; but he is not consistent, because on a previous occasion he voted for a course which was not in accordance with the Act. The honourable member for Darling Downs has also complained that the Act is not being followed, but on a previous occasion he was indifferent to that. The legal mind sees both sides of a case, but presents at any one time only that side which it then suits it to present, and later puts forward with equal logic the other side. The position of the honourable member for Coolgardie is reasonable and justifiable. He is acting in the best interests of the country, because he is acting on behalf of a majority of the electors who voted in the division which he represents, and the party to which he belongs represents a majority of the electors of the whole country. I hope that the House will vote with him as they voted with me on another occasion.",48

329,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member for Herbert was allowed to refer to what I said.,49

331,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Then I understand that I am not to refer to what he said. I submit that the House has no power to make suggestions to the Commissioners. The law is that if either House of the Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may ask the Commissioners to propose a fresh, distribution. I cannot understand why an amendment should be proposed which is in. contravention 'of the Act. Honourable - members can see the inconvenience of this procedure. We could all make suggestions. I could move that such and such a State electorate should be left out or included; another honourable membercould move something else. But we should then each be attempting to dictate to the Commissioners as to how they should carry out their duties: I hope that no attempt of the sort will be made. Let us act up to the law in any case, and if we do not approve of the proposed distribution, let us negative the motion moved by the Minister, and let him take the course prescribed by the law. The law provides that in such an eventThe Commissioners shall, thereupon reconsider the matter, and forthwith propose a fresh distribution. That is straightforward. I do not know why the honourable member for Coolgardie desires to take two State electorates out of the green-Kalgoorlie-and put them into the red-Dampier-are a on the map. As for community of interest, there is no doubt about it that Kalgoorlie, Mount Margaret, Lawlers, and all these mining districts to the south have community of interest with Cue and Mount Magnet. As for means of communication, the law does not prescribe that it must be railway communication. There is road and telegraphic communication, and therefore there are"", means of communication. I submit that in this matter the electoral law has been, properly 'complied with by the Commis-, sioners. I submit further that the arrange-^ ment"" which they propose is completely within the law. . The provision as to community of interest has been . adhered to as well as it can. be; whilst also the provision as to. means of. communication has been complied with, because there are roads and telegraphs between the places. There are no railways north of Meekatharra right away. up. to Wyndham. Therefore, it may be argued that there is no communication, say, between the Murchison and the Gascoyne. There are certainly no means of communication by rail between the Murchison electoral district, which is a mining and pastoral district, and the Gascoyne to the north. But there are means of communication by road between Cue and Mount Magnet and the northern parts of Western Australia. How can honourable members opposite say, as has been said by the honourable member for Gippsland, that the distribution is illegal? The quota is 30,391. There is an allowable margin'with a maximumof 36,469, and a minimum of. 24..3I3",49

333,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I am trying to argue that this scheme of distribution should not be sent back to the Commissioners.,50
334,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The right honourable member started off by saying that he' was going to reply to the honourable member for Gippslandi The right honourable member had that opportunity when speaking to the main question. .,50
335,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The honourable member for Gippsland spoke after me, so that I had no opportunity of replying to him.",50
336,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The right honourable member is quite right as to that, but he was referring entirely to the main question. He must not debate the main question now, but confine himself to the amendment.",50
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member for Gippsland spoke of the question of illegality.,50
338,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The right honourable member must not reply to these arguments now.,50
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I rise to order. I submit that the very question which the 'honourable member for Gippsland raised, and to"" which the right honourable member for Swan was referring, is involved in the very terms of the amendment - If the amendment is to be discussed at all, the question raised' by' the honourable member for Gippsalnd must be discussed. -'- Mr SPEAKER - A practice has grown up in this House which was laid down by' Mr Speaker 'Holder, namely, that when an amendment was moved honourable members were allowed to speak upon it and upon the main question. Personally, I did hot approve of that ruling. I thought that when an amendment was moved an honourable member should speak to that amendment, and to nothing else until it was disposed of. However, the practice which I have mentioned has gi-own up, and when I was elected Speaker. I followed the ruling set by my predecessor. The right honourable member for Swan has already spoken on the main question. The honourable member for Gippsland spoke on the main question this afternoon. Now the right honourable member for Swan desires, in speaking to the amendment, to reply to something said by the honourable member for Gippsland on the main question. If I permitted that, it will be seen that the right honourable member for Swan would be allowed to make two speeches on the main question, whereas he.is only entitled to make bne. Under these circumstances I rule that the right honourable member must confine himself strictly to the amendment.",50
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I shall not reply to the honourable member for Gippsland further, but will deal with the matter in my own way.",50
341,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The right honourable member must confine himself to the amendment before the Chair.,50
342,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The amendment covers the entire question. It could hot be wider.,50
343,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"If I am out of order. I shall obey the ruling of Mrl Speaker. I cannot understand how it can be argued that this distribution is illegal-. That quota, as I have said, is 30,391.",50
344,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Order! The question of legality has nothing to do with the amendment.,50
345,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Do you rule, sir, that I cannot discuss that point?",50
346,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The right honourable member must not touch that point. Sir . JOHN FORREST - Ver y well, sir; that is a very good .thing for the honourable member for Gippsland, because' I should demolish his arguments if I were permitted -. Shall I be in .order in quoting what honourable members opposite have said on previous occasions .in regard to the redistribution of seats?",50
347,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I must wait until T hear what the right honourable member wishes, to. say -: ..",50
348,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I wish to quote from a speech by the honourable member for Gwydir on the 23rd November, 1909. He saidHas it come to this-that in the National Parliament a question of this kind is to be determined by the political necessities of tea individual member? If this sort of thing is permitted there is nothing in American politicswhich we shall not be capable of by-and-by if the present Government remain in power. The honourable member was referring to a previous Government. That Government is not in power at the present time. But the honourable member for Gwydir is still a member of this .House, and I am very anxious to see how he will act on the present occasion. I am anxious to see whether he will vote in such a way as to assist "" the political necessities of an individual member."" I also wish to quote in regard to this matter the views of the Prime Minister. He said, in 1909I do say that the Government should have's policy in the matter. Again, trie right honourable ""gentleman - saidNo charge whatever has been made against the capacity or integrity of the Commissioner to whom was intrusted one of the most responsible duties, if not the most responsible, with which a citizen of the Commonwealth could - be charged, that of distributing the electors into such groups that they will as nearly as possible be represented in this House on the same basis. Surely those remarks are applicable to this present case. The Prime Minister went on to sayI wish to say in the plainest possible language that the members of a Government who lend themselves to that kind of thing are unfit to occupy the positions they hold, because an attempt to manipulate electorates and to take the work of electoral distribution .out of the hands of the responsible officers appointed for the purpose is about the nearest approach to political corruption. I want to know whether the right honourable gentleman will say that in this House today to those who are not voting with him on the present occasion, but who generally support him. I think the time has arrived when he .should say so, if he believes in the sentiments which he so eloquently expressed on that occasion.",50
349,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The Prime Minister's words did not alter the right honourable member's vote on that occasion.,51
350,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"What has that to do with it ? The Minister of Trade and Customs is fond of interjecting things which have nothing to do with the case. The Prime Minister said alsoI tell the country that no question has been more canvassed quietly in this House than the possibility of blocking this proposal. I regret it. I do not think such proceedings are correct. The Prime Minister said that when he was in Opposition. Now he leads a Government, and he is as silent as the Sphynx. He was foremost while in Opposition in denouncing what he thought was wrong, but he is as dumb as if he were "" wrapt in the cold embrace of the tomb,"" on a similar occasion when he is in office.",51
351,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"This is all relevant to the amendment, I suppose?",51
352,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The honourable member for Coolgardie does not like it, but he is not master here. ' I can only say in conclusion that in adversely criticising honourable members opposite I am not influenced by any personal motives.",51
353,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Order! Will the right honourable member confine himself to the question before the Chair? Sir JOHN FlORREST - I hope I am doing so. I am quite content that the distribution of electorates should be left to the three upright, and competent Commissioners who have been appointed. If this proposal is reiected, I have every confidence that those gentlemen will again deal with the subject hi a proper manner, and I am quite sure that I shall not object to whatever they propose, whether it suits me personally or whether it does not. I hope, too, that public opinion will be aroused by this debate.",51
354,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Order ! Will the right honourable member confine himself to the matter before the Chair ?,51
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Yes , sir. I hope, also, that parliamentary control over the work of arranging the boundaries of electorates will soon be swept away. This system, of which we have had experience in this House during the last ten years or so, has completely broken down. VVe want a better system, a strong tribunal to do this work, whose decision shall be final. I can only say that I am quite content to leave the matter to the House, though I think that it is, as a tribunal, about as bad an one as it is possible to devise. If honourable members like to send this scheme back to the Commissioners, well and good; they themselves know nothing about it. I am in the position of knowing something about the position, and so do the honourable member for Coolgardie and the other members from Western Australia, but other members do not.",51
356,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I know what the right honourable member's game is, too.",51
357,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,What is it then?,51
358,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I will tell the House presently.,51
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I shall be very glad to hear the honourable member. I have no ""game"" that is not straightforward. The honourable member's ""game"" is quite apparent.",51
360,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The right honourable member's game is not only quite apparent, it is transparent.",51
361,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I represent in this House 18,933 electors to the honourable member's 10,306. Therefore, from the point of view of the boundaries of this proposed electorate of Dampier, I have a better right to speak than an honourable member who only represents one-third of the electors I represent.",51
362,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The right honourable member never represented 18,000 voters in his life.",51
363,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"But they were there, and a large majority of those who voted, voted for me.",51
364,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The right honourable member did not represent them.,52
365,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The honourable member should not make such an astounding ancl incorrect statement. I fail to see why all this heat should be engendered. I have not the slightest personal feeling, but I have a duty to perform, and have endeavoured to perform it in a straightforward way without mincing matters. I have tried to perform it by seeking to throw some light on the motives and actions of the honourable member. If my statement is distasteful to him I regret it, but cannot help it.",52
366,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I shall throw some light on the right honourable member's actions.,52
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Why does not the honourable member do it? He has been talking on occasions in this way for the last twenty years, but has not done anything. I have no desire, however, to come into conflict with him, for I know that he is very bitter in conflict and controversy. If our interests clash, as they must clash in this matter, being on opposite sides, let us at least deal with the question from a public stand-point.",52
368,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Why does not the right honourable member go for his birth place?,52
369,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Perhaps the honourable member, being opposed to me politically, will tell me what else I ought to do.",52
370,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I am simply asking for information.,52

374,Mr WISE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Gippsland) [8.48] - The objection has been raised by honourable members of the Opposition that the amendment, if carried, will not express disapproval of the scheme as laid before the House. To overcome that difficulty, I propose to move That the amendment be amended by inserting after the word "" be,"" line 4, the words "" disapproved of and"" be inserted.",52
375,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,= 1 suggest to the honourable member that he should not move his proposed amendment of the amendment until the House has dealt with the question that certain words be left out.,52
376,Mr WISE,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Ver y well, sir.",52
377,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Coolgardie) [8.50] - The right honourable member for Swan has succeeded in getting in three speeches on this question. The first he made on Tuesday last; the second, in which he largely repeated himself, was made this afternoon; and the third, on the amendment now before us, he has just concluded. He has set us such an example in this respect that, eminent though he is in so many spheres, I hesitate to imitate him. Whilst intending to confine my remarks as closely as possible to the amendment, I hope, Mr. Speaker, that you will allow me, at least, by way of personal explanation, to make some reference to the charges which the right honourable member has made against me. Let me say, first of all, that the amendment to my mind is entirely relevant, since the people of Mount Magnet and Cue have distinctly asked that they should not be included in the "" D "" Division. They are the people who are affected by this proposed distribution, and from them the original protest came. That being so, I may be allowed to show why they should not be included in this division. In the first place, they are very remote from the electoral centre to which, under the scheme, they are to be united. They have always been associated, both in State and Federal politics, with the adjacent port of Geraldton, with which they have direct communication by rail. In none of the right honourable member's orations has he attempted to show that there was any community of interest between the people of Cue and Mount Magnet and those of the far distant city of Kalgoorlie. Nor has he attempted to deal with the important fact that if an elector in those districts wished' to visit the electoral centre, he would have to travel 1,900 miles, and to use not one, but three lines of railway.",52
378,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Ro w far would the people of Pilbarra have to travel in order to reach their electoral centre?,52
379,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The right honourable member, in his interjection, is ignoring the important fact that, as Premier of the State of Western Australia, he united with the adjacent port of Geraidton the two districts which he now wishes to join with Kalgoorlie. The interests of the people of those districts are identical with the interests of the people in another division, from which they have been separated by this distribution. They have no interest whatever, except that of common citizenship, with the people of Kalgoorlie; nor have they any direct connection by rail with that gold-field. They have identity of interest, however, with their immediate neighbours near Geraidton, and direct communication by rail with them, and they desire to be grouped in the division in which they have always been. The right honourable member for Swan today made several charges against me. The first of these was that I was endeavouring to gerrymander this electorate. I can, of course, afford to treat, with contempt such an unscrupulous charge.",52
380,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Order ! I called upon the right honourable member to withdraw the statement, and I ask the honourable member not torefer to it.",53
381,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I desire to show how utterly unfounded the right honourable member's observation was, because it is not in my power or in the power of this House to gerrymander any electorate. If we decide not accept this scheme it - will simply be referred back to the Commissioners, who can then deal with it again as they please. Such a charge comes - with ill grace- - : - Mr. JOSEPH COOK -- I rise to You ruled just now, Mr Speaker, that the right honourable member for Swan could not refer to anything covered by the main question. Surely the same ruling must apply in this case. The honourable member for Coolgardie is trying to refer to something that took place during the - discussion of the motion.",53
382,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"If the honourable member for Coolgardie is referring to a statement made by the right honourable member for Swan when speaking to the main question, he is certainly out of order in doing so.",53
383,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I have so far strictly confined my remarks to the amendment. - Mr. JOSEPH-COOK - No .,53
384,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member for Parramatta was unjust,53
385,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Order !,53
386,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,When he connived,53
387,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,The honourable member must not use those expressions.,53
388,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I wish only to say that the honourable member for Parramatta remained silent while the right honourable member for Swan was speaking in direct contravention of your ruling, Mr Speaker This charge which the right honourable member has levelled against me comes with an ill grace from the "" K r u g e r "" of Western Australia, who for years kept the residents of the gold-fields without presentation in the State Parliament. Mr ' SPEAKER - The honourable member must not follow that line of argument.",53
389,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I have no wish to transgress the rules of> the House. I would point out, however, that the right honourable member for Swan had the unparalleled audacity today to quote the words of a great Australian",53

392,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"No . The remarks to which I am now replying were made by order. the right honourable member for Swan whilst he was speaking to the amendment. It is a piece of his usual audacity, that-, in order to support his case, he should have quoted the words of a great Australian whom he helped into his coffin. That is all I desire to say in. that regard.",53
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Mr Speaker,- I am disinclined to interrupt the honourable member; but I think that he ought to be called upon to withdraw his statement and to apologize. He has no right to make the monstrous charge that I helped to put into his coffin an old and valued friend-of mine with whom I was on the most confidential and friendly teims up to the day of his death.",53
394,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Order- ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw the remark.,53
395,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I withdraw the remark, and I regret that I was led by the right - honourable member's bad example into making such an observation'. The legality of the action of the Commissioners has been raised to-night. What I propose to say in respect to this phase of the question is absolutely relevant to the amendment before the Chair. The argument used was that the Commissioners did not outstep the law - so long as they observed the margin of 'allowance. That direction is the last, and not the first, given by the Act to the Commissioners.",53
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I was debarred', any resir, from touching upon that point ",53
397,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Order !,53
398,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I should like to point 1 'out that the direction as to' the margin bf allowance is second to that in regard to community of interest, means of communication, as well as to the quota. It is only after those paramount statutory requirements have been observed, and every other expedient exhausted, that the"" Commissioners are entitled to f all back upon the margin of allowance. I would draw the attention of the legal members of the House to the subsidiary place occupied by the phrase ""margin of allowance"" in section 16, and which, I think, proves my contention. The Commissioners read the Act as if this provision as to margin of allowance were a general direction to be followed indiscriminately. This is shown by paragraph 2 of their report, where they refer to the ""margin of allowance"" and are silent regarding the more important statutory directions. The provision as to margin of allowance was plainly intended to provide for exceptional cases. The words are prohibitive as well as permissive. The Act virtually tells the Commissioners to partition the State of Western Australia into five divisions, containing as nearly as practicable an equal number of actually enrolled voters. says, in effect, to them, "" Consider first of all whether diepeople you group together have community of interest; secondly, whether they have direct means of communication with one another, and when you. are Satisfied on these points, consider the quota - The quota you will obtain by dividing the total number of electors actually enrolled by the number of members to - be returned. If some obstacle not foreseen by Parliament prevents strict adherence to the quota, ,you may vary it ; but you are not to vary it by more than one-fifth on either side."" That is the answer to the contention that the Commissioners have not erred so long as they have remained within the margin of allowance. The provision as to the margin of allowance is subject to all the other considerations set out in section 16; and it is not until those are all met, and every expedient exhausted, that the Commissioners are entitled to f all back upon it. Then, again, the provision as to margin of allowance is only to be used "" whenever necessary."" That is the literal instruction given in the Act. The onus of proving the "" necessity "" is on the Commissioners. But they have not attempted to show that it was necessary to use .the margin of allowance so as to include, nearly 5,000 more voters in one division than in any of the others, nor that arfy exceptional circumstances exist which call for such an enormous variation from the existing quota. This is the first time in my experience that Electoral Commissioners have claimed to form divisions by prophetic inspiration. If these Commissioners may look ahead for eighteen months, and distribute the State into divisions, having regard to what they think will be the position of affairs at that time, we may have other Commissioners later on claiming to be able to look ahead for four or-five years.",53
399,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"There are over 4,000 more electors in one division in Victoria than in another.",54
400,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Victoria - is in a very different position from Western Australia. There is a settled' community in Victoria, and it is not difficult to reasonably anticipate the near future. But division D of the Western Australian divisions includes almost the whole of an auriferous area on which a gold-field may be discovered at any time, which would add thousands to the population of the district, and it includes also a portion of the - State where much of the work connected .,with the transcontiIt nental railway will have to be done, within the next twelve months. I do not wish to delay the House further. If I have hurt the feelings of the right honourable member for Swan, I did not intend to do so. The strong language which he occasionally permits himself to use, naturally arouses some antagonism in those whom he so violently attacks. But I cherish no animosity at all, and. I hope that whatever the decision of the House may be,' we shall be as good friends as ever.",54

402,Mr FOWL ER,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Perth) [ 9 . 4 ] - I wish to say a word in connection with the amendment. It includes the expression "" the Commissioners be requested to make a division on the basis of existing enrolment (and not by way of anticipation)."" This language is used to indicate that in the opinion of certain members of this House the proposed redistribution is illegal. That statement has been before the House for some time, and I wish to know from some member of the Government whether, in view of the serious nature of that statement, they have taken the trouble to inquire into it. If the Commissioners have acted illegally, it is only fair, that the Government should give them some intimation to that effect. If they have not done so it is only fair that they should be given to understandthat the. redistribution they have, proposed is quite within the letter pf .the law. I hope that before we go to a vote on the amendment, the Government will be able to give us some assurance that they Brennan, Frank have taken this matter into consideration, and have dealt with it.

AYES. NAVIGATION BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 19th July (vide page 1070), on motion by Mr TUDORThat this Bill be now read a second time.",54
403,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Angas) [9.15] - Com mendation is certainly due to the Minister for the exhaustive speech with which he introduced the measure, and to the honorNOES. able member for Kooyong for keen and elucidatory criticism that should, I think, be, on the whole, rather helpful to the Minister. What I have to say will, as' far as possible, keep clear of the ground coveredby the two preceding speakers. But the fact that we are the representatives of an island continent, some 14,000 miles distant from the island centre of an ocean Empire, dependent, in peace and war, for commerce and prosperity, on the sea, should PAIRS. stimulate our interest in the class with which this measure chiefly deals. It is comforting to remember that the legislation of the last twenty-five or thirty years, instead of being directed, as most of the legislation of the middle part of the last century was, towards strengthening the capitalistic interest, is now chiefly directedBennett, B. 'H. towards the comfort and general conditions of the men who man those vessels. If the great ocean Empire of which we are a part is to retain and maintain what is still its supremacy, not only in commerce but in defensive power, in reserve of defensive strength, it must be by making moreattractive for the men who should man our navies, the conditions of the mercantile AYES. marine. It is somewhat reassuring to findfrom one of the shipping returns in the Economist that, taking British battle-shipsand battle cruisers only for comparison with any possible combination against the Empire- I say possible combination, for we hope there never will be any occasion, for the gauntlet being thrown down by either side in these industrial times-and taking what is considered by the experts as the test of effective strength, namely. battle-ship tonnage, the British vessels total 938,655 tons, against the combined tonnage of the Triple Alliance of 664,761 tons. I find also-whic h is a matter that we should bear in mind in dealing with navigation-that in studying matters that required amendment in the British laws for the purpose of increasing the manning of the British Navy, the Board of Trade Committee, of 1903, saidWe think that an increase in the number of British seamen in the mercantile marine may be looked for rather in the improvement in their conditions than in the increase of facilities for training boys at sea. The ""improvement of conditions"" has been marked in the Act of 1906 in England, and, I believe, in the operation of it, with very great success.",55
404,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,I referred to that.,56
405,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"The Minister did; and I am pleased to notice that this view is supported by some statistics published about eighteen months ago by an authority on commercial and naval matters in the Old Country. The fact is, and we must all be conscious of it, that there is a movement abroad, more likely, to my mind, to be successful than any sudden and angry revolution in industrial and social affairs, towards a recognition p f the necessity for a full realization of the proper proportion between effective effort and reward; and if that happens to place on a higher plane of comfort and competence the men who for many generations have made us, in our romantic imaginings, masters of the deep, the world will, in the long run, be all the better for the change. Coming to the Bill, I think the chief end aimed at includes a fair standard of wages and conditions for oflicers and men, and I acknowledge that this may necessitate, to some extent, the protection, if I may call it so, of our coastal trade. We cannot allow the happier conditions of the last two or three years to be interfered with from outside, if protection against that interference is really necessary. To take only two figures by way of comparison, I find that the wages of Australian able seamen are now £& per month, as against £ 4 5s. for seamen on ocean-going vessels; while Australian firemen receive £ 1 0 per month, as against £ \ ios. and £ 5 paid to ocean-going firemen. The only question with me is: What is the volume and character of the competing vessels, and to what extent is the protection that we are introducing necessary to maintain die local conditions? I merely state the position, because, owing to the limitation of time, I do not propose [5i] to elaborate on it. So far, then, as regards the men who are to be our chief consideration. At the same time, we ought not to unduly hamper Australian vessels. If we do so, we may, to a large extent, diminish the wages fund out of which the seamen's wages are paid, and also diminish the possibility of meeting the fair demands the limits of which at present have not been reached. We must progress as we go on. The Bill, to a certain extent, is challenged by some on the ground that there is an unnecessary hampering- I merely state this criticism, which has been levelled against the measure-of some of the shipowners by the provisions in relation, for instance, to greater accommodation, on which the honourable member for Kooyong dwelt, more frequent surveys, lower loadlines and whiter load-lines all the year round for both local and external commerce, manning ana other matters I need hot mention. Four points mentioned by the honourable member for Kooyong had reference, I think, to manning, load-lines, survey, and wireless telegraphy; and these alone will involve, if carried into effect, an additional annual outlay for the ships covered by the Commonwealth Steam-ship Owners Association of ^11:1,000.",56
406,Mr FENTON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Is not wireless telegraphy a kind .of insurance for the shipping companies ?,56
407,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"To some extent it is; I am merely dealing with the conditions laid down in the Bill, which are much harder than the conditions under, for instance the United States Act. Subject to these prime conditions, which have one end in view, we ought to aim at Imperial uniformity in both law and operation. That was the object sought to be attained by the Navigation Conference of 1907; and I should like, if I may, to read the following from the despatch of the Honourable Alfred Lyttelton, dated 8th March, 1905, suggesting that Conference to considerThe legal and constitutional questions concerning the scope of the powers enjoyed by Colonial Legislatures under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894; and, secondly, the practical inconvenience arising from divergent legislation of the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and the Colonies. Those were two objects from the Imperial point of view. Three years afterwards. Earl Crewe in his despatch to the Governor General, Lord Dudley, dated 3rd September, 1908, said I trust that your Ministers will concur with me in thinking that legislation respecting vessels engaged in the intercolonial trade, which are not registered in the Commonwealth or in New Zealand, and which do not engage in the coasting trade of either colony, should be determined upon by mutual agreement between the Commonwealth, New Zealand, and His Majesty's Government, and should be passed by the Imperial Parliament. That was mutual agreement on what ought to be;-assumin g that we have fairly comprehensive powers for local purposes, as the Imperial Parliament has for Imperial purposes-the lines that both local and Imperial legislation ought to follow. The suggestion was that those lines should be embodied in an agreement to be passed by the Imperial Parliament, and capable of adoption or rejection by us. What does this mean to the Imperial Government ? I have looked up a few figures concerning our trade, and I shall put them before honourable members, again mentioning that Earl Crewe said in his September despatch of 1908But it will be apparent to your Ministers that His Majesty's Government's power qf negotiating will bedestroyed unless the self-governing Dominions and the United Kingdom have Ihe same standard for oversea shipping. And he points out- I shall not quote the document at lengthForeign countries might retaliate by requiring different standards of equipment registered in the Dominioa. More recently, in connection with the Imperial Conference, fears of retaliation against the United Kingdom were also expressed and dwelt on. There is no doubt that if retaliation is ever induced by any legislation of ours, the commerce of the Empire affords a magnificent target. This was admitted by the Times in writing upon the subject of Imperial Tariff Reciprocity, towards the consideration of which discussion I contributed in 1904. The writer in the Times says that if foreign Governments desired to retaliate "" by hitting at our shipping industry, it must be confessed that it offers a noble target."" That is the qualification of a writer supporting Imperial preference if his doctrines were to become matters of legislation. I am merely asking honourable members in all cases to consider whether it is worthwhile to indulge in the remedy, and if the remedy is likely to be effective. Last year the carrying tonnage of the world was, I think, about 33,000,000 tons. The figures for the United Kingdom are 11,556,000 tons-a pretty big tonnage for that little centre of a mighty Empire. The Colonies and Dependencies have 1,806,000 tons, not very far short of the tonnage of that great Power, Germany, which has 2,903,000 tons; so that about Mr Glynn. 34.3 per cent, of the world's tonnage belongs to the United Kingdom. The British tonnage cleared at foreign ports is more than double that of the foreign tonnage cleared at British ports; 54 per cent, of the Atlantic tonnage, and 29 per cent, of the European tonnage, are British. The British tonnage engaged in the trade of India, as to which Mr Harcourt put in a special plea in connection with this legislation at the last Conference, was 78 per cent.; in South Africa, 83 per cent.; in Australia, 74.9 per cent.; and in New Zealand, 96 per cent. So far as protection to British tonnage is concerned as regards New Zealand, it would seem to me to be almost wanton to do anything to induce retaliation. My request is that we should consider the effect of our restrictions, and the probable efficacy of the methods we adopt to give greater protection to our local trade, remembering always that the maintenance of Britain as a world Power depends upon her mercantile marine, of which the Imperial Navy is but the symbol of its strength; and, of course, as the telegram just mentioned states, is nothing more than a defensive assurance. One might almost say of Britain what Byron said of Venice, that she is "" a ruler of the for vessels waters, and their powers,"" and if her greatness as a world Power is ever to be impaired, I firmly believe that, depending as it does upon commerce, it will fall as it rose, with the merchant Navy. I might quote from what Mr Lloyd George said at the Imperial Conference of 1907 on the question of the coasting trade of the world, the figures for which I have here, and the extent to which we really have to fear competition, or that reciprocity is not granted or is granted. He pointed out that the bulk of the foreign shipping engaged in our Imperial trade is Norwegian and German, and that neither of these countries excludes us from the coasting or Imperial trade. We have had various proposals recently introduced for the protection of British ship-owners and producers, some of them at the last Conference. This was the tenor of one niotion which was proposed, and on being amended became the operative resolution on which the Empire Trade Commission has been appointed. I am not going to do more than mention that they are carrying out the policy declared by us in 1907, when the Royal Commission reported and asked that certain subjects should be submitted to the Imperial Government, amongst others the desirableness of extending preference to British ship-owners and British producers. It is in reference to these suggestions that my remarks up to the present time have been directed; but I would like to mention that without any preference of that character in our navigation laws, wages have risen a good deal within the last two or three years. When the recommendation was made in 1907 for this to become a matter for Imperial legislation, the seamen were getting £ 6 ios. a month, whereas now they get £ 8 ; while the firemen who were getting £ 8 ios. a month get now ,£10, without any of this class of preference. If we are to have uniformity it must be Imperial; and without that Imperial uniformity, we are told by the Ministers in the Old Country that they cannot do very much to extend the international reciprocity which has to some extent been the result of' negotiations since the Imperial Act of 1906 was passed. As regards the present position, I may say that there are Imperial powers, Dominion powers such as the Commonwealth and State powers, all of which more or less clash as a matter of scope and as a matter of operation; that the Home advisers take one view of our powers, that our local advisers on some points take another view, and that it can be clearly shown that neither of them is right, because I will prove that the Home advisers on some points are wrong. First, let me say a few words as to what are the probable powers of the Commonwealth under which we propose to pass this Bill. These powers must be derived either from the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 or from the Commonwealth Constitution, or from both. I am now dealing with the Commonwealth powers at present, and they are not exhaustive of the powers on this side of the world. When the Navigation Acts were repealed in 1849, according to some writers-includin g Mr Garran, I think we had power which was not restricted by any Imperial Act to deal with navigation that is within territorial limits. But, in -853, the Customs Consolidation Act reserved the coasting trade of British Dominions in Asia, Africa, and America for British vessels, and that imposed a restriction on our powers to deal with the coasting trade which was removed by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, and an Act of 1869. That Act contained a provision empowering us to repeal certain' provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act which otherwise extended to us, and, in 1869, we got power to deal with the coasting trade.",56
408,Mr RILEY,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Hav e we not power to specify in the Bill that British seamen only shall man the ships?,58
409,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Not to the extent that is taken in this Bill, as I shall endeavour to explain. The coasting trade power of 1869. which was re-enacted in the Act of 1894 by section 736, entitle us to regulate the coasting trade subject to certain conditions, namely, that the Act must be suspended for the Royal assent andcome into operation when it was proclaimed in the Possession; that all British ships were to be treated alike; and that the law was not to affect certain rights granted by treaties in existence prior to 1869, and only a few of which, I believe, still survive. These provisions were re-enacted, and are now sections 735 and 736 of the Act of 1894. Section 735 gives us power to repeal certain provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act in relation to ships registered in Australia; section 736 gives us power to regulate the coasting trade; whilst section 264 gives us power to apply to any British ship registered in, trading with, or being at any port in the Possession, any provisions of part II . of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 which would not otherwise apply. In other words, a complete code was framed by that Act. I am only dealing with the three main sections which affect us. We got, under section 735, power to repeal some provisions, under section 264 power to bring into operation other provisions which did not otherwise apply to us, and under section 736 power to regulate the coasting trade; but the point as to whether our regulation of the coasting trade could be extra-territorial or not before the Constitution is a matfer of doubt. Some of the writers for the Colonial Office and for the Board of Trade think that it had an extra-territorial operation, but that matter is somewhat doubtful, and is not material, because it is now affected, I believe, by covering clause 5 of the Constitution. I a|fe dealing with doubts, because I am going*to suggest difficulties we are in as regards our legislation. It is also doubtful to what extent we can supplement the British Merchant Shipping Act-to what extent Mr Keith says in his recent work and some of his late articles on the merchant shipping legislation, and Mr Garran dwells on the same matter-as long as our provisions are not inconsistent with provisions of Acts of Parliament extending to us expressly or by necessary intendment, legislating in the way we are given express power to do by the sections to which I have referred. It is also doubtful whether the Commonwealth is a British Possession within the meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, because, if it is not a British Possession, we cannot legislate under that Act. What can be said on that point ?",58
410,Mr RILEY,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,We can use our own legislation.,59
411,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I shall come in a minute to our other powers. I am dealing at present with one possible source of our power. What I want to prove is that we are in a bit of a fix, and that there is only one cure - som e arrangement with the Imperial Government as to the whole aim of our maritime power.",59
412,Mr MATHEWS,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,It opens up a peculiar phase if we are not a British Possession.,59
413,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"It is an important matter, and I am sure honourable members will excuse me if I refer in detail to what really is more law than matter of direct policy. What is the present law ? This is a matter which concerns, not only us, but the Imperial Government, and our policy may be affected by what are our probable powers. Section 18 of the Acts Interpretation Act of 1889, an Act of the Imperial Parlia' ment, governs the interpretation of the Merchant Shipping Act. It declares in regard to Dominions under a central Legislature that where part of such Dominions are under both a central and a local Legislature, all parts under the central Legislature shall for the purpose of this definition be deemed to be one Colony. This being a British Possession, it would appear that the States have no power, because we are the central authority; but I do not think that that is so. It seems clear that both are not likely to be British Possessions within the meaning of the Act, and there is a doubt on the point, because in the Kalibia v. Wilson case, Mr Justice Isaacs saidWhether the Commonwealth is a British possession for the purposes of section 775 is a' question I have not considered. When Mr Justice Isaacs says ^ a the has not. considered a question, but suggests that it may be a moot point, it is time to ascertain the meaning of "" British Possession "" in this regard. If we cannot supplement the legislative powers to which I have referred, being a British Possession, some of the provisions of the Bill are ultra vires, such provisions, for instance, as those of Part IV., which apply to all ships, British and foreign. Clause 190 says that all ships shall be liable to inspection and survey; and clause 196, to re-survey every six months; but section 271 of the Imperial Act does not provide for the yearly survey of non-passenger vessels.",59
414,Mr FENTON,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Does not the honourable member think that, in view of the recent Titanic disaster, the British Legislature will pass more strict and drastic legislation?",59
415,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I do not think that the Titanic disaster will affect what is done. A great deal of the newspaper criticism of the Board of Trade did not amount to much. The Board of Trade regulations were framed a few years ago, when %'essels did not exceed a maximum tonnage of 10,000 tons, but since then there has been a . very rapid increase of tonnage. There still exists great difference of opinion as to whether human life will not be better preserved by improving the methods of preventing vessels from sinking than by insisting on the provision of more boats. Our legislation may be repugnant to other provisions of the Act. Section 377 provides that a certificate cancelled in the Commonwealth and re-issued by the Board of Trade is not to have effect in the Commonwealth. That may be ultra vires. During the last few years the representations of the Board of Trade in regard to our proposals have been met to some extent. The New Zealand Bill of 1909, which I think did not receive the Royal assent before 1911, paid more heed than does this legislation to the principles which should operate in accordance with the Imperial suggestions, and the declaration' of the Imperial Conference of 1907 that our local laws should provide for vessels registered in the Commonwealth when trading therein, and for vessels wherever registered when trading on the coast, but not to foreign vessels not trading in the Commonwealth. The forty or forty-five original points of difference between the Commonwealth and the Board of Trade have, it has been stated by the Minister or by the honourable member for Kooyong, been reduced to eight or nine. There is still, however, divergence between our proposed legislation and the Board of Trade view. I have mentioned the different powers that operate. The Australian power is divided between the Commonwealth and the States. The Imperial law authorities have taken a view that is not on all points correct. Lord Crewe has stated that view in these words-^ Law oflicers and other distinguished lawyers advise that the Parliament has only powers of legislation so to override the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 as are given by sections 735 and 736 of that Act, and that the eifect of section 51 and section 98 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth is merely to confer upon the Commonwealth power of legislation in navigation matters paramount to that of the State Parliaments, but that these sections do not in any way extend the legislative power of the Commonwealth beyond the powers previously exercised by the State Legislatures. That is incorrect. The Commonwealth has not power to override the legislation of the State Parliaments in navigation matters within their own sphere, because this is not a concurrent power. The sections of the Constitution which are relevant to this discussion are 51 (1), 98, 39, - covering clause 5, and section 76 (3). Section 51 deals with trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States. section 98 the power of the Federal Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping. Section 39 deals with matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in either House thereof, or in the Government of the Commonwealth, or in the Federal Judicature, or in any Department or officer of the Commonwealth. Covering clause 5 says that the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force on all British ships whose first port of clearance and port of destination are in the Commonwealth. Section 76 deals with the judicial department of the Constitution. The Parliament may make laws conferring jurisdiction on the High.Court on any matter of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. As to the trade and commerce power in the Kalibia v. Wilson case, it has been decided that the Commonwealth power does not extend to the purely internal coasting trade. Some of the local text writers thought that it did ; but I had not much doubt about it. I was afraid that our Seamen's Compensation Act would not be valid, and, when dealing with the Judiciary Bill a year ago, threw out a hint that probably many of the provisions of the Navigation Bill would be found invalid for a similar reason, l t is a difficult matter to determine, and lawyers may honestly differ about it. the Court said was that section 98 does not enlarge the ambit of the commerce power, or do anything more than explain the meaning of the ""trade and commerce"" as applied to powers within that ambit; in other words, that ""trade and commerce"" includes navigation and shipping. In Canada navigation and shipping is a general power. So the Seamen's Compensation Act 1909 was declared invalid, because it dealt with both Intra-State and Inter-State trade. In the opinion of the majority of the High Court the provisions of the Act were not severable. I was Attorney-General at the time the measure was passed. It was quite right as originally drafted, and as it passed from my hands; but it was re-drafted afterwards, on a request to widen its scope, and it was thought that an opportunity for severance would be given by the Court. But there was a good deal of reasoning in the decision of the majority of the High Court that the provisions were not severable, and. of course, one must do his best ' in such matters. In the Under United States, Acts dealt with traffic on railways, and included provisions as to employers' liability and arbitration. The employers' liability provisions of the Act of 1906 were held to be invalid for the same reason as our Seamen's Compensation Act was held to be invalid, because it dealt with purely domestic or Intra-State trade, whilst the commerce power is Inter-State. Accordingly, the provisions were knocked out, and the Act was held to be not severable. In the following year, in the case of Adair v. United States, US.R. 208, at page 178, the Court said that if the provisions had been expressed in a detachable section, so that the Court might have severed diem, it would have been valid. That referred to employers' liability, which, of course, is cognate to our Seamen's Compensation Act, which, as honourable members are aware, dealt with employers' liability. So that, according to the United States decision, with which our High Court agreed, if you do under our Inter-State power pass an Act dealing purely with Inter-State trade, that Act is valid. The United States law, however, is different in respects from ours. Their power is wider than ours. Uncier their power to deal with external commerce, they have passed extra-territorial laws Lhat, I believe, would be beyond our powers. In the United States, it must be remembered, there is no superior Parliament outside What Congress. Therefore, from necessity, they were forced to deal with external commerce in a manner covering something more than our commerce power covered. But in the words case of Lord v. Goodall-Nelso n and Perkins, 102 US.R., p. 541-the Court, in effect, stated that the external commerce power extended to vessels engaged in the transportation of goods and passengers between ports or places in the same State, but part of whose course between ports was on the high seas. To quote from the case the Court saidTn every just sense she was, while on the ocean, engaged in commerce with foreign nations, and, as such,' she and the business was engaged in were subject to the regulating power of Congress. In addition, in the United States they have an Admiralty jurisdiction which we have not. There the Admiralty jurisdiction is both judicial and legislative. It extends to all transactions of a maritime nature navigable waters of the United States, well as those on the high seas. It does extend to inland lakes wholly within the tion. limits of a State and wholly unconnected with the navigable waters of the United States. In other words, it extends to any waters that, by themselves or by connection with other waters, form a channel of commerce between States, or with foreign counof Whatever tries ; but it does not extend to any waters purely within particular States, and which cannot become water-ways between States or of foreign countries. A writer on this subin ject, Willoughby, mentions thatThe Federal Admiralty jurisdiction being whollv independent of the power to regulate Tnter-State commerce, and attaching whenever the cause of action has arisen in navijrable waters, jurisdiction extends 'over all cases arisan ing in navigable waters, even though they be whollv within the confines of a particular State, provided that they be links in a chain of commercial communication between States. In Australia, the Admiralty power 'is not legislative. It is purelv judicial. not, at present, exercised by the Commonwealth at all. Our Hieh Court has no Admiralty jurisdiction. The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act T.890 invested British Possessions with .power fo declare any of their Courts Courts of Admiralty. power was exercised by all the States of Australia except New South Wales and Victoria; but I think New South Wales and Victoria came into line by Order in Council in May, 1911. So that now all the States have established Vice-Admiraltv Courts, all of which are. I think, connected with the Supreme Courts of the States But we as a Commonwealth-I believe I am correct in this-have not exercised our jurisdiction under section 76, sub-section 3, of the Constitution by vesting in any of our Federal Courts Admiralty jurisdiction. We can do so, and we can make the power exclusive. But we have done neither. Even if we did choose to invest a Federal Court with Admiralty jurisdiction, our power would only be judicial. What it might extend to in case we exercised the power Mr Glynn. would be subjects of this class-claim s for damages done or sustained by a ship; questions of title in cases of possession, salvage, &c.; claims for salvage and towage; claims she for necessaries to foreign ships; relations between officers and crews; wages under contract wholly or in part performed at sea; repairs and possibly insurance. What the law is within those limits, assuming the general maritime law to be the basis of the system, depends upon what has been received on as law in the usages of this country; and as I will give a quotation from the Kalibia not case on a question of Admiralty jurisdicI t was urged by counsel on one side that the Commonwealth Act of 1909 was valid. Mr Justice Barton, at page 704 of the report of the Kalibia case, summed the matter up in these wordsmight be the force of the reasoning those cases, if Australia were in the same position as the United States at the time of the making of their Constitution-namely , that a separated nation of independent sovereignty its relation to the United Kingdom-the reasoning has no force here, where the implication from imperative necessity cannot be drawn. The power to legislate on matters of Admiralty and maritime laws, if it existed in the several States at the time of Federation, remains reserved to them by force of section 107 of the Constitution. But there would be, and there is, over-riding power to legislate on the subject in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the grant in section 76, sub-section 3, cannot be construed as an implied transfer, or even delegation of that legislative power to the Parliament of the Commonwealth in respect of Australia. Such anargument, as will easily It is be seen, differs radically from that on which theAmerican cases were decided, for the necessity on which they are avowedly stated to be founded does not exist here. The power is merely given qua the restricted subject-matter to which it is in terms confined, namely, the confirmment of jurisdiction in a particular class That of controversies. That is a power which, as I have said, we have not yet exercised. I will make one other quotation from a law report, and that is from a Court of Appeal judgment on the question of what is English jurisdiction. In the case of the Queen v. Tke Judge of the City of London County Court - I . Queen's Bench, 1892, page 272-the judgment of Lord Esher saidMr Justice Story, whom I may venture to call an exceedingly great judge, in one of the most learned judgments which could be pronounced, went through every case which could be found anywhere from the earliest time, and he asserted for the Admiralty Court the largest jurisdiction which that Court had ever claimed. He held that in America, at all events, that Court had jurisdiction, not only over every tort committed on the high seas, but over every contract which is to be wholly or partly performed on the high seas. In that particular case he held that the Court of Admiralty had jurisdiction over a policy of insurance, and that a policy of insurance in respect of ships or goods could be enforced by it. It is undoubted that no such jurisdiction has ever been even attempted in England. Now, I do not think the judgment of Mr Justice Story has been adopted to any thing like its fullest extent even in America I am inclined to think that American Judges have since flinched from it, and that the can Courts do not attempt to exercise such a jurisdiction. But that judgment has been treated in one way only in this country. It has always been said that it is a departure by the American Courts with regard to the jurisdiction of the Admiralty from what has been held in England. I shall now pass on, simply stating that, in addition to the matters I have mentioned as falling within our legislative powers, under the heading of "" Admiralty,"" freedom of navigation between the States by connecting rivers might also, in the opinion of some, be covered by it. Covering clause 5 of the Constitution declares that our laws are to be in force on all British ships whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth. The High Court will probably soon determine what is a port of destination. The question has not yet been decided. It was raised in the case of the Merchant Shipping Guild v. Archibald Currie and Company, reported in 5 C.L.R., page 757, but was not decided. seamen concerned in that case were discharged, and the voyage ended, not in the Commonwealth, but in Calcutta, so that the case was decided on other grounds. In the action of the Merchant Shipping Guild v. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company and two other companies, which I need not mention-it is known as the Fiona case- a case was reserved by Mr Justice Higgins for the opinion of the High Court. After hearing arguments, the Court reserved its judgment, but intimated a few days ago that it desired that the matter should be reargued before the Full Court on the return, I suppose, of Mr Justice O'Connor. The question of what is a "" port of destination "" is, therefore, still undecided. The matter concerns us, inasmuch as we do not know whether a voyage commencing, say, in Sydney, and extending to the islands of the Pacific, to Auckland, and back again to Australia, with several intermediate clearances, would be within covering clause 5 of the Constitution as a voyage having its first port of clearance and its port of destination in Australia. In New Zealand, the question of our power-no t under a covering clause, because there is no such thing in connection with the New Zealand Constitution-to deal with similar conditions by arbitration was decided in the case of the award of the Wellington Cooks and Stewards Union, reported in 27 New Zealand Law Reports. In that case there was a majority decision based on different grounds; but I think that the Chief Justice of New Zealand decided that the legisAmeri- lative power of New Zealand-which , being a unitary State, has all the powers that the States and Commonwealth have here-in respect of navigation and all other - matters extended to ships registered in New Zealand, trading in New Zealand, and owned by New Zealand citizens; that a voyage such as that which I have just mentioned would fall within that power, and that the arbitration award held outside the territorial limits. That judgment has been questioned. It has been cited, I think, in the Fiona case, and it affords another instance of the want of uniformity* in the operation of the laws of the Empire. Let me shortly summarize, not what the law is, but what I think is the position as regards our power. First of all, the Merchant Shipping Act probably applies to the Commonwealth. If it does, we have power, under section 735 of the Act of 1894, to repeal wholly or in part any of the provisions of that Act, except those of Part III . , relating to emigrant ships, in respect of The ships registered in Australia. An Act repealing any of those provisions would have to be reserved for the Royal Assent; - and, assent being given, there would have to be a proclamation. We cannot, however, repeal any of the provisions hi respect of State-registered ships plying within the State sphere. That is an important matter. I may mention to the Minister of Trade and Customs that I do not think we have power to bind the ships of a State. I notice that there has been a telegram on the subject published in the press.",59
416,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,On what ground? On the ground that they are State instrumentalities ?,62
417,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Yes , possibly; apart altogether from the question of State registration. Secondly, if the Merchant Shipping Act applies, as I think it does, to the Commonwealth, we have power under it to regulate the coasting trade between State and State or in the territories of the Commonwealth.",62
418,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,Includin g Papua.,62
419,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"Yes . We have power to regulate the trade of, for instance, the Northern Territory, or the waters of the Territory, because our powers in respect of those waters are exclusive of those of ftamgation [REPRESENTATIVES.] the States. Our powers in this regard are subject to the equal treatment of all British ships, and to the privileges granted by treaties before 1869. That is the position under the Merchant Shipping Act. Laws so passed are extra territorial under covering clause 5 of the Constitution. I think that that covering clause applies to all our legislative powers wherever derived. Under section 264, we may apply any of the provisions of Part II. of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, which otherwise do not apply, "" to any British ships registered in, trading with, or being at any part of that possession."" That would have effect throughout the British Dominions. In other words, we have power to make extra-territorial laws for specific purposes. Then, again, the Constitution gives us power to make laws in respect of trade and commerce between the States and with other countries, and in the waters of territories. The question of what power arises as being incidental to external commerce is not clear, but my opinion is that our power probably ceases, for external commerce, outside territorial limits. Unless that be so, our legislation would clash with, the Imperial Acts, and w.e have to take that into account when considering the meaning of a doubtful section. The commerce power of the Constitution includes power to keep the waterways open and safe from any obstruction by the States or otherwise. It also includes power to improve them for navigation. I come now to the position of the States. They have power, I think, to regulate Intra-State trade, with no extra-territorial operation by Act. Some think there is of necessity an extra-territorial operation; I merely say that the matter is doubtful. An important point is that the power under the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 is not substantially affected by the Commonwealth Constitution. Which law is supreme, if they clash within respective spheres, is not necessarily determined by section 109 of the Constitution. That section provides that where there is a conflict between the law of a State and a law of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth law shall be supreme; but the important point is that the Commonwealth laws must be laws passed under the Constitution. On the passing of this Bill there will be an Imperial Act, the scope of which, in relation to Commonwealth and State legislation, is doubtful; a Commonwealth Act covering a limited external and a limited local field of jurisdiction; six State Acts Mr Glynn. BtU. different in territorial scope and provisions for territorial purposes; and, under section 264 of the Merchant Shipping Act, for extra-territorial purposes. Further, there will be in the Courts of the States, though there is not yet in the Commonwealth Courts, Admiralty and State Admiralty jurisdiction. We shall, in the operation of the measure, have a conflict with Imperial conditions, foreign conditions, and with New Zealand legislation, because their Acts do not dovetail into ours. For instance, a vessel coming from New Zealand in our coasting trade would be bound by arbitration awards and Australian rules under the Bill, and also by the rates under the New Zealand Act. The rates under the New Zealand Act may be higher or lower than ours, and the question will arise as to which are to be supreme within the territorial limits. Some provisions, such as section 291 of this Bill, as to an agreement to deduct excess that may be paid under local laws, when a vessel gets outside our territorial limits would be binding, probably, on Australian and New Zealand ships, but would not touch foreign ships. That is a very important matter. To sum up all, I recommend that we should consult the Imperial Government as regards the question of uniformity.",62
420,Mr RILEY,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,How long would it take us to get advice now?,63
421,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYES IN MECHANICAL,"I do not know. My time for dealing with the matter is limited. 1 might quote from Harrison Moore and several other writers on the subject, but I will conclude with a quotation from Keith, V o l . II . , page 1 2 1 1 It does not appear probable that the extension of the power of the Dominion Legislatures would by any means result in greater simplification in shipping matters. On the contrary, it would seem that further comparison would be inevitable if the powers of the Dominions are extended. What does seem desirable is' that some agreement should be come to between the Commonwealth and New Zealand with regard to conditions of shipping, and, if possible, some agreement with the United Kingdom. At present the existing legislative powers are tending to confusion and difficulty, and to add needlessly, and without corresponding advantage, to the problems of British shipping. All I can say is that that is the conclusion I formed from an independent study of the various powers, and that is the dictum of one of the ablest writers dealing with the powers of the Imperial Parliament in relation to the Dominions. Debate (on motion by Mr CARR) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.18 p.m.",63
