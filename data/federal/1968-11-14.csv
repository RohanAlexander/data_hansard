1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. J. Aston) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA",14
2,Mr BEATON,DECENTRALISATION,"I ask a question of Prime Minister. I preface it by saying that I have noted his Government's prediction that Australia will have a population of 28 million by the year 2000. Is the Prime Minister aware that on current trends 70% or more of that population will be crammed into the major capital cities? What tional and positive role, if any, does he for the Commonwealth Government in insurance scheme? seeking a more balanced development of population and industry in order to avoid this abnormal and costly concentration people in our capital cities?",14
3,Mr GORTON,DECENTRALISATION,"1 think it is generally recognised that not only in Australia but in countries generally there is a tendency for more and more people to go to the big centres of population. The Government has assisted and is assisting the development industries throughout Australia, particularly the new industries concerned with minerals and other such matters. It is also, as the honourable member might well know, practitioners. through the application of science in such fields as improved pastures and improved carrying capacity, taking such action as lead to a greater production from our arable acres, particularly in the north, which in turn will have its effect on the developsuch ment of Townsville, Darwin and other cities in the north. Mr Beaton-The trend is still continuing. What is the Government doing about it?",14
4,Mr GORTON,DECENTRALISATION,"I said that this is world-wide trend. The honourable member asks what the Government is doing action is being taken to establish population in other parts of the country. I have answered that question and have told the honourable member some of the things that have been done. In relation to the trend for people to go to the main centres of population, if people wish to live in such centres there is no way-no r should I think there would be a way-in which a governHouse, ment should seek to stop them from doing so. In this respect the Government has been providing, and will provide, to State governments sums of money which will enable them, and have enabled them, to cope with the problems that face Australia. This cannot be done as quickly as one would like, because we cannot have everything we want all at once. But, in general, the grants the have been improving year by year. NA",14
5,Mr ARTHUR,PHYSIOTHERAPY,"In view of the widespread use of physiotherapists, and their recognised healing value, will the Minister for Health consider including physiotherapy addiamong the items for which a Commonsee wealth benefit is provided under the health",14
6,Dr FORBES,PHYSIOTHERAPY,"Mr Speaker, the efforts of of the honourable gentleman in the interests of the health of his constituents are well known. I agree with his estimate of the value of physiotherapy. I point out that quite a number of medical benefits organisations pay a fund benefit in relation to physiotherapy. Therefore, their members do get some relief in that direction. So far as of a Commonwealth benefit is concerned, the Government to date has limited Commonwealth benefits under our health scheme to services rendered by registered medical One of the difficulties of extending the scheme to include physiotherapists would be that we could not concan sider this matter in isolation. We would need to consider services provided by dentists and also other para-medical services as optometry, home nursing and so on. The cost of this would probably be very great. However, I point out to the honourable gentleman that the particular matter that he has raised comes specifically within the terms of reference of the Nimmo Health Insurance Committee of Inquiry a and, as he knows, the Government has undertaken to consider the report of that or what inquiry when it is presented. NA NA",14
7,Mr COPE,AFFAIRS,"1 desire to ask the Acting Minister for External Affairs a question. Is it a fact that the Department of External Affairs is to rent portion of John MCEwen the Country Party headquarters at Canberra, at an annual rental exceeding $41,000? Is it also a fact that the value of this building, is $280000, so that the rental for a period of 7 years will pay off the perty? Would it not be more economical for the Department of External Affairs erect another building for its own use?",14
8,Mr FREETH,AFFAIRS,"The honourable gentleman has given in the form of a question, great deal of information the correctness of which I cannot vouch for at the moment. It is true that the Department of External Affairs will be taking a lease of portion John MCEwen House. The Department made its requirements known to the Departthink ment of the Interior. It was advised by Department of the Interior, which normally looks after the property requirements of Government departments, that these mises were available, that they were reasonThere ably adjacent to the existing offices of Department of External Affairs and rental was comparable with rental for similar office space in other parts of Canberra. In the circumstances, Ihe Department of External Affairs was quite happy to have the premises. NA",15
9,Mr STREET,EDUCATION,I direct a question to Minister for Education and Science. I refer to the Commonwealth grants for secondary school science blocks and libraries. Can Minister say what measures are being taken to ensure that science blocks and libraries for independent schools meet the requirefrom ments of his Department?,15
10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,EDUCATION,"There is an seas Australia wide standards committee comof posed of experts in both fields. There is one standards committee dealing with science laboratories project and another concerned with the libraries project. function of the standards committee is define the standards of the libraries or of deficits? the laboratories appropriate to schools. Members of the committee visit schools and, in relation to the science laboratories scheme, depending on the amount of science teaching at a school, they decide whether that school requires 1, 2, 3, 4 or more science laboratories and what the size of those laboratories should be. I believe that this scheme has worked very well. If school wants advice on any of these matters it can approach members of the standards committee. Schools can and do approach my Depart; proment. All the advice is freely given and freely available to them in a way that will to enable them to decide what they should do and to give proper instructions to their architects in the design stages. Quite recently it has come to my notice a that various private firms are trying lo get into the business of selling advice to schools and advising schools what the Commonwealth wiil approve in relation to science of laboratories or in relation to the library scheme which is now being introduced. I that this is probably quite unnecessary the because all the advice that schools would be able to obtain would be available quite freely from members of the standards compremittee or through my own Department. is certainly no need for them to buy the advice from any firm that might try to that the enter this particular field. NA NA  of the Treasurer. As the .right honourable gentleman, in his speech to the AustralianAmerican Association, - said that 'private the investment from North America in companies has been running in the region of $250m to $300m a year and we should the like to have more', and as he has also said that we must reduce our trading deficit with North America, by a reduction of imports the United States of America or by an increase of exports to that country, or both, I now ask: As capital iriflow or over: investment in Australia' consists mainly goods that flow to this country to meet deficits on trading operations does the right the honourable gentleman mean that he will promote the flow of capital to Australia if The he reduces the flow of goods or if he into some way eliminates Australia's trading",15
11,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,Order ! The honourable member's question is far too long.,15
12,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIA,"I think 1 understood the sense of what the honourable gentleman said: Did I think that if. 1 reduced the flow of capital to Australia, I. would promote the a sale of Australian goods to the United States? I cannot see the logical connection between those two factors. Nonetheless, in deference to the honourable gentleman I will closely examine, and have my officials examine, his statement, and then I will be able to give him a written reply about it. NA NA",15
13,Mr MAISEY,EARTHQUAKE,Will the Prime Minister give the highest priority to a favourable consideration-whe n a request is received - of the State Government's case for creased Commonwealth aid to people who have suffered serious loss as a result of disastrous earthquake in the Meckering area of Western Australia? Will he explore every avenue open to the Commonwealth Department of Housing with a view to ascertaining whether any constitutional means can be found to enable the Competition monwealth directly to enter this disaster area with Commonwealth funds on long term at a low interest rate to replace homes? May I add that the right honourable gentleman will appreciate that many of the homes of people in the farming community have been completely destroyed and that these people cannot leave their perties and live elsewhere as they have crops to harvest and stock to attend to.,16
14,Mr SPEAKER,EARTHQUAKE,Order ! The honourable member will come to his question.,16
15,Mr MAISEY,EARTHQUAKE,"Finally , will the Prime Minister, at the rising of this House at the end of this sessional period, endeavour to visit this area of Western Australia and of afford himself the opportunity of witnessing what must surely be two modern miracles: firstly, that there was no loss of life secondly, the magnificent spirit of these people?",16
16,Mr GORTON,EARTHQUAKE,"A request from the Western Australian Government in regard to this matter will, of course, receive urgent consideration. The honourable member will know that we have already provided a gift of $50,000 to the Western Australian Government, or to a fund which it has sponsored, for the relief of personal hardship. He will also know that we have provided sixty Army huts from Northam for shelter for those people who are in need. These are the only two requests that have been received from the Western Australian Government, and both of them have been met. I am afraid that I cannot undertake firmly to visit the area at the rising of this House at the end of this sessional period, but all reports which I have received on the matter testify to the magnificent spirit of the people in that area, and I am bound to say that to me that comes as no surprise. AUSTRALIA'S NATIONAL ANTHEM",16
17,Mr STEWART,EARTHQUAKE,"Is the Prime Minister inaware of the mounting criticism and discontent about Australia not having its own the national anthem? Considering the 180 years of our development as a nation and the approach of the 200th anniversary of the landing of Captain Cook on the shores of Botany Bay will the Prime Minister approve a Government-sponsored nationwide comfor the composition of an Australian national anthem, with the successful entry being introduced as our anthem restore and on Australia Day 1970?",16
18,Mr GORTON,EARTHQUAKE,"I am not prepared to say that in fact Australia does not have a national anthem of its own in that 'God proSave the Queen' when sung in Australia is a song which means 'God save the Queen of Australia' because this is the position in which she finds herself in Australia. Nevertheless, I have heard quite an amount of discussion as to whether there should be some change or alteration. All I would be prepared to say at the moment is that whatever the position may be, and whatever the views people may have as to the question a national anthem, there is in my mind at any rate no doubt whatever that we do have a national song which is known by Australians and which has been used in war and, and peace when Australians get together abroad and overseas. In my view this song is 'Waltzing Matilda'. NA",16
19,Mr BOSMAN,CIVIL AVIATION,"I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation a question. Has he observed a report of the proposed commencement of an air service between Darwin, Bali and Djakarta? I ask the honourable gentleman whether this is correct. Could he briefly indicate to me the effect of this on inter* national airline arrangements between Australia and Indonesia? Will it have any effect on the standardised international agreements on services 'that are generally regarded as being of a larger nature than this proposed service?",16
20,Mr SWARTZ,CIVIL AVIATION,"I did read in two Sydney newspapers a report that a service is to start between Darwin, Bali and Djakarta about the end of December. However, my Department has no knowledge of such a service. We have not yet received any application in relation to it and whilst I know there is an interest so far as Indonesia is concerned in having a link through that region, the only comment I can make at this stage is that if an application for a licence is made it will receive careful consideration. On the question of air service arrangeing ments, I wish to say that the most cordial relationship has existed between Indonesia and Australia for some years in the air services field. We have not had a formal agreement, and the position has been he covered annually by an exchange of letters. This is quite a satisfactory arrangement under existing conditions. But because of the anticipated increase in air traffic in part of the world, we have approached the Government of Indonesia to see whether we can arrange a formalised air service agreement. I am happy to say that in and Djakarta last week I was able to confirm with the Government of Indonesia arrangehave ments for negotiations to take place in for judgment. Melbourne in March next year. I am very hopeful that as a result of these negotiations we will sign a formal agreement with Indonesia. NA",17
21,Mr BARNARD,DEFENCE,I direct my question into the Prime Minister. I ask the right honourable gentleman: Will he tell the House whether he intends to make a statethat ment about Australia's defence planning before the end of the parliamentary session?,17
22,Mr GORTON,DEFENCE,I have every hope that we will be able to do that. NA,17
23,Dr MACKAY,HIGH COURT RULING,I direct my question to the Attorney-General. Has he received proposals from me with regard to measures to avoid undesirable extensions of a recent High Court ruling? Will he outline those proposals and consider the desirability of measures to implement them?,17
24,Mr BOWEN,HIGH COURT RULING,"I . have received some proposals from the honourable member for Evans. As they are recorded in yesterday's Hansard in a question that was disallowed, perhaps it is unnecessary to summarise them.",17
25,Mr SPEAKER,HIGH COURT RULING,Order! I warn the Minister that reference to disallowed questions would not be in order.,17
26,Mr BOWEN,HIGH COURT RULING,"I withdraw that part of my answer, Mr Speaker. As I understand it, the honourable member's proposal is that there should be no liability on a person givadvice unless the person seeking it notifies him at the time that he wiil place a special value on it or, to put it another way, unless the person seeking the advice brings to the attention of the person giving it that will place a legal reliance on the duty to take care. The ruling of the High Court is, of course, a ruling on the common law. It is a matter for each State to consider within this its own jurisdiction whether it would wish to alter or affect the common law within its own territory. The Commonwealth is concerned with the Australian Capital Territory the Northern Territory. 1 wili consider the honourable member's proposals when I had an opportunity to read the reasons As some concern has been expressed, perhaps I should add that I believe the High Court pointed out that this duty does not arise on social occasions. Furthermore, although a great deal of gratuitous advice is given from clay to day, very little of it is fact acted upon. Even where it is acted upon, only a small proportion of it is given negligently or without reasonable care. Of small proportion, only part leads to actual loss or damage. However, where there is damage a serious claim can be made and 1 think this warrants consideration of the honourable member's proposals. NA",17
27,Mr WHITLAM,PARIS EMBASSY,I ask the Prime Minister a question. Has the Government yet arranged to sell the property of the Department of External Affairs in Paris which has been empty for some 3 years and which had to be put up for sale because of its deficiencies in structure and as to security? What arrangements have been made for suitable accommodation of Australian delegates and advisers if the Vietnam talks in Paris require or justify their presence?,17
28,Mr GORTON,PARIS EMBASSY,I do not have in my mind the answer to the question as to whether the Department of External Affairs has disposed of the property it bought in Paris. I suggest that the question be put on notice or that I give the Leader of the Opposition a written reply.,18
29,Mr WHITLAM,PARIS EMBASSY,Will you give me a written reply?,18
30,Mr GORTON,PARIS EMBASSY,Ver y well. NA,18
31,Mr JARMAN,NATIONAL SERVICE,"I address my question to the Attorney-General. Has he seen a statement made to the Press by a young man in my electorate that he and another member of the Communist Party have distributed in secondary and technical schools 12,000 copies of a pamphlet advising young men not to register for national service and promising to hide them from the authorities? Is he aware that this man has stated that he knows the pamphlet is illegal under the National Service Act and is probably illegal under the Crimes Act but does not believe the Government will take any action? Has the Attorney-General knowledge as to whether in fact these men have broken the law and, if they have, is action likely to be taken?",18
32,Mr BOWEN,NATIONAL SERVICE,I have seen the report and I have read a copy of the pamphlet. The officers of my Department are at present examining the pamphlet ancl considering whether a prosecution is warranted. I can assure the House that if a prosecution is warranted it will be instituted. NA,18
33,Mr SCHOLES,MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY,"My question is directed to the Minister for Trade and Industry. Is he aware of statements by sections of the Australian motor vehicle industry that the share of the small car market of Australian manufacturers registered under plan A has fallen from 77% to 49%? If so, what action has the Government taken to halt this decline in view of the serious consequences that any extension of it would have on the future expansion of and employment in this industry? Mr Chaney- I rise to a point of order. There is a question on the notice paper relating to this matter.",18
34,Mr SPEAKER,MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY,Order ! What is the number of the question? Mr Chaney-It is question No. 925.,18
35,Mr SPEAKER,MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY,I rule that the question is in order.,18
36,Mr MCEWEN,MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY,"It is a fact, as I understand the situation, that problems warranting consideration are affecting the small car market. What may be regarded as the large car market is not in any trouble at all. These problems have been the subject of representations to me through my Department for some time, and there have been close consultations between officers of my Department ancl the industry. The matter is at present under urgent examination by the Department. NA",18
37,Mr ROBINSON,DEVALUATION COMPENSATION,"I preface my question, which is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry, by recalling that it is almost 12 months to the day since Britain devalued its currency. I recognise that the Government has made certain payments lo assist primary industries affected by devaluation, but what does the Government propose to do about the future financial losses which the affected primary industries are facing?",18
38,Mr ANTHONY,DEVALUATION COMPENSATION,"It is a pity that the honourable member has to remind me of that day. I think it is to the credit of the Government that during the past 12 months it has been able to look after primary industries which have been severely affected by devaluation and in which losses have been demonstrable and unavoidable. Up lo date the Government has committed itself to helping those industries in respect of immediate losses and postdevaluation losses to the extent of about $60m. The Government has already announced that it will look at the situaiion in the following year, but as yet no decision has been macle as to what its altitude will be. NA",18
39,Mr CALWELL,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE,"I ask the Minister for Air a question. Is it a fact that certain young Australian citizens who were born in Malta are not allowed to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force because Malta is not now a British colony, even though it is an independent country inside the Commonwealth and still recognises Her Majesty the Queen as the head of the Commonwealth? If a boy 18 years of age who came to Australia with his Maltese father, an ex-serviceman of World War II , 10 years before Malta became an independent country can be denied the right to enlist in the RAAF, what hope has this country of continuing to attract Maltese migrants? Will the Minister consult with his colleague the Minister for Immigration on this matter?",19
40,Mr FREETH,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE,I am afraid that I am not certain of the details of the matter in the right honourable gentleman's quesbe acceded to. tion. I will consult with the Minister for Immigration. Mr Calwell- I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the reports.,19
41,Mr FREETH,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE,I accept that. I will cerIs tainly have a look at the matter and see what can be clone. NA,19
42,Mr ANDREW JONES,FIAT MOTOR COMPANY,"Is the Minister for Trade and Industry aware that repremittee sentatives of the Fiat company are at present in Australia with a view to setting up $l£m manufacturing and process plant for four-cylinder and six-cylinder motor Treasurer vehicles in either New South Wales or South Australia? Is he aware that South Australia offers better facilities than New South Wales for such a project? Consequently, will he that South Australia receives the same accommodation as or better accommodation than New South Wales?",19
43,Mr MCEWEN,FIAT MOTOR COMPANY,I have heard that the Fiat company has under consideration the possibility of establishing itself in Australia. I doubt whether there are many more competent manufacturers of motor vehicles than the Fiat organisation. It would be very welcome here. I think I must leave it to the honourable member for Adelaide and his friends in South Australia to establish the claims about their State relative to another. NA,19
44,Mr DUTHIE,APPLE CIDER,"I address my question to you, Mr Speaker. Will you use your considerable influence to have Tasmanian apple cider made available to members and visitors in the dining rooms of Parliament House and also at official functions? If you concur in this practical way of assisting Tasmania's apple industry to increase the consumption of its products, will you make sure that non-alcoholic cider also is made available? I might mention that you have helped South Australia and northern Victoria in a similar manner with respect to the availability of their products in Parliament House.",19
45,Mr SPEAKER,APPLE CIDER,"I appreciate the qualities of Tasamian cider, although I am not so conversant with the alcoholic form of it. I will give consideration to the honourable raised member's request and see whether it can NA",19
46,Mr JEFF BATE,DROUGHT RELIEF,"I ask the Treasurer: it a fact that the South Coast of New South Wales was declared a drought area as far back as February and has been eligible for maximum drought relief loans from the Commonwealth and record rail and road freight subsidies from the State? Was the Bega Valley Drought Relief Comformed only recently when it was thought that a Federal general election was a imminent and after 9 months of severe drought and a very severe winter? Has the any information about the affiliations of those who organised the Committee and who are using it as a medium to attack Liberal and Country Party governments in see the Federal and State spheres, thereby restricting the farmers' willingness and determination lo make the maximum use of government assistance?",19
47,Mr MCMAHON,DROUGHT RELIEF,"As to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question, the New South Wales Government has been entitled to get the maximum assistance under the scheme which was terminated on 30th September. In other words, it was entitled to get help in relation to the maintenance expenses of primary producers and also to permit money to be made available for reconstruction. It was entitled also to subsidies in respect of port costs, and any commitments that had been made will be met by the Commonwealth Government. Since that date an agreement has been made between the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales that the Commonwealth Government will subsidise on a $1 for $1 basis assistance that might be given by that Government. This is a pretty generous measure. The honourable gentleman would know this because he has attended several meetings in the area in an attempt to show the appropriate method of obtaining State assistance and, consequently, Federal assistance. I understand- I think the facts will prove this to be correct-that the New South Wales Government has done all in its power to bring to the attention of the primary producers of the Bega Valley the way in which they can obtain assistance from the State Government. What the honourable gentleman said the second and last parts of his question true. It was only when it was thought Federal general election was imminent that the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee decided to take action, although it should have been aware that the appropriate means were already being adopted to give assisBlowering tance to the farmers. I think it would most regrettable if we were to make this political matter rather than give help those farmers who are so desperately in respect  former Deputy Leader of the New South Wales Labor Party, was closely identiMurray fied with the movement, as was a from former State and Federal President of salinity reduced. that Party. The appropriate thing for the honourable gentleman to do, since he knows the facts better than anyone, is to use procedures of the House in order to show, if he can- I think he can-that this was political movement or that it had a political motive, and let the House itself judge matter. WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT Gwydir NA",19
48,Mr WHITLAM,PROGRAMME,"I ask the Minister National Development a question which also arises from an attack made on the honourable gentleman's Government by a Liberal Party Minister of the New South made transWales Government. The honourable gentleman will have noticed that last weekend the New South Wales Minister for Conservation stated that although the national water resources development programme had been announced in November 1966 and the New South Wales proposals had been in the hands of the Commonwealth for 12 months, and some of them had been on the short list for the Commonwealth's consideration since May this year, the New South Wales Government still has not seen the colour of the Commonwealth's money. I ask: What are the reasons for the delay in making any money available to New South Wales under this two years old scheme? When may New South Wales expect to receive some money?",20
49,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PROGRAMME,"The New South Wales Government may not have seen the colour of any Commonwealth money in the national water resources development programme but it has seen the colour of a in considerable amount of Commonwealth is money for water conservation. New South that a Wales has already had $667m for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. It has had about $8m for flood mitigation in northern New South Wales. It has had a long term loan of about $22m for the Dam. Already some payments be have been made to Queensland from the a national water resources development proto gramme. Payments have been made also in of two projects in Victoria which will the assist New South Wales because they are designed to reduce the salinity of the River. New South Wales uses water the Murray and is..anxious to see the The two applications by New South the Wales under the national water resources development programme-^in relation to a the Booroorban scheme' and the Gwydir scheme-ar e being cipsely examined. the Interdepartmental committees have met on four occasions in the last two weeks. I expect to receive very soon a report on one of those projects. The work on the scheme is of such a nature that a considerable amount of information is still for required. For example, we have only recently received from the New South Wales Government the necessary information relating to soil tests which must be before one can assess the benefits likely to accrue from this scheme. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition would not expect the Commonwealth to make payments to the State under this programme before fully investigating the benefits and the costs involved. We have said that $50m will be made available to the States over five years. Only two years of that period have elapsed. We are doing our utmost to see that this work proceeds as. quickly as possible but we do not believe that decisions should be made before we have all the answers. NA",20
50,Mr HALLEIT,SHIPPING,"I ask the Minister for Shipping and Transport a question. I refer to the commencement of the overseas container shipping service early next year. Will the Minister say whether the shore facilities - will be completed on schedule? Will the first ships arrive at the port, of Fremantle? If so, will the Minister consider visiting the port on that occasion?",21
51,Mr SINCLAIR,SHIPPING,"I know that the honourable member for Canning has been particularly interested in developments in the port of Fremantle. Work on the port and other facilities is proceeding, as I understand the position, so that they will be able to service the container vessels when they commence operating early next year. The requirements are not just at the waterside; there are also necessary back-up facilities. The concept of a container service involves the complete transportation of cargoes from vendor to consumer and a minimising of the handling involved in trans-shipping goods from a vessel to some form of intermediate transport and in unloading the goods at their ultimate destination. The Australian Government, realising that this system is to commence next year, is very conscious of the necessity to ensure that Australian shippers and consumers share in any economies that may result from the new procedures. I think that ail of us are interested in seeing that these economies are achieved. I will certainly be most interested to see how these new facilities work not only at the port of Fremantle but also at other ports on the Australian coast. Whether or not I will be able to visit the port of Fremantle at the time of arrival of the first container vessel is a matter that I woulcl prefer to decide at some time a little closer to the expected time of arrival of the vessel. NA NA",21
52,Dr JF CAIRNS,COMMISSION,"I ask the Postmaster General: Did he last Tuesday answer a question as to whether pressure had been exerted on the Australian Broadcasting Commission with regard to the Bob Sanders programme 'People' by saying that there had been no pressures in relation to the determination of the contract of Bob Sanders with the ABC? Were the words 'in relation to the determination of the contract' chosen by htm or by the Chairman of the Commission to conceal that there had been pressures on the ABC by a Minister, backbenchers and the Australian Democratic Labor Party? If so, will he say what representations or communications were received from, or what influences were brought to bear by, such people, and will he discuss with the Chairman of the ABC methods that might be adopted to ensure that these pressures are made known to the public?",21
53,Mr HULME,COMMISSION,"I thought I indicated on Tuesday that the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission had stated to me categorically that there had been no pressures whatsoever, whether by Liberal Party members, by Australian Labor Party members or by Australian Democratic Labor Party members, or by members of the public or by anybody else if it is possible to find another category of person, in an attempt to exert any influence in relation to the termination of the contract between Sanders and the ABC. I pointed out to the House that Sanders was under a contract and that either party to a contract is entitled to indicate to the other party, as the contract draws towards its conclusion, whether he wishes it to be completely terminated. I am not quite sure that I understand the innuendo which the honourable member for Yarra makes in relation to this matter. I think it would be a hopeless position if the details of every discussion that I have with the various members of the authorities under my control were required to be made available to the House, just as it would be a hopeless position if any other member were required to make available details of similar discussions that he might have. I do not believe there is anything sinister in relation to the conclusion of this contract. If any honourable member has a suspicious mind he must live with it. NA NA",21
54,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PORTS FROM HAIPHONG,"My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. Is he concerned in any way whatsoever that Polish ships are presently in Australian ports-and more of them are to come-afte r proceeding here direct from Haiphong? As it is obvious from previous answers that the Minister considers these ships have an unfettered right of entry to Australian ports under the 1923 convention, can he say in which cases in recent years this right of entry has been abrogated and whether it is ever intended to deny it to other ships?",22
55,Mr SINCLAIR,PORTS FROM HAIPHONG,"As I have explained in previous answers in this House, the Australian Government, as a party to the 1923 convention, would need to take serious cognisance of the results of placing any embargo on ships from other nations plying to Australian ports. It is of concern that the conference system should be maintained, because the system is designed to provide an efficient service capable of moving the products of Australian industry when they are available, not only from the principal ports but from our outports and without picking the eyes out of the trade. Therefore it is of concern - to note that ships countries which are not members of the conferences are entering into the Australian trade. I understand that some countries have denied the right of access to ports to tradcraft ing vessels of nations with which they are not enjoying amicable relations. Of course, fishing vessels and ships of war are excluded from the terms of the treaty. For Australia to take the step that other nations have taken would create extreme difficulties, Australia in its role as a multilateral trader is dependent upon continued access to world markets. I would not like to comment at this stage on the position in the future. NA Civil Aviation-Australia n Institute of Urban Studies-Car e of Deaf ChildrenDrought Relief-Decentralisation Transfer of Commonwealth Departments to Canberra-Nationa l Service-Vietna m Question proposed: That grievances be noted:",22
56,Mr DEVINE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"East Sydney) [11.17]- I rise to express what I believe to be a genuine grievance by the parents of a boy who was killed in an air disaster at Tennant Creek in 1966. I am aware that this accident happened over 2 years ago but I believe that because of the concern of the parents of this young fellow it is just to raise the matter here. Since the disaster the parents have travelled around Australia interviewing many of the relations of - other people who were involved in the accident. As a result of their investigations they have obtained some startling information that I think should be aired in the National Parliament. Their investigations reveal that the Department of Civil Aviation has not been effectively policing the air navigation regulations and that it has been lax in its checks on pilots ancl air crew and in respect of other matters appertaining to aircraft. 1 raise these matters so that members of the ; Parliament will be aware of the situation that exists. On numerous occasions I have referred to the laxity of the Department of Civil Aviation in not policing regulations in respect of commercial aircraft. The matter I now raise concerns small companies that are engaged in aerial surveys and in Hying around Australia. The aircraft involved in from the accident at Tennant Creek was a Hudson bomber. Honourable members can imagine its age, but such aircraft are still being certified to fly ih Australia and to undertake certain work. The accident to which I refer involved six people. The airhad been out on a survey. It was coming into land. It made a circuit over the airport and was about to make its approach run when the crash occurred. The aircraft had flown over the airport at 9 o'clock in the morning and made its turn to come in as to land. Nobody at the airport or at Tennant Creek thought of asking where the aircraft was for about an hour. Then it was decided that those concerned would have a look to see where the aircraft was. It was found within three-quarters of a mile of the aerodrome. It had crashed, but nobody had seen the crash or taken much notice of the aircraft. This indicates to me that the Department of Civil Aviation ofncials at the airport or those who were in charge of the airport at this stage were either relaxing or were not concerned about the aircraft and did not worry about something having gone amiss. The unfortunate part of this accident is that six people were killed. In the aircraft four seats were provided but there were only three safety belts. There were six people in the aircraft with three safety bells. The Department of Civil Aviation must have known that there were only three safety belts because it giants certificates of airworthiness to aircraft. The report of the coroner following the accident reveals that the bodies of two of the people killed in the crash were thrown out of the aircraft. Those killed in this fashion were an 11-year-old boy and the son of the parents to whom I am referring. One person had been thrown against a tree and another was under a wing. The others died inside the aircraft. I say that here was a case where not suflicient safety belts were provided in the aircraft. I want to say a few words about the pilot of ihis aircraft. I do not think he to have been allowed lo fly or that he should have been given permission to fly by the Department of Civil Aviation. His record shows that he was in ill health over a considerable period. His previous history revealed that be was employed by Air France. Because he suffered from vertigo, which is a form of giddiness, Air France severed its relations with him. He came to Australia and was employed by the Adastra company. He was carrying people in this aircraft for the company. Approximately 3 weeks prior lo the disaster he suffered a blackout at 15.000 feet. The Department of Civil Aviation knew this quite well. It was classified. But he was allowed to take the aircraft up again. We know what happened. When we look at the report from the Department of Civil Aviation on this accident we see that it shows that an investigation of the history of the pilot revealed that he hacl been in ill health for 9 months. This came out at an inquiry afler the accident. Why was not some sort of inquiry made into this matter prior to the accident? No doubt exists in my mind that many similar instances could be found in Australia today of people who cannot get positions with commercial airlines, because of the high health standards that are required, flying for smaller companies. I believe that even at the present time the company 1I have mentioned has a pilot flying its aircraft, doing survey work and carrying passengers, who has reached the ripe old age of 71. I am sure that many of us would not be prepared to fly in an aircraft the pilot of which was 71 years of age. But as our civil aviation regulations stand and because of the policy of the Department of Civil Aviation, this pilot is able to fly an aircraft. I feel that a greater check ought to be kept on the standard of health of pilots flying aircraft. The investigations that have been carried out over a period by the parents of the young fellow who was killed in this crash have revealed ihat the aircraft involved had a great run of unserviceability. For instance, props fell off the aircraft. The situation was such that 3 weeks prior to the disaster the pilot hacl sent a telegram from Tennant Creek to ihe company concerned asking who put the chock of wood in the wing of the aircraft. 1 do not know whether it was put there to stop the rattles or the ought shakes, but at least it was put there. A telegram was sent to the company but. to my knowledge, it was not answered. Also I am led ro believe rhat in August of the same year there was a mass walkout by employees of the company at Hall's Creek and also at Tennant Creek. They refused to fly the aircraft because they maintained that to do so would involve them in a great deal of risk. If these are the facts, I believe thai DCA should investigate them a great deal more than it has done so far. I think that DCA should take a little time to interview the lather of this young man who was killed, because he is a barrister and he has carried out an intensive investigation into many relevant questions concerning this accident. I want to say something about the coroner's inquiiy which was held into this accident. 1 see that, the Attorney-General (Mr Bowen) is sitting at the table. It appears that under Commonwealth legislation or ordinances evidence in these inquiries is not taken under oath. I believe that it ought to be taken under oath in such inquiries. Time does not permit me to speak for very long on this matter, but I point out that as soon as one engineer heard of the disaster he said: It has happened.' In other words, he was expecting a disaster to occur at any time. It did occur, and those were the words he uttered when he heard about it. This engineer was not called to give evidence at the coroner's inquiry. Within a couple of days of the disaster occurring he was transferred, very hurriedly I might say, to New Guinea, out of the range of the coroner. Although he could have given evidence at the coroner's inquiry, he was not called to do so. Also, the company and the relatives of those people who were killed in the disaster were not given representation at the coroner's inquiry, although the parent to whom I have referred requested that he be allowed representation.",22
57,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.  wish to make a plea on behalf of tralian Institute of Urban Studies for financial support to be provided by the Commonwealth Government. The institute that is a body composed of representatives from major governmental, private and professtudies sional bodies and groups involved in urban planning, lt was formed as a result of those chiefly responsible for the development cities having expressed a need for a to undertake studies on which their mendations and decisions must be made. These authorities and bodies found that they did not have the resources, funds and often the trained personnel on their staff to carry out the research they required, and theretations fore, major planning decisions were on inadequate studies or none at all. I refer the House to the fact that Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) appears to be Institute. cognisant of the need for city planning. In an article which appeared in the 'Australian' late in October 1968 he is reported to have this. addressed the eleventh congress of the International Union of Building Societies and Savings Associations in Sydney, which than 1,000 delegates from forty-five tries attended, and to have told the audience that it was part of their responsibility to foster a pleasing environment in cities they grew and as new ones were created order to maximise human potential, and that planners could do this with vision and forethought. Almost 82% of our national population lives in urban areas, and within those areas the greater part of our gross national product of $20,000m is produced each year. They house the whole of our government apparatus, as well as the decision making elements of the private sector of the economy. They accommodate nearly all our educational, social and cultural facilities. Their shortcomings as centres of production, administration and habitation are therefore of major concern to the whole nation. Every citizen and every enterprise is affected by obsolescence, congestion and inadequate service and amenities. Each year over $3,000m is spent on the development of Australia's towns and cities yet the amount spent on research into improving the efficiency and amenity of this urban development is meagre. Urban research in Australia is virtually limited to the modest I research effort of urban government the Ausagencies and universities. I am not proposing that the concepts are at present carried out in this sphere be taken over by any department of urban such as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) has put forward. I have pointed to the fact that the Institute has been of formed and that the Prime Minister body himself is well aware of the need for recomplanning in this direction. I now want to deal with the vitally urgent matter offinancefor the Institute. I understand that the Institute has made represen1 to the Prime Minister. By what the based honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Whittorn) has said, he, together with the honourable member for Moreton (Mr the Killen), is probably well aware of this Mr Killen- I support you completely in  more you would. 1 would imagine that the counhonourabte member has done the research which is necessary after the initial representations were made. The Institute, of course, as put very clear and cogent arguments to us in and I am pleased that the honourable member supports me. As I said, J understand that the Institute has made representations to the Prime Minister and honourable members. I am informed that the Government has been asked to provide $120,000 over 3 years for the institute's operating programme and §100,000 over 3 years for its research programme. That is not a great deal of money. The latter sum is to be matched $1 for Si from other sources. The Chairman of the Victorian group committee of the Institute advised me in a letter dated 2nd October 1968 that private enterprise has given or promised more than $65,000 over the first 3 years of the Institute's operations and all six State Governments have promised a total of more than $45,000. provided the Commonwealth also contributes. Thus more than $100,000 has been promised to match SI for $1 the $100,000 requested from the Commonwealth for research. Unquestionably therefore, the funds from the Commonwealth are vital to the future of the Institute. Without them there will be no State funds; nor can funds from philanthropic bodies be expected. So I strongly urge the Government to make the requested funds available to the Institute. Perhaps I should add in conclusion that the Institute comprises .100 elected and nominated members who are leading persons in the community and are serving in an honorary capacity. These people are representative of all main interests in urban affairs and research in Australia. The board of management has appointed a full time director and has embarked on a programme of needed urban studies. The Institute's headquarters, I am advised, are located in Canberra and groups of council members and associate members have been established in each State-that answers the question put by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns)-to ensure that the problems of the principal Australian towns and cities will be watched at close quarters and that the studies promoted will be of real value to them. I am gratified with the remarks that have been made in passing during my address the honourable members that I have tioned before. 1 also notice that the honourrecognition able member for Robertson (Mr Bridgesduce, Maxwell) indicates his support for the proposal. So, if I may, on behalf of those honourable members and the Institute. I urge the Government to give very real and close attention to the - representations that have been made to it by honourable members and by the Institute in the hope that the financial support desired and needed will be forthcoming.",24
58,Mr IRWIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mitchell) [11.34]-My address this morning is headed: The Deaf are denied, despised, neglected and rejected by society. There is no area today more neglected by church or State than the education of handicapped children. In the following statement. I am speaking about only one group of these handicapped children-the profoundly deaf and born deaf children. I affirm that in this year of 1968 with so much advance-swif t and radicaland so much concern for education generally, the plight of these children is no better than it was 25-years ago. In fact the gap between them and society is getting bigger. Theirs is not the society you and I know; nor is it the society that other physically handicapped children enjoy. Behind ali the facade of covering up, behind the morass' of ideologies and philosophies and methods, we come face to face with children-childre n who have never heard a human voice, but whose birth right it is to receive equal opportunities for social development that is the birth right of every child. This is basically the problem. Society generally-and this must include all authorities within our society-harbour s the mistaken philosophy that time and money spent on the handicapped may be tolerated out of pity and benevolence. The question of human rights and dignity does not seem to enter their minds-Iha t education may be given them out of charity only, instead of realising it. is a matter of justice. Education is for children and the purpose of education is the same for all children. Until this is recognised there can be no thought of raising the standard of deaf adulthood; we will continue to offend the dignity of deaf children and from our schools we will continue to produce the unintelligible, the illiterate, the socially by withdrawn, the socially detached and the mensocially uncommitted deaf that lack of of this work forces us to prol f the deaf child were mentally retarded we would be justified in saying: 'This child is capable only of third or fourth grade standard.' But the deaf are not mentally retarded. 1 repeat: 'Not mentally retarded.' This statement should be inserted in sayings of the week. Deaf children have normal intelligence and their speech organsare in no way defective. Everyone please comprehend that: their speech organs are in no way defective. There are 4 and 5-year-old children who have the potential for intelligible speech but who will never learn to speak because they are not being given the opportunity. Our deaf are failing to achieve a fraction of their potential because administrators and authorities have failed them and continue this day to fail them and fail them badly. This is not done wilfully but is due to a lack of understanding of the problem. On an average, deaf children, al the age of 16, after 12 years at school attain a fourth grade standard and a 9 to 10 year old reading level. At St Joseph's School for the Deaf in St Louis, United States of America, 65 children over the past 7 years have gone from form II to form III and on to colleges for hearing children. I would like honourable members to note that 12 have gone on to university. Nothing like this has been achieved in Australia. An instructional programme for deaf children requires within the organisation assurance of equality of educational opportunities for all children. It also requires establishment of a structure of organisation which is realistic enough to be maintained and to include finance, recruitment of teachers, training of teachers, curriculum development and integration. There should also be reliable diagnostic and evaluation services; responsibility for a parent guidance scheme and pre-school instruction; nursery trained teachers; trained teachers in all classrooms, which is the accepted procedure in all schools; and adequate accepted classroom appointments. We should be doing many things, but there is one thing we must do. We must bring the aims and purposes of the education of the deaf into line with the goals for all education. We cannot continue to offer these children the crumbs and the dregs, saying in effect: 'This is good enough for you because you are handicapped.' Today the churches and the States are being asked to assume responsibility for the eduration of the deaf. They have gone as far as they can with the tools that are available to them. At this point in history, when parents, teachers and friends of the deaf want the children to achieve something of their potential, the present tools just will not do. Badly needed changes in the education of the deaf are essential. The same ideas und systems that have been in vogue for the past 40 years cannot be regarded as satisfactory today. Today the adult deaf citizens are withdrawn, detached and uncommitted to society, and the deaf children of today will develop in the same way unless radical changes are made, it just will not do to patch up here and there, lt will not do to attempt more than can be managed and it will not do to modify what already exists, if what we attempt to do is done as unprofessionally, as half-heartedly and as unfairly as the present efforts are. It is obvious from the facts I have given that this work cannot continue without finance. It should be obvious that the complexities of this special form of education are beyond the present organisation of church and State. A mild epidemic of German measles in New South Wales in 1965 caused deafness in more than 150 children who are now 3 years old. About 80 deaf children a year are born in New South Wales. The challenge the to cope with deaf children from the preschool stage through lo secondary schooling is colossal. The teachers of the deaf in both church and State schools are dedicated and are applying their knowledge and ability generously. But as the teachers from St Joseph's School in St Louis, who came to Australia earlier this year, have shown, deaf children taken in hand at a very early age can attain to secondary and tertiary education. This a cause that 1 espouse. Many schools for the deaf in and around Newcastle and Sydney deserve monetary support. I would like those people who may he hearing me today to support St Gabriel's School. I do not make this appeal because the school is in my electorate. It is concentrating on the St Louis system of teaching the deaf and requires a lot of money to bring teachers to Australia and to train teachers in Auslralia in this wonderful method of teaching the deaf so ihat the more intelligent of them can attain to some of the greatest and most responsible offices in our nation.",25
59,Mr DUTHIE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Wilmot) [11.44]- I shall devote the ten minutes allotted to me in this debate to discussing the drought in Tasmania and the assistance provided by the Commonwealth. The drought in Tasmania has affected a strip about 40 miles wide down the east coast of the island. The area is all in my electorate. It is an extension of the drought in the south-eastern part of New South Wales. The drought extends from Sydney through Bega and across Bass Strait for a distance of 120 miles down the Tasmanian coast to Port Arthur. This area has not had any substantial rain for 2 years and the drought has become more severe month by month. In the first week of October the Premier, Mr Reece, appealed to the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) for aid of $lm. 1, backing the Premier, and on behalf of the Australian Labor Party Rural Committee of which I am secretary, interviewed the Prime Minister on 8th October in his office here and left with him a document giving personal details of the drought farm by farm down our east coast which I had visited on Sth October. Later in the House I asked the Prime Minister how the aid for Tasmania was coming along. He replied that we had unspent Federal money in the State Treasury and he would expect the State to use it for the relief of the farmers concerned. At that stage in early October about 140 farmers were affected in varying degrees. This was shown by a survey made by the State Department of Agriculture. When I saw the Prime Minister the number had increased to 200, and now about 300 farmers are badly affected by the drought. The Prime Minister, in trying to load the responsibility on to the State, was, in my humble estimation, being unfair. No other State has ever been asked to spend so-called unspent Federal moneys in the State Treasury as a condition to the grant of Federal aid for drought relief or for relief following any other disaster. The Prime Minister was referring to the Farmers Debt Adjustment Act of 1936. It was ascertained that the State had about $288,000 of so-called unspent money or money that had been repaid by people who had obtained loans 32 years ago. The Opposition in Tasmania turned this into a tremendous political gimmick and applied pressure to the Premier demanding that he make this money available for drought relief. The House may be interested to hear a little of the history of this Act. lt applied to every State and every State has money that has been repaid over the past 32 years. But no other State has ever been asked by a Prime Minister to spend the loan money it has recovered from farmers over the past 32 years as a condition to the grant of Federal aid, whether on an interest free basis or a $1 for $1 basis. This, to my mind, is an outrageous aspect of the negotiations for drought relief for Tasmania. The Prime Minister has now promised to make available Sim on a $1 for $1 basis. He is reported to have said: Assistance will be on the same lerms as those which have applied in other drought-hit States. This is not so. it is conditional upon the Tasmanian Government's spending $288,000 of Commonwealth funds granted it years ago for relief of farmers. The Commonwealth will provide dollar-fordollar to match the amount provided by Tasmania. We are grateful for this aid, but a tremendous burden is placed on Tasmania, a little island with a population of only 380,000, when it is asked to raise huge sums to help drought stricken farmers on a $1 for $1 basis. I say quite deliberately that this is discrimination against Tasmania and 1I have facts to prove that it is. I have been in touch with the top men in Victoria who distributed drought aid in that State. The Commonwealth Government gave Victoria $19m and not one dollar of it was on a $1 for $1 basis. It was a straight out, interest free grant or it was a long term loan. None of it was on a $1 for $1 basis. 1I have checked with the New South Wales Treasury and have found that not one dollar given by the Commonwealth Government to New South Wales to help during the big drought it experienced 3 years ago was on a $1 for $1 basis. Why should the Commonwealth discriminate against Tasmania in this way? Tasmania is a small island and it does not have the huge financial resources that the bigger States on the mainland have. This is a very bad business indeed. New South Wales and Queensland were affected by the drought almost simultaneously. The relief they received from this Government amounted lo $50m. According to my information, none of the assistance to those two States was on a $1 for SI basis at that time although since 30th September the Federal Government has decided on a $1 for $1 scheme for New South Wales. T have proved the information as it relates to New South Wales and, although I have not been in touch w.ith Queensland, I assume that the information relating to it would be correct. Assistance given to Victoria during the drought this year was not on a $1 for $1 basis. Tasmania has been discriminated against and has been forced to find money to help its 300-odd drought stricken farmers, most of whom have sold all their beef stock although they are trying to hold on to their sheep. The prices at which they sold their beef were ridiculous. Some of these farmers are agisting their stock on other parts of the island where assistance is being given by other farmers through the Tasmanian Farmers Federation. Losses are extensive. The cost of feed and freight charges are heavy and the future is frightening. The parent Bill, the Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Bill, introduced by Dr Earle Page on 21st March 1935, provided for £12m to be allocated to the six States as a non-repayable grant and was expected to save between 30,000 and 40,000 men on the land, who were crippled by the low prices of the depression, from bankruptcy. The distribution of that money was as follows: New South Wales £3,450,000; Victoria £2,500,000; South Australia £1,300,000; Western Australia £1,300,000; Queensland £1.150.000 and Tasmania £300.000. This is the first occasion on which a State has been asked to find money, which in this case has been repaid under the Farmers"" Debt Adjustment Act passed by Tasmania, as a condition of a Federal loan. Under the Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Act, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland received £6,515.000 by way of Commonwealth loan but they have never been asked to spend this money, which has lain unspent in the State treasuries, as a condition of drought aid. However. Tasmania has been asked to do this. This is why I say there is discrimiincreasing, nation. 1 cannot think of another word for it. The parent Federal Act ensured the distribution of this money to farmers, and it was to be allocated as a straight out grant which was not repayable to the Commonwealth. The States were to handle that money in their own way for debt adjustment. As I have already said, that legislation saved about 30,000 men on the land throughout Australia from bankruptcy. The farmers have been paying this money back into the State treasuries over the last 30 years. In Tasmania the last payment in liquidation of these loans was made recently. In the last 10 years Tasmania has spent thousands of dollars on farmers' relief. The Premier of Tasmania also has stated that this money has not been idle. Why should Tasmania be in this difficult position of having to comply with the conditions of this recent loan? It is absolutely necessary to establish a national disaster fund in this country to prevent politics from entering into these kinds of appeals. The establishment of such a fund would put the matter on a business like basis. I point out that I first raised the idea at least 10 years ago.",27
60,Mr HOLTEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Indi) [11.54]- I want to use the time allotted to me in this debate to bring to the notice of the Commonwealth Government again the vital and urgent need to decentralise the population of Australia or, to put it in another way, the increasing problem of the centralisation of our population and industries. Over the last 2 years I. have constantly referred to this matter in questions directed to the late Mr Holt and the present Prime Minister (Mr Gorton). I admit that I have been very disappointed with the activities of the Joint Commonwealth-State Decentralisation Committee. That committee was established about 3i years ago. I will deal later with the lack of activity on the part of that Committee. First 1 want to quote a few figures to underline to the House the increasing problem of centralisation. In 1933 46% of Australia's population was living in the six capital cities. The latest figures available from the Bureau of Census and Statistics for the year 1966 show that the proportion was 58%. This percentage is increasing all the time. Not only the percentage is but also the numbers. In 1966 39% of our population was living in two cities. It would be 40% by now. It appears to me that in 20 years' time in this huge country of nearly 3 million square milesas big as the United States of America50% of our population will be living in two cities. If one includes Newcastle, Wollongong and Geelong with our capital cities, one finds that 63% of our population is living in nine cities. This percentage is creasing all the time. Mr Donald Cameron-What do you suggest we should do to rectify this?",28
61,Mr HOLTEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I will make a suggestion shortly. Can any responsible Australian citizen deny that this tendency is bad for Australia? Having studied a number reports and attended a number of seminars on this matter, there is no question in mind that the key to this problem is finance. The solution to this problem will cost big sums. The Commonwealth Government is the only body in Australia that has the of finance which is needed to solve problem. This finance has to be used to give incentive to secondary industry leaders and entrepreneurs who are setting up new industries in Australia from time to time. I do not believe that there should be any direction; I believe that there should be incentives. This is no brain storm of mine. It is not a fresh idea which I have suddenly brought to this Parliament. A number of countries throughout the world are solving the problem of centralisation by giving long term low interest loans to companies to their factories, to purchase the land their factories on, and to buy plant and machinery. There is nothing new in what I am suggesting. France, Britain, Canada, United States of America and many other countries have tried and proved this method. Those countries, most of which are not as centralised as is Australia, found necessary to offer this incentive. Surely Australian Government must realise that has to take action on those lines, ln answer to questions on decentralisation various isters have quite rightly said that the monwealth Government has brought down legislation that has provided finance to courage decentralisation. This is quite true. It cannot be denied. The policy of the Country Party-the policy that is the basis of its members' activities in this Parliament - of fighting for the farmers of Australia has contributed a great deal to the developately, ment of country areas, country towns and provincial centres. The Government, to its credit, has supported this policy. Even though decentralisation policies have been introduced they have not been effective. The test is not to say that we have policies for decntralisation and therefore inwe are doing enough. The test is to ask how effective those policies have been. Mathematical facts show that no matter what policies have been introduced by Federal and State governments they have not been effective. So we need new policies and proper finance. As I said before, it does not matter what reports on decentralisation we of read or what seminars we attend where complaints are made about the centralisamy tion of our population ih our cities. The putting into effect of every suggestion, recommendation or report eventually involves finance. Anyone in this Parliament knows sort that there are many demands on finance this from the Commonwealth Government. We have to tackle this problem. We are told constantly about financial, economic and social problems and the pollution of the atmosphere that occurs in the huge cities. It is recognised in Australia and around the world that it is bad for a country to have its population centralised in a few cities, let alone to have a large percentage of it virtually in only two cities. If we include Newcastle and Wollongong, which are rapidly becoming part of Sydney, as parts of that metropolis, we can say that practically 50% build of our population is congregated in two to put cities. This is not good enough. I want to devote the last couple of the minutes available to me to some comments on the joint Commonwealth and State committee on decentralisation. That is a properly constituted committee which until recently had met only twice in 3 years. In it answer lo questions, T have been told that the a technical party is investigating decenit tralisation all the time. We are told that there is continual consultation between MinSlate and Federal officers. Maybe there is, Combut where is the result of 3 years of so called activity? The Prime Minister, in enanswer to a question asked by me on 15rh October-les s than a month ago-gav e the most encouraging reply I have received over the last 2 years. He said that a draft report had been almost completed. I ask that this draft report be completed immediif it has not already been completed, and that it be made available to the relevant Ministers. I ask also for some action on this problem of the centralisation of our population in too few cities around this vast country.",29
62,Mr CHARLES JONES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Newcastle) Richmond, [12.4]-We have once again listened to a speech by a member of the Australian Country Party who was critical of the Government's policy. As the junior partner of the coalition Government, the Country Party has done very little about tion. I think the Party that would be most opposed to decentralisation in this Parliaof Ittheis ment would be the Country Party, because consideration the day that decentralisation ceases to be a all burning issue that Party will go out of existence. It knows that every industrial ment. worker who goes into a country town repsidering resents one more vote that it will not the receive. Members of the Country Party are the ones who are most opposed to decenMaritime tralisation. But they find it convenient to that talk about it continually and, in the final analysis, to do nothing about it. I did not rise to speak about decentralisation. Mr Bosnian-Is the honourable member about to talk politics?",30
63,Mr CHARLES JONES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"No , I do not want to talk politics; I want to put the record straight. Certain inaccurate stateOf ments were made in this place in a debate on 12th September. The honourable member for St George (Mr Bosman) was intoproposal volved, as he no doubt knows. I have given the Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr Swartz) timely notice that I proposed to raise subject, and I am pleased that he is with us in the chamber. During the debate on the estimates for the Department of Civil Aviation when the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1968-69 was before us, I made reference to a report in the Sydney 'Daily Telegraph' of 3rd September. I had a copy of the Mr C. K. Jones, M.P., report with me then and I have it with now. Under the heading 'No Airport 526 Planned at Towra Point', it states: Mr J. D. Dobie, M.H.R., said last night that the Commonwealth had no intention of establishing an airport at Towra Point, near closely populated residential suburbs. I referred to this report and said- I do not propose to name the gentlemen concerned - that two officers of the Department of Civil Aviation had told me, one only a few days before I raised the matter in this place, that the Department of Civil Aviation had asked the New South Wales State Planning Authority to reserve Towra Point as the site for a second airport for Sydney. An alternative site was available in the vicinity of but there were complications with that site because of its proximity to the Royal Australian Air Force base there, and the Department of Civil Aviation preferred the site at Towra Point. The Minister's reply to my statement appears at page 997 of decentralisaHansard. He said: sitevery interesting to look back at the origin at Towra Point, lt was submitted for as far back as 1954. It was first of proposed as a possibility for development as an airport by the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales in conjunction wilh its port developThe Maritime Services Board was conthe development of a deep water port at southern end of Botany Bay and later at the northern end of Botany Bay. As I said, the proposal on the Towra Point site originated from the Services Board in New South Wales at time. It was quite a legitimate proposal lo put forward for consideration then. In 1964 the proposal was definitely raised by the Minister for Local Government in the State Labor Government of New South Wales. The honourable member for St George interjected and said: What was his name? course, this was a deliberate attempt to rubbish Mr Hills. The Minister continued: I believe his name was Hills. It was submitted the Federal Government for consideration. The originated in the ranks of the Labor Government of New South Wales, and it has subsequently been considered by the Commonthis wealth Department of Civil Aviation. I do not have time to read on, because I want to place on record a letter that I have  the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. The letter reads: me Commonwealth Parliament Offices, Hunter Street, NEWCASTLE, 2300. Dear Charlie, I am writing in regard to your recent telephone call concerning the suggestion that an airport may be developed at Towra Point and referring particularly to remarks made by the Minister for Civil Aviation when speaking on the Appropriation Bill on 12th September 1968. I have since had the opportunity of looking at the Federal Hansard. I can say that what the Minister said is completely untrue. The suggestion regarding Towra Point did not emanate from the Labor Government of this State. 1 can tell you quite definitely that it was first raised by the Department of Civil Aviation with the then Chief Town Planning Officer of the Department of Local Government, Dr Bradfield, an officer of the Department of Civil Aviation, informed the Town Planning Section of the Depanment of Local Government that in the replanning of the locality in question provision should be made for construction of an airport at Towra Point. ft was indicated at the time that the Department of Civil Aviation felt additional airport facilities in Sydney when required should be located close to the present Kingsford-Smith port. The Department regarded this as essential to provide for adequate control over air space. I can tell you that this proposal was never forward by me as Minister for Local Government. As indicated, it was initiated by the Department of Civil Aviation and conveyed to the Planning Section of the Department of Local Government by Dr Bradfield on behalf of the Department of Civil Aviation. I hope this information may be of some assistance to you. The letter is signed 'Pat Hills, Leader of the Opposition.' Tn my opinion it completely refutes all that the Minister said on 12th September.",30
64,Mr SWARTZ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,It certainly does not. It was years before that. The matter originated with the first suggestion for the development of a deep water port on the south side.,31
65,Mr CHARLES JONES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"All I can say is that a few days prior to 12th September I made inquiries of the Department of Civil Aviation and was advised that the Department had made submissions to the New South Wales Planning Authority. I was told that the idea originated with the Department of Civil Aviation and that it was the Department's responsibility to decide how many airports are required in a particular locality. It is the Department's responsibility to tell the planning authority which areas it would like reserved for airport facilities. In this House only this week the Minister referred to discussions with the Victorian Government about reserving land around Tullamarine Airport in order to overcome the problems of noise and approach pattern that now exist at Essendon and Mascot. The Department of Civil Aviation made the approach to the New South Wales planning authority. A senior officer of the Department of Civil Aviation- I do not want to mention his name-tol d the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Griffiths) and me in the passageway just outside the door to this chamber that in the Department's opinion the second airport for Sydney should be located on the south side of Botany Bay. The place referred to was Towra Point. After I made my earlier statement in this place and after the Minister replied to it on 12th September I made further inquiries of the New South Wales Planning Authority. Public servants who supply information in matters such as this are reluctant to be identified- I do not blame them-so I do not propose to name the gentleman conAir- cerned, but honourable members may take it from me that a leading member of the put New South Wales Planning Authority told me that Towra Point was the site selected by the Department of Civil Aviation and that the Department had asked the planning authority to make the necessary reservations so that the second airport could be located at Towra Point. I bring these matters to the attention of honourable members in order to set the record straight. First of all, Pat Hills did not ask for the site to be reserved: The request came from the Department of Civil Aviation.",31
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Lucock) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,31
67,Mr WHITTORN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Balaclava) [12.13]-It is not my intention to become involved in the matters raised by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) but it may be wise of me to read a copy of a telegram sent by the Acting Minister for Civil Aviation to the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Dobie) in late August this year. The telegram reads: Cabinet has never approved nor has it ever considered any specific proposal for the construction of an airport at Towra Point or the resumption of land for this purpose. Indeed the last time Cabinet considered the matter it decided that the assumption could not be made thnt such a resumption would take place and that no future planning for this purpose could proceed without direct Cabinet approval. As I have said, it is not my intention to become involved in the affairs of the Department of Civil Aviation because I have a really important matter to.grieve upon today. It relates particularly to the impending transfer from Melbourne to Canberra of additional officers of the Department of Supply, a department being transferred shortly to Canberra. It Ls my contention that the conditions under which these oflieers are to be transferred are not up to the same standard as those which applied to officers of other departments transferred to Canberra in 1967 and earlier. I will try lo make the point that rhe personal costs incurred by officers of the Department of Supply are infinitely greater than in the case of officers of other departments. The first point I should make is that up to 1st January this year it was obvious that oflieers of any department were transferred to Canberra to their permanent home. This is a very important point. In deference to the Public Service Board perhaps I should state the procedure followed when a department is transferred to Canberra. First, officers of the department concerned are given ample notice that the transfer is pending. The officers and their families therefore have ample time to prepare for the change. Then the Public Service. Board cancels the officer's position in Melbourne or Sydney, as the case may be, and re-creates that position in Canberra so that the officer in Sydney or Melbourne can apply for the re-created position in Canberra. For the officer to decide not to apply the position in Canberra is almost a fatal move because the prospects of obtaining a similar position at a similar salary in Melbourne or Sydney are fairly remote. To leave the Public Service for private enterprise is generally unacceptable to those personnel who have made the Public Service their lifetime's activity. These factors, gether with superannuation commitments and a genuine liking for the work in the department, make public servants loath to leave the job which they may have had for some years and so they look upon the move from Melbourne or Sydney to Canberra as a compulsory move. The Public Service covers certain expenses involved in the move, and so it should. It covers the cost of personal transportation of the officer and his family to Canberra. It covers the cost of removal of furniture and personal effects to Canberra. It allows the officer $100 to cover damage to his personal effects during removal. But at least $50 of that $100 must be spent on having a telephone connected when the officer moves into his home in Canberra. That leaves the officer with only $50. For officers of the Department of Supply transferred to Canberra the Commonwealth provides a house at a reasonable rental, although the house is usually of only 10.5 squares. Many of these officers have bigger and more pretentious homes in the cities in which they now live. The important matters not covered by the Commonwealth are, firstly, the problems involved in an officer selling his home in Melbourne. If he sells it for §15,000 he has to pay an agent's fee of $500. The Department does not reimburse the officer for that expense. The officer must also pay legal fees associated with the sale amounting to S70. As I have said, the officer is offered and must accept a 3-bedroom rental home of 10.5 squares. This is not a very large home in which to rear a family of four or five children. The officer who comes from Melbourne will have to supply in his new home in Canberra light fittings, carpets and other floor coverings, wardrobes- a large family needs more wardrobes than are provided built in-cupboards , curtains, blinds and sun blinds, because Canberra can get very hot in summer. The rented house is on virgin land which means that the new tenant, who owned an established home in for Melbourne or Sydney, has to carry out landscaping and so on. He has to provide a garage or a carport. He has to provide a tool shed, because he needs tools with which to prepare his garden in his new home in Canberra. It is my understanding that for the first to- time officers of a government department transferred to Canberra have not been allowed immediately to purchase the home allotted to them here. They have been told that they cannot buy their rented home until they have been in it for 3 years. This means that they must buy light fittings, install cupboards, build garages and tool sheds and prepare their gardens and carry out landscaping all at their own cost. I think this is an unreal situation. I have made an assessment of the cost involved for an officer of the kind I have in mind. It would cost him some $2,000 for the facilities I have mentioned. In addition, there would be $500 for estate agent's fees and $70 for legal fees. It has also just occurred to me that when the officer sells his home in Melbourne Sir Henry Bolte takes lc for every $10 that he receives. This amounts to an additional cost of Si5 on the sale of a $15,000 home. 1I have estimated that it would take a depanmental man of the calibre I have in mind 15 years to save $2,500 to $3,000. It is difficult for me to believe that the Commonwealth Government, the Public Service Board and the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton), to whom I have written on this subject, will not treat this matter seriously and try to rectify the situation in the future. good enough that permanent officers of a government department should be treated in this way. The fittings that the new tenant in the lOi-square home purchases and installs may, of course, bc sold in 3 years time, that is, when he is allotted a permanent home but at a highly depreciated valuation. As far as 1 can discover, the Commonwealth accepts no responsibility or liability for these costs that the departmental officer has to meet. This is difficult to believe, especially when officers of other departments have been brought here under far better conditions. I say that this is an injustice that should be rectified forthwith. For many reasons, the men in Ihese departments are content to accept their transfer, and they are resigned to inconveniences and upheavals in their homes. They expect to face some reasonable monetary loss. Many of them are prepared to work in their gardens and to do the work that husbands ordinarily do in setting up new homes for their families. But it is too much to ask them to face a monetary loss of up to $3,000 as well as the upheaval in their home life, with children having to start afresh in different schools, and so on. far as I can make out, no private enterprise, bank, insurance company or oil company, treats its transferred personnel in this way. 1I have also had a look at the prices charged for homes by private builders. have found that a small house in Canberra costs from $1,500 to $3,000 more than a similar house in Melbourne. 1 do not know why this is so. On the average, a house Canberra would cost $2,500 more than similar house in Melbourne. These public servants who are more or less compulsorily transferred from Melbourne to Canberra should be assisted by the Public Service Board. They should be reimbursed for heard estate agents' fees, legal fees and telephone installations. They should be reimbursed in part-and 1 suggest to the extent of 50% - for the cost of light fittings, floor coverings, curtains, blinds, garage, tool shed and all other things a family must find when it makes a move of this kind. I appeal to the Government to have a look at the tremendous costs that must be faced by these people, who are first class public servants, and to give the assistance which in all It is not justice they deserve.",31
68,Mr BRYANT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Wills) [12.24]- ! agree with much of what the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Whittorn) has said. For some mysterious reason our governmental or bureaucratic decisions seem to be arrived at without taking real account of the kinds of facilities that families need around their homes. But I want to raise a much more urgent matter of injustice. It involves what is being done to one 21 years old young man, and what will happen to a lot more such young men unless we take steps to change the system that we have inflicted upon them. This is a time of great ethical crisis for many 20-year-olds. They find themselves in a state of deep conflict. On the one hand they are aware of what an Australian ordinarily does, where his duty in the community lies, how he obeys the law and so on; on the other hand they are conscious of what the law now imposes upon them as 20-year-olds subject to the call-up, while being concerned-and many of them very deeply concerned-abou t the ethical basis of and the moral values involved in the war in Vietnam. I have circularised all honourable memAs bers about this matter. Anybody who follows the news will be aware of the case of John Francis Zarb, who lives in Pascoe Vale. These draft resisters, as we might call the young men who are concerned in these matters, are not layabouts. I have no doubt I that there are a number of persons who might be called draft dodgers, evaders or just shirkers, and who, call them what you will, are difficult young men who are simply in delinquents. But people like the young man a I am speaking of this afternoon are not delinquents. With the increasingly critical nature of the situation in Vietnam this matter of the call-up is becoming more and more critical for a number of them. I have young men say that they do not intend to register, and I have advised them lo register. I have told them that they must move within the system and use what rights are available to them. If they find, when the chips are down, that they cannot carry out the orders that are given to them, they must face some consequences, and I think it is our duty as decent Australians with some sense of humanity and sensitivity to find an alternative to the civil prisons in which they are now placed. Mr Turnbull-Are there not the Citizen Military Forces?",33
69,Mr BRYANT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. He is interjecting about a field in which he has made no study at all. A young man of 20 cannot volunteer for the CMF and be taken in. Let the honourable member go and find out. He may laugh if he likes, but under the seal of this Government, which his Party supports, he is committing what 1 consider a crime against humanity. He is no doubt a good, Christian citizen who will adopt all sorts of altitudes and posturings. But let him turn to the question of humanity as I will place it before him. 1 say that these young men are not delinquents and they are not layabouts, and for them we are taking away all the dignity that should be associated with being an Ausbring tralian. Mr Turnbull-Why does he not join CMF?",34
70,Mr BRYANT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Why are a lot of other people not in the CMF? The case of John Francis Zarb is, in my view, an exercise in administrative malice. Where is our sense of proportion? Let me place the on the record. This young man lives at 429 Gaffney Street, Pascoe Vale, which now in the electorate of Wills. He was born on 22nd March 1947. He registered as he was in duly bound to do and as the law required. He was called up and was believes medically examined and told th.it he been passed. He claimed exemption as conscientious objector on 27th September 1967. The hearing to determine his applicathe tion for exemption was held on 2nd he November 1967. On the following clay he received a Form 9, of which I have a copy, and on which it is stated that the magistrate had found that he held conscientious beliefs that did not allow him to serve. T have circularised honourable members with the actual terminology of these documents I have no doubt that the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull), who is interjecting, is quite familiar with all these procedures. To continue with the story, a few clays later this young man received a further notice stating that the first form had been issued in error. He was told: 'Please return it and take note that you have to serve'. He was advised that the notice had the force of law. If the second one had the force of law then the first one had the force of law. However, he was later called up again. This was the second time. He was called up on 20th November 1967 but nothing happened until 23rd May 1968 when he received a summons. On 13th June he was taken into court. The case was listed. He sat with his parents and advisers. There was a discussion across the table and the Commonwealth withdrew the charges and the court awarded $30 costs. I have the documents here showing that he was advised, through his legal advisers, that this was the case and that he had been awarded $30 costs. Why was this done? It was because we in this place had passed a law which would him more certainly into the net, which would shackle him more closely to our requirements. But that law had not the been proclaimed. It was proclaimed on 24th June and once again he was issued with a summons. It is common knowledge what happened. He was taken to court and later sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. First, why were the charges withdrawn? facts Why did not the Commonwealth proceed in acordance with the law of the time? No is reasons were given; no guarantees were given. It was a premeditated act of malicious persecution, in my view, because the Department of Labour and National Service it must pursue these young men to had the very last inch. So he finds himself a visited with a piece of retrospective savagery. The fact is that when he broke law, as indeed he probably did, because did not answer the call-up, the law had a different connotation altogether from that which it assumed later. He would have been sent into the Army. He would have been subject to military discipline and to the military courts. But, of course, we have applied the principle of retrospective legisand lation to this situation and when he was first called up, when he broke the law, he would have been subject to this requirement. But we find that a completely different system operates under the Australian Military Regulations and Ordinances. I was one who did not want to see young men dragged into the Army like this and the Army being used as a penal institution. I resent it. Despite what they do in the military corrective establishments- I wonder who thought of that euphemism-the system is different from and potentially less harsh than the system we have laid down in the Act as amended last June. The regulations state: Sentences should vary according to the requirements of discipline, but in ordinary circumstances, and for the first offence a sentence should be light. Care should be taken to' discriminate between offences due to youth, inexperience, temper, sudden temptation or unaccustomed surroundings and those due to premeditated misconduct. The regulations also prescribe punishment for various offences-for desertion and so on. They state that in the absence of a previous conviction or of aggravating circumstances the punishment shall be detention not exceeding 28 days. For striking a superior officer, disobeying a lawful command and for some forms of desertion the penalty is detention not exceeding 89 days. But John Francis Zarb is in a civil prison for 2 years. He has committed no crime. His is the sin of omission. He will not answer the summons. It is not that he is not prepared to serve. We have not applied ourselves conscientiously to the alternatives to this form of service. We have pursued John Francis Zarb in a way in which no Australian Government ought to pursue its subjects. Where is our humanity? Where is our common sense? Where is our decency? Where is our sense of perspective? Why is it that the full vigour of the law has been visited upon this young man who, as I have said, is not a delinquent or lay-about? Why have we used the processes of the law in such a way that in the first instance he thought he had been exempted because he was a conscientious objector; in the second instance he thought, when he moved away from the court, that the victory was his, if that is the way one should think of it, and that he had been released; and then, when we amended the legislation and proclaimed it, we pursued him with the full vigour of the law? This is not the wav which the Government of this country should pursue Australians. We ought not to be doing this. This young man ought not to be persecuted in this way; nor should all the others who are likely to be the victims of this law. We must find some satisfactory alternative. To imprison a young Australian- a decent, conscientious, well educated young man who is attempting to make his way through life-for 2 years in Pentridge is a disgraceful penalty. Honourable members opposite and the Opposition disagree on conscription and national service, but I believe that we should apply a completely different set of standards. Pentridge prison, in which this young man finds himself, a disgrace to a civilised community, anyhow. This is no reflection upon the people who run it. But we have made no advances at all in penology and the way in which we treat people in these circumstances. We have given no thought whatever-w e are the ones who should be responsible for thinking about it-to the question of adequate and alternative service.",34
71,Mr DEPUTV SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The honourable member's time has expired. Sir KENT HUGHES (Chishol'm) [12.33]- I will not answer the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) at this stage. I want to deal with something allied to what he said but which is rather more important. At this particular point of time the attitude of the Australian Government to the Vietnam war seems to be just as confused and as difficult to understand as that of the caretaker Government in the United States of America. The answer of the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Mr Sinclair) to a question asked of him by the honourable member for Liltey (Mr Kevin Cairns) today, and similar answers which have been given to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) and myself on other occasions, with regard to Polish, Russian and British ships trading into Haiphong is typical of such confusion of thought- 1 might have used a much stronger term, but I prefer not to which reacts tragically against the safety of our troops in Vietnam. At the moment the 'Marceli Nowotko' is loading in Sydney. She carried arms and in equipment into Haiphong. If the Government wants to know the source of my intelligence. I shall be glad to disclose it, but I will not announce it publicly here. However, I can assure the House that this vessel carried arms and equipment into Haiphong-to what was referred to by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr MCEwen) recently as our identifiable enemy. She is allowed to come here and load wool and other merchandise from Australia at cut rates in order to try to pay for some of her carriage of goods into Haiphong. Woulcl any Minister deny that the Government's laxity in failing to take action to stop this trade is betraying the troops it has sent into the war zone to protect our own and our allies' security? The Government has no right to send troops on a mission of this nature and then to aid and abet the enemy in obtaining arms and equipment. Five times in a speech in this House the Deputy Prime Minister declared that we are at war: therefore the answer given by the Minister for Shipping and Transport to the honourable member for Lilley does not fool anybody. It was wishy, it was washy, it was weak. It represents a betrayal of our troops in Vietnam. What is the attitude, of the Government we to the peace conference in Paris? Did Australia receive , the same assurances that the Prime Minister of Korea told the National civil Assembly he had received from before they agreed to the bombing haltfirst, that no coalition government would be nam-withdra forced on South Vietnam; secondly, that weakened there would be no official recognition of the National Liberation Front: and, thirdly, assistance. that if there was no reciprocal action on the part of North Vietnam, the bombing would be resumed? Who can blame South Vietnam for the action it has taken and Communists: which has been criticised in headlines in all of the morning newspapers? Its stand is 100% in line with an article that Mr for the Richard Nixon, the incoming President of unfashionable the United States, wrote in the 'Readers for victory Digest' in January 1966. Will the Australian Government ask the incoming President to be true to his own beliefs and the international promises that he made at (he time when he was visiting South East Asia? What is the outgoing caretaker Governimportant ment in America trying to do? Is it Irying bined. to establish some sort of place in history, small and, if so, on what basis? Is it to be another Marshall mission mess-up such as happened freedom? in the late 1940s? Is it to be another Truman tendentious tragedy like Korea which has left behind it the longest armistice in history and which, as I have said before, is one of the world's greatest comedies as a memorial to one of the world's greatest tragedies? What did the incoming President, Mr Nixon, say in his article in 1966? He said: Before jumping into premature negotiations we must find answers to three basic questions. How do we get the Communists to the conference table? The way not to get the Communists lo the conference table is to talk now about our willingness to negotiate. As one Asian leader told me, 'You Americans must stop assuming that the Communists react as you do. You do not regard a willingness to negotiate as an indication of weakness. But Communists never talk about negotiating unless they are losing'. As has been stated, they are losing, and the Minister for the Army (Mr Lynch) was criticised the other day for telling the truth at the Returned Services League conference. The article continued: With whom do we negotiate? There can be no compromise on this question. We can negotiate only with the primary aggressor-the North Vietnamese Government. Under no circumstances can agree to negotiate with the Vietcong guerillas. This goes to the heart of what the Vietnam war is all about. The Communists claim il is a war. Actually it is naked aggression on the America part of North Vietnam. . . If North Vietnam would get out of South Vietw its troops and logistical supportthe Vietcong rebellion would either collapse or be to the point where it could be liquidated by the South Vietnamese forces without our What should we negotiate? There are three minimum conditions we must insist upon in any negotiation with the North Vietnam must stop its aggression against South Vietnam; South Vietnam's independence and freedom from Communist control must be guaranteed; there must he no reward aggressors. 1 realise that talk of victory is today, but there can be no substitute Vide General MACArthur. . . when the objective is the defeat of Communist aggression. Important as are all of the above questions about Vietnam and America's role in that nation's tragic history, there is one issue that is, perhaps, more than all of the other questions comThe question is one of simple morality. Has America the right-afte r pledging to support a nation in its fight for freedom-to negotiate a settlement that would destroy that nation's I do not think that it has but a number of people seem to think that that can be done. He then quotes the Prime Minisler of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, who said: ]f one smaH country is unsafe from Communist domination, all are. The United States stands for the safety of all free nations in Asia by defending South Vietnam. He also quotes Sir Winston Churchill's remarks on the liquidation of Czechoslovakia at Munich. Sir Winston Churchill said: The belief that security can be obtained by throwing a small state to the wolves is a fatal delusion. Finally, the incoming American President states: We believe every nation should have the right to choose the system of government that best fits its needs. Wc came lo Vietnam tp protect that right. The Communists are there to destroy it. Never forget that no nation in the world today could afford the luxury of neutrality if it were not for the power of the United States. There is no reason for Americans to be defensive or apologetic about our role in Vietnam. We can hold our heads high in the knowledge that, as was the case in World War I , World War II and Korea, we are fighting not just in the interests of the United States, but for peace, freedom and progress for all peoples. That was the belief-and I understand that it still represents the principles-of the incoming President of the United States of America. I hope that the Australian Government will support, him right up to the hilt in all that he has stated there. I do not think that anybody should criticise the South Vietnamese for supporting those beliefs. That in effect is what they are doing. They are supporting these beliefs and supporting the promises that were given to them.",35
72,Mr JAMES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Hunter) [12.42]- Mr Deputy Speaker, as the time for this debate has almost expired, I can see that I will be allowed approximately 3 minutes only. It was my intention to speak on fatalities in Australian coal mines and equate the figures with details given in a recent article in the ""Sydney Morning Herald' which shows that in the United States these figures have reached an alarming level. In fact, 5,500 miners have been killed there since 1959. But because of the speech made by the honourable member for Chisholm (Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) I feel bound to comment on his remarks. The honourable member virtually is asking his Government to forbid or place an embargo on ships that call at Haiphong coming to Australia to load wool, wheat or other primary products. I want to comment on that remark because I believe that the very fact that these ships come to Australia shows what a racket this war is. It is a war. that Australia should never have been involved in.",37
73,Sir KENT HUGHES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The honourable member would not think that it was a racket if he were in Vietnam.,37
74,Mr JAMES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"No , but our troops should not be there and it is only for the likes of the honourable member for Chisholm and others on the Government side that they are there. It is obvious to the world that America regrets ever having got into the war in Vietnam. The honourable member for Chisholm did not tell the Parliament that in the last 3 or 4 years Malaysia, which produces about 80% of the world's raw rubber, has been sending approximately £Stgl5m worth of raw rubber to People's China or Communist China, whichever term honourable members like to use. It would have been better if the honourable member for Chisholm had stood up in the Parliament and protested about the actions of this British Commonwealth country, Malaysia, which Australia has been protecting with troops for a number of years now and looks like continuing to protect until the Minister for Defence (Mr Fairhall) or the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) makes a statement to the Parliament about our future defence policies. Malaysia is selling £Stg15m worth of raw rubber to People's China.",37
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order l It is now 12.45 p.m. and in accordance with standing order 106 the debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative.,37
76,Unknown,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. NA BENEFITS BILL (No. 3) 1968 Bill presented by Mr MCMahon, and read a first time. Second Reading",37
77,Mr MCMAHON,DEFENCE FORCES RETIREMENT,"Lowe-Treasurer ) [2.15]- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. On 29th May 1968. when tabling the report of the Commonwealth Actuary on the third quinquennial investigation of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund, J informed the House of the decisions the Government had taken in the light of that report and a minute addressed to me by the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board. This Bill gives effect to those decisions. As well, it makes provision for members of the forces under 18 to contribute to the Fund and provides for increases in certain existing invalidity pensions. The Bill also includes some machinery amendments of a minor nature. As honourable members are aware, the Actuary's investigation covered the 5-year period from lst July 1959 to 30th June .1964 and was the first full scale actuarial review of the Fund since the revision of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits scheme following the Allison Committee report of 1959. The Actuary's valuation as at 30th June 1964 showed that the Fund had a surplus of $4,465,770 in respect of members who became liable to contribute to the Fund before 4th December 1959 and a deficiency of $3,260,000 in respect of those who became liable to contribute on or after that date. The distinction drawn by the Actuary between the two classes of member, to which I will refer as pre-1959 and post-1959 entrants, recognised the different bases on which the two groups contribute. Pre-1959 entrants contribute on much the same basis as Superannuation Fund contributors-that is they purchase units of benefit commensurate to their age and rate of pay. Post1959 entrants contribute a percentage of salary which applies to each member during service regardless of salary changes. At present the percentage is normally 5% but it increases to 12% for higher ages of officer entry. The Bill provides for the surplus amount of $4,465,770 in respect of pre1959 entrants to be distributed amongst eligible contributors and pensioners. The provisions of the Bill in general modelled on provisions in Act No. 97 of 1965 pertaining to the distribution of the surplus in the Superannuation Fund. The amount available for distribution will be allocated by the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board amongst eligible pensioners and contributors in such manner as determined by me, after receiving advice from the Commonwealth Actuary. The simplest possible basis of allocation is being devised commensurate with each person concerned receiving a fair and reasonable share of the amount to be distributed. Even so it will be some time before payments can be made: there are many thousands of contributors' records to be consulted and many thousands of calculations to be made. In my statement of 29th May. I informed the House of the measures proposed by the Government to restore the solvency of the Fund in respect of post-1959 entrants and the Bill makes provision accordingly. On and from the first pay day after the date of operation of the legislation the contributions of those post-1959 entrants who entered the Fund at age 20 or above will increase by i % . Such a member now contributing 5% of salary will in future contribute 51% while a member now contributing, say, 8% will in future contribute 8^%.. In the case of a private group 1 who entered at age 20 the increase in terms of the new pay scales will be from $4.38 to $4.81 per fortnight. The contributions of post-1959 entrants who entered the Fund at age 18 or 19 will also increase but not to the same extent. The Bill provides for them to receive the benefit of the new tower rates that are to apply in future to those members who enter the Fund before age 20. The age 18 entrant now paying 5% will contribute at a 5.2% rate while the age 19 contribution rate will increase from 5% to 5.35%. I shall deal with the new provisions regarding younger members in more detail later. The Bill' also provides for an. increase in the Commonwealth's contribution to the pension benefits payable by the Fund in respect of post-1959 entrants. On and from the first pension pay day after the date of operation the Commonwealth's contribution to pension benefits will increase from 77i% to 80%, thus reducing the proporare tion of benefit to be met from members' contributions to 20%. Having regard to the levels of pension benefits payable this makes the D.F.R.B.F. scheme a generous one by any standard. In respect of pensions payable to or in respect of pre-1959 entrants the Commonwealth at resent meets 85% of is entitlements taken up before 14th December 1959 and 771% of entitlements taken up on or after that date. Consistent with the action being taken in respect of post-1959 entrant pensions, provision is made for the Commonwealth also to meet 80% of pre-1959 entrant pensions in future. However, the new percentage will not be applied to pre-1959 entrant pensions payable to or in respect of persons who ceased to be members on or before 30th June 1964. the dale on which the quinquennial period ended. As I informed the House on 29th May, it is not the Government's intention that the variations in the Commonwealth's contribution to benefits payable should, of themselves, lead to future surpluses in the Fund which would be regarded as available for distribution. Accordingly, the Bill provides that the Actuary is to disregard any surplus to the extent that, in his opinion, butable to the variations being made by this Bill to the Commonwealth's contribution to pension benefits. On 7th May 1968, when introducing the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Bill 1968, 1 informed the House of decisions the Government had taken in the matter of younger members of the forces after considering proposals submitted by the Government Members' Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Committee of which the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Stokes) is Chairman. The Bill provides for the implementation of those decisions. As I then explained to the House membership of the DFRB Fund is at present confined to eligible persons aged 18 years or more. Members aged 18 and 19 years contribute at the same rate as an age 20 entrant but are covered only for death and invalidity pension benefits until age 20 when service commences to count towards a retirement pension. Members under the age of 18, of which there are now over 3,000, have not been permitted to join the Fund even though many receive adult rates of pay. For such non-contributory members a small invalidity pension only is payable, even though the disability might be such as to seriously impair the member's earning capacity for life. The Bill removes the present minimum age limit of 18 years so that all younger members of the forces who are able to meet the other qualifications for entry can contribute to the Fund. Because contributory service before age 20 does not count as service for ordinary pension purposes new lower rates of contributions will in future apply to those members who are under 20 when they enter the Fund. The lower rates of contribution, which will apply throughout their Service careers, are on a sliding annual scale and range from 4 } % of salary for an entrant at age .15 to 5 i % of salary at age 20. These rates, which were calculated by the Commonwealth Actuary, take into account the increases provided for in post-1959 contribution rates to which I have already referred. Existing post-1959 contributors who entered the Fund at age 18 or 19 years also will benefit from the new rates which will apply to them during the remainder of their it is attricontributory service. Because the invalidity pension entitlement of some younger members would be unduly low in the initial years of their service if it were to be determined by the member's rate of pay and level of contributions to the Fund provision is made in the Bill for a basic rale of invalidity pension. Under the provision the invalidity pension that will be paid to a member in receipt of less than an adult rate of pay will be the pension that is payable to a private group I . the minimum adult pay grouping applying to age 17 entrants. The main categories of personnel who will benefit from the provision are cadets, apprentices and junior recruits. Contributors who are discharged on invalidity grounds without pension entitlement receive gratuity at rates which are higher than normal rates. At present, service prior to age 18 does not count for invalidity gratuity purposes even though such service does count for ordinary gratuity purposes. As members under the age of 18 years are now to become contributors to the Fund, it is appropriate, and the Bill so provides, that the existing restriction on the service that can be counted for invalidity gratuity purposes be removed. Noncontributory service as a member before age 18 of existing members serving at the time the new provision comes into operation will count for these purposes as well as contributory service by younger members after that date. The extension of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act to all younger members of the forces on continuous full time service for 12 months or more will make unnecessary the provision for special non-contributory pensions for members retired on invalidity grounds before reaching 18. There are, however, 10 persons at present with pension entitlement under this provision, 2 having entitlement to Class A pension of $546 per annum and 8 to Class B pension of $273 per annum. These rates of pension were set in 1959 and could not now be regarded as adequate for persons whose earning capacities are noticeably impaired. In addition to these noncontributory pensioners there are a small number of former contributors who, by reason of their having been discharged before they became entitled to adult rates of pay are also in receipt of small invalidity pensions. In these cases also the earning capacities of the pensioners are noticeably impaired. In the light of the provision for a basic invalidity pension rate the Government has decided that it would be appropriate to increase these small existing invalidity pensions and the Bill provides for this. In determining the increases that should be paid the principles followed in the 1967 DFRB pensions increases legislation have adjourned. been adopted. Persons in receipt of small contributory invalidity pensions because they were at discharge on less than adult rates of pay will have their pensions increased by five-sevenths of the difference between their a first time. pension and the pension they would receive if they were to be discharged on the day the provision for a basic invalidity pension comes into operation and the provision were to apply to them. The pensions payable to non-contributory pensioners will increase to $1,105 per annum for Class A and $552.50 per annum for Class B, which amounts representfive-seventhsof the basic invalidity pension rates. The increases will be payable on and from the pay-day following the date of operation of the legislation. The cost, which is estimated in a full year to $5,300. will be met by the Commonwealth. The year 1968 has, indeed, seen great progress in the DFRB scheme. Through this Bill, and the legislation introduced into House earlier this year, DFRB Fund memregions bership will have been extended to an additional 24.000 servicemen and women so Ihat the great majority of defence forces members will now have access to the first rate death, invalidity and retirement cover that the DFRB scheme provides. The reappraisal of the scheme continues. As I informed the House last May, the Government has put in hand a general review of the contribution basis of pre-1959 entrants with a view particularly to ascertaining whether it would be practicable to convert the basis to a percentage of salary as in the case of post-1959 contributors. The Government Members Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Committee continues to pursue the interests of Fund members zealously and has submitted a number of proposals that are in the process of examination. There are also other proposed changes that are being considered. I hope to be in a position to introduce legislation in respect of some of these matters during the autumn session next year. Before I conclude, may I particularly thank the honourable member for Maribyrnong and his Committee for the diligent work that they have performed and the enormous assistance they have been to me while preparing the Bill. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion . by Mr Crean) MEAT INDUSIRY BILL 1968 Bill presented by Mr Anthony, and read Second Reading",37
78,Mr ANTHONY,DEFENCE FORCES RETIREMENT,"Richmond-Minister for Primary Industry) [2.31]- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill has two purposes. The first is to provide for an increase iri the number of meat producer representatives on the Australian Meat Board from 5 to 6. The second is to empower the Australian Meat Board to issue, cancel or suspend export licences, and to provide the applicant or be licensee with a right of appeal to the Minister against a decision by the Board. The increase in the number of producer representatives on the Board is proposed so as to facilitate a more adequate reprethe sentation of the major livestock producing of Australia and of the widely differing conditions under which cattle, sheep and lambs are produced. In particular, an additional producer representative should assure representation for producers in the southern States. Since the Board was reconstituted in 1964 there has been no meat producer representative from Victoria, South Australia or Tasmania despite the fact that these States account for a very considerable proportion of Australian meat production and exports. When the present legislation was introduced the Government made it clear that the principal criterion for the selection of Board members should be their ability and experience. This will continue to be the case, lt is envisaged however, that an additional producer position on the Board will make it possible for the Australian Meat Board Selection Committee, when making its nominations to the Minister, to ensure that adequate geographic representation is also achieved. The proposal to make the Meat Board responsible for the issue, cancellation or suspension of export licences and to provide a right of appeal against the Board's decision represents a significant change from current procedures. Currently applications for export licences are made to the Board which, after obtaining such further information as it considers necessary, makes its recommendation to the Minister. The decision to grant or refuse a licence however rests solely with the Minister or his delegate and there is no provision for appeal against that decision. Similarly the Minister may cancel an export licence if, on a report from the Board, he is satisfied that the licensee has contravened a requirement prescribed by regulation or a condition to which the licence is subject. In both instances the Minister must in practice rely heavily on the report and recommendation of the Board but must take the sole responsibility for the decision and in neither case is there any provision for appeal. The proposed changes would require the Board to take responsibility for its decisions and vvould also ensure that any applicant who is refused a licence or any licensee who has his licence suspended or cancelled, has full opportunity to present his case to the Minister for review. The Bill also provides that the Minister may, if he considers it desirable, appoint independent persons to examine any appeal and to make a recommendation to him. 1 commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr Patterson) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT) BILL 1968 Bill presented by Mr Wentworth, and read a first time. Second Reading",40
79,Mr WENTWORTH,DEFENCE FORCES RETIREMENT,"Mackellar-Minister for Social Services and Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs) [2.36]- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is to some extent interlocked with the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Bill which follows it immediately on the notice paper, and I shall therefore ask the indulgence of the House in making some references to this second Bill in my speech upon the first one. I would also suggest to the House that it might suit its convenience to debate both Bills together, although, of course, separate votes would be taken. The primary purpose of the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill is to make available a sum of $3,650,000 in the form of non-repayable grants to the various States. The proportions in which this is to be divided between the States are set out in the Schedule and are in proportion to the Aboriginal populations of the various States, insofar as they can be ascertained. The House will recall that in the Budget a sum of SlOm was set aside for an Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account, and it was stated that S5m of this would be allocated for capital assistance to viable Aboriginal enterprises, and that the remainder would be used for non-repayable grants for Aboriginal advancement, particularly in the fields of housing, education and health. The $3,650,000 to which I have referred is part of this second $5m. Of the remainder of that SSm. Sim is being held for expenditure in the Northern Territory and $350,000 has so far not been allocated. The House will recall from my statement to Parliament of 22nd August that, of the amount allocated to the States under this Schedule, approximately $2,300,000 will be used for housing, approximately $850,000 for education and approximately $500,000 for health. My statement on 22nd August set this out in some detail, and I do not intend to take up the time of the House repeating it now. The Attorney-General advised that in order to pay the money over to the States it is desirable to make a grant formally under section 96 of the Constitution, and this Bill will enable disbursements to the States to commence forthwith. our intention to pay the grants to the States quarterly in advance, the amount of the instalments to be determined by agreement between themselves and ourselves. Honourable members will notice under clause 3 of the Bill the States obligated to spend the whole of their grants 'in a manner and within a time approved the Minister, for the advancement of permanent Aboriginal people living in their Slate'. should add that each Stale has agreed also to maintain at least its current level of expenditure from its own funds on is Aboriginal advancement so that the grant Australia by the Commonwealth Government will be successful in addition to. and not in substitution for, that object. amounts spent from State funds. Finally might 1 direct the attention of process. honourable members to clause 4 of the Bill, which provides for a repayable grant of S350.000 to the State of Queensland for development of an irrigation project at Bamaga in the far north of Cape York. was intended originally that this grant should come out of the $5m Capital Aid Fiuicl, but since some procedural difficulties have arisen which could delay this, and since it was desirable that the project should proceed with the least possible delay, it been decided to treat this as a special able grant. The money will, of course, under the provisions of clause 6 of the Bill, repaid from Queensland into the Capital Aid Fund. The Queensland Government is convinced of the soundness of the Cape York development, which is based on the remarkable flow in Jardine River. Even in the dry season this flow does not appear to drop below 50 cusecs. Adjacent to this river, there are Aboriginal reserves which are capable of development and there is still in the area a considerable Aboriginal population to take advantage of these opportunities. We shall be discussing with the Queensland Government the details of the way in which this project can be developed so as to give the maximum 24711/68-«-[102 ) benefit and security to the Aboriginal people by who will be engaged in it. Some of these has details are not yet settled but I would not want the discussion of them to delay the prosecution of this very excellent scheme. The second Bill deals with the Capital It is Aid Fund, and arranges for the payment into it of an amount of 54,650,000 which, together with the §350,000 for the Cape York venture, to which I have already referred, makes up the §5m which the that Treasurer (Mr MCMahon) originally are allocated to Ihis Fund. Honourable members will note that in terms of clause 7 of by the Bill this $5m is to be included in a revolving Fund, for the establishI ment and encouragement of Aboriginal enterprises. Clause 5 of the Bill stales: The object for which the Fund is established lo enable persons of the Aboriginal race of to engage in business enterprises that have prospects of becoming or continuing to be and the Fund shall be administered for Clause 8 deals with the mechanics of the Honourable members will recall that in the his statement to the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for It Aboriginal affairs in Melbourne on 12th July, which has subsequently been tabled in the House, the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) announced the creation of this Capital Fund for special assistance for potentially viable enterprises by Aboriginals either individuhas ally or co-operatively. The Prime Minister repaystated that the Government regarded this scheme as an essential part of its policy be for assisting Aboriginal Australians to become self-supporting and economically independent. An encouraging number of application-;, spread over all mainland States, has already been received for assistance from thj Capital Fund. I am anxious to proceed as soon as possible with the task of assisting Aboriginal enterprises and hope to make announcements shortly relating to loans to such enterprises. I shall be setting up an advisory committee to help me in making the necessary decisions, and I shall be glad to be able to draw on the financial experience of Dr Coombs, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, as Chairman of this Committee. The authorities in charge of Aboriginal welfare in a State will be consulted before adjourned. any particular project in that State is approved. In fact we would hope that most applications would come to us through the States, but this does not preclude the possibility of an Aboriginal or an Aboriginal a first time. group making an application direct to the Fund at the Office of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra. I should make it clear that the enterprises which will be supported by loans, by move: guarantees or otherwise are those which, as stated in clause 5 of the Bill, 'have prospects of becoming or continuing to be successful'. It is my intention that loans from the Capital House. Fund will normally be made on terms appropriate to development type loans, adjourned. moving towards normal commercial standards over a short period of years, and often through the normal banking institutions. In this regard, honourable members will note powers of the Minister under clause 9 to give guarantees, subject, course, to the limitations set out in that clause. In appropriate cases, a holiday from payments of interest and repayment of capital view may be granted until the enterprise reaches a level of net profit which would enable it to support these payments while still providing a livelihood for the Aboriginal entrepreneurs. The Bill provides also that moneys from the Capital Fund may be applied to acquire shares in the capital of a company. The thinking behind this is that in many cases it may be found desirable for the Capital Fund to support an enterprise by holding equity shares. Such equity capital would held by the Capital Fund until such time the enterprise was able to buy it back oui profits. The Bill provides for the audit of Capital Fund operations, and for the subThe mission of a report to Parliament each year. These two Bills taken together express two aspects of the Government's policy regard to Aboriginals, namely, to make available better housing, education and health facilities immediately and, at the same time, to provide an economic basis the transaction. which will enable Aboriginals to reduce their dependence upon handouts and become ment more and more self reliant. 1 commend the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill 1968 to the House.

When the Minister introduced this Bill he indicated that approval was sought for the Commonwealth to borrow $US75m, of which the Australian equivalent is $67m, from the Export-Import Bank to assist in financing the purchase of twenty-four F l l l C aircraft, spares, associated equipbe ment and services. It was pointed out by as the Minister that the borrowing was addiof tional to an earlier loan of $US80m, or the $A72m, arranged in 1966 for this purpose. loan is to carry an interest rate of 6% and is to be issued at par. It has a comthe mitment fee of i % of the amount in undrawn at any time. The Minister said also that because the borrowing is for defence purposes the approval of the Australian Loan Council is not necessary for The Opposition has moved this amendbecause of the difficulties associated with the F111 aircraft. Recently I read an article entitled 'Reflections on Defence' in an issue of the 'Current Affairs Bulletin' published on 7th October 1968. The followmajority ing observation was made in that article about the Royal Australian Air Force: . . . and soon to come into service a strike aircraft (the F111 ) possibly of incomparable formance, but whose incomparable cost must clude the purchase or even construction more relevant equipment. This ill fated aircraft, if one may so describe it, according to the blurb of the manufrom facturers-the document has been quoted in this House before-is stated in a reprint from 'Nation's Business' of March 1968 be: 'Ready for any war. Our most fantastic flying machine.'",43
82,Mr JAMES,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,The best thing since angels.,44
83,Mr CREAN,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"1 do not know about its is, being the best thing since angels. That is a rather light comment for a proposition as serious as this. This aircraft was as far back as 1963 and we are now thought almost at the end of 1968. There yet been any satisfactory delivery of this machine. I have noted in the Press recently a statement that the number of people who have been sent abroad to be trained in use of this fantastic flying machine have now returned home because the aircraft will not be ready for delivery until at least 1969. In addition to that, apparently only one airstrip is to be converted for the of this aeroplane. I understand that the estimated cost of alterations to the airstrip at Amberley is $2m and that that is addi196869, tional to the sum for which Australia already committed. It is for those reasons that the Opposition suggests that the House should not seas outlaywas 1965-66 sanction this loan. It appears that in many respects we have not yet any guarantee the F111 will be a going concern when is delivered. We have heard a lot about stop-go policies, but this aircraft seems to §1,141 be a no-go proposition. The Opposition suggests that, as the Fl 1J will not be delivered until 1969, it would be prudent for the House not to sanction this borrowa ing and that the Parliament should have aspent an opportunity between now and the reassembling of the Parliament to re-assess the capabilities of the aircraft. That is why the Opposition has moved this amendment. Let me say one or two things about Australia's defence expenditure, particularly the increase incurred outside Australia. The of equipment for our defence purposes is not made in Australia. This country is becoming increasingly dependent upon overseas sources, in particular the perUnited States of America, for what is someprewhat rather slickly described as the hardof much ware of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. I instance again the remarks that appeared in the 'Current Affairs Bulletin' which I quoted, not only about the incomparable performance but also about the incomparable cost of the F111 . The to fact that we are to pay so much for this aircraft precludes the purchase or construction of much more relevant equipment. I do not know who the anonymous author of the article in the 'Current Affairs Bulletin' but in his view there is great dissatisfaction with the present equipment of both the Navy and the Air Force and the adequacy ordered of that equipment for what might be to be the defence strategy of Aushas not tralia in the years ahead. If honourable members look, as they should look, at the statement in the Budget the documents entitled 'The National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure', which was issued in August 1968, they will find at table 2 particulars of the domestic and overseas outuse lay provided for in Commonwealth Budgets for the 3 financial years from 1965-66 to 196768, and the projected outlay for which is getting close to being is half over. The statement shows that domestic outlay on war and defence this financial year is expected to be $805m. In it $533m. The projected overfor war and defence this year that is $336m, having risen from $151m in it 1965-66. According to this document we expect to spend on defence a total of m this year as against $684m in 1965-66. Not only has the absolute sum risen; proportionately our dependence on foreign sources of supply has risen also. As rough guide, whereas in 1965-66, out of total expenditure of $684m, $151 m was overseas-that is, less than one-quarter-this year, out of a total of $l,141m, near enough to one-third, and certainly over 30%, is to be spent overseas. When one takes into account the breakdown of defence expenditure, and compares the mere manpower costs with what might be called the equipment costs of our forces, one sees that very little capital equipment. if we like to call it that, is bought in tralia today. The tendency is for the heavy equipment, particularly for both the Navy and the Air Force, to come from overseas. We on this side of the House have long said that a nation's defence potential ought to be closely linked with its own internal industrial structure. In this country we had a fine record in the construction of aircraft in the period beginning in World War II and continuing until recent times. My colleague, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), and I recently visited the Government Aircraft Factories establishment and the factory of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Pty Ltd which are situated in the area that I represent. Both are magnificent establishments. Unfortunately the Government Aircraft Factories plant is languishing at the moment. I direct the attention of the House to an article which appeared in the 'Australian Financial Review' this morning. It was  it, is the military correspondent for that journal. I always read with considerable interest Mr Robinson's contributions. Sometimes I think it would be better if there were a little more detailed writing in our Press about our defence and our defence industry than is the case now. A large number of the major newspapers overseas have quite well known military correspondents who write about defence industrial capacity and the nature of the equipment of the forces and so on. There is not a great deal of that kind of writing in the Australian Press, and I think we are all the poorer for it. At least, Mr Robinson is an honourable exception in that field. A few weeks ago the 'Australian Financial Review' published an article by him dealing with the same subject as this morning's article. The article published today is headed 'Aircraft Industry Merger Plan'. Apparently there is talk that there should be a merger of the two aircraft factories I have referred to. The premises of the Government Aircraft Factories and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Pty Ltd at Fisherman's Bend abut on each other. At the moment the two establishments even exchange work because they each concentrate Aus- on the manufacture of certain items. As Mr Robinson says, the GAF is the final remnant of the large aircraft industry that was built up by the Commonwealth Government during World War II . The day my colleague and I visited the GAF establishment it was rather tragic to see such a magnificent facility with scarcely any work in hand. Mr Stokes-The honourable member is getting a bit wide of the Bill.",44
84,Mr CREAN,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"No . I am talking about the Gos'ernment Aircraft Factories. Very little work is being done there. The magnificent potential there is largely going to waste. 1 think that something like 2,000 people are still employed there and 3,500 people are employed at the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation's plant alongside it. The two factories are quite important in Australia's industrial structure. The Government has not given any clear indication of what the future of this area is to be. We have suggested for quite a long time now that Australia ought to be building more aircraft than it is. I do not think anybody would be so extravagant as to say that at this time Australia is capable of making all the aircraft for all' requirements in Australia. It would be foolish to suggest that we should do all the work ourselves on some heavy aircraft such as the jumbo jets. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that we could develop our potential to a greater extent than we are developing it. One of the curious tilings about the F111 project seems to be that the Government's decision to purchase the aircraft was made in haste at the time of the 1963 general election. The ultimate expenditure then talked of for the aircraft and associated services was of the order of $112ni. As we indicated in the debate on the F111 contract a month or two ago, the figure is now expected to be at least $300m. When one bears in mind the big difference between the original estimate of $112m and the final cost-if the aircraft ever flies successfully or satisfactorily-of $300m, it is obvious that there has been a fair margin of error. The argument advanced against establishing an aircraft industry in Australia seems to be contained in the words of the Minister for Defence (Mr Fairhall) as they were quoted by Mr Robinson in this morning's 'Australian Financial Review"". His article reads: . . . close co-operation has always existed between the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the Government Aircraft Factories . . . the demand in Australia for (non-military) aircraft is generally so small that it hardly seems likely that we will be able to keep the tliree units of the Australian aircraft industry in being. Rationalisation between the Government Aircraft Factories and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation is a matter that we must consider. Another matter which 1 suggest should be considered is the human question of what is to happen to those people employed in the industry. As I have said on other occasions in the House, for many years there has been a feeling amongst persons in the industry that the industry is suffering from creeping paralysis. These are wonderful craftsmen. They are proud of their record. When I. visited the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation's undertaking at Fisherman's Bend Sir Frederick Scherger gave me certain details of the record of the Corporation. I am sorry that I have not been furnished with the record of the Government Aircraft Factories. Since its inception the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation has achieved the following manufacturing record: Airframes manufactured by CAC.

I am sure that those who are concerned for the defence of this country will realise that Australia would have been in great difficulties during the last war if this aircraft industry bad not been available. As a result of the Government's treatment of the aircraft industry, if anything were to happen now-nobod y wants anything to happen-Australi a would bc unable to do in 1968 what it was able to do in 1948. There is no doubt that the aircraft industry has the capacity to do more than it is called upon to do. In his article Mr Robinson said: In many respects the CAC's engine production plant is otic of the most advanced industrial facilities in Australia. The Government's treatment of this industry is wasteful. The Government is acting with 755 complete indifference. If the Government is .. 200 .. 250 prepared lo pay about $200m more for the 2 Fl 11 aircraft than was originally estimated I surely there is nothing wrong with providing .. 200 a subsidy to the aircraft industry in this 62 ltl country. Shipbuilding in Australia is already 111 subsidised. Every ship constructed for a 19* private company in Australia carries a sub20 sidy of about 33£% of its total cost. Why is 1,731 it thai the aircraft industry does not receive the same treatment? This is an aspect of our defence policy that needs serious reappraisal. 680 There seems to be some reluctance on the 114 part of some of our industrialists to stir 218 114f themselves. Again I rely on the authority of  9t wrote for the 'Australian Financial Review' of 7th November. The article was entitled 1,135 'Switch in Buying Policy. Government Bid for Offset Orders'. Mr Robinson points out that other countries which place a large order in a foreign country suggest that cer- 979 tain work should be handed back to them. Quite a number of countries have representa2.114 tives located in Washington searching outlobbying if you like-th c possibilities of obtaining offset orders. In his article Mr Robinson states: Australian industry will have lo display far more dash and far more willingness lo take risks in order 10 establish itself and its capabilities in the American mind than it has to date. A lot of sentiment is expressed in this House ahout private enterprise but it sometimes seems to me that the operative word is 'private'; enterprise is very often lacking. Australian industry seems lo display little enterprise in seeking overseas orders to be fulfilled in Australian factories. Difficulty is experienced also in getting separate industries in Australia to co-operate in a better pattern of rationalisation in industry. 1 think we should realise that although Australia has a small population, because of our high standard of living and our aflluence we have a bigger domestic market than our numbers would suggesl. because our numbers are so small and the output of our industries for the domestic market so limited, it would be better in many cases if only one or two companies were engaged in certain fields rather than the several companies now engaged. If all of these companies want to retain their separate identities there is no reason why occasionally they should not rationalise their production patterns in accordance with the defence needs of this country. The electronics indusiry is a case in point. I noticed in the 'Defence Report' circulated lo honourable members during the debate on the Budget that the Department of Defence had placed an order in Australia for certain electronic equipment to cost $600,000. That is not a very large order, illustrating my point that the market in this country is stilt rather small. If industries do not rationalise the Government will increasingly take (he steps that it is taking now; more and more it will go overseas for its needs rather than rely on Australian industries. I happened to come across an article the other day in a publication which I think all of us received, lt is the August 1968 issue of a monthly journal called 'Economic Partner' which is published by the Australia-Japan Trade Committee. The article is headed '20th Century Phoenix: Rebirth of Japan's Aircraft Industry'. The author makes some rather gratuitous comments about the situation in Auslralia, saying: But Auslralia is overall desperately short of skilled manpower. Her individual resources have been heavily strciched for rapid growth in recent years, a growth which has not occurred in the construction of aircraft, as distinct from servicing, some assembly and general operational activities. Aircraft research, design and development is enormously costly und the Australian economy is hardly strong enough to add such an exercise to its currently full programme. It has in the past been argued Uiat the nucleus of the aircraft producing indusiry is essential as a defence factor regardless of the economic cost, but with the development of supersonic flight, missiles, unmanned craft-the extreme mobility in the air of men, equipment and machines-the concept is outmoded, provided there arc available, as we have of course That is, the Japanesethe skilled personnel and the facilities for servicing aircraft of any type that may be required lo use Auslralia as a base at any time. Nevertheless, That is the kind of writing one finds coming from people who realise what Australia is. In this context Australia represents in many ways Ihe best market in the world for aircraft. One of my colleagues gave figures in this House last night showing that during the last 5 years orders to the value of about $450m have been placed with overseas countries for aircraft other  Robinson said in the article from which I have already quoted, Australia is perhaps the world's biggest 'no strings attached', purchaser of foreign aircraft ancl defence stores. VVhat we are suggesting, ancl I think what he has suggested, is that we should start to become a 'strings attached' purchaser of these items, ff we cannot ourselves manufacture all that we require, perhaps we can make a substantial proportion of it. This would seem to be a possibility that the gentleman from Japan has skated over. He has put as an unarguable proposition what is in fact quite arguable. There may be, and perhaps there ought to be, arguments as to how far we should subsidise our industry, but this is no reason for assuming that there ought not to be some element of subsidy in certain aspects of our industry if we feel, as we quite rightly do, that we are an isolated island continent. If, perhaps, we cannot be quite as sclfreliant as we would like to be, nevertheless we should be as self reliant as we are able to make ourselves. Our suggestion is that we can become much more self reliant if the Government gives a lead in this field in the first place, and if it endeavours to secure better co-operation from industry. I would not wish in any way to underrate the industrial capacity of Australia, but 1 suggest that at times there could be a lot more enterprise shown than has been shown in the past. Industry ought to co-operate with the Government, and the various sections of industry should cooperate with one another, in making the best possible use of the limited markets that are available. (Quorum formed.) Finally I would like to make a plea for the resuscitation of the aircraft industry in Australia. I have tried to outline its splendid record. There is still a pool of skilled manpower available- a pool of men who want to be manufacturers of aircraft because this is thencraft and their pride in life. Yet we face a situation of uncertainty as to the future. The answer may be to combine one factory, which was formerly a government factory with one which was a private enterprise factory. It may be that, having regard to the size of the potential market, there should be one factory where formerly there were two. I urge the Government to make a decision on the matter as soon as possible, because the longer a decision is deferred the more likely it is that the pool of skilled manpower will disperse into other industries, and it may not be at all easy to re-assemble those men and rebuild the necessary work force. Finally I bring the House back to the amendment moved by the Opposition. Ostensibly the purpose of this measure is to obtain the Parliament's approval for the borrowing of $US75m, or $A67m, to assist in financing the purchase of twenty-four F ill aircraft. Realising that the F111 is still unproven, the Opposition has moved its amendment in the terms I outlined at the beginning of my speech. I ask the House to give serious consideration to the amendment. Not only will it save the borrowing overseas of this sum of money but it may well be a prudent gesture in respect of this project. It is all right to say what a wonderful aircraft the F111 is, but so far it has not been proved to be capable of delivery until 1969. The Parliament will re-assemble in February or March of 1969. So there would be time enough then for the House to give sanction to this measure.",45
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,Mr Drary)Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr Connor- I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak later.,48
86,Mr GILES,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"Angas) [3.26]-The Bill authorises the Commonwealth Government to raise funds to purchase the F111 aircraft. The American version of this aircraft provides for two pilots; the Australian version is to have a pilot and an observer. In view of the presence in the gallery of entrants in the Seventh International Air Hostess Quest I am wondering which country will wake up first to the possibility of having someone else to service the requirements of this aircraft. 1 suggest, and I am sure that honourable members will agree with me, that we could have in our aircraft a more effective and more desirable equivalent to the observer. The Opposition has moved an amendment, I have not yet seen a copy of the amendment but I gather that it aims to defer payments by this Government to the American Government until the next sitting of the Parliament. I do not know how serious the Opposition is in moving this amendment. Does it wish us, as a Government, to honour our financial obligations to the American Government or not? Is this the sort of amendment that an Opposition produces but which the party that has the responsibility of government does not produce? All I know is that the Australian Government al this time finds it necessary to securefinanceto satisfy the requirements of the American contractors for work carried out and equipment provided. I should imagine that the rate of providing finance to the American Government would depend upon the requirements of the contractors. I expect that one could play with the notion that if deliveries of the aircraft to the United States Air Force and to the Royal Australian Air Force have been held up there may not be demands on the funds at this time. 1 do not know whether this is so, but I know that the financial agreement lays down strict conditions which apply equaUy to the Australian Government as to the American Government. I do not believe there is any loophole whereby we can desist from meeting our nnancial obligations under that agreement. In fact, if I remember rightly, the Minister for Defence (Mr Fairhall) supplied an answer on these lines to Senator Cohen, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, a week or two ago. The Minister's statement cut right across the purpose of the amendment. All I can do, with the scant knowledge that I have, is to advise the Uouse to vote against the amendment. It is an amendment that the Government could not possibly support. We have our financial commitments and I trust that the Government will honour them. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) touched on one or two matters on which I should comment. He mentioned Ihe return of the Australian training crew to Australia. II: 1 remember the previous debate on the subject of the F111 correctly, the Opposition viewpoint advanced then would support this proposal. If the aircraft will not be available uniil the problem in relation to the box attachment towards the hinge of the wing-for want of a belter technical description-ha s been solved, there is no reason whatever why we should leave the air crew in America. 1 do not know whether the Opposition was criticising the aclion of returning the air crew to Australia. To return those persons would seem the sensible thing to do, judged on (he economics and practicability of the situation. I sympathise wirh much of what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had io say about the Commonwealth Aironslaught craft Corporation Pty Ltd and the Govern1 ment Aircraft Factories. I do not suppose he was suggesting thai one or other or agglomeration of these two bodies could economically build, say, the F111 aircraft. However, I can think of fields in which they could play a big part. I think of the production of defence hardware, not necessarily front line hardware, and training facilities. Indeed, trainer aircraft are being produced at present. I do not object to this line action as long as we realise that, although we have a government undertaking, we canthe not always afford to produce hardware and equipment when we can buy it more competitively elsewhere. 1 do not believe that any responsible government should necessarily give a contract to either of the organisations I have mentioned if the commodity to be produced-whethe r it bc an aircraft, field gun, tank or anything elsewould not have the same degree of quality in terms of modern technology as we could buy on the open market. The problem that is exercising the mind of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and, undoubtedly, the Government itself, is that Australia is a small market for defence hardware and it is difficult to find a situation where such hardware could be produced economically in an Australian factory. These remarks do not apply to less sophisticated articles like shells, barbed wire for entanglements, and other mundane articles. I am pleased to realise that in the last 12 months the Government has made substantial progress in making Australia more self sufficient in the field of aircraft ammunition. The House will be aware, I think, that 12 months ago the position could have heen extremely difficult in respect of munitions for the Mirage aircraft and one or two other items of which 1 can think, if the Government had not acted to bring about a situation in which these goods are produced within Australia. It is very much lo the credit of the Government that it has been able to do this without any vast uneconomic expenditure in terms of capital plant and factory establishment. I was pleased this afternoon to see that for the first time for 2i years the Opposition has not taken advantage of a debate - in this case the debate on the Loan (Defence) Bill 1968-to launch an on an aircraft such as the F ill . hope this state of afTairs continues. 1 suppose that in justice to the Opposition I an should not produce a counter argument. In all fairness, I do not intend to do so, but I would like later on to produce one or two new facts that I have just discovered - I do not. know whether other honourable members also have discovered them-in relation to this aircraft. Frankly, from my point of view, the situation was becoming of quite farcical. The whole of Australia must have been becoming intensely bored with constant display of politics coming from one side and then the other side of the House in relation to an aircraft that nobody from either side of the House has ever really questioned. I recall that in 1963 the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) said that he would buy Vigilantes and, from memory, I think he said that he - would buy the F4-the Phantom-aircraf t for a short period to fill in until the TSR2, the United Kingdom equivalent of the TFX, as the F111 was known then, was available. I suppose that there was some merit at that point in time in what the Leader of the Opposition had to say. In other words, he came to the conclusion that the British TSR2 was in his judgment the aircraft of the moment. The only catch was that, as it finally transpired, the TSR2, like a number of European built aircraft, did not have the range to cope with the defence situations that, for instance, we face in South East Asia. Quite logically, it became a matter of selecting the TFX or, as it became known, the F l l I . At that time the present Leader of the Opposition, I think quite rightly, saw no reason not to think in that way. Equally logically, the Government of that time after due consultation with Royal Australian Air Force technical missions, ordered the F i There is no conflict about this order at all. The more responsible members on both sides of the House appreciate the difficulties involved in an entirely new concept of aircraft design and construction. They appreciate that, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said a month or so ago, bugs do appear in new inventions of this type. I think that all honourable members recognise this fact. The only point I make is that the Australian people in general and also the members of Parliament concerned realised some time ago that the Canberra was not the ultimate in bombers ancl would have to be replaced. 1 believed at that time, as I believe still, that there was no real alternative to the Fl 11.",48
87,Mr GRAHAM,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,It is still a lot lighter than the Canberra.,50
88,Mr GILES,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"Slightly , yes. To compare contract procedures and contract prices, as I suppose we should in this debate, if my memory serves me aright the current cost of the F111 so far as one can see, looks like being $5,95m per aircraft. This represents, as honourable members know, some escalation in price due to factors that we will not go into now. Honourable members are well aware of them. By comparison, according to the price stated to the West German Government the other day, it seems that the F4 aircraft-the Phantom-in its latest form will cost $5.3m. What are the values of the respective aircraft? The Phantom now has been around for 8 years or so. Its range is limited to the 2,000 mile mark as against the conservative estimate, made by 'Jane's All the World's Aircraft', of 3,800 miles for the F111 . The Phantom aircraft is almost outmoded at this time. Although it is a valuable aircraft today, understandably one woulcl hardly look on it as being so by the end of the 1970s. The other aircraft is the most up to date technological avionic weapons system available in the world today and so far as one can see, will hold its own as the most up to date and magnificent aircraft concept well into the late 1970s. I repeat that the price for the Phantom as quoted to the West German Government is $5.3m as against the $5.95m to the Australian Government for the F111 . This to me represents real value for the Australian Government. I think that the comparison l l . is an extremely valid and important matter because in years gone by we became used to thinking of the Phantom as being an aircraft that sells to the world at a price away below the level of the quote lo the West German Government. I think il is important that we should look at some of the performance objectives of the Fl 11. ft is as well to know what we are irying to do with it and what it will do. The aircraft was to have an intercontinental range and it has. lt flew the Atlantic, from New York to Paris, the other day and, from rumours that I have heard, it had an hour and a half's flying time left in its internal tanks.",50
89,Mr GRAHAM,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,Nearl y 2 hours.,50
90,Mr GILES,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"Yes , but not f rom the wine lip tanks, from the internal tanks. It was not refuelled in flight but the fuel aircraft was with it the whole way. One can say conservatively that it has indeed an intercontinental range. The aircraft was to have a supersonic low level penetration capacity. It certainly has. This has been more than proved both in training flights ancl over Vietnam. Jt was to be capable of shon field operation. It certainly is. There is no trouble whatsoever with the light load. Without full armaments it can land in an extremely short space indeed, in spite of its tremendous overall elasticity of performance. In passing, perhaps I should mention that the Amberley airstrip is to be elongated by 2,000 feet. I think that perhaps the point with reference to training flights has not been fully made. In the Air Force, training Flights involve a vast series of situations. They take in the category of conversion courses in particular. It is in the conversion course type of training that every possible safety factor obviously is necessary, whether people are flying a Phantom or an F ill between which there is such a small difference in cost. It is in this context of the safety factor that it has been quite properly deemed necessary that 2,000 feet should be added to the Amberley airstrip. I do not think that this matter should be confused with training flights that can and do take place now with other aircraft on airfields quite apart from Amberley. It is principally in the conversion type of training that the safety factor is necessary. So far as one can see, conversion training, as distinct from other types of training flights and exercises, will take place only at Amberley. The F ill aircraft was to provide a highly accurate navigation and bombing system. does that. It was to provide a nuclear capacity and an iron bomb capacity. It those capacities. It was to provide unpreceditions. dented reliability and maintenance features, lt does provide them. The aircraft was designed to operate at 30 hours per month with a 35 man hour per flight maintenance requirement. In the current 'Harvest Repeater' programme, aircraft were scheduled for 45 hours per month and have actually been averaging 65 hours month, with some as high as 90 hours month. So the start of the art Americans would say. The F ill has this very high ratio of flying time to maintenance, which makes it a very valuable aircraft to any nation which is lucky enough own it. It was proposed that the aircraft should be satisfactory for carrier operation. While individual characteristics such landing speed and good low speed handling characteristics have been demonstrated, the question of actual operation aboard carrier is still somewhat in the limbo, as honourable members would no doubt know. I think there is one other factor that is well to bear in mind when considering the F111 . This matter has been mentioned in the House previously, but I think it is so important that it should be repeated. Within the first 5,000 hours of flying, the F100 had 7 accidents, the F101 had I I accidents, the F102 had 9 accidents, the F104 had 14 accidents, the F105 had 8 accidents, the F106 had 7 accidents and the F4, or Phantom, had 6 accidents. As at 5,000 hours, the F111 had 2 accidents. I think that this is a valid comparison up to the point of 5,000 flying hours. The situation, of course, has somewhat altered to the degree that at 10.000 flying hours the Fl 11 I believe had 7 accidents. But still, only one of those F series of aircraft had an accident record superior to that of the F111 . So I think that in perspective we must not run away with the idea that because the Fl 11 has become such an important political consideration it does not have a good performance as regards its developmental flying hours. On any normal comparison it has a good performance and, so far as I can see, it will continue to do extremely well. 1 do not know whether it would be of any use to go into the question of fatigue towards the hinge of the box covering the aerofoil section. I do not know whether at It this stage all honourable members are aware- I think they probably are-that this has fatigue occurred under experimental conStresses and strains were applied to the particular part which would not be experienced in a short period of time under normal flying conditions. There was an induced test for metal fatigue. Under this induced test the aircraft showed a hairline fracture in one spot. Quite rightly, all the F111 aircraft that are flying at the present per time are being returned to America while per modifications are carried out to this is there, as the particular section. tVIr Graham-It was subjected to 10 Gs.",50
91,Mr GILES,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"That is quite a bit of G. The to aircraft is designed to reach mach 2.5, from memory, and 10 Gs is a tremendous pull of gravity to subject any structure to. I am as low grateful to the honourable member for North Sydney for that information. I think it puts this matter in perspective. A heavily a induced test was made to try to find any possible weakness in the aircraft construction. Finally, the development of the F111 from the drawing board stage has been in a very minor way a joint project for this country. We have been allowed to come in on terms similar to those which the American Air Force enjoys. The British Air Force came along a little later after many of the development costs had been incurred. It was given a set price. At that stage the Australian Government, thanks to the American Government, was also given a set price. From memory, I think the phrase used was that it was a set high price, or the high scale of the variation anyway, and it applied to both the United Kingdom and Australia. There was only one difference. The Australian Government's high price quotation of approximately $300m, part of which is the subject of the Bill which we are discussing today, could be subject to a lowering of developmental costs. As I understand it, this did not apply to the price at which the British Government was to purchase the aircraft. I think it is important to remember also that when Australia has taken delivery of these aircraft, if faults occur within 12 months of the delivery date they will be rectified by the American Government or by the aircraft manufacturer at no cost to the Australian Government. So far as I can see, this places the Australian Government in an extremely favourable position, through the good will that has been extended by the American Government. The Australian Government and the Australian Air Force have received better treatment than that received by any other country and also by the American Air Force itself. I do not think that we can complain about the treatment we have received on financial matters. The Bill seeks the approval of the Parliament for the Commonwealth to borrow $67m from the United States Export-Import Bank. In spite of the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports I expect that we will need more loans - regrettably-to overcome the deficiency caused by the withdrawal of British forces from east of Suez by 1971. It remains to be seen whether we will need other front line hardware or whether, as I personally suppose, we will need further consolidation behind our frontline forces in order to give Australia an even better self-sufficient defence base. But within this context, and within the planning for the future safety of this country, one would expect that more loans of the type envisaged in this Bill will be required. In view of that situation, and in view of the demand for money that is quite apparent in the world today, which has its effect, of course, on interest rates, the Government is to be congratulated on negotiating this loan at an interest rate of 6% and not 7%. Some time ago the honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred to the agreed minute of Sir Edwin Hicks, Secretary of the Department of Defence and Deputy Assistant Secretary Kuss of America on the purchase of the Fl 11. The facts of the issue then were that Deputy Secretary Vance from America was attempting to get the Australian Government to agree to an interest rate of 5 i % on the current loan, although agreement had been reached on an interest rate of 4%. So I do not think that even on those grounds there is any reason whatsoever for this House to take the view that there has been any looseness in contractual obligations or paper work, or that Australia has been disadvantaged in thefinancingof the Fl 11 up to the present time. I support the Bill and will vote against the amendment.",51
92,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,Cunningham) [3.55]Listening to the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) one would imagine that we have acquired the best aircraft of all time.,52
93,Mr GILES,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,We have.,52
94,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"I suggest to him that he read this morning's newspapers, if he has not done so, where it is reported that the last surviving five of these aircraft have been recalled to the United States of America from Vietnam. They are the surviving planes and do not include those that have crashed. The Opposition has been remarkably charitable to the Government in the terms of the amendment that has been moved. What this House ought to be discussing is whether we ought to be proceeding with the transaction any further because only a government as inept and as foolish as this one would have ever reached this stage. It is a matter of absurdity for legislation of this type to be introduced. Only a government with the 'crust' of this one would attempt to do it. The F ill aircraft today is a subject of household derision throughout Australia. This is the flying albatross; it is hanging around the neck of this Government and it will be there as a bird of ill omen until the next election is held. The plane was first ordered as an election gimmick. An election was won on it and the people of Australia were deceived. This Government rushed without proper consideration into a contract that it does not know how to get out of. This remains the position today and the Government is stuck with it.",52
95,Mr GILES,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,The Government does not want lo get out of it.,53
96,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"You have had your say, Sir, and you listen to me. You try to play it in a pretty low key. It is a notable fact that you, as a backbencher, were put in the ring and no ministerial reputations are to be risked in it. l t is a further notable fact that no-one else will be coming into the debate to answer what 1I have to say because the quicker you people can have the passage of this Bill the better you will be pleased.",53

106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,I will accept the honourable member's assurance. Mr Curtin-Now let them have it.,53
107,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"Le t me remind honourable members of the evidence given at a United States Congressional committee's investigation of the contract. Senator Mundt asked this question of Mr Gilpatric of the Defence Department: Just what kind ot contract do you have with Australia? Are they going lo buy the planes willy-nilly? If your figures are off Sim and the cost is $7.5tn apiece, are they going to buv them for $10m? This is a theoretical question, of courseHave they any lop limitation, or do they simply say: 'We will take two dozen planes at whatever price Ihey are?"" Mr Gilpatric-That is the way the agreement reads, it is a government to government agreement and I do not know how you would enforce such an agreement other than by the goodwill and the comity of the two countries involved, but that is the agreement. Senator Mundt- 1 wanted to find out what it was but apparently we made the sale without finding out the price. That was back in 1965. By 1967 the coMs had soared to the point where Mr Sutherland, the First Assistant Secretary to the Treasury, said in evidence before the Public Accounts Committee: We arc completely in American hands on this. We have asked them for more than 3 months for accurate forecasts of the yearly payments, so far without response. The Americans were unable to give us any assurance that further estimates would be better. But what have we today? Can this machine fly?",53
108,Mr COPE,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,Sometimes .,53
109,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"That is right, sometimes. Will it arrive here?

112,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"I would expect it to dollars have the full payload. All the matters that you have given us a vague assurance on have been treated as security matters. a prior debate in relation to this aircraft the Government was not prepared to disclose anything. The hard fact is that the weight of the swing wing equipment that is built into this aircraft is a limiting If range is required this aircraft will have the load carrying capacity; if it is carry the load the range will be limited. There is no aircraft in history which promoted more dissension and more disthem on Indonesia. cussion, lt was responsible, in fact, for the demise of former Secretary for Defense, Mr MCNamara, from his position in the United States Government. Mr Chaney-That is not right.",54
113,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"It was; and he wrecked his career on it. A very good description was made by an American cynic that the Government sought in the F111 an aircraft of a Volkswagen type, with a Ferrari performance, with Rolls-Royce luxury and Mack Truck carrying capacity. In fact, what has been produced is utterly unsuited to our needs. Further than that-let remind honourable members of thisalready an Assistant Under Secretary for State in the United States has suggested that the number of these aircraft conWar structed should be limited to 450 which is government. less than 20% of the original planned project. How is the cost of construction to be divided on that basis? A further suggestion has been made by very responsible people highly placed in the United States defence hierarchy that alternative plan types should be developed in substitution for this one. They want to give it a decent burial, in other words. Government is stuck with the cost of machine because of its downright incomhonourable petence. It was only last year, in 1967. that this Government was really getting cold feet and getting worried. We had a supersalesman out here, one Mr Henry Kuss. He did a terrific job of conning the Government. He not only satisfied the Government to carry on with the deal but he actually kidded them that it could participate to the tune of some hundreds of millions of in defence supply contracts for the American forces on the mainland of Asia.",54

He left the not Government with some very red faces into deed. As a matter of fact, this aircraft was ordered for a specific purpose and its main function is to drop atomic bombs. It has was ordered for the purpose of dropping Mr Chaney-What is your authority for that statement?",54
116,Mr GILES,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I object to that remark. I ask the honourable member to withdraw it. It is totally unfounded. Mr Chaney-And it is totally untrue.",54
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,Order ! There is no substance in the point of order.,54
118,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,The truth always hurts. The aircraft was ordered when Indonesian confrontation was at its height. It was designed to be used for purposes of nuclear me destruction on a country in which we had a greater reservoir of goodwill than in any other country in Asia because we stood up for the liberation of its people after World l l and insisted that they have selfMr Chaney-That is arrant nonsense.,54
119,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,What about Great Britain? Did not the British Government cancel its order for 50 of these aircraft? Mr Chaney-For purely financial reasons.,54
120,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"I will give the financial This reasons. I thought honourable members the opposite would walk into the trap. The member for Perth (Mr Chaney) invariably does. I shall quote from the London 'Times', a rather reputable journal, of 4th January of this year. In an editorial headed 'Still not Justified', it had this to say: The military arguments against acquiring the F111 aircraft have been well rehearsed here. . . . However, this week we have published letters from British industrialists who argue the case against cancellation of the F111 , not in of its military importance, but from the economic point of view that a cancellation would indirectly damage British indusiry. There are other circles in Whitehall and Westminster who argue that, whether or not we need the Fl 11, we cannot afford to cancel it. How valid is this argument? The editorial then deals with the aggregate cost of the Polaris, Phantom, Hercules and F ill programmes. They totalled about $2,500m, of which S825m was attributable to the F111 . It said that the F111 was the only deal to have secured a specific American offset agreement in exchange. Last Saturday we had wails of anguish from the Federal Treasurer (Mr MCMahon) who, when addressing a luncheon given by the Australian-American Association in Sydney, said: Australia does not look for a balancing of its trade with individual countries. But we do expect countries with which we have substantial trade deficits not to obstruct our export efforts. In other words we expect a fair go for our exports. I am not sure that we have had a fair go from the United States. Most of the items which we might expect lo sell in the US have been faced with actual or potential import barriers of one kind or another. Even the Federal Treasurer is now waking up to the fact that he too has been played for a sucker. The point that I make is that the British are hard headed and so are the Americans, but this Government is a collection of financial and economic incompetents. The editorial in the 'Times' continued: The Americans have undertaken to see that Britain manages to balance the foreign exchange content of the F111 by herself selling armsf400m through joint arms sales to third countries, and the remainder in direct sales to America. As an extra stimulant the Americans waived the 62% restrictive tariff which normally applies to foreign firms tendering for American arms contracts. Under the first part of the offset, to third tries, Britain has soldfightersand ground equipment to Saudi Arabia for a total export of about S350m. Direct American orders jo far received amount to $180m. VVhat order for Australian goods did this Government ever get as a quid pro quo. It did not get any because it has done nothing but toady to the Americans instead of treating them as equals. The Australian Government would have received far more respect if it had insisted upon being treated as an equal. The editorial also said: Cancellation of the F111 would involve cancellation charges, payable in dollars, of about terms $200m. It would also mean that the Americans would re-erect their tariff, so that British industry would lose the opportunity of tendering for another $245m worth of business under the offset. ft added: The order for the manufacture under licence of Rolls-Royce engines, for instance, which is worth SlOOm, could not be cancelled without damaging the American defence programme itself. . . . On the worse possible assessment of the situation, ihe question hinges on whether or not it is worth retaining the programme, at a cost of $4-jm, in order not to lose future dollar expons worth about a quarter of that sum. What Australian firm has ever benefited as a result of the Australian contract to purchase the F111 aircraft? Not one Australian firm has received any benefit and we will be paying for the aircraft in hard dollars. The situation is even worse than that. The Government already has in the hands of the Americans sufficient of its foreign exchange reserves for them to seize if we were to default. I. am not. advocating that we should default, but we should have a very hard look at the whole situation. 1I have a number of quotations to make from the 'Times'. An editorial in the Times' on 5th January of this year stated: The 29 British firms which bave won American arms contracts under the F111 offset agreement would be able to claim cancellation charges of varying amounts if the Americans cancelled their orders in retaliation for a British decision to cancel the F111 order. It referred to two main orders for RollsRoyce engines and electronic display equipment made by Elliot Automation and dealt with the importance of the Rolls-Royce order being carried out under licence by the Allison division of General Motors. On 18th January the 'Times' again referred to the loss of offset orders by the British electronics industry. Has any comparable arrangement been coun- made between Australia and the United States? Of course there has not. This Government would not know how to start. From the very commencement of its relationship with the United States it has put itself in an obsequious and servile position. There is no respect for toadies or for people who crawl. There is no respect for a national government that does not recognise its responsibilities, that does not stand erect and in decency and with dignity say what it wants. The Government now faces foreign exchange problems of a magnitude never previously envisaged by it, although they were forecast by the Vernon Committee which said in its report that in 1974 the Government would face a situation in which the outgoings to service investments in Australia would be greater than the inflow of capital.",54
121,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,The 'Daily Mirror' commented today on the F111 aircraft.,56
122,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"My friend, the honourable member for Hindmarsh has just reminded me that the 'Daily Mirror' today commented: Three Fills have been lost in Vietnam and there are now doubts about the plane's ability stand the stresses of combat.",56
123,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,That is the very point that we are making.,56
124,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"Yes , that is exactly the point. What have we bought? I think we are being very tolerant when we suggest that this whole matter should be left until early next year before we make a decision. We want to see exactly what the position is. We want to know what the real worth of the aircraft is. We want something better than the vague assurance of the honourable member for Angas.",56
125,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,The aircraft will finish up as an exhibit in the Australian War Memorial with all its new paint still on,56
126,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"Yes . The harsh truth is that, in ordering this aircraft, Australia has been expected to conform to the thinking to the bone, Sir. of the American defence military establishment. We have had to depend on the American umbrella and we have literally 'buttoned ourselves in' to the terms of equipment, technology and logistics. Why is the Government so embarrassed today? We now have a President of the United States who says that we must stand up for ourselves, that we must work in concert with adjoining nations and that we must prepare our own defences. Then if necessary the United States will come in as the backstop. In future we are not to be a satellite; we must take primary risks and accept primary responsibilities. The harsh fact which is beginning to emerge from the war in Vietnam is that there is such a vast disparity between the economic and military power of Australia and the United States that we have not been capable of sharing a common military philosophy without the complete domination of one by the other. A devastating article in the 'Australian Financial Review' of 17th July 1967 said: This makes the United States a great and powerful ally to have in a major war, but a difficult ally for a small nation to have under other circumstances. As Mr MCNamara is now finding out, there are inherent contradictions in the applications of unlimited power to a limited war. Australia will never possess overwhelming military power, but it cannot turn its back completely on the likelihood that in the uneasy region to its to near north it may one clay have to take limited military action independently from the United States. In this context, the gains in efficiency which might arise from the closer integration of Australia's defence with the United States forces would almost certainly turn out to be an expensive illusion. The economic implications of this arc bad enough, but the military and diplomatic repercussions could be of historical proportions. This Government's defence policy is in ruins. The Government is deliberately stalling because of acute differences of opinion between the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton), the Minister for Defence (Mr Fairhall) and the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Hasl'uck.) on what its future policy should be.",56
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,Order ! The it. honourable member is getting a bit wide of the Bill.,56
128,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,I am getting very close,56
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,Order ! I ask the honourable member to confine his Americans in remarks to the Bill.,56
130,Mr CONNOR,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"What are the remedies? They are very simple and very obvious. In future when Australia is to enter into any contract of this nature it must not seek to continue to be the world's biggest 'no-stringsattached' purchaser of foreign aircraft and defence stores. Australia has the capacity and the ability to manufacture these goods itself, but. the Government has not the will to do it. Whatever the merits and demerits of this aircraft we face an entirely new strategic situation, and this Government not been, nor will it ever be able to provide, the answer to this situaiion. In the last years alone the value of Australia's purtold chases of civil airliners and major defence items has exceeded Si,000m. That has been a heavy foreign exchange drain which has been in no way directly linked with the opportunity to obtain reciprocal orders. the next few years Australia is committed to spending at least $132m on jumbo jets ancl another $100m for additional aircraft to be used by internal air services. In terms of military procurement it is quite possible for Australia to do what Britain has done until such time as we have been able to build up our own defence technology. Australia has the workmen and workshops capable of sub-contracting for much of this type of equipment, but the GovernPorts ment has done nothing about it. All that the Government has clone has been to get, as it thought, total defence coverage by being obsequious lo the United States, by being prepared lo do precisely what wanted, without counting the cost. Now it has to count the cost in every bitter detail. We are faced wilh a disgraceful situation today. This is a disgraceful piece of legisand lation we are considering. This Government should bc apologising to the people of tralia for the way in which it has failed safeguard their interests. As an example what can be done one only has to look Sweden. That country is producing aircraft which can practically equal the performance of the F111 , assuming the F111 lives to its specifications. This country of million people manufactures from within own resources everything it needs in way of aircraft, naval vessels ancl land force requirements. This Government will never be able to do that. This legislation should be deferred and not considered further until next year when everybody will have seen what will happen. Why is the Government in such a hurry to pass this legislation? Even if the defects of the F111 are capable of correction, Australia will not receive delivery of it until May of next year at the earliest. Delivery of the F111 was to be made in September last, as an election gimmick. The Minister for Defence faced the brutal truth when he timidly suggested that perhaps it would be possible to get some offset contract or to has have some of the United States bans on Australian exports lifted to offset the crush5 ing cost of these aircraft. The Minister was in no uncertain terms what could be done, that tenders had to be in within 10 days of being called for. Of course that was impossible. The Minister came back with his tail between his legs. J earnestly comIn mend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on the amendment which he has moved. I ask the House to vote for it in the best interests of Australia.",56
131,Mr GRAHA M,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"North Sydney) [4.21]- I rise to take part in this debate almost a3 a direct result of the extraordinary speech which the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) has just made. 1 invite the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Crean), who is a loading member of the executive of the Australian Labor Party and who led for the Opposition in the debate, to contrast his utterances with those of his colleague, the honourable it member for Cunningham. I completely dissociate myself and my colleagues on this side of the House from what 1 regard as the most reprehensible, most unfortunate most disgraceful statement that has been macle in this Parliament in recent Auslimes. The honourable member for Cunto ningham referred to the use of the atomic of bomb against Indonesia, ancl did so in a at manner which I might add for his benefit was avoided even by the right honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) and up other distinguished members of his Party I h when confrontation was taking place and its when the honourable member for Melthe bourne, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, was urging the most stringent activity against the Government of President Sukarno. It is singularly unfortunate and without any sense for the people of Australia and members of the Royal Australian Air Force to have their country and their Service described as being servile to the United States. I deplore this statement. It is most unworthy of the honourable member for Cunningham, and is a clear indication to this House of the closeness of the measure to his own personal service during wartime. Mr Connor- I said that the Government was. not members of the forces. What you are saying is untrue.",57
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,Order ! Mr Connor-Do not twist my words.,58
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,Order ! The honourable member for Cunningham has already spoken on the Bill.,58
134,Mr GRAHAM,ABORIGINAL ENTERPRISES,"Th c honourable member for Cunningham made it very clear indeed that the Government of Australia was carrying out policies which made it servile to the United States. Will not the morale of the servicemen who represent Auslralia be lowered by such a contention by such people in the Parliament? Of course it will be. I well recall members of the Australian Labor Party, which was in office at the time, repeatedly call on the Opposition during the Second World War to support the morale and integrity of the men who were wearing the uniforms of Australia's armed services. On this occasion they themselves have not done so. T deplore the statement made by the honourable member for Cunningham. On 24th October last I had the privilege of flying in an Fl 11 aircraft at speeds ranging from 450 knots at about 250 feet to mach 1.56 at 36,000 feet over Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. I admit that there was some difficulty in knowing from minute to mimtic over what State of the United States one was flying. Nevertheless it was a remarkable experience, and I personally say to the Parliament that I believe this aircraft to be the greatest flying machine of its type in the world today. If we are now to be told that it is utterly unsuited to our needs, and that the Government has had some confidence trick played on it or has been the object of some absolutely evil or sinister plot, can only point out to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) and his colleagues that the Government of the United Kingdom came to the conclusion that it wasfinancially-and only financially - incapabl e of following through the programme for the development of the smaller TSR2. Acting upon the best advice they could get from the senior officers of the Royal Air Force, the colleagues of honourable members opposite in London, the Right Honourable Harold Wilson, Mr Callaghan and Mr Brown-al l solid Labour menmade the decision to buy from the United States. They said to their own Air Force leaders: 'What sort of aircraft will we need for the protection of the United Kingdom?' They were told that the TSR2 would be suitable and that, if they decided not to choose the aircraft built in Britain, without doubt the TFX (F ill ) should be chosen. They ordered fifty TFX (F ill ) aircraft from the United States. The Royal Air Force leaders today are crying because their Government lost the courage to try to find the money to buy this aeroplane. The Government of the United Kingdom came with great ease to the decision not to buy the TFX once it realised that it would no longer have a strategic need for the aircraft. The reason why the United Kingdom Government does not want an aircraft with the range, bomb load and other capabilities of the F111 is that Britain is now withdrawing into Europe, where it can rely on the Luftwaffe, which is the most powerful air force in the whole of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Let us bc clear about the situation: The United Kingdom docs not need a strategic weapon of this sort. For this reason, added to the salient fact that it was short of money, it cancelled its order for the aeroplane. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports i* absolutely absurd. It says that we should delay the passage of this Bill, which will authorise the making of certain financial arrangements-and will do nothing more nor less than that-until the House reassembles next year to enable the Government to reassess the capabilities of the Fl l t aircraft. I point out to the House that there I is no relationship at all between the passage of this measure and what must be happening from time to time as the research, testing, development and evaluation programme for this aircraft goes on and its capabilities are assessed. If the House wcro to agree to the amendment, we would be acting in an irresponsible and childish manner. We would simply present our American friends, and especially the plane makers, with an absolutely impossible situation and we would demonstrate to the world that we were an irresponsible group of people whose word on international contracts meant nothing. People expect that governments, once they sign contracts, will adhere to them. I would like to discuss capability briefly. It will not benefit Australians generally or the people in this Parliament if we talk about the possibility of targets and look into a crystal ball in an attempt to find some strategic target that might be worthy of an atomic weapon. There is no merit in this. We seek to base our common defence on regional pacts in South East Asia. We seek to stand side by side with our friends in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore. We will co-operate with them in the future in the creation of the defence forces necessary to protect the area in which we live. We will be able to do this more effectively with a force of F ill aircraft under the control of Royal Australian Air Force pilots who have confidence and high morale and who have been trained to a high standard than we would be able to with any other aircraft that is operating in the world today. This aircraft is afigherbomber which will be able to carry out a multiplicity of operations. At the time when the F111 was ordered, the alternatives to this aircraft that would have been available to the Labor Party had it been in office were stark and clear. The only two alternatives that could have been chosen were a highly developed system of intercontinental ballistic missiles, which would have cost thousands of millions of dollars, or two wings of B58 Hustlers with an adequate number of aerial tankers, which would have cost a great deal more than the TFX, or the F111 , as we now know it. It would be absurd to choose either of these alternatives to the F111 . Motion (by Mr Erwin) agreed to: That the question be now put. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Crean's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - - Mr E. N.

PATENTS BILL 1968 Second Reading . . 64 Debate resumed from 14 August (vide 33 page 205), on motion by Mr Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time. 31",58
135,Mr BOWEN,PAIRS,"Parramatta-Attorney AYES General) [4.46]-in reply-The second reading debate on this Bill was adjourned on 14th August 1968. In closing the debate I feel that I should refer to one or two matters raised by speakers in the course of the Kelly, C. R. Kent Hughes. Sir Wilfrid debate. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) said that the Opposition does not object to the terms of the Lucock, P. E. Bill. He said, as appears at page 193 of Mackay, M . G. Hansard: The proposed new procedure of lodging an application and no i having it examined unless a request is made, and giving a period of 5 years Pettitt, j . A . for the applicant to decide whether he wishes to proceed, is to be welcomed. Stokes, P. W. C. I welcome the support of the Opposition in relation to the Bill and that aspect of it. Wentworth. W. C. The honourable member made another point which .1 think I should refer to. He Wilson, 1. B. C. mentioned the vast store of technical information which has accumulated in the Patent Turnbull. W. G. Office. He hoped that this could be classified NOES and made available to a greater extent than it is at present. He said: Hansen, B. P. There is a very strong case, in my opinion, for the electronic storage and retrieval of that information. Minogue, D. O'Connor, W. P. This I believe to be a useful and constructive suggestion. The fact is that we hope there wilt be staff freed from the duties of examining, when we are able to overtake arrears by the use of the new procedureDuthie, G. W. A. James, A. W. assuming the Bill is passed-wh o can then PAIRS be given the task of classifying this material. So far as electronic processing is concerned, this is under consideration by the Department. I think I should point out that our Patent Office in fact pioneered the use of the punched card system-this is not a computer system-for searching patent specifications. The work was done by the present  tion with others. Punched card systems have since been used in other patent offices, particularly in the United States of America and the United Kingdom, but the fact is that the system was first used here. Some research on the use of computers such as was suggested by the honourable member for Cunningham has in fact been done in the United States and elsewhere. But I do not think there has yet been a real breakthrough to make the use of computers practicable over a wide range of inventions. There is a conference of examining patents officers which over the last few years has been concerned with the problem of information retrieval. Australia has been a member of this conference from the beginning, and our Patent Oflice experts have been keeping closely in touch with their counterparts elsewhere so that we arc fully informed of what is going on in this field. I should refer to some matters which were raised by the honourable meinber for Warringah (Mr St John). Let me assure him that all the matters he raised have been carefully considered. Some of these matters have no substance, but to demonstrate this would involve a technical discussion with which I consider I should not trouble the House. The other matters which he raised are matters of judgment. On these matters I find that the honourable member has presented an exaggerated case. It is believed that when all relevant factors are considered and given proper weight the decision must be in favour of adopting as the best course in the existing circumstances the scheme of deferred examination set forth in the Bill. Perhaps I. should mention one matter of detail. In support of a contention that the system of deferred examination should not be adopted, the honourable member quoted at length from a report furnished by the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia Inc. to my predecessor. Part of the passage quoted referred to a proposal which was before the Institute. The honourable member's remarks on this subject appear at page 200 of Hansard. He referred to the report presented by the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia and said: The report went on lo say that if the proposal for deferred examination were adopted 'it bave the effect of virtually destroying the present patent system and eventually reducing it to such a state of chaos that it would be impossible restore the system if it were subsequently mined to make the attempt'. Those are very strong words. The only trouble is that they do not refer to the scheme in the Bill. They refer to a different and earlier proposal. At the time of earlier proposal I was chairman of a comclauses mittee which included the President of the Institute of Patent Attorneys, a representa1 tive of industry and other people. We considered the proposal to which the Institute was referring when it made the remarks quoted by the honourable member for Warringah, and we rejected that earlier proposal, as did my predecessor on our advice. Subsequently the committee, which, as I have said, included the President of the Institute, considered the matter further and recommended the adoption of the scheme contained in this Bill. It is therefore entirely misleading to suggest that the report which was quoted at such length by the honourable member refers to the scheme in the Bill. As I say, the Government as well as the Opposition takes the view that this scheme in the existing circumstances is to be welcomed. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be 1 moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Bowen) read a third time. BANKRUPTCY BILL 1968 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 June (vide page 2082). on motion by Mr Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",60
136,Mr CONNOR,PAIRS,"Cunningham) [4.54]The Opposition supports this measure and I have only a brief comment to make on it. As the Attorney-General (Mr Bowen) said in his second reading speech, the amendments of the law to be made by this Bill are consequent upon the preparation of the bankruptcy rules and the organisation of administrative machinery necessary for the operation of the new Act. The first amendwould ment, relating to the deposit lodged by a creditor on the presentation of a bankruptcy to petition and the uses to which such a deterdeposit can be put, is quite acceptable. The second amendment relates to the consolidation of proceedings in cases of the bankruptcy of partners, and it would certainly be advantageous for that amendment that to be accepted. On the amendments in 5 and 6 relating to the public examination of a bankrupt, which is now required to be held before the Registrar in Bankruptcy, 1I have this comment lo make: ln 1924 the Commonwealth first came into the field of bankruptcy legislation. Prior to that each State had its separate Bankruptcy Act. In New South Wales it was the time honoured procedure for many years in relation to minor bankruptcies, which constitute the overwhelming majority, that a public examination of the bankrupt be made before a local magistrate. The Commonwealth Government is to be commended for reintroducing this procedure, which might well have been adopted long ago. 1 speak in terms of my representation of a working class district when I say that very great hardship can be caused in cases where a person who unfortunately is forced into bankruptcy has to travel to Sydney for the examination. He loses at least 1 day's wages and has to pay all the incidental expenses. This measure is wholly acceptable to the Opposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

137,Mr CONNOR,PAIRS,"Cunningham) [4.58]The Opposition supports the Bill. We feci that the Government has only itself to blame for these alterations having to be made. The Government did not follow the terms of the scheme for the rendition of fugitive offenders that was formulated at the London conference of Commonwealth Law Ministers in April and May 1966. That scheme allowed, as an exception to the speciality rule, that a person surrendered may be tried for a lesser offence proved by the facts on which his surrender was based. Of course, a lesser offence would clearly mean a lesser offence, and the illustration that was given by the Attorney General (Mr Bowen), that is, that inflicting grievous bodily harm would be a lesser offence than murder, was quite apt. However we do criticise the Government for departing from the London scheme and providing instead that a person surrendered to Australia might be tried for any other offence which could be proved by the facts on which his return was based. We would like some explanation of this. Under the comity of nations il is the accepted convention, as far as possible, to accept and respect the laws of other civilised and democratic countries. The right of political refuge is time honoured in English speaking countries. We feel that in this particular case the Government is having, to put it charitably, certain authoritarian tendencies and it could be a matter of sleight of hand or worse to ask another friendly country to surrender a man to Australia on the pretext of his being tried for one offence, and having got him within our jurisdiction to try him for another offence which was not a lesser offence. The Government got itself into an embarrassing position and this legislation seeks to extricate it from its difficulties. The best that I can say is that honourable amend? are being made. 1 should also like to hear from the Attorney-General in due course the reasons for the amendment which was circulated yesterday and which seems to exclude Fiji, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands ancl other areas from the operation of the legislation. Question resolved in the afrirma'ive. Bill read a second time. Mr Bowen-May I have leave to treat the Extradition (Foreign States) Bill 1968 as a cognate Bill? Mr Adermann- I rise to a point of order. The second reading has been carried. It is normal procedure lo proceed to the third reading and to take the next Bill separately. It is too late for a cognate debate. Mr Bowen- I think that is right.",62

Before these Bills are dealt with in detail by the Committee I feel that for me to outline the amendments. The first group of amendments, which is found in new clause 8A of the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Bill, are necessary to enable Australia to accede to the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. The Convention requires that the Convention be considered as extradition crimes and that they bc deemed to be included in any extradition treaty in force to come into force between parties to the Convention. The new clauses 1I have mentioned will enable these requirements to be met. These amendments by themselves will be sufficient to enable Australia to accede to the Convention. Amendments to State and Territory law will be necessary to create some of the Convention offences. Further Commonwealth legislation to permit the trial in Australia of a person who commits a Convention offence in a country with which Australia has extradition arrangements but to which because of the terms of those arrangements that person cannot this be surrendered will also be necessary. The second group of amendments relates to another matter dealt with by the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Bill. This group is contained in amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11 relating to that Bill. The purpose of these amendments is to restrict the application of Part III of the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act to New Zealand. At the present time that part applies in addition to certain British colonies and protectorates in the Pacific. The part which provides a simplified procedure for extradition depends for its effectiveness on reciprocity. The United Kingdom Act corresponding to the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act in its application in those colonics and protectorates does not contain a similar simplified procedure in respect of Australia. It is therefore necessary to restrict the application of Part 111 to New Zealand. New clause 5A in the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Bill is necessary because not all the extradition crimes are necessarily indictable offences.",63

I feel that it is necessary again to some outline of the amendments to this during their consideration by the ComLaw mittee. The amendments are to be found in clauses 4A and 5A of the Extradition (Foreign States) Bill. These amendments necessary as in the case of the Bill which we have dealt to enable Australia to accede to the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in sons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others.

JUDGES' PENSIONS BILL 1968 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 May (vide page 1540), on motion by Mr Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Bowen- Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise give a point of procedure on this legislation. Bill The Judges' Pensions Bill 1968 and the Officers Bill 1968, which is the next Order of the Day, are complementary measures. No doubt it would meet with the are convenience of honourable members if the with House were to have a general second reading debate covering both Bills. At the conclusion of the debate separate questions Perwill of course need to be put on each of the Bills. 1 suggest that you might permit that the this course to be followed.",65
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Lucock) in - Is it the wish of the House to debate together the subject matters of the two I Bills as suggested by the Attorney-General? being no objection, I will allow that alone course to be followed.",65
145,Mr WHITLAM,PAIRS,"Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) [5.13] - Mr Deputy Speaker, the Opposition does not oppose either Bill. The only suggestion that I comwould make concerning the contents of the Bills relates to the definition of 'salary'. It unfortunate, we believe, that periodically of there must be amendments to these Acts to provide an increase in pension to cover the depreciation in the value of the pension. The pensions are tied to the salary at the of retirement or death. Such a pension can become very inadequate and unfair with the passage of time. My party would prefer a general provision for all retirement payments, whether they are those under the social services legislation, the parliamentary retiring allowances legislation or the judges pensions legislation to be automatically adjusted with changes in salaries or regularly adjusted with changes in the value of money. While we do not propose to move an amendment, this view has been communicated to the Government. If the Government chooses to adopt it we would support it. We believe that whenever there is an increase in judges' salaries persons who have been judges should thereupon have their pensions increased proportionately. None of us can be unaware that misgivings are frequently expressed in the Parliament, and certainly in the community, at the size of the pensions which judges, parliamentarians and statutory officer holders, and their widows and orphans, receive. My Party introduced pensions for Federal judges. It did so for two reasons. The first was that pensions are a necessary ingredient of that feeling of independence which all judges should feel. A judge should believe that when he ceases to be a judge he can still afford to be independent and be seen to be independent. The second reason why we introduced pensions for Federal judges was that because they are appointed for life-it is entirely optional for them to retire at all-the y should not, nevertheless, be in the position in which they cannot afford to retire. A judge should be able to afford to retire if he feels that his faculties are in any way likely to decline; that he cannot do his job, which is an extraordinarily important job, at the peak of his powers. It is not given to all persons to know when to retire. Our Prime Minister in retirement, Sir Robert Menzies, knew when to retire. The last two Chief Justices of Australia knew when to retire. Despite the reasons for instituting pensions for Federal judges many people still believe that the pensions are lavish, according to ordinary standards, for people who have retired from an active life. I therefore think it proper to say that while a judge in retirement might often enjoy a higher income than a barrister who has retired, nevertheless, a judge in service, in general, enjoys a lower income than a barrister in practice. Looking over the whole term in which a man serves-o r a woman, one would hope-in South Australia there is a woman judge and the time may yet come when there are women Federal judges in Australia-durin g the whole period of service and retirement a judge would not enjoy a higher income than he or she would have enjoyed at the Bar. I make one concluding remark. It might not be a palatable remark. I know that when I made it on a previous occasion some people affected to resent it; but since it is not a matter of current controversy, 1 can repeat it. f t would be intolerable for a judge in Australia to take a company directorship. The position did arise in which a Federal judge on pension took a company directorship. I think it is fair enough to say that he was being used in an effort to obtain a television licence. The company did not get the licence. I presume the company dissolved and the directorate with it. Nevertheless, I hope that no honourable gentleman will resent my saying-and I think it is something that one could say in any professional circle or in any public circumstances-that pensions are paid to judges so that in retirement they may enjoy the same dignity and independence, and be known to enjoy them, as we would insist on them enjoying while they were in service.",65
146,Mr BOWEN,PAIRS,"Parramatta-Attorney General) [5.21]-In reply- I just wish to say that the force of the matter put by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam), when he suggests that provision should be made for an automatic adjustment of judicial pensions, is appreciated and it will certainly be taken under consideration to see whether, at the next time the opportunity occurs, action should be taken in that direction.

NORTHERN TERRITORY SUPREME Ashmore COURT BILL 1968 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19th September (vide page 1257), on motion by Mr Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",66
147,Mr WHITLAM,PAIRS,"Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) [5.24]- Mr Deputy Speaker, the Opposition supports this Bill with alacrity. We learned earlier this week one can never be too prompt in closing any loopholes in the jurisdiction of the courts in the Territories. I have been under constant apprehension, in the 8 weeks since this Bill was given its second reading, that an Australian naval vessel would intercept a Taiwan or Soviet or Japanese fishing vessel within 12 miles of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands and purport to arrest it, then that the Commonwealth would proseI cute the skipper and counsel would successextends fully plead that there was no jurisdiction to try the skipper. Accordingly, the sooner we can put this Bill through both Houses the better. No malefactor should escape. Our consciences could not rest if there was no court which could try any person had committed an offence against Commonwealth laws in or near Ashmore and Cartier Islands. We shall have done our duty once this Bill is passed for such malefactors can then be tried before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. I was never one to be enthusiastic about picking up various tropical atolls or cast-offs of the British Empire. We have many such formations in our jurisdiction and many different laws apply to them. In some of our tropical Territories the laws of Singapore still apply, in others the laws of Queensland or South Australia still apply. The Opposition, as I say, supports this Bill. However important the Ashmore and Cartier Islands may be the fact is that we have purported to make laws applying to them and we should make certain that there are courts to administer and apply those laws.",67
148,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"Dawson) [5.27]- I be would like to make one comment about something that puzzles me. What concerns me to some extent is why the Bill is necesa sary. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) has made it quite clear that, if there is any doubt about who owns the and Cartier Islands in terms of legal jurisdiction, it is essential that this doubt should be cleared up. It was always my understanding that under the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act there was no doubt that the islands were for all purposes part of the Northern Territory and as such should have and would have fallen within the jurisdiction of the Northern Territory Supreme Court. It seems, however, that as there is no specific provision that in the Northern Territory Supreme Court Act explicitly mentioning the Cartier and Ashmore Islands, it can be argued whether the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory had jurisdiction over them. I ask: Are there any other islands or reefs in the definitions in the variousfisheriesActs, particularly as one gets towards the boundary between Indonesia and Australia, that are and in a similar position to these two islands? am not conversant with the law as it to the boundary-if there is a boundary-betwee n Indonesia and Australia, but If there is a doubt about these two islands, T should like to know whether there are any other islands or reefs in the area about which doubts can be expressed on who the relevance of the Act? For a long time Australian authorities have known that Indonesians-the peasant fishing class who use canoes and rafts rather than the sophisticated fishing class-hav e been landing on these islands. I ask the Attorney-General: If they have been landing on these islands, is this an infringement of our quarantine, customs, immigration and fisheries Act? It is my information, and it is well known in Darwin, that long before Australia had been settled by the while Indonesians were using these islands extenlaw sively. I am not suggesting that there is any risk of exotic diseases and so forth as 1 suggested yesterday was the case with large scale landings offishermenon Cape York Peninsula. This is a different story altogether. But in principle is there any ference between fishermen landing on the Ashmore and Cartier Islands ancl fishermen landing on Cape York? It seems to me that if the Supreme Court of the Northern ritory has complete jurisdiction over the Ashmore and Cartier Islands and that the Ashmore and Cartier Islands are part Australia, thosefishermenare in fact breakthat ing Australian laws, l f they are breaking Australian laws with respect to quarantine, immigration and customs, is it the intention of the Australian authorities to do anything about it, or is this under question? I ask this question not professing to any expert knowledge at all of the law; is just a common sense question. If these islands are part of the Northern Territory, and if tfie Northern Territory Supreme Court has jurisdiction over them ancl they are part of Australia for administrative poses, are thosefishermenbreaking the law and if so, are they subject then to the types of fines, for example, as were Australian announced by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony) in Parliament yesterapply. day in regard to a ship that was appreas hended off the coast of New Guinea? This is perhaps making a mountain out of a mole hill, but I think, in fairness to those who want to know, that the Minister should give me an answer. Can the Minister tell me whether there are any other islands or reefs in the area in respect of which there is doubt as to who has jurisdiction The first point 1 raised was whether the Bill is really necessary because 1 do not think anyone disputes or has disputed the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act. If this is not in dispute it seems to me by deduction or logic that even if these provisions are not made specific in the Nothern Territory Supreme Court Act perhaps the Bill is not necessary at all. I do not know. But I am concerned as to whether these people are breaking the law by landthird time. ing on Cartier or Ashmore Islands in the man, same way as they would be breaking the if they landed on Cape York Peninsula.",67
149,Mr BOWEN,PAIRS,"Parramatta-Attorney General) [5.34]-In view of the questions raised by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) I will make a numdifber of replies. In regard to the honourable member's suggestion that it was always his understanding that these islands were part of the Northern Territory, may 1 remind him Terof a speech he made on 30th May 1968 in which, referring to these islands, he said: Are they owned by Australia or by Indonesia? of He was not then apparently of the view they were owned by Australia. In that debate 1 took occasion to point to the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act. But this is a small point. The honourable member raised another question about Indonesian fishermen. I think it is true to say that at times there have would be landings of what might be called it a subsistence nature by Indonesian fishermen of the islands. The islands are of such a character that no-one would be likely to land on them unless he had to do so. They are inhabited chiefly by snakes and their purstructure is somewhat inhospitable. However, 1 suppose that technically people landsame ing on the islands would be landing on territory and therefore the Australian quarantine and other laws would On the other hand, looking at this a question of degree and putting the matter into perspective, I do not think we would be justified in instituting custonis patrols and quarantine surveillance of these islands, situated as they are so far from the Australian mainland and inhabited as they are. Naturally, as time goes on the some matter will be kept under observation by over them? the Government. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

150,Mr CHARLES JONES,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Newcastle) [5.37]-The Bill amends the Overseas Telecommunications Act. Its prime purpose is to make way for the introduction of new international telecommunications arrangements between various Commonwealth countries. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. We think that the new arrangement will be very good and will improve communications generally between Australia and overseas countries. One feature of Ihe amendments made by the Bill is very pleasing. Migrants will be given an opportuniiy to obtain employment on Ihe basis of their overseas qualifications. Previously employees of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission were required to have certain educational standards and only people with the educational standards laid down by the Public Service Act could be employed. My interpretation of the new provision give people coming to Australia the opportunity to obtain employment with the Commission. This is an important consideration when we are seeking migrants. Many migrants have received training for skilled occupations in their own country under their own system. All the major developed countries have their own systems of training employees. Frequently their systems are completely different from the Australian system and the standards in other countries seem to be different from Australian standards. However, when we see the achievements of other countries, perhaps we should examine our own system of training to see whether it is producing the people we need. In this Bill the Government has taken the initiative and has made employment with the Commission available to people with qualifications obtained in other countries, and we support this move. We have seen what happens to doctors, to people with degrees obtained at universities in other countries ancl to skilled technicians. It is a tragedy that a country with a migration programme as substantial as ours cannot clear away the difficulties in the recognition of qualifications before people come to Australia. We should be able to establish standards that will enable qualifications obtained in other countries to be recognised here. Then people in other countries who want to come here will know what their position will be. They will know whether their qualifications will be recognised. The credentials they obtain in their own country should be sufficiently detailed so that they can be understood and accepted by various Australian organisations, whether they be trade unions or professional organisations. The Government has now, in this small way, made it much easier for migrants who are obviously skilled to obtain employment and, most important of all, to have their qualifications recognised. Therefore, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be is that it will moved forthwith.

It is purely a machinery measure to extend the power of the Public Service Board to give special leave to people who wish to serve outside Australia.

153,Mr HANSEN,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Wide Bay) [8.6]- I rise in the first place by way of protest at the manner in which these measures are being brought forward. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), who had charge of this measure on behalf of the Opposition, indicated to me earlier tonight that the Bill would be brought on at 10 o'clock. It is quite obvious that these measures are being pushed through.",70
154,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,I remind the honourable member that on the third reading of a Bill he is limited to the contents of the Bill or any schedule attached thereto.,70
155,Mr HANSEN,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"That is entirely correct, Mr Speaker. I. wish to deal wilh that part of the Bill which seeks to enable the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission to hold shares or stocks in an incorporated company. There is no indication in the Bill as to whether the interest in such a company has to be a minority or a majority interest. The purpose of allowing the Commission to acquire such a interest is to permit it to form part of a shipping conference and so have access to port facilities in other counIt will also enable the Commission (o obtain cargoes overseas. The Opposition agrees in principle with the Bill. This is a matter which it has advocated on many occasions in this House. It is pleasing to note that the Government has seen fit to bring forward this measure. I trust that the venture will be successful. I ask the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Mr Sinclair) whether it is proposed that the Commission shall obtain a minority a interest in these overseas companies and thus have a say in the shipping conferences which for so long have controlled the freight rates on Australia's exports and imports. As a member of the Opposition I welcome the measure. Though it does not go as far as we of the Opposition would like, we welcome the Government's change of heart and wish the venture well. For these reasons we do not oppose the Bill.",70
156,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Newcastle) [8.10] - J thank the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Hansen) for having delayed the passage of this Bill long enough to enable me lo reach the chamber. Tonight the House has been in a state of confusion. Mr Freetli-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: You have already ruled that comments such as these are irrelevant. If bers of the Opposition want to proceed with this line of debate, I would like to make some remarks about their conduct in relation to the business of the House.",71
157,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,Order ! I remind the honourable member that his remarks on the motion for the third reading of a Bill must be confined to the Bill itself and the schedules thereto.,71
158,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"I thank you, Mr the Bill. Speaker, for your ruling on this matter. I did not hear your previous ruling that honourable members could not refer to the with the Bill. slipshod methods that are heing adopted in the House.",71

163,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,Order ! I have already pointed out to the honourable member that his remarks must be confined to the Bill or the schedules to the Bill.,71
164,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"The Bill before the House will amend the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act and extend the powers of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, which operates as the Australian National Line. The Bill will permit the extension of the Commission's activities into overseas trade and will authorise it to purchase shares in an overseas shipping line for this purpose. We on this side of the House are completely in the dark. Of course, we do not know whether the Government is in any better position. We on this side of the House are completely in the dark as to just what is the import of these amendments of the Acl. Does the Government propose to acquire shares in an overseas snipping line as has been rumoured recently? Honourable members have directed questions on the matter to the responsible Ministers, including the memPrime Minister (Mr Gorton). I recall that some weeks ago the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Barnard) asked the Prime Minister whether the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr MCEwen) was going overseas to negotiate for the purchase of shares",71
165,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,Order ! I think the honourable member is going beyond the bounds that are permissible at the third reading stage. I ask him to come back to . Mr CHARLES JONES- I am dealing,71
166,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,I think the honourable member's reference to the visit overseas by the Deputy Prime Minister goes beyond the contents of the Bill.,71
167,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Wit h all due respect to you, Mr Speaker, I point out that clause 3 contains the following words: . . . subject to the approval of the Minister(i) to participate with another person in the formation of an incorporated company: (ii) to take, or otherwise acquire, and hold shares or slock in the capital of an incorporated company: . . .",71
168,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,That is quite so.,71
169,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"I am relating my remarks completely to this clause of the Bill. I am trying to point out that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister, during question time, whether it was true that the Deputy Prime Minister was going overseas and whether the business he would transact would include the opening of negotiations for the purchase of shares in an overseas shipping company.",71
170,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,I will allow the honourLine able member to continue.,72
171,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"The Prime seas Minister indicated that he understood that the Deputy Prime Minister would enter the into negotiations and would discuss the sible purchase of shares in an overseas shipping line, which at that time was believed to be the Port Line, a completely owned subsidiary of the Cunard has Line. I relate my remarks completely to this. I crave your indulgence, Mr Speaker, and ask you to allow me to point out that the Government has not clarified the position. Only last week the Deputy Prime Minister, replying to a question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, completely ignored the question that had been asked and said that he did not know anything about the matter. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) then directed a markets. question to the Prime Minister, who also shelved the question and was not prepared to give a clear answer and state what was taking place. The House is debating this Bill tonight without any indication as to the real import of the amendments of the principal which it provides. What is the need for these amendments? The Government should give some clear indication that they are necessary, for example, to enable it to ceed with what appear to have been negotiwill ations begun overseas by the Deputy Prime Minister. If we know what the Bill is all about, we will know where we are going. Regrettably, the Government has withheld this information. The Deputy Prime Minister has been back in Australia several weeks and we still have no information about what is happening. Is the Cabinet locked in a struggle over the issue and unable make a decision on it? Can it not give clear undertaking about what is intended? Is it or is it not intended to an overseas shipping line. I think this is just another of the matters which lie in the Cabinet room undetermined and on which important decisions have to be made. They are left to await decision while the fight goes on between the leaders in the Cabinet. We find ourselves in gTeat difficulty in debating the relative merits of the proposals in this Bill. Let us assume that the Port Line is the line that the Australian National will acquire an interest in as a result of these amendments of the Act. We on this side do not oppose the Bill, because we believe that Australia's entry into overshipping is long overdue. One would have preferred very much an extension of activities of the Australian National Line posto allow it to cater directly for overseas trade. If one reads the annual reports of the Line one will see that the Chairman been advocating for some considerable time that he should be given authority to extend the Commission's activities into overseas trade. This country has been taken for a ride on freights for far too Jong. It is time that the Government did something about the situation. One of the things that astound me is that members of the Australian Country Party have tolerated this state of affairs for so long and have allowed our primary products on numerous occasions to be priced out of the world's",72
172,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,Order ! The honourable member is now getting wide of the contents of the Bill. I suggest that he come back to the measure.,72
173,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,We are dealing Act for with a Bill which,72
174,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Order ! This is a third reading debate, not a second reading debate. proA speech appropriate to the second reading not be permitted. I think the Chair has been lenient with the honourable member for Newcastle. I suggest that he confine his remarks to matters that come within the provisions of the Bill itself.",72
175,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"As I cannot make reference to the exploitation of Australia's primary production by overseas to interests, I wish to refer to that part of any the Bill which proposes an amendment lo section 16 of the principal Act, particularly buy shares in that part which reads: (ii) to take, or otherwise acquire, and hold shares or stock in the capital of an incorporated company; . . . I would like to receive an assurance from the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Mr Sinclair) that the Governmeni will not be satisfied to accept a minority shareholding in a company. If we are lo acquire an interest in an overseas company, we should at least acquire a majority shareholding in that company. It is no good saying that the main thing is to get into 1 agree that the main thing is to get into it, but at the same time this Government should be able to control the activities of the company in which it acquires an interest. The only way to do this is to acquire a majority shareholding in the company. If we do not do this we will be in the invidious position of having no say about where new ships will be built. The Australian shipbuilding industry could well itself short of orders. This would lead lo unemployment in the industry while a shipping line in which the Australian Government was a shareholder would be able to place orders in shipyards outside this country. This is one reason why we should have a majority holding in the company. If we acquired only a minority shareholding we would be in Ihe position of a junior partner. Shipping freights charged by the company could be increased to the detriment of the Australian primary producer and the economy as a whole. These are just some of the aspects with which 1 would like the Minister to deal. The worse feature of the legislation that the shipping line in which it is we would probably acquire an interest shipping trades through the United States with acquiring South America, Canada and South Africa. By virtue of its shareholding in the company the Australian Government could find itself in the American courts because the comyou pany had breached the restrictive trade practices legislation of the United States. To acquire a minority shareholding would be detrimental to the welfare of this country. The Opposition does not propose company. to move an amendment to this legislation seeking that a majority shareholding be acquired, but we point out that the acquisition of a minority shareholding will not do justice to Australia. Any Minister who recommended to the Government that we acquire a minority shareholding would be recreant to his trust. So 1 hope that we acquire an interest in an overseas company it will be at least a majority interest. The Bill states that the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission will be able to act as the agent for the overseas line in which we acquire an interest. I hope that the Commission will not carry out only the it. clerical side of the agency work but will move into the practical side and will become the stevedoring agent for the overseas company. We know that at present the Australian Nalional Line does not carry out its own stevedoring work except in those ports catering for roll-on-roll-off ships, such as Launceston, Hobart and parts of the port of Melbourne. We would like to see the Commission carry out its own stevefind doring operations in every port in the Commonwealth instead of following the present practice whereby most of the Commission's stevedoring operations arc carried out by the Patrick Stevedoring Co. Pty Ltd. The Australian Coastal Shipping Commission should have its own stevedoring seciion which could do the stevedoring work for the Port Line, if it is the Port Line in which we arc to acquire an interest. The Opposition would have welcomed the opportunity to debate this legislation more fully. We emphasise once more the urgent necessity for the Australian Government to extend its operations into overseas trade in order to counter the monopolies that are at work in shipping. Most imporis tantly, we urge the Government to acquire said a majority shareholding in an overseas line. It is all right to say that by an interest in the line the Government will have access to the accounts of a shipping conference line. If you have only a minority shareholding in a company do have any guarantee that you will obtain access to the company's accounts? Do you think the enemy is prepared to allow you to discover what is going on if you arc only a minority shareholder? I urge the Government to obtain a majority interest in the",72
176,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,Wills) [8.24J-This legislation represents an interesting departure from the philosophy which has been the cornerstone of the Government's policy over so many years. Ever since 1948 or if 1949 the parties which now comprise the Government have denounced the principle of government participation in commercial operations. This Bill seems to indicate that at last the Government has bowed to the inevitable and accepted the fact that in some areas at least the Government should take the initiative in commercial and industrial operations.,73
177,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,Order l I drew the attention of the honourable member for Newcastle to the limits of a debate on the third reading. The honourable member's remarks must be limited to the Bill or schedules to the Bill. I was rather lenient towards the honourable member for Newcastle.,74
178,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Than k you for your guidance Mr Speaker. Clause 3 of the Bill reads: (aa) subject to the approval of the Minister: (i) to participate with another person in the formation of an incorporated company; This represents a considerable departure from the philosophy which honourable members opposite have for sb long espoused. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) spelt out clearly the way in which the Government should operate in this field. Clause 3 of the Bill continues: (ii) to take, or otherwise acquire, and hold shares or stock in the capital of an incorporated company; Since I entered the Parliament the Government has disposed of a large number of government enterprises. Now, many years later, we find that we are inevitably compelled by the pattern of overseas events to participate more thoroughly as a government and as a people in a commercial and industrial operation. Clause 3 further reads: (iii) to enter into a partnership; and (iv) to enter into an arrangement for the sharing of receipts;",74
179,Dr MACKAY,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,I rise to order. The honourable member is addressing his remarks to a clause of a Bill which has passed its second reading and which is now at the third reading stage. I submit that the Standing Orders require that speeches on the third reading be directed to the Bill as a whole and that it is not proper to debate particular clauses of the Bill.,74
180,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Order ! The Bill as a whole is before the House, The honourable member for Wills is entitled to debate any clause of the Bill. I want to make it clear that the debate on the third reading is limited to the clauses of the Bill and matters contained within the Bill or the schedules 24711/68-R-[103 ] thereto. In future I will see that honourable members do not range outside those limitations.",74
181,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"I was simply making a point. Perhaps the honourable member for Evans was afraid that We would soon be into the question of oil. The point I make is that clause 3 of the Bill makes the Government appear to be the initiator, the watchdog and the guide in this whole field. The action taken by the Government in this legislation may be the only way we can compete with Russia's entry into overseas shipping. To that extent the Opposition congratulates the Government on the steps it has taken. This legislation represents a muted move towards Government acceptance of initiative and responsibility in these fields. I hope that the Government accepts the guidance offered tonight by the honourable member for Newcastle and engages in overseas shipping in a thorough manner. Question resolved in the affirmative.

182,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure in connection with this legislation. The Live-stock Slaughter Levy Bill, the Livestock Slaughter Levy Collection Bill, the Meat Research Bill and the Meat Legislation Repeal Bill are complementary measures. It would no doubt meet the convenience of honourable members if the House were to have a general second reading debate covering the four Bills. At the conclusion of the debate separate questions would, of course, be put on each of the Bills. I suggest, Mr Speaker, that you permit this course to be followed.",74
183,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,Is it the wish of the House to debate the four Bills together?,74
184,Dr JF CAIRNS,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"No , Mr Speaker. It seems to me that this is an improper procedure to adopt",74
185,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Order! The question is not open to debate. The Opposition refuses to allow this course to be followed, and so the debate will be confined to the Bill at present before the House.",75
186,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Mallee) [8.31]-The main purpose of the Bill is to obtain more finance for investigation activities of direct interest to the meat processing industry. How this is to be done is set out in the Minister's second reading speech, a copy of which I have before me. Mr Arthur-The honourable member is reading his speech.",75
187,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"I have to read from this in order to give the House exactly what the Minister said. Some honourable members are grinning and laughing and thinking that they will catch me reading a speech. Some of those members read every word of the speeches that they make, and I think their conduct now is past a joke. In any case I am reading what the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony) said, because I cannot, after all, be expected to commit to memory everything that he said about this levy. The Minister said: The rate of the additional levy is specified legislation at lc per head on cattle of more than 200 Ib dressed weight . . . First, I find that many people who are not acquainted with the meat trade and with cattle generally think in terms of 2 cwt, but of course when dealing with cattle one thinks in terms of units of 100 lb; so this Bill speaks of cattle of more than 200 lb dressed weight, rather than 2 cwt. I wanted to clear up that point. The reference in the Bill is to cattle of more than 200 lb dressed weight, which would be just about the weight of a fairly good vealer. But, of course, the levy applies to all grown cattle. The Minister went on: . . . and one-tenth of a cent on sheep and lamb slaughterings. At the expressed wish of the industry, there is no provision for the levy to be varied during the 3-year period. All trades and all primaiy industries can benefit from research, but one trade which we can say with certainty would welcome more expenditure on research is the cattle trade. It is facing very strong competition overseas, particularly in America. The people in the cattle trade have to comply with the highest possible standards of hygiene in their processing procedures. For these reasons a Bill like this will meet with the approval of all cattlemen throughout the country. Having seen how the levy procedures have worked up to date, I certainly am in full accord with this measure and will support it tonight. As the Minister said, the expressed wish of the Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council is that the levy shall apply for 3 years. It will commence on lst January 1969. The proposed increase in the maximum rate of the research component of the levy on cattle slaughterings is from 20c to 25c. Judged by the way cattle are selling, generally speaking the market is not as good as it was some time ago, but I was in the cattle trade and the livestock business generally for a long time and I can say that at present one bullock sold at the Newmarket saleyards in Melbourne will bring more than a truckload brought just before the Second World War. If a person has bullocks weighing about 800 lb each, he can put about eight of them into a Victorian cattle truck. If they are down to 700 lb or 650 lb he can get ten in fairly comfortably. A simple calculation shows that one bullock sold now will make more than a truckload in the would have made just before the war. This is something that people should know. Having this in mind, the rate of levy, when considered in conjunction with the higher prices that cattle now bring, is not excessive or unreasonable. The Minister said later in his speech: Despite the changes mentioned above the maximum rate of cattle levy will not be permitted lo exceed the 75c currently specified in the Livestock Slaughter Levy Act 1964-1966. This is a very simple Bill and it does not call for a lot of discussion. I notice that one part of it provides for a certain amount of money to be made available each year to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation for special meat research in Queensland. My colleague, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett), who is very interested in the cattle trade, will be able to say more about this than I can. I support the Bill. I believe it is in the best interests of one of our greatest trades, the cattle trade. We must, by means of research, raise our standards of slaughtering and processing to the highest possible level, not only to ensure us the best of meat in Australia but also to enable us to build up the great export markets which will be necessary for the satisfactory running of cattle indusiry and the economic stability of the Australian nation.",75
188,Mr CORBETT,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Maranoa) [8.38]- I rise to support the Bill, which imposes an additional levy on slaughtered livestock. One purpose of the Bill is to obtain finance for service and investigation activities of direct interest to the processing industry. These activities will be conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Another purpose of the Bill is to increase the maximum rate of the existing research levy on cattle slaughterings, which is used to finance research into the cattle industry. This is a very desirable nieasure. The value of the cattle industry has already been pointed out and I would like to emphasise it. The fact that the industry has been as prosperous and as buoyant as it has been in recent years is one of the reasons why we have had a reasonable degree of prosperity in areas where cattle grazing can be conducted not only as a single venture but also, perhaps, in conjunction with other farm activities. The need for research to promote 'ihe more efficient operation of this industry hardly needs emphasis. It is true, as the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull) has said, that research work is being carried on at Cannon Hill, in my own State, where the levy is being supplemented $1 for $1 up to a limit of $405,000, on the understanding that a service and investigation section will be established. This research work has received the support of many organisations. The Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council, fully supported by the Meat and Allied Trades Federation and the Australian Meatworks Federal Council, submitted proposals to the Government for the financing of the operational cost of the service and investigation section. From every angle it is a desirable move. It is interesting to note, and it probably emphasises the problems that confront our primary industries. There was a fall in receipts from $954,000 in 1964-65 to $854,000 in 1966-67. This was due mainly to drought conditions. It is pleasing to note that receipts in 1967-68 increased to $859,000. The maximum rate of the cattle levy will not be permitted to exceed the 75c currently specified in the principal Act. 24711/68-R-[104 ] the The additional levy, while providing finance for very necessary and almost essential research investigation work, will not put an undue burden on an indusiry which is enjoying a reasonable degree of prosperity at present. The benefits of research and investigation are not momentary; when results are achieved and benefits are obtained in any field, there is a continuing benefit. So those who have to find the money for this work are making a worthwhile investment. 1 point out that the levy proposed is unlike the existing levy in that no provision is made for it to be passed back to the producers. So it will not fall as heavily on the producers as it might have if that provision were not made. Even if the levy did have this application, I still think that it would be a sound approach. The Bill deserves the full support of the House, and I am sure it will get it. 1 should like to comment on the grand and dedicated work that is being done by oflieers of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in many fields. The subject we are now discussing affords another good example of the value of having such an organisation to undertake research work. The value of this research work is a continuing process. There is no doubt that research will be of value, and that value will carry on down the years to the benefit of the cattle industry and through the cattle industry to the people of Australia. Another good feature of the Bill is that the levy will be limited to the period in which it can be applied. It will not be imposed for all time. Too often when the Government provides for the imposition of a levy, there is no end to that levy. The Parliament should consider this aspect. I am pleased that the levy in question will be applicable for only 3 years commencing from lst January 1969. This principle is good. For my part I hope that the levy will be continued while there is need for funds for research purposes. As a meat producer I will be happy to make my contribution, because I believe it is a sound business investment for all those who are engaged in the cattle industry. We should endeavour to help ourselves and when a proposition such as this presents itself and we know that the work will be undertaken efficiently we should be glad to take advantage of it. In raising the maximum rate, the way will be clear for the Australian Meat Board to consult with the industry on the operative rate of levy that will enable the research that is currently being undertaken to be maintained at a satisfactory level. This is important. Nothing is more unsatisfactory to people who are undertaking research work than to find their funds cut off and that they are obliged to discontinue their work. This is frustrating. I hope that the implementation of this legislation will enable the work that is being undertaken by CSIRO to be continued. I congratulate the O'rganisattion on its work and I am sure that this will be another example of its value to Australia and, in this instance, to the cattle industry. I support the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Anthony) read a third time. LIVE-STOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY COLLECTION BILL 1968 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 October (vide page 1756), on motion by Mr Anthony: That the Bill be now read a second time.",76
189,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Mallee) [8.47]-In his second reading speech the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony) said: The purpose ol this Bill, which is complementary io the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Bill 1968 Which we have just debatedis to provide the machinery necessaiy for the collection of the special levy imposed by the Livesaid: stock Slaughter Levy Bill 1968. The matter to which 1 want to draw attention was raised by me when similar legislation was before the House in the early 1960s. The proposal before us requires recognised slaughtermen to refund the equivalent of the levy to the vendor if the livestock are not slaughtered within 30 days of purchase. Often persons attend a private sale or an auction and buy cattle in what are called the fat pens. These cattle are in better than store condition and may be fat enough for slaughtering but they can be made better on pastures. If a man buys them in the fat section it is generally accepted that they will eventually be slaughtered, but if they are not slaughtered within 30 days the levy must be refunded to the vendor. This is a good provision. Sometimes sheep and cattle can be bought in the fat pens just as cheaply as or more cheaply than stock in the store pens depending on the market. It is often a good business proposition for a man to buy threequarter fat beasts, which are good enough for killing, and to hold them for a few months until the winter. I have found that generally speaking in Melbourne the best market for beef is during the week before the Melbourne Show. I do not want anybody to say that I advocate marketing then because the keen cattleman watches the market and the conditions and he knows when to act. Question resolved in the affirmative.

MEAT RESEARCH BILL 1968 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 October (vide page 1757), on the motion by Mr Anthony: That the Bill be now read a second time.",77
190,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Mallee) [8.50]-Mr Speaker, as the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony) presented his second reading speech some little time ago, it is as well to remind honourable members what the purpose of this Bill is. The Minister The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Meat Research Act 1960-1965 to provide for the payment of the additional levy That is the levy with which we have just dealt in passing the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Bill 1968: . . . into the Meat Research Trust Account and to provide for the funds derived from the levy plus matching Commonwealth contributions for approved expenditure, to be used for financing service and investigation activities of direct interest to the meat processing industry. I approve of this proposal. My colleague, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett), has been loud in his praise of it. The monej'S will be made available to the Commonwealth Scientific and industrial Research Organisation-that is, at Cannon Hill--to finance work in this field approved by the Minister on the recommendation of the Australian Meat Research Committee. We must congratulate the Minister for bringing this legislation forward. 1 do not think that any cattlemen will be in doubt as to the way in which the nioney that they have put into this proposal is invested. Directly or indirectly, the money comes from the man who sells the cattle. I do not think that he will be concerned with the money that he pays by way of levy when he compares it with the benefits derived by the industry from the levy.",77
191,Mr DUTHIE,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Wilmol) [8.51]-We on this side of the House accept and approve of this measure and the three related measures which are being considered hy the House. But we completely condemn the Government for the way that it has introduced these matters for discussion tonight without clue regard to our views on that matter. I will not tell you Sir, what we arranged about these Bills before the sitting was suspended, l f I did, you would be just as disgusted as we are at this moment. We are always pleased to see money made available for research into primary industry and primary products. The reason that more must be done for the meat industry is that we find that a lot of our processed meat is going overseas to America. Our quota has been suspended for the time being until the Americans dispose of the Australian processed meat products already in their country. This is a very serious time for our producers. We know that the Americans have imposed rigid standards on the processing factories throughout Australia. Many of our factories have gone out of business because the standards set were so high. These standards are set high deliberately because no doubt exists that the Americans are not happy about getting meat from Australia. We will be less happy with the decisions made in America when the Nixon Administration gets under way. Therefore, we appreciate the concern of the Government to improve the quality of our meat products, not only for home consumption but also for export. The money collected by way of this levy will go to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to help in financing special projects within the meat industry. This is an excellent scheme and we approve of it. Clause 4 amends section 6 of the principal Act. Proposed new section 6A (3.) reads: Subject to the last preceding section, moneys sianding to the credit of the special account shall not be expended otherwi.se than in making payments to liie Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation for or in relation lo scientific research in connection with the processing of meiti or of other products for the slaughter of cattle, sheep or lambs. Meat processing factories are located in each of our Stales. They process for home and overseas markets. We realise that they must work to a very high standard indeed. In some cases the factories either have had to go out of production or spend a lot of money in lifting the standards within their meat works. Australia is fighting to maintain a certain level of processed meat production. Our own consumption of processed meat is rising each year. The Opposition appreciates that the CSIRO, with its vast ramifications in the matter of research, is the best organisation that can be brought into this field. It covers a wider field probably than any other organisation of its kind in the world. We are proud of the CSIRO and of its tremendous work in research. It has improved the quality of almost every range of production that honourable members could name, not only in the jjrimary industries but also in the secondary industries. Therefore, we on this side of the House agree with the purpose of this Bill. We know that the proceeds of the levy will be put to very good use by the CSIRO.",78
192,Mr KATTER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Kennedy) [8.56]- I support this Bill with a great deal of enthusiasm. I spent last weekend wandering over an area which greatly demands the benefits of any sort of research which will improve our most important primary industry, cattle raising. There are many research projects being carried out in our nation. In the great northern part of the country, we see agronomists and agrostologists working. In the brigalow country we see a research station carrying out most valuable work. But there is an aspect of this brigalow development that I think we sometimes overlook. It is that the quicker a new settler gets on his feet so much more quickly will he be able to contribute in no uncertain manner to the Treasury funds of the nation. Very briefly I take this opportunity to put the spotlight for a moment on what I consider to be the last remnants of the genuine pioneers of this country. I refer to those people who have settled in brigalow areas. Last weekend I had the opportunity to come into rather intimate contact with some of their problems and with some of the methods they are using to solve or partly solve these problems. For the benefit of some honourable members who would not have a clue about brigalow areas and so on- I heard a few 'Hear, hears!' to some of the earlier remarks in this debate- I feel that I should add to the knowledge of those honourable members if I can. The technique whereby brigalow areas are cleared is very simple, or at least appears to be very simple. An area is cleared. Uncertainty exists as to how it will react to that clearing. The great problem that settlers face in brigalow areas after clearing is sucker regrowth. We see this in various phases in the brigalow areas. Sometimes this regrowth can be cleared by burning off. Sometimes it can be cleared by slick raking. Sometimes it can be cleared only by deep ploughing. But here is the rub. This final process requires equipment which is quite beyond the resources of the settlers. Hence the great necessity for additional funds for research. In the area that I visited last weekend is a brigalow research station which is doing extremely valuable work. I do not think that the difficulties that beset the meat industry are fully appreciated. I. refer particularly to difficulties that are experienced when development is in the infant stage such as it is in the brigalow country. That is the reason for this Bill. If it means that greater funds will be made available for accelerated research into sucker regrowth in the brigalow country, leading eventually not only to greater numbers of stock in those areas but also to the production of finer quality beef, I give the Bill my complete support.",78
193,Mr HANSEN,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Wide Bay) [9.0]- I do not wish to talk about brigalow suckers or any other suckers. This measure deals with meat research. Much has been said about the amount of money that has been made available to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation from the levies which are raised under the Livestock Slaughter Levy Bill which we discussed earlier. It amazes me to think that the CSIRO meat research laboratory at Cannon Hill, which has been referred to by two members of the Australian Country Party, is practically alongside the Brisbane abattoir. This abattoir recently had its export licence taken away because of unhygienic conditions at the abattoir and because it did not comply with the requirements for the American meat trade. It seems to me that someone is very much at fault. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony) in answer to a question last week indicated that notice was served on the Brisbane abattoir last March that it would lose its licence if it did not take steps to meet American requirements. Research has been proceeding at the CSIRO meat research laboratory alongside the abattoir which has been the subject of a great deal of attention by vested meat interests from overseas, which have been trying to break into the Brisbane metropolitan meat market and which, with the support of the Liberal Country Party Government in Queensland, have eventually broken through. I believe that there is something very' much amiss in the administration of the Brisbane abattoir when this situation arises. The abattoir has research facilities available alongside of it. The Minister for Primary Industry said that in March of this year notice was served on the abattoir that it would have to carry out certain repairs to the works. What happened is not the Minister's fault. I believe there is something amiss in the administration of the abattoir when such conditions were allowed to continue for so long. As I have said, this abattoir was selected for attention by the overseas meat interests in order to obtain a breakthrough into the Brisbane metropolitan meat market. Now they have obtained a breakthrough. They have also obtained a great advantage because meat for export cannot be slaughtered at the Brisbane abattoir. I lay the blame fairly and squarely upon the Queensland Government for not attending to these matters. As I said the CSIRO meat research laboratory, which is financed by the producers cattle and by the Commonwealth Governmind. ment in equal proportion, is alongside Brisbane abattoir, yet the Queensland Government has not taken advantage of future the facilities available at the laboratory.",79
194,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Hunter) [9.3]-It intention to take up the time of the House for very long in this debate. The Australian Labor Party supports the Bill. But it apparent to me, if it is not apparent to every other honourable member, that every man is entitled to be paid for his labour. it is agreed that for many years the grazier has been enjoying very high prices for stock, particularly for lambs. In the electhere torate of Hunter, until recently people had to pay Is 6d for a small lamb chop. Admitis tedly the producer is not receiving the full benefit of the high prices. What amazed most in this debate were the remarks of honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull), the spokesman for the Australian Oountry Party. He is a man who enjoys respect of most members of the Opposition. Mr TurnbuU-What is coming next?",80
195,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,The honourable member in should listen to what is coming next. said that the best time to market lambs Victoria is just before the Melbourne Show. Mr Turnbull- I did not say that. I referred to beef.,80
196,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"The honourable member has corrected me. He said that the best time to market beef is just before the Melbourne Show. It means the same thing. In other words, he says: ' I believe in the manipulasumers. tion of the market so that we get price'. The point I make is that when the postal workers withdraw their labour they are called traitors and Communists.",80
197,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Order ! I think the honourable member is getting a little wide of the Bill. The Bill deals with meat research and the moneys allocated for this purpose. It has nothing to do with the marketing meat, whether beef or lamb. It refers to the application of the moneys, and I ask honourable member to confine himself to that sphere.",80
198,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,I am sorry. The wideness of of my remarks indicates the wideness of my I find it difficult to make my point in the such a narrow sphere. The Labor Party supports the Bill and hopes that in the farmers will try to ensure that housewives are not charged the exorbitant prices for lamb and beef which they have been is not my charged through the years.,80
199,Dr EVERINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING,"Capricornia) [9.6] is - I want to comment briefly on the fact that the funds are derived mainly from producers in the meat industry. The decision I think about where the money will go depends upon the recommendations of the Australian his Meat Research Committee. 1 point out that are other people concerned with the meat industry. I refer to the consumers. It also worthwhile pointing out that there is a very great disparity in the scale of promc duction of different producers in the beef the industry. Some people are working hard, they are making money and they are contributing funds which are used for research. the Other people are minding the northern half of this country. They have hundreds of thousands of square miles of property which they are neglecting, which they are allowing to become eroded and which, only recent years, have been brought into proHe duction by the action mainly of the State in governments. I make a plea that the Government should make some effort to direct these funds and this research not only in the direction indicated by the Australian Meat Research Committee but also in the direction which is in the interests of this country, in the interests of the conservation of our land, in the interests of the smaller producers who have a small voice in the matter and in the interests of the conAt this stage I do not propose to the highest say how this could be done. There has been very little opportunity for us to prepare ourselves for this debate. 1 speak for honourable members on both sides of the House. Evidently honourable members opposite are not willing to speak at this stage.

This matter has been decided by the House on previous occasions, and the House has sustained a Speaker's ruling to uphold a standing order. Therefore, I am wondering whether it is in order in these circumstances to move a motion of dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling because such a ruling has already been upheld by the House.",81
213,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,There is no point of order.,82
214,Mr BRYANT,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Wills) [9.17]-Standing order 105 states: Ministers may arrange the order of their notices and orders of the day on the Notice Paper as they think fit. It is the established procedure that order of business in this place shall arranged by Ministers, but it then becomes the property of this House. It is surely with the in the competence of any member to move that a difierent order of business be adopted unless the standing orders expressly proto hibit this. As far as I. can tell, it is not expressly prohibited in the standing orders. While standing order 105 allows the initiathere tive to lie with Ministers, and this is tradiHouse tional in the way our parliamentary system works, no system of standing orders can prevent the Parliament itself from conarrange trolling its own affairs. Insofar as the pretation of standing order 105 inhibits transcends this power of the Parliament, the Speaker's ruling must be disagreed with. I believe it is important that we place the actual competence to decide the order of business in the hands of the assembled majority of this Parliament. This is the principle that is at stake in this affair. is not a question of whether we want to take the business over from the Governbefore ment. We must allow, in any procedure in which we are paying full respect to parliamentary system of majority rule, for country. the majority of members to say what the order of business shall be. As far as 1 can see, standing order 105 applies in particular to the printed orders that come before House each day. The notice paper sets out the order of business. In any formed group of people there are rules of procedure and an agenda and Ihe order in which the items on the agenda are to be taken. In any other body of people it is competent for the majority to say that order of the day X, for example, shall be called on before order of the day N. I believe it is important for the Parliament to decide that it shall control the order in which it considers items of business. To that extent we must vote against the strict interpretation of standing order 105 which says, in effect, that not only shall Ministers be able to arrange the orders of the day but that other members and indeed the majority of members shall be prohibited from changing the order. I believe that this is against the general principles of parliamentary practice and majority rule.",82
215,Dr MACKAY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Evans) [9.18]-We have listened to a most astonishing speech from the the honourable member for Wills (Mr be Bryant). Standing order 105 is absolutely explicit. It states that Ministers may arrange order of their notices and orders of the day on the notice paper as they think fit. It does not say that Ministers shall propose the House: it does not say that Ministers shall suggest; it does not say that the House shall be demagogic; it does not say that shall be a popular vote taken in the as to the order of business. It says that the order shall be in the hands of the Government and that the Ministers shall the order. It does not propose that interthe House should arrange the order. There or is no doubt about, or questioning of, the Speaker's ruling on this particular standing order. I maintain that the objection is absolutely flimsy and indeed frivolous. There is no possibility of honest doubt or indeed of the slightest shadow of doubt about the meaning of standing order 105. I maintain therefore that what has been done at present It is most frivolous and is simply to delay the consideration of measures that are to come the House.

BOUNTY BILL 1968 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 August (vide page 462), on motion by Mr Anthony: That the Bill be now read a second time.",82
217,Mr DAVIES,PROCESSED MILK PRODUCTS,"Braddon) [9.33]-As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony) indicated when he introduced this measure, the purpose of this Bill is to amend the Processed Milk Products Bounty Act 1962-1967 to permit the payment of this bounty on specified processed milk products that have been manufactured from products that have already attracted the production bounty under the Dairying Industry Act. I point out that the 1962 legislation was introduced by the Government because companies engaged in this section of the industry, such as Tongala Milk Products Pty Ltd and Nestle Co. (Australia) Ltd, found that for the raw materials for their products they had to compete with other manufacturing sections of the dairy industry. As a result of the introduction of this legislation those companies were able to qualify for the bounty and thus were able to obtain their raw materials on a more equitable basis. Under the original Act an amount of $800,000 was to be set aside each year for payment as export bounty on processed milk products. Each year the Minister determines an interim bounty rate, and the rate for this year has been determined at 5c per lb of butterfat contained in processed milk products. We have been given to understand from the Australian Dairy Industry Council that this legislation will allow the maximum use to be made of the amount of $800,000 already provided for. The Government will not be involved in any further expenditure. Because it will prove to be of very great benefit to certain sections of the dairy industry, the Opposition supports the measure. The measure will have effect for the next 5 years and will be incorporated in the current 5-year stabilisation plan which ends on 30th June 1972. The Australian Dairy Industry Council submitted a proposal in an endeavour to assist this section of the industry. The Council requested the exemption of specified processed milk products from the restrictive provision contained in section 4(3.) of the Processed Milk Products Bounty Act. That section reads: The bounty is not payable in respect ot processed milk products produced from goods in respect of which bounty has been paid or is payable under the Dairying Industry Act 1957 or under the Dairying Industry Act 1962. This means that the export bounty will be payable on products manufactured from butterfat which has already attracted a bounty under the Dairying Industry Act. At the commencement of my speech I indicated that these manufacturers were permitted originally to buy for their products raw materials which had already attracted a bounty. Under this legislation when the raw materials come into the Tongala and Nestle factories for processing they will be able to attract the bounty a second time. The reason for this is obvious. Those of us who have taken a keen interest in the Australian dairy industry over the years can understand what has occurred. The processed milk products section of the industry has suffered from subsidised competition on export markets, as has practically every other section of the dairy industry. As the Minister pointed out, and according to thefiguresmade available, this competition was so strong that the butterfat in processed milk product exports was 18% lower in 1967-68 than in 1966-67. Such a decrease is serious. It is no good pouring the butterfat down the drain. It has to come back into the industry and be used in other products within the industry. This butterfat that would normally be exported is being channelled back into butter production. As I will indicate in a few moments, butter producers in this country are in trouble because of competition from other countries. We commend the Government for introducing this Bill, which provides for the payment of a bounty on butterfat, for a second time, to the manufacturers of processed milk products who use butterfat in their products. This will give them a little cream on the skim milk, as it were, while they attempt to hold their export markets overseas. As I indicated, there is already a great problem with butter surpluses. When the United Kingdom was seeking to become a member of the European Common Market in 1962, I visited the Common Market countries to study this problem. At that time, about 100,000 tons of butter were being held in cold storage each year in those countries. The governments of those countries were spending $A300m a year on price support programmes. This was lower than the amount that was being spent at the height of the price support scheme in the United States. The United States Government was spending $A350m in building up the price to the consumer by paying so much an acre to farmers for paddocks not being used. While it was doing this it was keeping up the price of milk and allowing the surplus to be poured down the drain, as it were. When I went back to the Common Market countries again in 1967 I found that their expenditure on price support schemes had risen to something like $A700m a year. Of course, this has had a tremendous effect on the Common Market countries; it has led to increased production. I found that the amount of butter held in cold storage represented more than 250% of the figure in 1962. Whereas 5 years previously 100,000 tons was being held, in 1967 some 275,000 tons was being held. On top of that statisticians from the mon Market countries have astounded us by telling us that by 1972 the rate of production will have increased to such an extent under the price support scheme that these countries will' be holding in cold storage some three-quarters of a million tons of butter. They can get rid of it. But a fortnight ago, on thefiguresI have, butter in France was selling at 76c Australian per lb. The French are prepared to dump butter anywhere in the world at 26c Australian per lb. The Dutch are prepared, even today, to dump butter anywhere in the world at 22c Australian per 1'b. This is a very serious situation. If one of the member countries incurs a loss, that member applies to the European Economic Community Commission for an amount equal to its loss. I well remember on one occasion that the price of butter was reduced by 10c per lb overnight in West Germany to increase home consumption and to enable some of the stored butter to be taken out of cold storage. The West German producers incurred substantial losses, but their Government applied to the Commission for the amount they had lost, and this was forthcoming. The situation is becoming increasingly serious for us. because our traditional market is the United Kingdom, which takes some 70.000 tons of our production each year. If and when the United Kingdom enters the European Common Market, the price of butter per lb, which is about 40c Australian per lb in the United Kingdom now, will eventually go up to the price ruling in the Common Market countries, which is some 70c to 80c Australian per lb. Australia will then find it very difficult to maintain its annual exports of 70,000 tons of butter to the United Kingdom. We will be in trouble. We have tried to find markets in South East Asia. We have gone into the Philippines where we have developed a good market, and into Peru and other countries. The Australian Dairy Produce Board has negotiated contracts for the sale of butter overseas. But because of the competition from this highly subsidised export production of the European Common Market countries, we are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out. The price for Australian butter on the United Kingdom market is still running at about 300s per cwt. We have experienced Comtroubles as a result of the devaluation of sterling. I have mentioned those troubles, but I will not discuss them in detail now, as it is not the purpose of this Bill to provide compensation for losses suffered as a result of devaluation. Everybody is anxiously waiting to hear from the Minister what compensation is to be given and to what degree it will carry over into the next season. There is no doubt that we are in trouble in relation to markets for butter. We do not need to go into this question of devaluation again tonight to see that. We have been building up markets overseas particularly in the Philippines. There is no doubt that we can get between 370s and 380s a cwt for butter in some countries. The Australian Dairy Produce Board has found some new markets for us. These are very good markets. The price obtained for butter sold on these markets is higher than the price obtained on the traditional United Kingdom market. The returns from these new markets are coming back to the butter factories and enabling them to increase the returns to the farmers during the season, though it does not look as though the farmers will get any increase in their return this year. We began the season with a return to the farmer of 41c per lb for butter fat. I might point out that this is the lowest return for 17 years. One can imagine the tremendous increases in costs that have occurred over that period. Despite the cost increases, the producers of this product from which butter is manufactured in the factories are receiving the lowest price they have received for their product in 17 years. As I have indicated, the butter manufacturers cannot do much about the return on butter exports because the world price of butter is affected by surplus production and by the intolerable and chaotic marketing conditions resulting from the subsidy paid on butter production in other countries and the dumping operations of the European Economic Community countries. All this imposes great strain on the managers of butter factories. They are practically certain, as one finds when one speaks to them, that they will not get a good return and consequently will not be able to increase the return to the farmers during this season, as they have done in the past. It is a good thing that the Government has guaranteed the farmer a minimum return of 34c per lb for commercial butter fat. It is felt that the price might fall below this level for the first time. If it does, the Government will be called on to honour its undertaking. I am not a pessimist. I still hold out hopes for the industry. I think we can find more new markets. I have simply pointed out the facts as they are. The industry is faced with a tremendous problem, and it is to be hoped that it will be able to get over this problem. We must face facts. In 1962 when it seemed likely that the United Kingdom would enter the European Common Market and we would lose our traditional market for 70,000 tons of butter the appeal went out to the industry to diversify. Between 1962 and 1965 factories which had formerly concentrated on the production of butter turned to the manufacture of such things as milk powder and casein. Quite a change came over the industry. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation came to the industry's aid by developing a process for making reconstituted milk. The Australian Dairy Produce Board, using some of the funds available from the equalisation scheme introduced after the Second World War, went into South East Asia and established factories for the manufacture of reconstituted milk in places like Manila, Singapore and Bangkok. We sent our milk powder and our butter oil to these places and, using Australian know how and funds and local sugar and labour, we produced sweetened condensed milk, which was a very profitable line. We had considerable encouragement from the Government of Singapore and the Government of the Philippines where the Marikina Dairy Company was established. The Socialist Government of Singapore helped us a great deal. When the European Economic Community saw that this venture was proving successful it attempted to dump its products in the area, but the Government of Singapore applied a complete embargo on all such imports. The product had to be produced in the projects to which I have referred. The venture operated successfully for a while. Its success meant that the people producing whole milk powder were not keen to participate in the stabilisation plan; they were getting high prices for their milk powder-up to $280 a ton. But things are different now that there is a world surplus of milk powder. The price dropped to $170 a ton at the beginning of this season and is now $100 a ton. I would like the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony) to tell us the outcome of moves by manufacturers of milk powder to participate in the stabilisation scheme. When prices were high these people were not interested in the scheme but now that the bottom has dropped out of the market they want to participate. For a while the manufacture of milk powder was a success story. A few weeks ago an export award was made to the Australian Dairy Produce Board. In a Press statement issued at the time of the making of the award the Minister for Primary Industry said that the Board's success arose from its initiative in establishing milk recombining plants in Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore. The Press statement reads: Mr Anthony said the Board was well advanced in the development of a plant in Indonesia and was looking into the possibility of opening a plant in Cambodia. He said: 'The existing plants are profitable business ventures but more, importantly they have vindicated the Board's judgement in proving collectively to be a major and expanding outlet for Australian skim milk powder and butter oil. In 1967 the plants took 10,000 tons of skim milk powder and 2,600 tons of butter oil for a total value of $5.2m. In the first half of 1968 nearly 6,000 tons of skim milk powder and 1,400 tons of butter oil were shipped to the plants. From the time the Board entered this field in 1962 until last June the total value of raw materials supplied was $16.6m. This is a very exciting story. But it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to our milk powder.' Recently a South American country- I think it was Argentina - suffere d from a drought. Tenders were called for the supply of 4,000 tons of milk powder and a tender of $60 a ton was received from the United States. We have no hope of competing with a price like that. I know from authoritativefiguresgiven to me recently that in Victoria 26,000 tons of milk powder are' held in storage. The Victorians were peddling this milk powder in the northern States of the Commonwealth at any price. They were accepting as much as $.10 a ton below what had earlier been offered in New South Wales and Queensland. This situation indicates the magnitude of the problem confronting exporters of milk powder. The same situation applies to casein. found a very good market for casein Japan but the price has dropped from $2,500 a ton to $400 a ton. The problem not one confined to the production of butter, milk powder and casein; it applies also the processed milk section of the dairying industry. Companies such as Tongala and Nestles which manufacture products Milo, Lactogen and full milk powder have done a wonderful job for Australia in searching for new markets. They have up markets in practically every part world, including Africa and Burma. The companies face very strong competition Burma. Competition is strong also in Malaysia and Singapore. We must remember always that these are Australian companies using Australian primary products. These are important factors. Sometimes honourable members representing city electorates complain about the subsidies that are paid to the dairying industry. This is a stupid attitude to adopt, because companies engaged in the dairying industry must use cartons, tin foil and other packaging materials for their products and in this way they generate work for the Australian work force. They keep people in employment. So the subsidy does not benefit only the dairy farmers and companies such as Tongala and Nestles but the Australian work force generally. It is important not to overlook this fact. The companies to which I have referred sell have gone out into the world and built up export markets. They now find that they are in trouble from subsidised competition in export markets to such an extent that butter fat in exports of processed milk products was 18% lower in 1967-68 than in 1966-67. The Labor Party welcomes the Government's decision to permit the pay-, ment of a bounty on products made from butter fat which has already attracted bounty under the Dairying Industry Act. This measure will not be a big help to those experiencing difficulties, but it will assist them to maintain their export markets and to cope with competition from other countries. As I. have said, this proposal will not cost the Australian taxpayers any more money. An amount of $800,000 has already been appropriated by the Parliament for We export bounty in the current year, and this in measure will allow that $800,000 to be used to maximum effect. In other words, it is will enable the whole of the money to be used, so that portion of it will not go back to into the Consolidated Revenue Fund or wherever unexpended funds of this kind finish up. lt will all be used for a very good like purpose. It will help to keep people employed in processes that will use up a good deal of the butter fat that might otherwise be channelled back into local built butter production. As I have already of the indicated, there are enough problems already associated with that section of the in industry. This is only a small measure but it is a very valuable one, and for this reason the Opposition supports it.",84
218,Mr GILES,PROCESSED MILK PRODUCTS,"Angas) [10.1]- I pick up where the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) left off. I say that this Bill represents an intelligent step for the Government to take at this time. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony) explained in his second reading speech, and as the honourable member for Braddon has properly pointed out, this measure has been introduced in an attempt to solve the problems of a section of the dairy industry that is now in a state of glut or surplus. It will be apparent, I think, to all honourable members that the products of the dairy industry are made up fundamentally of water, of fat, and of what are called solids not fat, which are proteins. In general terms those are the three components. One could qualify that statement by considering the by-products of milk that are sold and say that one does not sell water, one sells But in some States the producer is paid according to the amount of water in the milk. If my memory serves me correctly, the New South Wales Milk Board pays dairy farmers virtually on the basis of the number of gallons of water in the milk. Water is not a very expensive commodity here, although in some countries it can be. Mr Bosman-Some vendors run the hose into the milk.",87
219,Mr GILES,PROCESSED MILK PRODUCTS,"Speakin g as an experienced dairy farmer I can say that any such activity can be readily spotted. A vendor could not run the hose into his milk without taking a very big risk of being caught. But the fact is that milk is made up largely of water, which is not a very expensive commodity in most countries throughout the world. Likewise, fat is not a very expensive commodity on world markets if one does not differentiate between animal fats and vegetable fats. The fat which becomes butter is the component that is causing most concern in the dairy industry today. As the honourable member for Braddon has pointed out, this Bill has resulted from a proposal submitted by the Australian Dairy Industry Council, on which the Government has acted, and acted properly. The Government has agreed to the Council's proposal for the exemption of specified processed milk products from the restrictive provision contained in section 4 of the Processed Milk Products Bounty Act, so that the export bounty will be payable on products made from butter fat. Here we come to the crux of the problem. Not only is there a well known and well recognised surplus of butter, including Australian butter, on the world's markets, but at present there is also a very serious surplus of processed milk products. This measure seeks to take some of the surplus butter fat from the butter section of the industry and encourage its use in the production of processed milk products by the extension of the bounty provisions to include butter fat which is so used and which has already attracted bounty under the Dairying Industry Act. I would like to return to the subject of the various methods of paying for dairy products. I think all honourable members milk. know that the New South Wales Milk Board pays for milk that it sells to consumers not on the basis of quality but on the basis of the total weight. I suggest that this is equivalent to paying on the basis of the water content. In South Australia, however, milk is sold to the consumers through the city milk market and is paid for at producer level on the basis of butter fat content. This means that if I milk Jersey cows I will be paid only on the butter lat content of the milk, and although, there may be less milk than 1 would get from other breeds of cows it may contain just as much butter fat as would be found in a larger sample of milk given by Friesians or Shorthorns. Some people in South Australia feel that this levels out the competition between breeds. It provides a chance for all breeds to be used for production and for payment to be made according to the amount of butter fat in the milk rather than Ihe amount of water in it. I suggest that this is probably just as asinine a method of paying for dairy products as is the New South Wales Milk Board method of paying on the basis of water content. Both methods are patently ridiculous in this day and age. Water is not valuable and fat is not valuable. That brings us to the question: What is the valuable component of dairy products today and how can we most effectively make payment to the producer? I think it is beyond question that we should be paying on the food value of the milk. This is not in the water and it is not in the fat. It is in the solids not fat, in which are included the carbohydrates, the sugars and the proteins. This is where the food value of d.iiry products is to be found. I suggest with great respect that the Minister one of these days should get around to reorganising the dairy industry along these lines of payment. I. can appreciate, from my knowledge of many influential people in the industry, what troubles he will have on his hands when he does so, and how difficult it will be to achieve complementary legislation, if this is found to be necessary. But the fact is that we are past the day when we can tolerate the practice of paying dairy farmers for two components of their product that have no value on today's world markets. We must get around to effecting payment on the food value of milk. The honourable member for Braddon made a most comprehensive speech and I have no intention of going over all ihe ground that he covered. He mentioned the AusVictorian tralian dairy produce factories established in South East Asia under either bipartite financial arrangements, such as in Singapore, or tripartite arrangements as were originally negotiated in Thailand. I do not know whether the honourable member really meant to convey that the establishment these factories was possible only because there was a Socialist government in Singaact. pore. However, we will let that pass. From what I have heard, the Singapore plant fallen almost info disrepair. I am not certain whether some of its assets have been realised. Perhaps the Minisler will us this later on. This faclory in was established before the days of confrontation with Indonesia. It had pioneer industry status, as the honourable member for Braddon said. The agreement under which ii operated tied in by-products Australian dairy industry with locally progood-Australia duced sugar, and it turned out five or six different grades and categories of condensed milk. But my point is that it was set up lo supply a much bigger market than Singamuch pore alone. Confrontation unfortunately limited the fieid of sales of its products. The problem was aggravated by the very real dumping practices that were indulged in around Singapore and similar areas. The main difficulty of that factory, however, was that it was geared to supply a much bigger market than the Singapore market alone. This factory, therefore, has not able to achieve the economy of scale that such factories must depend on for iheir viability, and for this reason it has fallen on had days. The honourable member for Braddon said that he thought that ihcre was a need for equalisation in respect of dried milk products. .1 hope I am quoting him properly. 1 do not quite know what he means by the need for equalisation in respect of these products. I have heard on the bush wireless milk. that there is a move afoot to produce a compulsory equalisation scheme for dried milk products in Australia. If this is so. I point out that there arc many people in States other than Victoria who would go along with a compulsory equalisation scheme in order to save a State that has gone in for dairying to a ridiculous extent. I hope no move will be made that will drag the industry down. I think the surplus is temporary and that it is peculiar to the industry. The historical attitude of the dairy indusiry has been to wait until a surplus becomes more or less permanent before taking panic action. I hope that this will be the attitude of the industry and of the Government. on Ihis occasion. The course J am suggesting is that v/e take a of good look at the problem and make sure it is noi a temporary problem before we If we do act, I would be in favour of a voluntary equalisation scheme for dried has milk products. I am sure that I would be quite supported heartily by many people, cooperatives and proprietary firms in South tell Australia. There is not a great deal more Singapore that I have to say tonight.",88
220,Mr BRYANT,PROCESSED MILK PRODUCTS,Do not stop now.,89
221,Mr GILES,PROCESSED MILK PRODUCTS,"I will continue and will refer to something that would probably do of the the honourable member for Wills some n milk wafers. They are the best gob stoppers 1I have encountered yet. The New Zealand equivalent is not as good as the Australian product, which I think is more edible. I do not believe that either the dairy industry or the Government has taken sufficient interest in the production of milk wafers as a means of helping the starving people of South East Asia and elsewhere. This is a good article which is produced under a patent that I think is owned by the industry itself. The product uses surplus processed milk powder in a been form which is readily assimilated by the digestive tracts of people who are not used to our high protein standard of living. I should like to sec the Government try lo promote the sale of milk wafers in new markets, especially in areas of Asia. There may also be a market for them in Africa. I know, for instance, that we have a good trade commissioner in Nairobi. In places like Nairobi there could be a market for these wafers, and these markets could make good inroads into our surplus processed",89
222,Mr DUTHIE,PROCESSED MILK PRODUCTS,-Who is making the wafers?,89
223,Mr GILES,PROCESSED MILK PRODUCTS,"I think that so far only the not Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is making them, but in New Zealand private firms have commenced their manufacture. This matter needs to be followed up both as a means of overcoming a glut in this section of the industry and also on humanitarian grounds, which is, I am sure, why the honourable member for Wilmot is exhibiting such an interest in the matter. Tonight I have suggested a change that 1 believe must occur in the dairy industry in regard to the payment to primary producers. I will mention one more change before I conclude. I am not sure that I am right, but I believe that traditional, and sometimes conservative, elements within the dairy industry must be prepared to accept change in order to put the industry on a proper footing. I realise that ling on to slightly more dangerous ground. I believe that as long as we have a surplus of butterfat in the dairy industry and as long as there is a sale-this is somewhat problematical at present-for protein and carbohydrates in the form of processed foods, it is quite ridiculous to go around the country letting farmers take out the very products that are good and feed them to pigs. The farmer is getting the same price for the fat as he would if he were seliiug the whole milk equivalent. What could be more stupid than this? We are trying to encourage a smaller production of butter, and therefore fat, and a greater pioduction of the food value of dairy produce. I believe that the time must come when payments are split to achieve a payment for butter and a method whereby the 50% content of protein, carbohydrates and sugar, is paid for and not necessarily shoved down the neck of a pig, which is not to the benefit of the dairy industry itself. It suits the farmer very well, because he is getting full value for the fat component of the milk that nobody particularly wants. However, it does not suit the dairy industry as a whole. The industry should be looking beyond this parochial method of payment within the industry. I have made two fairly provocative suggestions tonight. I believe they are basic to the problem that this Bill attempts to tackle. 1 do not know whether they could be implemented tomorrow, or indeed in 5 years time, but I make the point that within the co-operative movement particularly there are rather conservative elements that are very much against any change. I suggest that over the years there must be change in the structure of the dairy industry if it is to exist as a viable proposition. I support the Bill.",89
224,Mr LUCOCK,PROCESSED MILK PRODUCTS,"Lyne) [10.18]- ! have much pleasure in supporting this Bill, which was introduced by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony). If we examine the Minister's second reading speech we can appreciate some of the problems and difficulties that are confronting the dairy industry at present. The Minister said: The processed milk products section of the dairy industry has suffered from subsidised competition in export markets to such an extent that butter fat in processed milk products exports was 18% lower I am get- in 1967-68 than in 1966-67. This indicates some of the problems and complexities that confront this industry. This is particularly important because one of our export products is involved. Recently we were discussing exports and the need for exports to sustain our financial progress and development. If we take into account the contribution that is made by primary industry in the export field, we get a picture of the contribution that this industry makes to the financial stability of Australia. Because of what is happening in Europe at the present time in regard to the European Economic Community, the competition, particularly in the Asian area, has been highlighted. I was interested to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) when he spoke of the criticism that had come from certain quarters in metropolitan areas about the assistance being given to primary industry. This criticism comes from people without an understanding or an appreciation of the contribution that primary industry has macle to the financial stability of this country. This criticism to my mind shows a complete lack of understanding and a complete lack of appreciation of what assistance to primary industry really means and really does. We should look also at the continuing factor in relation to employment. The employment situation in the primary industries is related not only to those who are directly concerned with primary production; it also spills over into many other industries. As has been pointed out, there are containers into which the various products of the indusiry are put. The production of these and of the other things required by the industry provides continuing employment. One of the advantages of the policy of this Government lies in the discussions with the industry in regard to the assistance to be given to it. I think that we should take note of the words of the Minister who said in his second reading speech: The Australian Dairy Industry Council has submitted a proposal, which has the support of facturers of processed milk products, to help the latter compete in ihe export field. The Government has agreed lo the Council's proposal for the exemption of specified processed milk products from the restrictive provision contained in section 4(3.) of the Processed Milk Products BountyAct, so that the export' bounty will be payable on products made from - butterfat which has already attracted bounty under the Dairying try Act. This is of tremendous importance and value in these days when our co-operative societies are facing many problems and difficulties. This is a step in the right direction, towards giving assistance to the co-operative societies. The maximum usage of this S800.000 which is to be made available will give to the industry a stability which will allow it lo plan ahead. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that on a previous occasion I said that the plan to help primary industry is of tremendous value in that it gives stability to industry planning. That is a very important factor in regard to this matter. I had the privilege not so very long ago of visiting one of our reconstituted milk plants in Manila. A young man from my electorate was over there managing the plant. As I went through the faclory and saw what was being done and the progress that had been made in the factory in a period of only 6 months, 1 realised and appreciated lo a greater degree the contribution that we were able to make in this area, ftrslly by giving a market for the product produced in Australia and secondly, by assisting the Philippines Government to establish in Manila a secondary industry which woulcl be of value to that country. A great deal has been said in regard to this legislation and much has been said in regard to the primary products which were the subjects of the other measures that have been discussed tonight. I do not want, particularly at this hour, to labour the point, but 1 congratulate the Minister for Primary Industry and the Government on again extending this assistance and in giving this further stability to the dairy industry. 1I have always said that our primary industries have a future. Having regard to the part that Australia is to play in providing food in this area of ihe world and with the continuing increase in our population, more food and primary products will need to be produced manu-. here. Therefore a future exists for our primary industries. The most important factor today is to see that we give assistance to the primary industries so that they are able to take advantage of the prospects ahead of them. In this Bill we have a further indication that the Government is indusconscious of this fact. It is always ready to help an industry which is prepared to help itself. I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this legislation.",90
225,Mr ANTHONY,PROCESSED MILK PRODUCTS,"Richmond-Minister for Primary Industry) [10.25]-in replyA few questions were raised during the course of the debate on the Processed Milk Products Bounty Bill which seeks to overcome an anomaly in that processors did not receive any portion of the bounty if their products contained a quantity of butterfat which already had attracted a bounty under the Dairying Industry Acl. The questions were not related directly to this Bill but, for the benefit of those honourable members who raised them, 1 should like to say a word or two about them. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) inquired about the progress that had been made in bringing about some form of equalisation for skim milk powder. There have been discussions this year between manufacturers of skim milk powder to try to bring about a voluntary scheme with the purpose of establishing a home consumption price, the surplus to be exported to the very depressed world market. At the moment, with no scheme operating, the ruling world price determines what the domestic price will be. As a result, producers of skim milk powder suffer seriously because of low world prices. Unfortunately, no agreement could be achieved between the manufacturers and now that there has been a complete breakdown in discussions to establish a voluntary scheme, the Australian Dairy Produce Board, a group of themanufacturers and officers of my Department are examining the possibility of a compulsory equalisation scheme. The establishment of this scheme may not be possible under the constitution of the Australian Dairy Produce Board. However, we are examining the situation to see whether a scheme of some sort can be implemented. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) made, I thought, a very worthwhile contribution lo the debate. He raised some rather pertinent questions. He referred to the method of payment for dairy products in Australia. Some of his remarks were akin to remarks that I remember making in this House a few years ago, before 1 became Minisler for Primary Industry. He said that it was anomalous and almost stupid to have a system ofpayment for dairy products that incorporated a payment for the wafer content of those products. The anomaly arises where milk boards pay on a gallonage basis. As the honourable member for Angas pointed out, milk is made up of three ingredients. These are water, solids not fat, and fat. The water is not really worth anything, but some people seem to be prepared to pay a lot for it. To overcome this anomaly a scheme of payment would need to be devised which would take into account not only the fat but also the solids not fat. At this point in time there is no system which can readily, quickly and efficiently determine the solids not fat in milk on which a suitable payment might be made. The honourable member will be interested to know that a committee of the Australian Agricultural Council has been set up to look into the method of payment for dairy products, to see whether advances in technology that have been made in other countries whereby the solids not fat content of milk can be quickly assessed could be adopted here, and to see whether a system of payment could be established which incorporated a balance between the fat and the solids not fat content. I think that in time this will have to be done, but unfortunately we have not got the technical skill to enable us to do it yet. The honourable member for Angas also referred to the reconstitution plant operating in Singapore. He pointed out thai there had been a heavy capital expenditure on the plant which now was not being utilised its fullest extent. I am not sure whether the honourable member is aware-perhap s he is-that the Australian Dairy Produce Board has relinquished its financial interest in the plant in Singapore. It has recouped its investment without loss, and it has arranged for the supply of ingredients to this plant. Products are being processed and are being sold at whatever the ruling prices are for skimmed milk powder and butler oil. However, we have access to this plant. At the present time, with difiicult marketing circumstances overseas it is important that we should have access to the plant, although the prices being obtained for products might not be as high as we would wish. The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) also made a very worthwhile contribution to the debate. Apart from referring to the importance of the Processed Milk Products Bounty Act in helping to overcome certain anomalies in the dairying industry he drew the attention of the House to the important role that the dairying industry plays in the economic makeup of this country. It plays a very worthwhile role in earning foreign exchange which keeps this country progressing and which helps with our national development. The important role which the Australian dairying industry plays can never be overstressed. In fact, in the year just ended the industry earned approximately $93m in foreign exchange. That is a very worthwhile contribution when we consider the problems in our foreign exchange situaiion. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

226,Mr MUNRO,ADJOURNMENT,"Eden-Monaro) [10.34]- I want to draw the attention of the House to the continuing drought in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. In spite of some recent showers the drought is continuing in a large area of the tablelands, particularly in the real Monaro, the southern end. l l is continuing in virtually the whole of the south coast. It is the worse drought in the history of the south coast and parts of Eden Monaro. One of the outstanding features of the battle against the drought has been the difficulty in getting accurate figures about anything and the ease with which it has been possible for a distorted view to be publicised front time to time. This has been especially apparent in the last couple of weeks. Newspaper stories have come out stating that approaches for special drought assistance have been made in vain to the Commonwealth. This is certainly untrue. and editorials have stated that fodder has been building up at railway sidings while the stock starved. This is completely untrue and without any basis of evidence whatsoever. In this unprecedented drought both Commonwealth and State Governments have given unprecedented help, and in every area farmers have been fighting with the problems of drought as effectively as they can with whatever resources are available. However, there have been some problems, as well as some successes, in the efforts made by one particular group in the Bega Valley. This in the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee and I will come back to its problems and successes in a moment. First, I should like to give as good a picture as possible of the overall situation in thai hard hit dairying area of the Eden Pastures Protection Board, from Moruya to Eden on the south coast. The best estimate of ngures from the local branch of the Department of Agriculture and the Eden Pastures Protection Board is that we are concerned with approximately 100,000 head of cattle, including calves, beef and dairy cattle, and about 71,000 sheep. The latest estimate of deaths in cattle arrived at today is about 4,000 head. Surprisingly enough, it has not been found possible to arrive at an estimate of the number of cattle that have been sold out of the area, but it is probably safe to say that this would be well in excess of 10,000 head. The number ot cattle that have gone out to agistment was estimated at 8,000 head some 10 days ago, and later figures are not available today. The local branch of the Department of Agriculture estimates that 40,000 of these cattle are of milking dairy stock, and that on the approximately 600 dairies in the area, supporting stock, heifers and milch cows usually account for about 25% of the number. So it would be safe to say that there are some 25,000 actual milking cows, which naturally do not lend themselves to agistment. The nearest estimate I have been able to get as to the proportion of cows that would be feeding off irrigated pastures is between 8% and 10%. So this still leaves a very large number of milking cows in the continuing problem area requiring imported feed. However, it does show that a very large number of cattle could be Other stories moved out to agistment. Apart from very substantial offers for free agistment-and a fresh offer was received this morning for free agistment for 3,000 head of cattle-ther e is a very great deal of agistment 'available at from 50c to 70c per beast per week. Hay that has been bought just to keep starving stock alive - this is apart from the free hay-is costing $1 to Si.40 a head a week. It is very obvious that it is a far better proposition to put cattle where they can fatten for half the cost of barely keeping them alive. If there is not substantial rain in the immediate future there will have to be a very great movement of cattle out to 'agistment. Water is often a more drastic decision maker than feed. The recent showers have decreased the flow of cattle to agistment, but this can be expected to resume on a very large scale unless there is follow-up rain immediately. All the stories about hay being held up at Nimmitabel have been completely false. There has been no hold-up and none is presently expected. Hay has been arriving at Nimmitabel in the last few days in greater quantities than before. Indications are that it can be handled. Yesterday 22 trucks of hay and 1 truck of wheat arrived at Nimmitabel. while a further 19 trucks were on their way towards Nimmishortage tabel. A special train from Goulburn to Nimmitabel took down 13 trucks for Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee, 5 other trucks of gift fodder and 2 trucks of privmanaged ately owned fodder. This train arrived at 8.30 a.m. today. Another train will arrive at Nimmitabel tomorrow at 9 a.m. It is expected that tomorrow morning there will be 4 large trucks of hay for the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee and 2 smaller trucks for private owners. It is also expected that there will be a carry-over of 17 trucks at Nimmitabel from today. Both the to be true. Secretary of the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee and the local officer from the New South Wales Department of Agribetween culture have advised me that fodder is ing fairly well and that they seem to sufficient road transport to handle situation. One very encouraging aspect of this drought has been the response of farmers in the more favoured areas who have offered about 95,000 bales of hay, which would be a quantity approaching some 2,000 tons. To date about 2,000 bales this free fodder has arrived. There is an article in this morning's 'Sydney Morning Herald' indicating an offer from Narrabri of ?ome S28.O00 worth of cotton seed hulls. This offer apparently has not been taken up yet but the officers of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture know about it and I think we will hear about it in the very near future. 1 would now like to briefly mention activities of the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee. This Committee was formed when the Mumhulla Shire Council decided to call a meeting of local organisations and bodies concerned with the welfare of farmers on Monday, 23rd September. The Committee is made up of one representaassistance tive from the Imlay, Mumbulla and Euroboclalla Shires, the Bega Municipal Council, the Eden Pastures Protection Board, the Factories Association, the Primary Procredit ducers Union, and the Australian Primary Producers Union. In addition to these, other people were co-opted, including the Reverend Frank Woodwell, who has extremely good in getting us free hay agistment. The Committee set out lo pura chase hay which, in the event, did not turn out lo bc particularly cheap and some of it was rejected by farmers. There was a of railway trucks in October, occasioned partially by the 2 weeks strike the by storemen and packers in Sydney, but organisations and individuals to get their hay through and the Committee did not get as much as it wanted and did not advise the State or Commonwealth Governments until the shortage was virtually over. This led to the confusion about the demand for Army transport but, apart from the public confusion, the Premier's assurance that adequate rail and road transport was available has turned out Loose statements about any conflicts the Slate and Federal Governflowments over drought aid having created have delays have all been quite false. The the involvement of the ALP, particularly through the President of the Eden-Monaro Council of the ALP, has been particularly clumsy in trying to make political capital out of this desperate struggle against a now natural disaster. Statements from ALP sources have become mixed up in the public of mind with statements from the Committee and this has led to charges that some members of the Committee have been politically motivated, rather than motivated by a desire to help the farmers. Spokesmen for the Committee have denied party political affiliation as a committee, and I believe them. But in addition to this, the Premier more of New South Wales has quoted Committee sources as making misleading and untrue statements about the request for the Army transport. The great pity of this cloud of confusion is that it has reduced the farmers' confidence in government assistance available to them ancl has even the apparently blindfolded some farmers so that they did not take advantage of the that was and is available. On the other hand, the Committee has clone a splendid job in obtaining offers of free hay and free agistment, and particular for thi.s must go to the Reverend Frank Woodwell. Whatever happens in the immediate or long term future there is something to be learned from this battle. been In Eden-Monaro we have broken new and ground in achieving Commonwealth aid in broad range of drought assistance in a regional drought for the first time in Commonwealth history. In spite of occasional healthy disputes between representatives of the two Parliaments there has been effective co-operation where it counts, in practical measures. I hope we can go on from there to establish a better basis for analysing measures to control and mitigate drought. It is fairly true to say that just as Commonwealth involvement in these matters is only recent, so too it is only recently that we are beginning to acquire the men and materials, the methods and techniques, and the machinery of analysis needed to tackle this great task. As an initial step I am approaching the Treasurer (Mr MCMahon) to ask him to make an analysis of taxation provisions so as to determine what further measures might be taken to encourage people to spend on conservation while they have an income from good seasons, so as to provide against bad ones. I have been supporting measures which have been successful and I certainly will give my wholehearted support to any future practical measures. I woulcl like to appeal to some of those people who have been directly concerned with the drought and who have been indulging in a little income fighting to knock it off and get on with the real business of fighting the drought.",93
227,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Dawson) [10.44]- I want to deal with the farce that took place here tonight regarding the swift movement through the Parliament of a large number of important Bills and on which practically no debate of substance took place. There were reasons for this which I shall The position will have to be looked at very closely so that it will not arise again. It is obvious that the Government Whip Whip panicked in bringing on some of these bills. I tbink that he was trying to do the best job that he could in the circumstances. Nevertheless there was no reason or justification for him to take the action he did the reasons I will outline. At 4.20 o'clock this afternoon the Goon vernment Whip contacted me and indicated that the business of the House was moving faster than he had anticipated. He to know whether I could help him out by resuming the debate on some of the Bills that were not listed on the blue paper. I it? said I would try to help him and asked him to tell me the Bills he wanted. He said: 'We would like to take the meat Bills listed on the notice paper as orders of the day supposed to do? Nos 13, 14, 15 and 16.' I replied that I would let him know if it were possible to do so. I came into the House then to resume the debate on the Northern Territory Supreme Court Bill. At 5.40 o'clock the Government Whip approached me again with respect to Bills that were not listed for today. We then had a discussion in the Labor Whips room. I told him that as the beef Bills were very important and as it had not been thought at any stage that they would be discussed today I did not think it was a fair thing to be asked at this short notice to take them. I said, however, that I would try to help him out. I said that I could take order of the day No. 12, which was the Quarantine Bill 1968. The Government Whip then said that I could not take the Quarantine Bill. This is the Bill listed on the notice paper above the livestock Bills. He said that I could not debate this Bill because it had been taken off the list and would not be debated until next session. It would not be debated tomorrow, or next week but would before the House for discussion next session. I then said: 'All right, I will take the Bill coming after the meat Bills'. This is order of the day No. 17, the Wine Grapes Charges Bill 1968. I suggested this Bill because it was fresh in our minds. I said that I. could take that Bill and he informed me that I could not do'so because it had also been taken off the list and would not appear until next session. So, another Bill would appear not tomorrow or next week outline. but during the next session. I then said that I would try to help the by taking the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill 1968. I thought we could line np some speakers such as the honourable members for Wilmot (Mr Duthie), Braddon  for was decided in the honourable member for Wilmot's room that this Bill would come at about 8.20 o'clock. It was also decided in rhat room that because we would take the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill wanted the meat Bills would not come on.",95
228,Mr ANTHONY,ADJOURNMENT,Wit b whom did you decide,95
229,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,Wit h the Government and Labor Whips. Is not that what one is,95
230,Dr JF CAIRNS,ADJOURNMENT,Would the honourable gentleman make his interjections more audible?,96
231,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"He is incapable of doing that. Between 7.50 and 7.55 p.m. we saw the Government Whip in the corridor who again confirmed that the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill would be coming on at approximately 8.20 o'clock. The Government Whip says that he informed me that the meat Bills would also come on, despite the fact that 2 hours previously said that they would not come on. If he said this I did not hear him. Certainly our own Whip knew nothing of it. When 1 got back from my room at 8.5 o'clock I found that the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill was finished. The next thing that happened that the four meat Bills were called on. had the farce of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull) getting up and, like a parrot, reading the Minister's second reading speech.",96
232,Mr HULME,ADJOURNMENT,That is not right.,96
233,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"You can have your say, too.",96
234,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Hon. W. J. Aston)Order! There are too many interjections coming from my right. Mr TurnbuU- I did not read it; I said I was quoting from it.,96
235,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order !,96
236,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"This is the truth, as I understand it. We had the farce tonight of very important Bills being rushed through despite undertakings given to us by the Government.",96
237,Mr HULME,ADJOURNMENT,Coul d the Labor Party get anyone to speak?,96
238,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The Postmaster General comes into the House only late at night, like an owl. That is all we see him.",96
239,Mr HULME,ADJOURNMENT,I happened to be in the House when you were not here at 5 minutes past S.,96
240,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! Far too many the Bills. interjections are coming from my right.,96
241,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"That is the basis of the complaint. I repeat that I believe the Government Whip is doing the best he can in the circumstances, but he panicked. Arrangements in the House were out of control and Bills were brought on without the Opposition being given any notice that they were being brought on. Certainly we should not have a repetition of this situation.",96
242,Mr FREETH,ADJOURNMENT,Forrest-Minister for Air) [10.52]- I am sorry that the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) feels so deeply disturbed about what after all is only the normal arrangement of the he business when the House is nearing the end of a session. It is well known that the blue paper that is issued each day is intended only as a guide and that the official Notice Paper is the white Notice Paper which is printed each day. It contains the complete was list of outstanding Government business. We The blue paper is a general guide showing the business that the Government hopes to get through during the course of each day. A note at the foot of the blue paper today reads: Other orders of the day may be taken as time permits. Clearly the House was on notice that the blue paper was not the only paper to be looked at for the business of the House.,96
243,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,We know all that.,96
244,Mr FREETH,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Dawson ventilated his grievances at some length. He freely invited us to take part in the little debate he has started and I suggest that he allow me to develop my theme in my own way. If we look at the white Notice Paper we see that the Bills that were debated have been before the House for some time. The earliest, the Processed Milk Products Bounty Bill, not was introduced on 22nd August.",96
245,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,What about the others?,96
246,Mr FREETH,ADJOURNMENT,"I am dealing with the of Bills that were debated tonight. There were a number of other Bills, the latest of which was introduced on 22nd October. No-one on the Opposition side can claim that he was caught by surprise as to the contents of the Bills or the Government's views on",96
247,Dr JF CAIRNS,ADJOURNMENT,Ye s we can.,96
248,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member for Yarra will cease interjecting.,96
249,Mr FREETH,ADJOURNMENT,"The plain truth of the matter is that when the bells ceased ringing at 8 o'clock tonight, the Opposition called a quorum. We have had some excellent cooperation from the Opposition, let it be acknowledged, but calling a quorum is not the kind of tactic that endears the Opposition to the Government.",97
250,Dr JF CAIRNS,ADJOURNMENT,Is that why you were,97
251,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order ! Despite my which warning, the honourable member for Yarra is still interjecting. I ask him to restrain himself.",97
252,Mr FREETH,ADJOURNMENT,"The Government then the went on with the Bills as it had determined to do. The honourable member for Dawson seems to think that he is the aggrieved, but other honourable members on the Opposition front bench were in the same situation. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) was not here for the resumption of the debate on a on which he had taken the adjournment. but The Leader of the Opposition (Mr the Whitlam) was not here for a Bill on which he had taken the adjournment. The honourmember able member for Dawson now complains about the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Bill and the Live-stock Slaughter Collection having been brought on. The honourable member, as we all know, sets great store on his own importance in this place, but expect the House to arrange the order of its business to suit one Opposition member is asking a little much of the Government, hard pressed as it is in the interests of honourable members to get through a pretty tight timetable before the House is due rise. The honourable member was in the House during the debate. He could have spoken at any time on Bills about which has known since 9th October, when they were introduced in the House. One imagines he would have had some material prepared. But he sat and sulked like a child, a performance that would not rate him very highly with anyone.",97
253,Mr BARNARD,ADJOURNMENT,"Bass) [10.55]-It obvious that the Minister for Air (Mr Freeth) knows nothing about the arrangethe ments that were made earlier tonight. He makes that point that the arrangement of the business is a matter for the Government, and he may be correct. The Opposition acknowledges that this is so. However, the Minister has been a member of the House long enough to realise that an arrangement is always made firstly between the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the House and secondly between the two Whips. It is unfortunate that the Minister for Immigration (Mr Snedden), who is the Leader of the House, is not here tonight. If he had been here I doubt very much whether the performance tonight, for the Government is responsible, would have happened. Indeed I believe it would not have happened. The Leader of the House and I have always worked very closely together and I think he would be first to concede this point. I believe it may be said, too, that the Government Whip and the Opposition Whip have always only person worked well together. The Minister for Air, knowing norhing about the circumstances, endeavoured tonight to refute what was said by the honourBill able member for Dawson (Dr Patterson), the blunt fact is that 1 was present when discussions took place. The discussions took place not only between the honourable for Dawson, the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie), who is the Opposition Whip, and the honourable memBill ber for Ballaarat (Mr Erwin), who is the Governmeni Whip, but I was also present. Certain arrangements were made. They to were not made to assist the Opposition. On the contrary, it was made perfectly clear that the Government wanted the House to sit tonight until at least 10.30 p.m. and all the Opposition conceded that this was a reasonable proposition. Because the business to on the Notice Paper had been completed earlier than anticipated by the Opposition and the Government, we made certain he arrangements with the Whip. What were these arrangements? They were substantially as the honourable member for Dawson has outlined them to the House. It was agreed that the Opposition should deal first with the Spirits Bill and when that was completed that the honourable is member for Dawson, who had no prior notice of this legislation, would deal with Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill. Since it was recognised that the debate on these two Bills would not occupy the House until 10.30 p.m., it was agreed that the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill would be brought on. Although the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) had no opportunity to prepare for a debate on the Bill and had not expected it to be brought on tonight, he agreed to deal with it if it was not brought on before 9.30 p.m. What happened? Although these arrangements had been made with the Whips, with me and with the honourable members who were to take part in the debates, as the honourable member for Dawson said earlier, the Government, having dealt with the Spirits Bill, moved on to the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill although the honourable member for Dawson was not present in the House. Surely the decent thing for the Government Whip to have done, knowing of the arrangements which were made earlier this evening, would have been to hold this Bill over temporarily so that arrangements could be made for the honourable member for Dawson to be present in the House and deal with it. What happened? The Government allowed the Bill to go through. The honourable member for Dawson was not here. There have been occasions when the Government Whip has co-operated with the Opposition Whip and myself to ensure that a speaker was available in the House when a Bill he was interested in was coming forward. As I said, that did not happen on this occasion and the Bill vvas dealt with before the honourable member for Dawson came into the chaniber. Despite the fact that there had been agreement between those concerned that Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill would not be brought on before 9.30 p.m., the Bill was brought on immediately the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill had been dealt with. The honourable member occasions. for Newcastle was not in the House at time. Surely the Government Whip could have had sufficient courtesy to honour earlier arrangements. He knows that an arrangement was made for the honourable member for Newcastle to deal with this Bill not earlier than 9 o'clock and preoperation ferably not before 9.30 p.m. The Governoccasions. ment Whip had the Bill introduced and it was dealt with at the second reading stage. The honourable member for Newcastle then spoke on it at the third reading stage. think the Government Whip will recallhe wili have an opportunity to refute I have to say on this matter if he wishes to-that we had a discussion in the Opposition Whip's room and it was decided to keep the House going until 9.30 p.m. The four Bills in relation to which the honourable member for Dawson objected earlier tonight were not to be brought on this evening. Those four Bills were the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Bill 1968, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Collection Bill 1968, the Meat Research Bill 1968 and the Meat Legislation Repeal Bill 1968. The Minister for Primary Industry may raise some objection to this arrangement, but that was the arrangement. The Government has dealt with three Bills which the Opposition had agreed to debate, and these were not on the blue business sheet.",97
254,Mr ANTHONY,ADJOURNMENT,They were on the white sheet-the notice paper.,98
255,Mr BARNARD,ADJOURNMENT,"They were on the white sheet, but they were not on the blue sheet. The Opposition agreed to co-operate wtih the Government in this respect and, as I said, part of the arrangement was that the four Bills to which 1 just referred would not be dealt with tonight. I repeat that if the Minister for Immigration, who is the Leader of the House, had been here tonight this unfortunate situation would not have arisen. I do not hold the Government Whip entirely responsible for this situation; I think that probably he does the best that he can. Since I have been accepting the an responsibility on behalf of the Opposition the to make arrangements to co-operate with the Government, the Minister for Immigration-if he were here tonight he would be the first to concede this-ha s had the complete co-operation of the Opposition on all I refer to a Bill which was passed that by this House only 2 days ago and in relation to which the Government urgently the needed the complete co-operation of the Opposition. I made arrangements with the Minister for Immigration for this Bill to be dealt with. He has had the complete coof the Opposition on all such Whenever I have given my word to the Minister as to what should be the proI gramme in the House, it has always been adhered to. It is clear that on this what occasion the Government Whip, and probably the Minister for Primary Industry, rejected the earlier arrangements agreed by the parties concerned.",98
256,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable try member's time has expired.,99
257,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"Mallee) [11.6]- I do not want to enter the argument about the Bills that have been passed tonight, but want to say one or two things about the remarks made by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson). When I spoke on the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Bill and the Meat Revenue Bill I said that I was wallow in it. quoting from the Minister's second reading speech. I did look at the speech to remind myself of the exact figures.",99
258,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order l The honourable member should not refer to a debate that occurred in the House earlier this evening. If he does so he will be out of order.,99
259,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"When the honourable member for Dawson came into the House just now he made a special feature of sulting me. I make it clear to the House if I read something I always say that I quoting. No-one in this House can say I read my speeches. The honourable memaffected ber for Dawson said: 'There was the honourable member for MaUee reading away like a parrot'. If that is not insulting I would like to know what is. I want the honourable member to understand that that sort of talk does not go over here, even with his own colleagues. I was not impressed when he spoke tonight. Everything which he said commenced with T. I think he must have some inflated idea of his powers. He was here when I was speaking, because he said that he saw me reading. Therefore he could have entered the deoutside bate. Why did he not enter the debate? All he had to say was: T thought this', T did this', T did that'. I am not one who talks September. in that kind of language; it is foreign to me. I thought when he said T he was referring to the Opposition. I have never approached or spoken to the honourable member Dawson in other than a courteous way. think that applies to my aproach to members in this House. The honourable member for Dawson is a relatively new member in this House, and it is remarkable how much of his speeches he reads. If he did not read his speeches he could not make one at all. He reads speeches all the time. It is not in the best to interests to come along here and try to insult a member who has been here for a long time. The best thing he can do is to to put things on a better basis, or goodness knows how he will get on. I do not insult people. I am here to protect myself against this sort of attack. I believe I have I a right to rise and speak in my defence. I am not a speech reader and I resent that accusation more than anything else, l f the honourable member for Dawson gels any satisfaction from insulting me, then he can",99
260,Mr JEFF BATE,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) [11.10]The Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee is not officially affiliated with any political party, but I believe that it has been used in a political sense by the Australian Labor Party. We are aware of the way in which this Committee has been used in a manner detrimental to the interests of the Bega Valley farmers. How has this happened? inThe New South Wales Governmeni formed that a drought sub-committee of Cabinet which am has been working since February of this that year on providing assistance for those by the drought on the south coast of New South Wales. A very severe drought was followed by a very severe winter. The New South Wales Government has been providing extremely generous subsidies on rail freight at the rate of 75%, which compares with the 50% that was paid by a previous government of which Mr Hills was a member. Farmers in the Bega Valley have been paying only half of the road freight and have been able to obtain unlimited funds at 3% interest. All the cooperatives have been making sure that fodder was flowing into the area quite freely. This was the situation through March, April. May, June, July, August and Then, when it was thought that there might be. a Federal general election this for year the Bega Valley Drought Relief I Committee suddenly appeared. The man all who chaired the meeting at which the Committee was formed was heard over the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio station 2BA in Bega exhorting farmers to attend the meeting at the hotel. Mr Hills, the Leader of the Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament, the Labor candihis date for the Federal seat of Eden-Monaro and the former President of the Federal and New South Wales organisations of the Australian Labor Party were present. This Committee is supposed to be non-political. The chairman of the meeting which formed the Committee exhorted the people over the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio programme to attend the meeting. Of course, the ABC is one of the Labor Party organs in this country. Some of the farmers attended the meeting. The person who moved the resolution on the basis of which the Committee was formed is a strong supporter of the ALP in Bega. A few days later he was seen talking not to members of the Government Parties but to Labor members of the New South Wales Legislative Council at Parliament House in Macquarie Street, Sydney. We all know what has happened in the Legislative Council recently. The man who made the most noise at the meeting in Bega is a strong Labor supporater. When I was game enough to outline the Government's proposals he said: 'The same old stuff. We want free grants, not loans.' I said very timidly, as is my habit, as honourable members know: 'The Bega farmers are very relucant to borrowWhen I was here in 1952 after the big fire, I offered them £500 each free, provided they borrowed £500 from the Rural Bank at 3% interest. They said: ""No. Our fathers borrowed from the banks at 12%. We will never borrow again."" That shows the reluctance of the Bega farmers to borrow.' What happened? This Labor supporter, this Socialist who believed the Government should do everything, said: 'No. We do not want loans; we want free grants.' The cows were not fed because the farmers were waiting for the free grants. Because of the publicity about the drought, plenty of fodder is going into the Bega Valley area, and the State Government is paying for this fodder under arrangements made by the Cabinet sub-committee. Members of the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee say that it is not political. They forget that at every opportunity they attack the Liberal-Australian Country Party coalition in the Federal and State spheres. When the Dungog and Gloucester areas were affected by a most terrifying drought, the co-operatives arranged for fodder to be taken into those areas. No drought relief committee was formed, because no Federal election was pending. The co-operatives handled the situation with great skill, because they knew how to buy fodder and get the best quality, and how to handle transport. They knew that the railways could not carry the fodder at that stage, and they even got the State Government to pay for the transport of Victorian fodder to Dungog and Gloucester. My friend the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) and the member for Gloucester in the State Parliament will recall this because they were with me for some of the time. The honourable member for Lyne, one of the most esteemed members of this House, is nodding his head because this is accurate. In other words, for 4 years we have been administering relief from these terrible droughts with some success because we have pulled these farmers through. No-one would believe that the once great Australian Labor Party would stoop to this miserable business of trying to use the anguish, the bitterness and the agony of the farmers of this district for political advantage. Mr Speaker, would you believe that people could do this? I do not believe it. I think it was probably only a coincidence that the Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro happened along at this moment, that Mr Hills came along at this moment and that the ex-Federal and State President of the Australian Labor Party also happened to be there with these noisy men. Oh, this was not political at all, it was just a coincidence that they became disgusted with what was happening and decided that not enough fodder was flowing. What did the co-operatives think about this? Does anyone think that the Nowra Cooperative Dairy Company with $240,000 bothered about who was the candidate for Eden-Monaro? Does anyone think that Horlicks with S 100,000 bothered, or the Moruya co-operative with its money, or the Central Tilba, Tilba Tilba, Cobargo or Pambula organisations? AH of these were supplying farmers with good quality fodder. They were not worried about the fact that there was a federal election coming up. But at Bega were these characters, including the one who chaired the meeting. I am afraid I was invited by some innocent farmers t< come along and I think I rather spoilt the show because they moved a vote of thanks and said that I had the courage to go. I said: 'Courage? Who do you think 1 would be frightened of around this place? They then went ahead with the meeting and formed the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee and from that moment they began attacking Liberal-Country Party coalitions in the federal and State arenas. By so doing they eroded the willingness, the resolution and the determination of farmers to go on with the ordinary methods which had been provided with the utmost generosity. The money was there. Mr Hills went down. He was the Minister in the Renshaw Government who refused the 75% rail subsidy. It was only 50% under Labor but it was 75% under this Government, with payment for all of the transport of the gift fodder. Once again 1 woulcl hope that it was merely a coincidence that this galaxy of Labor talent appeared just as the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee was formed and that these well meaning and patriotic district residents were sucked into this Committee by this kind of plot. Really, it is so barefaced. But these chaps feel hurt to be lined up with these characters who appeared just before a Federal election. An election was on. There was a frantic run for the Labor preselection. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Cope) was very interested. He was naturally in on what was happening and so we had this terrific rush for the selection by the Labor interests in Eden Monaro.",99
261,Mr DUTHIE,ADJOURNMENT,"Wilmot) [11.19]- I only wish to take a few minutes because the matter that was raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Barnard) and the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) has been covered, not in complete fullness but very widely, and I would just like to fill in a few of the parts that have been omitted. As a result of an excellent afternoon's work we got through nine Bills and the House ran out of business at 5.45 p.m. It was then that the Government came to us for help. It could not call other Bills on for debate without being completely ruthless and breaking all the rules of parliamentary conduct. The Government could not debate a further seven or eight Bills without first consulting the Opposition. The consultation took place in my office. Present were the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Government Whip (Mr Erwin). At one stage the honourable member for Dawson was present and at another the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor). Later another very important person was present-the Parliamentary Liaison Oflicer, Mr Ian Grigg. We worked out a programme for the night. I want it to be understood that at that stage the House had run out of the business which it expected to deal with today. A Bill involving substantia] discussion could not have been debated after 8 o'clock without causing a good deal of inconvenience. So the Opposition said that it would agree to debate the Spirits Bill and the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill, which we had not expected to debate today. Then out of the blue the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill was called on. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) and the honourable member for Dawson were prepared to debate these Bills and we thought that the debates would ensue for the remainder of the night. I was prepared to speak for about 20 minutes on the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) was prepared to speak on the Bill for 10 or 15 minutes. The honourable  be asked to speak on the Bill because his preelectorate is probably one of the biggest apple growing areas in Australia. I have before me the list of speakers which was prepared in my office. It is not in my writing but in the writing of Mr Ian Grigg. The names are Patterson, Pearsall, Duthie, Pettitt. Davies. We thought that the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill would be disposed of by 9.30 or 9.45 and that wa would spend the remainder of the night debating the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill. That would have been the day's work. But things went haywire at 8 o'clock. The honourable member for Franklin rose to speak when the Spirits Bill was called on. Somebody pointed out that he was speaking on the wrong Bill, so he sat down. The Government seized the opportunity to put the Bill through the House quickly before the honourable member for Yarra (Dr JF CAIRNS) could get into the chamber to speak. He arrived in the chamber seconds after the Bill had been passed. The next Bill was called on. At that time. I was in my office speaking on the telephone to somebody in Launceston. 1 was getting information for my speech on the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill. I had not had any dinner. I have not had anything to eat today since 1 o'clock. I spent 2 solid hours preparing my speech in order to help out the Government. Please understand that: T had not intended to speak on the Bill. I spent 2 hours making telephone calls to Hobart and Launceston seeking information for my speech. 1 was on the telephone when the Government Whip passed through my office into the corridor outside. Tn the corridor he saw the honourable member for Dawson and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). He did not bother to interrupt my telephone conversation, as so often happens, to tell me that the Bills would be called on earlier than had been arranged. I did not know that the honourable member for Dawson was not in the House when the legislation was called on. The arrangement was that the honourable member for Dawson sbould speak at about 8.15. Mr Erwin-What about the honourable member for Yarra? He was supposed to speak on the Spirits Bill.",101
262,Mr DUTHIE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am crooked on the whole business and I want an explanation. When the honourable member for Dawson was not present to resume the debate on the Apple and Pear Export Charges Bill, there was nothing in the world to stop a member of the Government parties resuming the debate and speaking on the Bill. The honourable member for Franklin rose to do so, but was waved down and sat down. That was why that debate collapsed. He told us afterwards that that was what happened - that he was waved down. He could have saved the whole situation and given me time to get back into the chamber. I arrived back in the chamber just as the motion for the third reading of the Bill was being passed. I would have debated the Bill had I arrived back in the chamber a few seconds earlier or had the honourable member for Franklin spoken even for only 5 minutes. The honourable member for Dawson arrived back in the chamber just before 10 minutes past 8. That is the unfortunate story of what happened tonight. I do not know whether it was the deliberate intention of the Government to try to take us unawares and to rush all these Bills through without any speeches at all being made on them. I hope it was not. The upshot of it all is that we finished seventeen Bills today. Mr Erwin-We finished nineteen.",102
263,Mr DUTITJE,ADJOURNMENT,That means that two Bills were passed without my knowing about them. T thought that an explanation was necessary to clear the air from our point of view. Motion (by Mr Fairbairn) agreed to. That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.27 p.m. The following answers to questions Helicopters: Antarctica: Trans-Australia (Question No. 594!),102

Did the Company obtain a contract to provide helicopters and crews for the use of tlte Department of External Affairs upon an Antarctic expedition in Becember 1961, after seeking an injunction to restrain Trans-Australia Airlines from providing the helicopters and crews? 3. Has the Company obtained further contracts from the Commonwealth since that lime, if so what are the details of those contracts? 4. Has he given further consideration to securing statutory authority for TAA to operate helicopter services to ofi shore oil rigs and in Antarctica following the comments in Annual Repons of the Australian National Airlines Commission and the questions to him by the honourable member for Stirling and me on 22nd September 1967? 5. When did he or his Department undertake the review of airline policy which he mentioned in his answer to me and when does he expect to complete it?",103
265,Mr SWARTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: 1. After the accident the Certificate of Approval granted to Helicopter Utilities Pty Ltd to maintain aircraft, overhaul aircraft components and distribute aircraft goods was suspended pending investigation under Air Navigation Regulation 257. The possible suspension of the Certificate was, at the time of the accident, being investigated as a result of other indications of deficiencies in the company's airworthiness control system so that the suspension was by no means wholly due to inadequate maintenance procedures revealed by the accident. The accident merely provided the further evidence needed to impose the suspension. The investigation following the suspension revealed that the overhaul and distribution activities were satisfactory and the relative approvals were reinstated. Requirements necessary to be met for the Company to have its aircraft maintenance approval reinstated were specified by the Department and have been now met by the Company. I should mention that the accident report makes it clear that the accident did not arise from activities performed under the aircraft maintenance approval. 2. In 1961 tenders were invited for the hire of two helicopters and crews to accompany the Antarctic voyages in 1961-62. TAA and Helicopter Utilities Pty Ltd. submitted tenders and a contract was arranged with TAA. Subsequently, Helicopter Utilities Pty Ltd took action in the Supreme Court NA upon notice were circulated: of New South Wales to restrain the Australian National Airlines Commission from carrying out Airlines the contract on the grounds that the Commission had no power to make such a contract. The Company's submissions were upheld by the Court and an injunction was granted by Mr Justice Taylor. At the request of the Australian Nalional Airlines CerCommission, TAA was released from the contract and a new contract was arranged with Helicopter Utilities Pty Ltd. 3. Helicopter Utilities Pty Lid has been awarded the contract for the supply of helicopter services to Antarctic expeditions every year since 1961 and has been awarded a number of other Government contracts. The details are as follows: Date Department January-June 1962 . . Department of the Army Department of National Development 1962-63 .. ..

Yes. This is one of those matters that is kept under continuous notice. 5. I announced on 8th August 1966. that a review of the two airline policy was being undertaken. This review is proceeding. Parts of it have been completed and implemented such as financing arrangements for the domestic airlines to each acquire a fifth Boeing aircraft, also duty exemption for jet aircraft. The review covers a wide range of individual and also interlocking subjects. It is not possible to give precision to when any outstanding part of the whole may be completed. Housing Agreement: Civic Costs (Question No. 755)",103
266,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TOQUESTIO NS UPONNOTIC E,"the Minister representing the Minister for Housing, upon notice: 1. In what circiinnlances and to what extent do housing authorities and building societies which receive grants under the Housing Agreement meet or share the capital cost of (a) roads, (b) water, (c) sewerage, (d) drainage, (e) community centres, (f) youth clubs, (g) children's playgrounds, (h) sportsgrounds and (i) pre-school centres? 2. In what circumstances and to what extent do the authorities and societies pay local government and semi-government rates and charges? Mr Bury-The Minister for Housing has supplied the following answers to the honourable member's questions: I. Perhaps I should first explain that grants, as such, are not made under the 1956-1966 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. All moneys made available to the Slates are in the nature of advances repayable with interest over a period of 53 years. Insofar as the question relates to State housing authorities, the answer can be presented most conveniently under the following headings: (a) Roads and (d) Drainage-In accordance with clause 11 (3) (b) of the Housing Agreement, State housing authorities use advances received under the Agreement to meet the costs of providing roads and drainage within new subdivisions they have created. Where land for building projects is acquired within existing subdivisions the purchase price paid with Housing Agreement advances has regard to the existence of roads and such services as are available. The creation of new subdivisions is the more common practice among the Slate housmg authorities. (W Water and (c) Sewerage-Clause 12 of the Housing Agreement provides that, except as otherwise agreed between the Commonwealth Minisler for Housing and the appropriate State Minisler, advances may not be used for works, including water and sewerage mains, which are normally the financial responsibility of Local Government or public utility authorities. There have been very few instances over the years where State housing authorities have sought and obtained the agreement of the Minister to use advances under the Housing Agreement for such works. In each case, special circumstances warranted the exception being made. (g) Children's Playgrounds and (h) Sportsgrounds-Housin g authorities recognise the need for land lo be set aside for these facilities within subdivisions that they create. In some States, local government or planning legislation requires that a certain minimum percentage of land be set aside within subdivisions for reserves or public space. In most States, land is dedicated free of cost to the Local Government authority concerned, sometimes after minor grading of the areas has been carried out to place them in reasonably usable condition before dedication. While the cost of the laud is met from Housing Agreement advances, the improvement, planting, and provision of equipment in these areas is the responsibility of Local Government, and the housing authority incurs no expense in this regard. (e) Community Centres, (f) Youth Clubs, (i) Pre-school Centres-In some States, housing authorities make grants of land to Local Government authorities or sell land to various community and welfare organisations undertaking the provision of these facilities. In regard to building and housing societies, Housing Agreement advances channelled through the Home Builders' Account are made available only for the purposes stipulated in the Housing Agreement, that is, for loans to persons who require finance for the erection or purchase of their own honies. Once the borrower assumes ownership of the land he is in the same' position aS all other private landowners in respect of liability for meeting or sharing the cost of municipal and community facilities. In ordinary circumstances, a society would not obtain title to a dwelling in respect of which it has made a loan and therefore would have no liability to contribute to these costs. 2. State housing authorities pay normal rates and taxes on the properties they own, and recover the amounts paid as a component of the economic rentals charged to tenants. In some States, rates are not payable by the housing authorities on vacant land or vacant dwellings. Building and housing societies are not ordinarily the owners of properties in respect of which they have made loans to members, and consequently have no responsibility to pay rates and similar charges. Cost of Radio and Television Dr Everingham asked the Postmaster General, upon notice: 1. What are the estimated costs of (a) existing and (b) projected telephone, radio and television connections by (i) satellite and (ii) landline and ground station relays (A) within his Department and (B) for private broadcasters? 2. Can he say what percentage of this cost Australia would bear if the launching of a satellite were a joint project with New Zealand, Indonesia, Polynesia, Taiwan, Japan, Soulh Korea and Southern Asia, excluding Vietnam, assuming each contributed to the cost in proportion to gross national product per head of population? 3. Is he able lo say whether the Soviet Union recently reported a decision to provide all of its territory with satellite-relayed television; if so, he investigate the possibility of an exchange of television and radio lime by satellite between Communist and non-Communist countries as a means of diminishing international political censorship and misunderstanding which lead to tlic human and economic wastage of cold and hot wars? Mr Htiime-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: 1. (A) (i) (a) The Depanment commenced installing broadband bearer systems during 1958 and today some 8,000 roule miles of broadband systems are in service. The network provides large blocks of trunk telephone and telegraph circuits lo more than eighty important centres and also provides a large number of television relay facilities. The cost of providing this network by satellite cannot be estimated because it would not have been technically feasible to provide sill of these facilities by the use of communication satellite systems. (b) The cost of television relay facilities provided by private broadcasters cannot be accurately estimated but it would be insignificant compared wilh the departmental investment in such facilities. (ii) (a) The total cost to June 1968 of the Department's network of broadband bearers, which comprise coaxial cable and microwave relay systems, has been approximately $70m. (b) See 1. (A) (i) (to) above. I . (B) (i) (a) The Department plans to extend its broadband bearer network considerably over the next 5 years. As might be expected, the Department bas investigated the technical and economic feasibility of providing some of these future facilities by a satellite communications system rather than by extension of the terrestrial broadband network. Based on the unit costs which ate current for international satellite systems, a domestic satellite communications system providing television relays and telephone trunk circuits to a limited number of centres would involve annual cosls several times greater than those which would arise from comparable land based systems. An Communications important factor is the life of a commercial telecommunications satellite which is now estimated (Question fV«. 878) at about 5 years, and costs must therefore be written off over a comparatively brief period. In addition, the failure of a launching, the probability of which is currently estimated at 15%. can add significantly to the cost, l f favourable assumptions are made concerning future unit costs for a domestic satellite system, and the number of earth stations connected to such a system were severely limited, it is estimated that the total capital cost of such a sysem would lie in the range from 530m to S70m. Such a system would not serve all of the centre-, which the extension of the land based broadband network will serve and, furthermore, the fact that much of the cost must be written off over a short period would bc a financial limitation. For example, our studies, which are confirmed by similar studies carried out by other countries, show that it is unlikely that satellite techniques wiil prove economically competitive with land based circuits for distances of less than about 1,000 miles for some years to come. Satellites also have techwill nical limitations when used for telephony which are not possessed by the land based broadband bearer network. The situation is being closely studied within the Department because of the possibility that a domestic satellite communication system could, in lime, provide some facilities which arc not practicable to provide by land based systems. It should be added, however, that the transmission of television programmes from satellites direct into individual homes is not. yet technically practicable and the immediate proposals which have been studied involve only the relaying of television programmes between satellite earth stations for retransmission by regional television transmitters. (b) See 1. (A) (i) (b) above. (ii) (a) The Departmental investment in the broadband bearer network will at least double over ihe next 5 years. As indicated in the earlier pail of the reply, it would not be economically or technically feasible to provide by satellite all of the facilities which the extension of the broadband network will provide. (b) Sec 1. (A) (i) (b) above. 2. Although, in certain circumstances, there may be economics from joint use, lite capacities needed for the domestic requirements of the countries listed by the honourable member would call for considerably greater investment than for Australia's requirements alone and would probably require a number of satellites. It is not possible to estimate the total cost of a satellite communications system serving all these countries. Furthermore, a regional grouping of such a nature to provide international circuits between the countries suggested would be a direct competitor for traffic to the Pacific Intelsat satellite system which is being established by the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, of which Australia and some of the other countries mentioned are members. The attitude of the Consortium under the international agreement, which is to be re-negotititcd in 1969, towards regional satellite projects has slill to be established. Nevertheless, the Australian Post Office has made some approaches to other countries in the region with a view to studying joint action. 3. The Soviet Uinon has in operation a satellite syslem known as Molnya. This consists of some six satellites which are used for relaying domestic television programmes to special earth stations for retransmission by regional transmitters. The Soviet has commenced the construction of twenty-four earlh stations for this purpose. These satellites follow an orbit designed to suit the northern hemisphere, and are in view of Australia for only a very short period, traversing the southern sky at very high speed. Earth stations receiving from these satellites would require extremely expensive tracking equipment and, in addition, would be in sight of the satellites for very short limes. Reception in Australia from the Soviet Union's Molnya system is considered to be impracticable. Workers' Compensation Legislation",104
