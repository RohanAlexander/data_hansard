Firstly, on the question of speech, I was intrigued to note that he did headed for Tasmania as part of the Telstra June. I would have thought that that might thought was a very important thing. They talk $25 million for the Darwin-Alice Springs railway not drawn attention to. I wonder why that is, is, Mr Deputy Speaker, as we know and particularly on the other side of the chamber, who is the 14543 confidence in getting an ambulance when they sent to locations in other states?

Even Telstra still remains a significant employer in centres in Tasmania is very serious. Last week CEO of Telstra, I was very concerned when he Lights Fault Centre, which is based in service consultants and technicians, as I visit. The role of this fault centre is to a problem with their service and is predomiand Tasmania. That these jobs are at risk is a Telstra, a privatisation which has already plans for regional Australia: sell off the asset its shoulders as if to say, ‘Well, what can we policies through a regional impact filter to enare not unfairly and unreasonably disadvanare seeking is investment in people to ensure capitals are available in Tasmania, jobs without meet the community's needs and government Australia.

The fact as the National Party deputy whip sitting chairman of the government's communications NA 14544 committee, knows, the reason the government cause they had shirked what they promised. money that the government promised Tasmania deed, I think I saw the honourable member opposite the government had shirked the amount of money and it ought to be more. The government is keen to mention Telstra the full privatisation of Telstra and, indeed, again spoke about how the government wanted interested in seeing Telstra improve its standards. the record recently as saying he would like to their customers better, particularly those customers room for improvement and no excuse for the sacking of 16,000 employees over the next force-shows just how little Telstra thinks logic to think, as the minister for communications these jobs are only going to be in the cities. We have now got the government in the saying that Telstra should be privatised and-as time-that the government had to keep up Telstra's wink, nudge-nudge directions that staff cuts one who has any sense at all knows that that cant cuts and they will make them in the bush. said that the red light would be flashing in reduced from now on.

Just berelease from the Commonwealth Bank announcing a who wanted unsecured finance to purchase offered a similar deal when Telstra was first they would be able to do it again. I thought because a lot of people who were buying Telstra on the basis that they thought the government ownership in the company.

More importantly, the people trust the trust them as much as they used to, but they of ordinary people are vulnerable to what appears concerns me is that the sort of people who get least able to afford to take advantage of the bank's cheap money.
