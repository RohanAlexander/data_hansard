1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. NA Second Sydney Airport",13
2,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Yesterday, the minister told the House that neither he nor any of his front-bench colleagues gave any undertakings or made any secret deals with developers wanting to construct a second Sydney airport at Holsworthy. Has the minister seen reports in the Daily Telegraph of 24 May 1996 which read: Senior coalition MPs held confidential negotiations with a consortium last year and agreed not to make the details public until after the election. And also: A spokesman for transport minister John Sharp confirmed a plan was being investigated and that it had appeared last June but had not been revealed to voters in the March 2 election. Will you now admit, which you failed to do yesterday, or concede that some or all of your colleagues indicated to the developers before the election a preparedness to consider Holsworthy after the election?",13
3,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We received a number of representations and submissions from people in regard to airport proposals in the years that we were in opposition-airport proposals designed to solve the problem of developing a second airport for Sydney. We received a proposal from the gentleman that the opposition leader's question is directed at, the Lawrence Hargrave project. That gentleman asked those people who were presented with that submission to keep the detail of his submission and treat it as intellectual property, which is exactly the arrangement that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and indeed other members of the Labor Party also complied with. We received a number of submissions from other people in relation to other airport proposals, including Holsworthy. The House would be interested to know that we received a submission from Mr Rupert Pickrell, advocating the construction of an airport at Holsworthy. We also received a submission from the Australian International Pilots Association, who preferred a site at Holsworthy . We did not make those publicly known because there was no need to-for the same reasons that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith did not feel it was necessary to reveal that he had had discussions in regard to people like this whilst he was the minister for transport. We also received submissions from a number of people in relation to airport proposals in Goulburn, Williamtown, Richmond and Wilton, and indeed we even received a proposal called the Sydney Seadrome for a floating airport off Botany Bay. If all of those proposals that we received from those people-and gave consideration to-whether it be the Australian International Pilots Association, Mr Rupert Pickrell, the Sydney Seadrome, Goulburn, Wilton, Richmond or Williamtown, were to be described as secret deals, then they are secret deals. If that is the standard you impose on yourselves in opposition, I will look forward to you revealing all your negotiations with every single person you talk tofor the public's benefit.",13
4,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question understanding order 151: Questions may be asked without notice. At the discretion of the Speaker supplementary questions may be asked to elucidate an answer.",13
5,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Proceed. Mr Reith-Point of order, Mr Speaker!",13
6,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question is in order and I will accept it. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, my point of order is that that standing order has been there for a long time, but the convention in the House has not been to accept supplementary questions, and therefore it should not be accepted.",13
7,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have already ruled in terms of the supplementary question and I call the Leader of the Opposition.,13
8,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I return to the precise terms of my question and the part that the minister did not answer. I asked you: did you indicate to those developers, or any of the others that you chose to reveal, that you were prepared to consider Holsworthy after the election? Did you say that to any of them?",13
9,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We said-as we said to all of those people who put proposals to us, whether it was in regard to Goulbum, Wilton, Richmond, Holsworthy, Williamtown, the Sydney Seadrome or the people who put proposals to us in regard to Holsworthy-we would consider their proposals. That is what we said to them and, indeed, that is what we have done. That is exactly what you would be expected to do in opposition, as indeed did we. Sale of Telstra",14
10,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What are the public benefits in selling one-third of Telstra? Is the government determined to press ahead with its plans to provide a cheaper and more efficient phone system for all Australians as well as lasting environmental benefits for future generations?,14
11,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are a large number of public benefits in a sale of one-third of TelstraOpposition member interjecting,14
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the Labor members interjected, 'What about rural people?' Let me say two things about rural people and Telstra. The first thing I say is that the National Farmers Federation has given unequivocal support to the government's policy on a sale of one-third of Telstra. The second point I make is that all of the community service obligations are completely guaranteed. In other words, under our policy, the crosssubsidies for the bush in Australia will be kept lOOper cent. The question of public benefit is fundamental to the sale of one-third of Telstra, and particularly fundamental in the ongoing debate on this issue between the House of Representatives and the Senate. I will tell the House what the Leader of the Australian Democrats had to say on 31 January, the day that I announced the then Opposition's policy on selling one-third of Telstra. It is very important that her words are recalled in the context of the stance now being taken by the opposition parties in the Senate. She had this to say: 'The Democrats have said they won't support it' - that is, the sale of one-third of Telstra-'unless there's a public benefit demonstrated.' That is probably not a bad stance to take. Demanding that there be a public benefit in a privatisation has been a principle I have enunciated, and it was also a principle enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Finance. There are many public benefits, one of which is that you will give a better deal to consumers-that is not a bad public benefitvia lower prices. Another public benefit is that you will have greater competition. And so it goes on. It is very interesting that, since the election, the Leader of the Democrats has sought to condemn, by reference to British Telecom, the effect of privatisation on customers and on telephone prices. In that context I have had provided to me a copy of a letter written to Senator Kernot by the Managing Director in Australia of British Telecom, Mr Steve Burden. Referring to an article written in the Australian on 22 May by Senator Kernot, he said: It would have been preferable if you had taken the opportunity to check the facts with British Telecom before making some incorrect and misleading statements. I think this will be instructive to all members of the House, and it goes very directly to the question of public benefit. This is what he had to say about British Telecom: Since privatisation in November 1995, the price of inland calls in the United Kingdom has been reduced by 53 per cent in real terms and 46 per cent for international calls.",14
13,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It was competition.,14
14,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member opposite pipes up about competition. I will come to it is competition in a moment, mate. Mr Burden then goes on to say: These reductions have resulted in business calls in the United Kingdom being 34 per cent cheaper and residential calls 33 per cent cheaper than in Australia in 1995. So there is ample evidence, on the precedent of British Telecom-which Senator Kernot herself sought to invoke in order to condemn the government's proposal-to demonstrate that the consumer is better off, there is more competition, and there is a national benefit in privatisation. The very thing that she said before the election-remember, she leads the party that wants to keep all of us here honest-was, 'If you can prove to me there's a public benefit, I'll support it.' I have demonstrated on the precedent of British Telecom, which she sought to rely on, that there is a public benefit. There is a very strong case. The Leader of the Opposition earlier interjected, 'What about competition?' It is appropriate that he asked that, because it is a day that there appears in the press the report of the Institute of Management Development issued annually out of Lausanne in Switzerland that lists the competitiveness of nations. Unfortunately, over the last five years, out of a table of 25 countries, in relation tiveness Australia has gone from a position of 16th down to 21 st. It gets even worse when you start to analyse the different components that make up this aggregate competitiveness measure. There are 46 countries in the table. We are 44th on current account balance. We are 43rd on the current account as a proportion of GDP. We are 42nd on hiring and firing practices-that's not bad, is it? I thought we had a world-class system! But this is the piece de resistance: we are 46th out of 46 on international telephone charges.",14
15,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Wrong.,15
16,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are wrong?,15
17,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,15
18,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is too much noise in the chamber.,15
19,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to a public benefit, there is undoubtedly an overwhelming case in favour of the privatisation of one-third of Telstra. If the Australian Democrats were keeping themselves honest, as well as keeping other people honest, they would give force to their rhetoric before the election and they would let the legislation go through the Senate. Sale of Telstra Mr GARETH EV ANS-My question is addressed to the Prime Minister, and it follows the answer he has just given. Is it not the case that the report to which you were referring is marked by conspicuously sloppy research-not least in saying that we do have the highest international telephone charges in the world, where the truth of the matter is that we have some of the lowest, as you well know? Is it not the case that some of the measures of competitiveness in that reportMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. We thank the honourable member for his entertainment, but I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that he is out of order. The fact is that his question, as it so often does, contains argument, and that is beyond the standing orders.",15
20,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but be very careful in the wording of your question. I would like to see to competiyou get to the question.",15
21,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Is it not the case, I repeat, that whereas this particular report says that the cost of a three-minute telephone call to the United States is $12.01 the truth of the matter is that the cost of such a call is $3.17? Is it not the case also that this particular report regards terms of trade as a measure of competitiveness, when it is manifestly nothing of the kind? Is it not the case that it regards the current account deficit as a matter of competitiveness, when it is manifestly nothing of the kind? Mr Reith-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I want to repeat the point of order. This is yet another example of the deputy leader advancing an argument under the guise of a question. He is clearly out of order and he should be required to put a question succinctly.",15
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am warning the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that he is straying very far from the intent of question time. Address the question or resume your seat.,15
23,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asking the Prime Minister why he chooses to rely upon a report which has manifestly soppy research, sloppy research",15
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ha, hal",15
25,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-And soppy too! The report has manifestly sloppy research and lousy methodology and he is using it in order to make a squalid partisan political point. Why is the Prime Minister talking down Australia?,15
26,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wish to make one thing very clear at the beginning of my answer. It is not Australia. I am talking down; it is your failure in government that I am talking down. I will go on in the national interest talking down your failure in government. Whenever you throw up a full toss on the leg stump, like the question you have just asked, I will do it with some gusto. There were a few comparisons that I left out in my earlier answer. I said that, according to this survey, we were 44th on the current account balance, 43rd on the current account as a proportion of GDP and 36th on gross domestic savings. You talk about this being sloppy. Do you seriously deny that under your government in 13 years there was an absolutely catastrophic decline in the level of household savings? Are you denying that under your government our overseas debt went from $21 billion to $180 billion? Are you denying that under your government in 1995 we had the worse current account in the Western world? Are you denying that one of the worse legacies you left us was the need to do something about our chronic level of national savings? The truth is that you do not like the truth when it is brought out. It stings and it hurts. Your confected indignation showed it all, Gareth.",16
27,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,16
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! the cross-table confection is not appreciated. I am trying to get on with question time. Second Sydney Airport,16
29,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Has the government made any decision to proceed with building an airport at Holsworthy or is its preferred option still Badgerys Creek? Can the government guarantee the people of Hughes that the environmental impact assessment conducted into the Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy sites will be fully comprehensive on both sites? Will there be a full evaluation of the noise impact on the residential suburbs of Wattle Grove, Holsworthy, Moorebank, Hammondville and Chipping Norton?",16
30,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. The honourable member for Hughes has asked whether the concerns of the people that she very ably represents in this House will be considered. As honourable members on our side of the House will know, the answer to that question is that the honourable member for Hughes will represent her constituents very effectively indeed, as she has already done so. The government's preferred site for a second airport for Sydney is Badgerys Creek. That should never be lost in all of this. The other thing that needs to be restated, and is part of the question put by the honourable member for Hughes, is that there will be a full environmental impact study on both Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy. The study will follow the guidelines established by the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, which involves full public consultation, full industry consultation and its being a transparent process. The honourable member for Hughes is concerned to ensure that residents of her electorate will have their views considered in this process. I assure the honourable member for Hughes that that will be the case: their views will be considered and given great weight in the process of determining the environmental impact study. I also make it quite clear that all of those views of people in that area who will be affected, not only at Holsworthy but also at Badgerys Creek, will be considered because this government is not going to engage in a process that the previous Labor government engaged in when they did an environmental impact study for the third runway for Sydney's Mascot airport. That environmental impact study did not follow guidelines such as those put forward by the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. It was not a transparent process. As a consequence of that, the people of north Sydney and the people of Sydney in general felt that the previous Labor government cheated and deceived them over the way the third runway was developed. I can assure the honourable member for Hughes and her constituents that, firstly, Badgerys Creek is our preferred site and, secondly, the EIS process that will be undertaken will take full account of the concerns of her constituents and other constituents of members throughout the Sydney region. We are determined to make this a public, transparent process, unlike the way you did it when you were in government and you hid the truth from the people of Sydney. Second Sydney Airport",16
31,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. In answer to my question of 22 May, you stated that, apart from the problems of unexploded bombs, there are a number of reservations which Defence has to Holsworthy being selected as Sydney's second airport site. Do those reservations include the potential demolition of some $150 million worth of new defence facilities? Will you now table the advice which you received from Defence about those additional reserReid. vations?",17
32,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the were honourable member's question, I repeat what I said several days agoMr Crean-You had a number of reservasition tions.",17
33,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, there are some where reservations in the Department of Defence. You would expect that to be so. The honourwhere able member knows it would be so. As I said the other day, the Department of Defence been there for a very long time and has been using it for",17
34,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Since the Rum Corps.,17
35,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"it has been using it since about then. It has some unexploded Europe, ordnance, which I will come to in a second, and other problems. In regard to the EIS and the feasibility study, it depends on the results of the Badgunder erys Creek and Holsworthy EIS and feasibility study. studies as to what view the government finally takes. From my point of view, I make no prejudgment. Unlike you, I have not prenot judged the issue. You have prejudged a lot issues of recent times. That is why there are 49 of you sitting on that side and 94 of us sitting on this side. Let me just say that, even if the EIS came out in Holsworthy's favour, it is not certain that those buildings would go. They may well be included in a new airport site. They may well be included in a new airport site; they may not be included in a new airport site. I tum to this business of bombs, because you keep raising the issue of bombs and unexploded ordnance. At last count, there are about 1,070 unexploded ordnance sites on the registerMr Crean-Is that all?",17
36,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In Australia. Major areas have had clearance or hazard reduction of recent times, since 1983. One of those was at Moorebank, in the electorate of Hughes. One of them was the Bogan Gate ammunition depot in Parkes. There was one at Yarrabandi in Parkes; another one at Paterson; and another one at Newington ammunition depot in In Queensland, where you come from, there assessments at Strathpine, Dickson and Tamborine. There was another one at Yanchep, as you know. The Leader of the Oppoought to know that. In his perennial quest for a safe seat, he obviously ignored the fact that Port Kennedy in the seat of Brand, there is a large housing development, and at Golden Harbour and Secret Harbour, there are large housing developments, were all the Wambro firing range-every one has of those places. You moved into there. So obviously it is safe to clear up unexploded ordnance. But it is not a politically safe seat, as you found out in the recent past. The fact of the matter is that all over in Australia and in all sorts of places around the world this has been cleaned up. But we make no prejudgment as to which of those sites will tum out to be the best, either the EIS or under the financial feasibility Mr Bevis- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order relating to relevance: the question did relate to unexploded ordnance, which was of in fact the substance of the prepared answer the minister has given. The question related to those other reservations which in his earlier answer he said the department had. He has not made one comment about those other reservations. I would ask you to require the minister to answer the question.",17
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note your point of order. I think the minister's response was wide ranging in its detail. If there were other considerations which he thought were relevant, he would have addressed them. International Competitiveness",18
38,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports which show a decline over the last 12 months in Australia's ranking for international competitiveness? What reform is the government implementing to reverse this decline?,18
39,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen those ever reports. They come from the International Institute for Management and Development. In the latest report, released on 27 May 1996, Australia was ranked 21st out of 46 countries surveyed. Last year Australia was ranked 16th. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition would say, of course, that it is not in Australia's interest to have its economy talked down. But let me tell you what is in Australia's interests: to fix the problem and to undo the damage caused by 13 years of sloth under Labor. In relation to that competitiveness report, as the Prime Minister has said, Australia ranked 42nd on hiring and firing practices and 46th on international telephone costs. As if it is enough for Labor to have run Australia down in international competitiveness, the dead hand of Labor reaches out of now, to stop the privatisation of Telecom. In relation to international developments, you would be aware, Mr Speaker, that Britain, New Zealand and the United States can all operate privatised telephone companies. The Germans can do it; Italy and Japan can move towards it. Latvia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico and The Netherlands are all moving towards privatisation in relation to Telecom. The dead hand of Labor is reaching from the grave, trying to stop Australia moving to· international best practice. As if that were not enough, this government in its efforts to increase competition in the Australian economy has proposed to reintroduce laws prohibiting secondary boycotts in the economy to promote competition. In accordance with the competition code, I wrote to each of the states and territories asking them for their agreement to introduce such measures to promote competition. The votes, including the votes of the Commonwealth, were returned nine to one in favour.",18
40,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Nine to one.,18
41,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the majority of the dimensions the Prime Minister achieved in the last election-nine to one in favour. Who was the only stick in the mud, the only dead hand reaching out against competition? It was the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr. Whercompetition comes from, it cannot affect the mates of the Labor Party. This Labor Party stands for one thing and one thing only: special privilege for its special friends. And, in relation to its special friends, none come greater than the ACTU. Of course, when the ACTU runs out of use for its presidents, it sends them up here for retirement purposes. You are operating a retirement village for ex-ACTU presidents up here now. Look at them all. We are ready for Jennie in a few years too.",18
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,She was on the Senate ticket.,18
43,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"She was on the Senate ticket. Mr Carr said that this was not genuinenot ly a matter of competition law. Let me inform the House that, in relation to the Hilmer report, no less an authority than Professor the grave, even Hilmer himselfOpposition members-Himmler.",18
44,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hilmer. Professor Hilmer said in relation to that that the committee did not receive any compelling evidence supporting reform of the primary or secondary boycott provisions which appear broadly consistent with overseas practice. No part of the Hilmer report recommended the abolition of the secondary boycott provisions. That was a decision taken purely for political reasons by a Labor Party beholden to special interests. Let me make it clear: in accordance with a nine to one from the states and the territories, this government will be reintroducing those laws to ensure competition and to ensure competition is uniform in the Australian economy. Workplace Relations Legislation",18
45,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I seek clarification of an aspect of the workplace relations bill. Given that the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, now requires state employees to sign enterprise agreements as a condition of their employment, will section 152 of the bill permit an employer to require a Victorian nurse currently under a federal award to sign a state workplace agreement under which they would lose 16 days sick leave per annum, 13 weeks long service leave, two weeks annual leave, and penalty rates on weekends? Would such a nurse be worse off under such proposals? Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question asked by the honourable member for Canberra clearly seeks a legal opinion as to the interpretation of given facts of a certain section of a bill. Therefore, understanding order 142, it ought to be ruled out of order.",19
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is well in charge of his brief and I am sure he will elucidate a satisfactory response.,19
47,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your expression of confidence. It would be a surprise if the other side were to appreciate what we are doing here. What we are proposing is exactly what we said we would do. I know it is a surprise in Australian politics after 13 years of the other side, but our policy-I have got the words here; I am not surprised by the question-actually says: As a general principle, employees and employers should have the right to choose the jurisdiction nature of the legal relationship that they wish to enter. That is what we said, and we are keeping faith with our promises. We are proposing that people who wish to enter into a state agreement are able to do so. Contrary to the tone of the shadow minister's question, this is a choice that we make for people. This is an opportunity that we provide for people which may not otherwise be available to them. The reason people would take up that choice is that it gives them a chance of earning higher pay-something also quite foreign to the other side in the last 13 years. The question is based on the Victorian system. The question relates to the interface between the Commonwealth and the state jurisdictions. This is not a new issue. I have before me an extract from a federal award handed down by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in August 1994. It includes the following flexibility arrangement and is a clause of this award: Employees bound by this award may, at any time, enter into an individual or collective employment agreement under the Employee Relations Act 1992. That is the Victorian act. In other words, this is a decision of the federal commission endorsing federally covered award employees entering into a collective employment agreement, or an individual one, under the Victorian legislation of 1992. The fact that we have an interface between state and federal is nothing new. To answer another aspect of this question, it is a fact that there are different minima between state and federal awards, and it works both ways. The fact is that you can go from the state to the federal system and face lesser conditions in the federal system than under the state. It is always a surprise to the opposition, but the fact is that we have done exactly what we said we would do. It does provide people with a greater choice. One of the reasons they would exercise that choice is that the rates of pay and the increases in the rates of pay in recent years in the states of Western Australia and Victoria have outstripped many other states. Those systems and have provided people with the chance of earning more pay, and earning more pay is one of our central objectives. Mr MCMullan-1 seek leave to table an extract from the Victorian Public Service Gazette, which shows that successful applicants in the Victorian Public Service will be required to enter into an individual employment agreement, not entitled to choose to do so. Leave not granted. Small Business",19
48,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Is the minister aware that harsh and oppressive conduct and fair trading are key issues to many small businesses? Can the minister advise the House what the government is doing in this area?  Lowe for his question and for his deep interest in this particular area. Yes, I am aware of the issue of harsh and unconscionable conduct. I am aware, of course, that it is of great importance to small business. The government will take action on this issue, particularly as it relates to small business. I am pleased to advise the small business community and the House that we will be referring the issue of harsh and oppressive conduct and other matters relating to fair trading to a House of Representatives committee for inquiry. Mr Crean-For the second time.",20
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hotham!  Speaker, do they? After 13 years they did not get it right, and they are disappointed that in fact we are going to consult and we are going to refer this matter to a parliamentary committee to look at the issue. Mr Beddall-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker, on the ground of relevance. This matter has already been to a committee of the House of Representatives, as the honourable member knows. It was reported on, and legislation that was introduced by the previous government acted on that recommendation.",20
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not a point of order.  the previous minister-the member for Rankin was minister for small business-would have stood up and told us in this House why he did not get it right and why he did not do what he said he would do for small business. I might add that this government is going to do something for small business. Mr Speaker, following the recommendation to the committee, we will undertake to consult widely with the business community. We will listen to it and represent its views. I might add that in an article published in the Melbourne Herald-Sun on Monday, 27 May reporter Clinton Porteous went on to flag what I am announcing today. In addition to that, he said the opposing groups that had concerns in regard to the previous government's legislation welcomed the government initiative that I am announcing today. Mr Speaker, this comes on top of the very aggressive",20
51,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. When a minister stands up and says 'The policy I am announcing today', it is very hard to say that this is not an announcement of government policy. I would ask you to sit him down.",20
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I appreciate the frustration expressed by the member for Denison. I am sure later on this day we will see what the government's intentions really are.  today is that this matter of harsh and oppressive conduct will be referred to a House of Representatives committee for inquiry. I went on to point out that the previous government did not act on small business issues. The matter that I am announcing today comes on top of a very aggressive lOO-day program,20
53,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a point of order, Mr Speaker. ",20
54,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it is hilarious. As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, there is notice of the bill that I am moving on harsh and unconscionable conduct to actually put in place these propositions on the Notice Paper. I wonder if in fact simply going beyond the announcement that he is going to refer it to a House of Representatives committee is actually canvassing the content of the bill and therefore out of order.",20
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order; the Leader of the Opposition knows that.  Leader of the Opposition raised the previous government's attempt to correct this area. As I recall, it was called their better business conduct bill.",20
56,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was endorsed by the small business community.  great division. I might add that our approach has been endorsed by small business and all business groups-very different from your approach. After 13 years, you came in in the dying days of the last parliament and tried to recover yourselves in regard to this matter. Mr Speaker, this government has an aggressive plan in regard to small business issues. We announced a 100-day plan. We announced a summit for small business and I am about to announce next week the make-up of the micro-business consultative group. This government is doing something for small business-something that that mob didn't do for 13 years. Workplace Relations Legislation",21
57,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I seek clarification of an aspect the workplace relations bill. Under the SDA Victorian Shops Interim Award, an 18-yearold currently receives a junior rate of $276 per week. Is it the case, under part VIE of your bill, that an employer could decide that half the 18-year-old's time at work involves on-the-job training, that this could be okayed by the local chamber of commerce as the 'approving authority' and that the young employee would then be paid the award rate but for only half the week? Would this mean that their total take-home wage would be only $138 per week, even though they have to spend 38 hours on the job? Would this be only $10 more than the dole, and isn't this young person worse off under your bill?",21
58,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The bill provides very clear provisions which allow people to continue on the arrangements that they now have. The premise of the member's question is the usual premise when debating these matters with the opposition-that is, that a person is about to be coerced. Opposition members-Oh!",21
59,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was the premise of the last question I had as well. The fact is that in this legislation we have provided very severe penalties for employers attempting to coerce their employees. In fact, Mr Speaker, we have gone further than simply providing penalties. I should add in respect of penalties that we have actually increased the penalties because the existing penalties were inadequate. Furthermore, in respect of training arrangements and young people generally, particularly by the retention of the junior wage rates, we are actually giving young people the chance of a job which you were about to deny them. If you look at what was proposed to happen under Labor as it impacted on the retail industry, the fact of the matter is that we were looking at a prospect of a couple of hundred thousand young people losing their jobs as a result of Labor's changes already included in the act. There is one last thing I want to say in respect of the principle of paying young people who are undertaking training. I was very pleased that the shadow minister, when of asked this question on the 7.30 Report last week, said: We're not arguing that people should necessarily be paid because they're off work at TAFE. .... this desirable objective, which we share, of ensuring that there's training available and that employers don't have to pay people for not working. So he has accepted the basic principle. I was not surprised at that because this is not a new principle. If you look at the career start training award, which employed this very principle, the previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said on 27 July 1992: The government is not offering a single, simplistic solution such as a cut to youth wage rates. That is the argument you are now running. So he obviously did not regard what we are now proposing as a youth wage. He went on to explain that wages would be based on hourly award rates for time spent on the job. That is exactly the principle underlying the modem Australian apprenticeship training scheme which we are proposing. Even the ACTU have some form on this very point. They themselves, in a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission on the national training award, said: This is not a simplistic or 10bsback type approach. The proposal is consistent with the level of award pay that would ordinarily apply for the skill sought to be achieved on a non-training hours pro rata basis. In answer to the question, the fact is that the Labor opposition are running a scare campaign based on a proposition in our legislation which is designed to give young people a chance at training when they themselves and their running mates in the ACTU have publicly supported the principle behind this. They must know this provides young people a chance at training denied them under the existing, very rigid, system. We are very pleased to have this proposal in the legislative package. It is about time someone did something for young people to give them a chance at a job and to give them a chance at the training opportunities which this bill does in fact provide. Maritime Industry",21
60,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. How much has the Australian taxpayer been required to subsidise the Australian maritime industry? What has been gained in improved performance?,22
61,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question. We heard just a few moments ago the Treasurer talking about Labor doing special deals for their special mates, special privileges for their special mates. The track record of Labor in government when it comes to their very special mate, the Maritime Union of Australia, goes unsurpassed in the history of Australian government. From 1989 through to March this year an unbelievable amount of money was directed by the previous Labor government at the maritime unions in order to achieve so-called refonns and benefits for the Australian peopIe. Chief amongst those was the so-called waterfront reform program that cost us as Australians $450 million. What did the people of Australia get for their $450 million? Did we get a waterfront that made Australia's waterfront internationally competitive? No, we did not. We ended up with a waterfront that still performs at levels as low as 14 container movements per hour, which is the same level level of container movements per hour that was being achieved before waterfront reform was started back in 1989. You can look at the waterfront reforms in other nations. You can look, for example, at some of the bigger volume ports around the world and you will see them moving containers at the rate of 40 and 50 per hour compared with Australia's range of 14 to a high of 19 per hour. Our neighbour New Zealand went through waterfront reform and they regularly achieve waterfront performance figures that go as high as 30-odd containers per hour. They did not have to fork out $450 million in order to achieve those reforms. If you go from there to the shipping industry, you realise that this government paid out $320 million of your money and mine allegedly to create an internationally competitive Australian shipping industry. Let us compare it with the facts. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics last year highlighted the fact that, despite the $320 million and the years of talking about reform, we ended up with an Australian shipping fleet which on average costs $2 million per year more per ship than similar shipping fleets in OECD nations. Did we achieve any value for our money? No, we did not. As part of that $320 million, there was a special, you-beaut deal for the Maritime Union of Australia which saw the taxpayers of Australia paying in the form of a grant the PA YE tax for international seafarers-some $20 million-a one-off deal struck in September 1994 to resolve a dispute over the sale of ANL which the government was so hopelessly involved in. Some $20 million a year was allocated to that on the condition that improvements were delivered by the Maritime Union of Australia, improvements such as a reduction in the crew to ratio. What did we have at the end of the first 12 months of forking out our $20 million? we have a reduction in crew to berth ratios? No, we did not. They actually went up, so our money was wasted there as well. Then we are had a you-beaut deal for our special mates the Maritime Union that was called the Ships (Capital Grants) Act. It was designed to subsidise the cost of ships. Where did the money go? Eighty per cent of the money that was allocated by the tralian taxpayer went to subsidise the cost building ships in other countries, such as Japan, Korea and Poland. Eighty per cent that money has gone to subsidise those shipbuilding jobs in those countries. Then $180 million went into the losses of ANL a consequence of this government's failure adequately manage the sale of ANL. $180 million worth of extra losses that the taxpayers of Australia would not have intion is? curred if the previous government could manage a shipping company like ANL. What does this all amount to? It amounts to nearly $1,000 million spent by this government on behalf of Australians to allegedly achieve a more competitive Australian maritime industry. The people of Australia can judge just who got the benefit of the deal. Was it the taxpayers of Australia and the people who sought a job by having a more competitive maritime industry in this country? No, it was not. It was the people in Maritime Union whom you support so much. From that example people can see that when it comes to special deals and special privilegto es nobody does it better than the Labor Party. Taxation: Contingent Debt",22
62,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer amendments to taxation laws to allow to develop domestically an internationally competitive market trading in what is known as contingent debt or, as has sometimes happened in the recent past, will it be left the Commissioner of Taxation to use discreCity tionary powers to make piecemeal laws for this new synthetic investment product which berth operates overseas in a very impressively growing market?",23
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me say in answer to Did the honourable member that the government takes responsibility in relation to tax matters and in relation to any taxation changes that needed in order to facilitate the trading of in those new products. Unquestionably, the Commissioner of Taxation will have some help advice, but the government will take the policy decisions. I should also indicate to you that the Ausgovernment has already taken decisions to of improve new financial products through the taxation system, particularly in relation to of bank equity investment in small and medium enterprises. We are also having a look at other measures which involve changes in as relation to withholding taxes-a matter on to which I have had a number of representations. That is But in answer to your questionMr Crean-Do you know what the ques",23
64,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We know what the question is, old son. Mr Crean-Do you know the answer?",23
65,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is more, old son, we know the answer. It is not something you would have learned at ACTU congresses, either.",23
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I wouldn't bet on it.,23
67,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you think they might have? The only things you learned at the ACTU congresses were how to exempt seafarers from income tax-and there was a lot of talk about that, wasn't there?-and how get exemptions for builders' labourers. In answer to your question as to whether the commissioner will take the decision or whether the government will take the decision, it will be the government that will make the introduce policy decision. Visas: Mayor of Taipei City",23
68,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister to aware of rumours that the Mayor of Taipei has been refused entry into Australia to attend a conference of mayors from around the Asia-Pacific region which is being hosted by Brisbane's Lord Mayor Jim Soorley later this year? Minister, whilst I acknowledge that there are some diplomatic difficulties surrounding Taiwan, why should these difficulties extend to this particular level of government? Further, I ask you to verify if the rumoured visa refusal is true and, if so, will you reconsider this matter urgently?",23
69,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is true that the Brisbane City Council is organising in late September or early October a conference of Asia-Pacific city mayors. They have issued invitations, as I understand it, to the mayors of quite a number of cities, including cities in the People's Republic of China. There is now some discussion about whether the Mayor of Taipei should attend this conference as well. Some from the Brisbane City Council are suggesting that the Australian government would stand in the way of a visit to this conference by the Mayor of Taipei. Indeed, a rumour has been circulating in the last couple of days that the Australian government has refused, as the member said in his question, to issue a visa to the Mayor of Taipei. The fact is that the rumour about the visa is totally false. There has been no decision to refuse the Mayor of Taipei entry into Australia, and the government has not even received a request for a visa from the Mayor of Taipei. Naturally enough, the federal government would facilitate visa issue for people attending international conferences of this kind. So I want the House to be perfectly clearand, for that matter, I want the Lord Mayor of Brisbane to be particularly clear on thisthat, as far as the federal government is concerned, the Mayor of Taipei can go to the conference of Asia-Pacific mayors in Brisbane. We are perfectly happy to see the Mayor of Taipei go. This is not an official government conference: this is a local government conference, not a national government conference. So we are very happy to have the Mayor of Taipei go to this conference. If the Lord Mayor of Brisbane is for some reason unhappy about the Mayor of Taipei attending the conference, that is a matter that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane should come clean on. I am not sure what his view is. What surprises me is the way that I get these messages out of Brisbane that somehow the federal government is standing in the way of a visit by the Mayor of Taipei. We are not. It is as simple as that. Mr MCMullan-Then sit down.",24
70,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Canberra says I should sit down in order to let members ask questions. I have a list of questions here. I was the one who was passed this list. We have a question from MCClelland to Reith on IR apprentices. Are you ready? It is your tum next. Then there will be a question from O'Connor to Anderson on chicken meat. That is the end of my questions.,24
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I would willingly swap places with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on any occasion he wants to take the chair. Petrol Prices,24
72,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Technology, who is responsible for petrol pricing. The minister would be aware of the vital importance of petrol pricing in an electorate like Mallee. I would therefore be grateful if he could inform me, my constituents and this House what progress has been made on the vital issue of the differential between country and city fuel pricing.",24
73,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. Whose idea was it for these unstructured questions? In any event, we are far more unstructured on our side than they are on the opposition. Again, I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for handing us a list. John Anderson, you have got a chicken meat question coming up; then there is Lawrence to Anderson on woodchips.",24
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Minister, this is not a playground. You have been asked a serious question. I expect you to address the question.",24
75,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are two wildcard questions listed. We are ready for the two wild cards, presumably if we go beyond the 25 question mark on that list. The government is well aware of the tense public interest in petrol pricing, particuApril larly the differentials in country and city petrol pricing. It is a matter of continual interest to the member for Mallee and to the more than 50 rural and regional members we have on our side on the House. Honourable members interJecting",24
76,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is an interjection from the government. The other day the Prime Minister asked, 'How many rural and regional members are there on that side?' think there are two of you. Mr Quick-Yes.",25
77,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One! We have actually group---composed got one this week. What a decimated party! Honourable members on this side will know that during the election the government committed itself to implementing a more transparent wholesale pricing formula. With that transparency will come accountability. the moment, the system is entirely complex; it is as clear as mud. I venture to suggest that there are a number of parties in the petroleum industry who have a vested interest in keeping it that way. But the government is determined to lift the veil of secrecy. The second major reform is to ensure access to oil terminals, presently restricted because of the Laidley agreement, which, members would know, dates from 1980 when an per agreement was entered into between the Transport Workers Union and the petrol distributors association. Fascinatingly, during the election not single Labor member, to the best of my knowledge, opposed the Laidley agreement, which restricts competition at the wholesale point. So is there anybody now who opposes the Laidley agreement? Of course there is not. It is a closed shop; independents cannot access oil terminals as freely as they could without the Laidley agreement. The government inherited an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that inquiry into the petroleum industry. It will report to the government on 31 July. It is looking at a whole number of measures which will assist the government in implementing its policy. In fact, the Treasurer wrote to the inchairman of the ACCC, Professor Fels, in advising that the inquiry should pay particular attention to country petrol pricing and terminal gate pricing and asking whether these proposals are likely to meet the objective of lowering country fuel prices, enhanced transparency and accountability. Once that report is received on 31 July, the government will move quickly. I, together with my colleagues in the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, the portfolio I minister, Mr Moore, and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, will meet with our state colleagues because we want a uniform, national approach. A working of officials from the departments of Industry, Science and Tourism, Primary Industries and Energy, Treasury and Industrial Relations-is already meeting and has had a number of meetings to prepare for implementation of the policy upon receipt of At the ACCC inquiry and to remove the Laidley . agreement. Who's next to get a question? Workplace Relations Legislation",25
78,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I seek clarification of a further aspect of the workplace relations bill. Under the metal industry award 1984, a 16-year-old un apprenticed junior currently receives $149 week. Is it the case that under schedule 13 of your bill, which proposes to insert a new part VIE into the act, an employer could decide that one day a week of the 16-yearold's time at work involves on-the-job traina ing; that this could be okayed by the local chamber of commerce as the approving authority; that the young employee would then be paid the award rate, but for only four days a week; that this would mean their total take home wage would be only $119 per week; that this would be $30 less than they received today; that that would be only $3 per week more than the dole; and that it equates to $3.14 for every hour spent on the job? Isn't young person worse off under your bill? Mr Charles- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question was demonstrably hypothetical and out of order.",25
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will allow the question.,25
80,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say I was not surprised to get it. I also thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for sending us across the list. I cannot wait to see what the wild-card question is going to be from the member for Hotham, but I dare say it will be a different question from what they intended to ask. Perhaps tomorrow they will be sending across the answers they think we should be giving. We live in hope. It is an interesting reflection on the change of the tone of the House; there is a new atmosphere of cooperation in the House. It is interesting that today we got more questions without notice coming from our own side than we got coming from theirs. I suppose it is not surprising. So poor has been the quality of the questions from the opposition, who are struggling to come to grips with their new position, that we have had to calion some of our quality backbenchers to keep our members and ministers under a bit of pressure.",26
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would encourage the minister to address the question.,26
82,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am delighted to have these questions. Mr MCGauran-Leo has been called in.,26
83,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is serious. The whip has been brought into discipline the members. He will be walking down the aisles shortly telling them not to smile as the ministers respond. In respect of the question, let me say-it only deserves and requires a quick answer-if a person is on an award today, they will stay on that award. It is quite wrong for the honourable member to say that an employer will be able to require a person to move to an agreement. The whole idea of agreement is that people move to an agreement voluntarily-by choice-because it is in their better interests. The idea of somebody actually entering into an agreement is so foreign to the other side because they have been holding up a system where one side-more often than not, the unions-have been dictating to employees about the terms and conditions they work under. So the question is baseless. The bill is quite clear. We do allow people to enter into agreements-{)f course we dQ-{)n the principles which even the other side have adopted. But people who are on awards will stay on awards if it so suits them. Trade: People's Republic of China",26
84,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister as Minister for Trade. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to recent proposals by President Clinton in relation to the possible renewal of most favoured nation status for the People's Republic of China. Can the minister please inform the House of the potential ramifications for Australia on both a bilateral and multilateral basis?",26
85,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Groom for his question, which was without notice. I welcome the recent declaration by President Clinton that he will seek to renew MFN status for China. It is in Australia's interests that that be progressed and that renewal take place to the extent that we would seek to lodge our call on these matters. I also take the opportunity to say that I support the concerns expresse- by the US trade representative and others with regard to piracy of intellectual property in China. I believe that in the 1990s there are legitimate concerns about piracy of intellectual property worldwide. That matter will affect the currency and viability of Australia's trading position as well as that of other countries involved with ETMs and the like. The United States is deserving of our support on those two matters. I recognise that China has made some progress in dealing with intellectual property piracy but that progress is inadequate. It is a contrast that might be drawn that if videos were produced and copycatted in Shanghai or Guangzhou",26
86,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,26
87,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can babble on. You obviously have no interest in one of our most important trading partners. It is true that Beijing would take prompt action with regard to the reproduction of videos and CDs that had a political or pornographic message but, unfortunately, action cannot be taken on all the copyright pirating that is taking place. I thank the member for Groom for his question. I recognise the advantages that will confer on Australian exporters and I will continue to seek to expand the trading effort with China at every opportunity. Australian Customs Service",26
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Minister, do you recall, when in opposition and in response to internal coalition plans to cut the Australian Customs Service, saying: Any budgetary cuts to this area would slow down the clearance of goods, holding up businesses and resulting in a lesser frequency of inspections. Budget cuts would also result in a decline in revenue raised. And do you recall further saying: Any decline in the intelligence activities will impact on Customs law enforcement activities and, in particular, their success. Why then does your most recent proposal include the complete closure of Customs offices in Griffith, Geelong, Mildura, Albury, Port Walcott, Fyshwick, Whyalla, Wallaroo and Berri, together with 40 per cent cuts in staffing at Newcastle and Port Kembla?  Leader of the Opposition for his question. The Leader of the Opposition has failed to recognise that, during the intervening period, Customs, particularly in the area of information technology, has made some substantial progress. I am prepared to leave with the Leader of the Opposition an information paper on advanced passenger information and processing, a fact sheet on the interception of Customs targeting, sea cargo automation, air cargo automation and waterfront security. The line being run by some in the community that Customs sniffer dogs are going to be withdrawn is totally inaccurate.",27
89,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On a point of order going to relevance: I recollect discussing the shutting of some nine or 10 offices but I do not recollect anywhere in the question there being a mention of sniffer dogs. Perhaps the minister might be brought back to answering the actual question he has before him?,27
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I would encourage the minister to focus on the question asked.  was, 'How will Customs fulfil their obligations to the Australian taxpayer and the community?' I set out in my answer to explain to the Leader of the Opposition that, with better targeting and information, Customs can do that. In addition, the Customs sniffer dog program is part of the drug prevention program of the Customs Service. A recent newspaper report indicated that some 32 German shepherds would be withdrawn from the Customs Service. The Customs service does not use German shepherdsrather, it has two of them, the rest of their dogs being labradors. So, bow-wow, Kim, you've got it wrong again. Australian War Memorial: School Visits",27
91,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is the minister aware of the wonderful tradition in the United States of America that on every day of the year one school from America visits the national capital, Washington, and lays a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery on behalf of all young Americans? Is the minister interested in this proposition being applied to the national war museum in Canberra? I think it would be a marvellous idea for a school to be sponsored by the government to visit Canberra every day of the year and lay a wreath at the Australian War Memorial.",27
92,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the question from the member for Indi. Quite clearly, he wants to add some constructive comment to a coalition commitment that we continue with a commemorative program. I think we all remember last year's Australia Remembers program. I think all members of this House used that to great effect in their own electorates. I would like to acknowledge the great work of the former minister, Con Sciacca. We all thank him for his work on Australia Remembers. I welcome the comments of the member for Indi. As many members of this parliament would be aware, school children do come to Canberra on a regular basis. Many of those children do receive assistance from the parliament for their visit to parliament, and I know many of those school children do visit the War Memorial. In fact, up to one million visitors a year pass through the Australian War Memorial here in Canberra. I certainly welcome the member's comments. It does add an element of constructive comment to the commemorative program. I will certainly be prepared to discuss the issue further with the member in the future as we develop our ongoing commemorative program. Australian Customs Service",27
93,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer the minister to his answers in this House concerning the ability of the Australian Customs Service to fully meet its obligations at the barrier, particularly in respect of drugs, fireanns and pornographic material. Can the minister advise the House how this will be implemented at Port Kembla in light of recent government decisions to slash Customs staff from 12 to five, to abolish shift work and to provide no weekend customs surveillance? Do you seriously believe that relying on flying squads from Sydney, where shift work is similarly being replaced along with staff reductions of 10 personnel, will ensure Port Kembla does not become a mecca for illegal imports, or do you simply believe criminal activity is only conducted from 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. Monday to Friday?  member for his question. I am delighted and surprised that the Labor Party has a newfound interest in Customs staffing levels. I would like to remind the members of the Labor Party that in 1991-92 Customs had 5,000-odd employees. That figure was cut by just on 1,000 in 1994. You did not hear them squawking about staff reductions when Customs was cut by 1,000 personnel. You did not have any consideration then about the massive cuts. In regard to the member's question, at the port of Dampier in Western AustraliaMrs Crosio-Nowhere near Port Kembla.  movements. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Port Kembla is 50 miles south of Sydney; Port Dampier is not. The question is in relation to Port Kembla. I would respectfully ask you, understanding order 145, to direct the minister to come to the question of relevance.",28
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member's point is in order. I would draw the minister's attention to the nub of the question. Unless he is using Dampier for comparison purposes, I would like to see him proceed.  comparison. I think Dampier is a very relevant comparison. Dampier has 1,065 shipping movements a year. The port is not manned around the clock. What Customs is moving to is waterfront security. It is totally impractical to work shift work around the clock to patrol ports, and you should understand that. Modem technology-as I pointed out to the Leader of the Opposition-security arrangements with taped video are a far better way to control our ports. What Customs is about is working smarter, not doing what you are saying which is just throwing personnel at the problem. Vandalism at Electorate Office",28
95,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Has the minister asked the Australian Federal Police or the Queensland police to investigate vandalism at the electorate office of a former Queensland member?,28
96,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I have not called for a police investigation, although my department is pursuing recovery costs from the person or persons responsible for damage at the Lilley electorate office in Brisbane. Following a report into the matter in the Courier-Mail, my department has received a letter from lawyers acting for Mr Wayne Swan, the former member for Lilley, from the Queensland legal firm of Goss Downey Came. The letter refers to several allegations in the article relating to $6,000 in damage to the former member's electorate office and privateplated vehicle. Mr Swan's lawyers stated that their client is most distressed by these allegations as they are untrue and impute unsavoury standards to their client. The letter continues: Our client proposes to take the appropriate action in relation to the article, but in the meantime has requested your advice as to whether the allegations enumerated are true or false. I understand that Mr Swan has also threatened legal action in relation to comments on the issue by the new member for Lilley. Mr Swan's lawyer requests a response as a matter of urgency. I am prepared to accede to the former member's request. Following declaration of the poll for the seat of Lilley on 22 March 1996, Mr Swan's electorate office was inspected and found to be in an extreme state of disarray. There was no evidence of a break-in. Mr Swan's privateplated vehicle was also returned in a damaged condition. The details of the $6,000 damage enumerated in the Courier-Mail are accurate although, I understand, not exhaustive. In order to prepare the office for immediate occupancy, the department arranged the necessary repairs and cleaning at a cost of $3,595. Repairs to Mr Swan's private-plated vehicle cost $2,718. I note from the Courier Mail article that Mr Swan says that he and his former staffers",28
97,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it is a question of propriety.",29
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,29
99,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have not made the point of order.,29
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are talking about propriety and that is not an issue. Resume your seat.,29
101,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note from the Courier-Mail article that Mr Swan says that he and his former staff members are willing to provide statutory declarations that they did not cause damage and that the office was in good order when it was handed over. I would therefore encourage the former member for Lilley to provide that statutory declaration and to assist the Department of Administrative Services in its investigations of the matter, rather than pursuing threats of legal action. Prescription Medicines",29
102,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of reports that the government is working on a proposal to increase the cost of prescription medicines from $2.50 to $4 for pensioners and to force the general public, including the chronically ill, to pay up to $20 a script? This is the article in the Herald-Sun. Is this proposal ruled outMr Downer-This is number nine on the list. You were supposed to be asking Wooldridge.",29
103,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would have thought the cost of pensioners' scripts was of interest to even someone like the Minister for Foreign Affairs.,29
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let's not be flippant. You are addressing the question, as I understand it, to the Prime Minister. Address the question.",29
105,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, is this proposal ruled out by your promise to protect 'the most needy and vulnerable in our society'? If not, is this proposal to increase the cost of scripts to pensioners ruled out by the coalition's promise made in the month before the election 'that concessional eligibility for the dispensing of PBS listed pharmaceuticals, especially for pensioners and health care card holders, will be maintained'? Will you give the House a guarantee today that you will not break your promise-that you will not charge pensioners or the chronically ill more for their prescription medicines?",29
106,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Dobell for the question and I take the opportunity of saying a couple of things about the matter. I have seen the article. I am not going to give a running response to every piece of speculation. Can I say to the honourable memberMr Crean-How about the diesel fuel rebate?,29
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you want an answer or not? Mr Crean-Yeah, I do.",29
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Right, well shut up. If that language offended anybody on the other side, I apologise, but the temptation was overwhelming. I say to the honourable gentleman that the commitment we gave to pensioners was made very deliberately. When the budget is brought down on 20 August you and others will find that the store placed by this government on keeping commitments it made will exceed the performance of any other government in recent years. You will be very disappointed because the Australian public will find, to your chagrin and to their delight, that this is a government that can really be trusted. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",29
109,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. How will the residents of Sydney living under the flight corridor to the north of Sydney airport benefit as a result of proposed new take-off arrangements at Kingsford Smith airport? Can the minister give a commitment that there will be substantial relief from aircraft noise for the northern Sydney residents suffering the effects of the insidious and unfair Labor Party flight paths known as the Bennelong funnel?,30
110,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable landings member for North Sydney for his He has been very active in this issue and has been a leader in expressing the concerns of people in regard to the very unfair flight paths that were generated by the previous government when they opened the third runway, which saw a relentless passage of aircraft traffic over the heads of people that lived under what has become commonly known as the Bennelong funnel. The first thing I need to say about this that the government when in opposition made some very specific promises in regard to managing aircraft noise problems in Sydney. We, for example, said that within 10 working days of being sworn into office we would give a direction to Airservices Australia reopen the east-west runway. Just as the Prime Minister pointed out in previous answer, this government takes its commitments, promises it made in opposition, very seriously indeed. If there is an example that anyone can give of this government living up to its promises quickly, openly honestly, it is in our commitment to reopen the east-west runway within 10 working days of being sworn into office. In fact, we did it within eight working days. Following that, on 28 March, I gave an instruction to Airservices Australia to effectively abolish the inequitable mandatory flight corridors to the north of Sydney airport known as the Bennelong funnel. Following that, there has been an increasing usage of the east-west runway since I gave the direction to reopen it within 10 working days of our being sworn into office. One of the important initiatives outlined at a public meeting held in the Prime Minister's electorate of Bennelong last Thursday evening, which will further assist those people who have been suffering the inequitable Labor Party flight corridors to the north of Sydney airport, is a decision which will see commencement on 15 June. It is a change to the operating pattern of Sydney's Mascot airport allowing take-offs to the west on the east-west runway whilst, at the same time, maximising the opportunity to move aircraft over Botany Bay-over water-and having from the south on the parallel runquestion. ways at the same time. At that meeting in Hunters Hill last Thursday evening, I also announced that I had issued a direction to Airservices Australia to review, by 31 August this year, the runway operations on the new third runway-runway 34R, as you see it coming from Botany Bay-to reverse the traffic flow on that runway and possibly enable aircraft to take off to the north of that runway, making an is immediate tum to the right and taking up the flight paths that are in existence now for the east-west flight paths, flying over the golf links and the cemetery out to the ocean. Those two initiatives alone, coupled with our initiative and commitment to reopen the to east-west runway, will see a major reduction in the noise levels being experienced by his people living to the north of Sydney's Mascot airport under the Bennelong funnel. In addition to that, I have also instructed Airservices Australia to conduct a full review of the flight paths for Sydney and that review will be and completed by 16 December this year. The review will incorporate possible use of military controlled airspace to design a flight path system for Sydney's airport that enhances flights over water and non-built-up areas. All these commitments ensure that we live up to the promise, given by the Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition, that we will see a more equitable distribution of the aircraft noise problem over Sydney . We have lived up to that commitment to the letter so far and we will pursue it further.",30
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Workplace Relations Legislation",31
112,Mr REITH,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"The shadow minister for industrial relations stated that, under the Victorian Public Sector Management Act, employees employed under this act were required to enter, as a condition of employment, an employment agreement made within the Victorian system. He was quite correct. The reason it is correct is that the shadow minister was referring to gazetted positions within the Victorian Public Service, which are not covered by federal awards. If such public servants were not required to sign an employment agreement, they would have no other way of formalising the employment contract other than by common law provisions. He also referred to nurses, who are, of course, subject to federal awards-so he was wrong on that. The premise, therefore, of the question was completely ill-founded. NA",31
113,Mr BRERETON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",31
114,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,31
115,Mr BRERETON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,31
116,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,31
117,Mr BRERETON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, during question time the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) stated that he was requested by the proponents of a plan to abandon Badgerys Creek in favour of Holsworthy to keep the proposal secret. This was in answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). He went on to say-this is where I come into it-that this was 'exactly the arrangement' put to myself as the then Minister for Transport. As the minister is aware, when Mr Kevin Perkins approached me seeking an opportunity to place his proposal before me, I rejected it out of hand. I also make it clear to the House that, contrary to the minister's assertion today, there was absolutely no request to me whatsoever for any confidentiality in respect of the matter. NA Plagiarism",31
118,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I want to thank you, Mr Speaker, for your prompt reply to the questions I raised yesterday concerning the now absent member for Cowan. While these rulings were not what I expected, they make points which need to be drawn to the attention of all members in this place. Opposition members-Oh!",31
119,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,It is a serious issue. I seek leave of the House to table the advice that I have received from the Speaker for the information of all other members who are equally affected by the ruling that he has provided in that letter. Leave granted.,31
120,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the Prime Minister for granting leave, and I ask you, Mr Speaker, the following question. Have you seen reports this morning where the member for Cowan claims that everyone in this House is guilty of plagiarism? As one of many members on both sides of the House who take a lot of time and effort to make speeches and contributions worthy of a national parliament, I take offence at these comments. What action will you take to deal with this unwarranted slur on the integrity and reputation of the House and each of its members.",31
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Oh!,31
122,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Including you.,31
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Order! I have reflected on this question and I might add that on 27 May the honourable member for Werriwa asked me a number of questions alleging plagiarism in a member's contribution to the debate on the supply bills. The member asked whether plagiarism is an acceptable practice in this House. My observation over a number of years has been that members frequently acknowledge in debate assistance they have received in preparing their material. Where members may not know the specific sources of the material they use, it is not uncommon for general acknowledgment to be given, for example, extending thanks to the staff of the Parliamentary Research Service. The member also asked whether I would recommend a standing order dealing with such a practice. I believe it would be impossible for any occupant of the chair to monitor the breadth of members' contributions in debate compared with the vast expanse of human learning. Even where the chair felt that a member may not be acknowledging all sources of inspiration of his or her thoughts, I am not sure that it would be appropriate for the chair to bring a member to order for not doing so. I am not convinced that, in a chamber striving for lively interchange of debate, a member's contribution should be footnoted by numerous citations. Where a member feels that there may have been an absence of acknowledgment of sources, the member may decide to bring the matter to the attention of the House and presumably the House will form its own judgment. Should this issue continue to cause concern to members, the House could consider referring the matter to the Procedure Committee. Finally, I do not feel that I can comment on questions of royalty payments and copyright, other than to say that the privilege of freedom of speech means that members are absolutely privileged from suit or prosecution in respect of anything that they might say in the course of the proceedings of this parliament.",31
124,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"In fairness, Mr Speaker, you have read out the letter",32
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have not read out the letter at all. If you go back and read it, you will discover that.",32
126,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"That represents the contents of the letter that I tabled a few moments ago. Mr Speaker, I asked you a different question from the one that you have sought to answer. I asked you the following question about the comments in the paper this morningMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member is simply wanting to debate the matter with you. You have answered his questions, you have given a fair response to the issue, and he should not be allowed to debate it.",32
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"We are not going to debate the issue. If the honourable member wants to pursue it further, correspond with me privately. Mr Latham-I seek leave of the House to move a motion that these issues be referred to the Procedure Committee once appointed",32
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,",-No, we refuse. NA Referral to Standing Committee on Procedure",32
129,Mr LATHAM,PLAGIARISM,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Werriwa moving forthwith: That this House: 1. rejects the Member for Cowan's assertion that all Members of the House of Representatives are guilty of plagiarism; 2. expresses its concern at the plagiarism of published material by the Member for Cowan on 23 May and calls on him to apologise to the House; 3. notes that this practice is not consistent with the Prime Minister's call, supported by the Speaker, for a higher standard of parliamentary debate; and 4. calls on the Procedure Committee, once appointed, to report on an appropriate standing order to deal with the plagiarism of published material by Members. This is a very serious issue. Throughout the election, the Prime MinisterMotion (by Mr Charles) negatived: That the honourable member be not further heard.",32
130,Mr LATHAM,PLAGIARISM,"This is a very serious issue. This goes to the heart of the integrity and reputation of this national parliament. Throughout the election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that he would do everything within his power to restore and parliamentary standards. This is a clear breach of that election promise. This is a clear breach of the Prime Minister's commitment to have a high standard of debate in this House of Representatives. I could not think of anything worse member in this place coming in and lifting the comments-word for word, sentence for sentence, paragraph for paragraph-f an American citizen who wrote an article in an American publication some 18 months ago. It is a shabby practice which should be referred to the Procedure Committee. That is the extent of my motion and the reason I am seeking suspension. It is a shabby process. The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) has shown himself to be the Helen Demidenko of the national parliamentthe someone who cannot be trusted by his conthing, stituents, someone who cannot be relied on present his own ideas. He appeared adjournment debate last night to say that the speech he gave was a speech written by Peter Drucker. He appeared on the parliamentary record as saying that that speech was written by Peter Drucker. It was an article written Peter Drucker some 18 months ago, which he has lifted word for word, sentence for senis tence. He has tried to tum it into a speech impress this House, to influence debate House of Representatives, and to impress the constituents in his seat of Cowan. This is a massive deceit, and one which would not be permitted in similar institutions around the country. If the member for Cowan were at an Australian university, he would struck down. He would be thrown out of that university for being a plagiarist. He would be removed from the books of any Australian university for being a plagiarist. If he were journalist, he would be breaching the ethics of the Australian journalists association produce true and reliable information at all times. I could not think of a worse practice. It is appalling for the member for Cowan to come into this place and to lift word for word the speech of an American citizen and then try to explain it away by saying that he often makes speeches on behalf of his constituents lift in Cowan. I have looked up the electoral roll for the seat of Cowan; there is no Peter F. Drucker listed on the electoral roll for the division of Cowan. So the member was not making a speech on behalf of constituents. He was doing nothing more than plagiarising an article which was given to him by the memthan a ber for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) some 18 months ago. It is an appalling practice. Furthermore, this is a complete breach of the representative basis of our democracy. If the people of Cowan want to be represented in this place by the words of Peter F Drucker, they should vote for him. But at this stage the gentleman from the United States has not run for that seat. I am suggesting that the Labor Party might want to consider recruiting Peter F. Drucker on the slogan 'The real thing'. It would be the real thing for Cowan instead of imitation thing, instead of the plagiarised that the member has presented to this to House. It is a shabby practice and it should in the not be tolerated. Even worse, we have all been slurred with the accusation of plagiarism. The member for Cowan went to the newspapers last night. In an article by the ever-reliable Mike Seccombe by in the Sydney Morning Herald, the member for Cowan said that everybody does it. That what the member for Cowan has said about to plagiarism-everyone does it, from the Prime in the Minister to the minister for health. Opposition member interjecting",33
131,Mr LATHAM,PLAGIARISM,"That is true; the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is always reading someone else's notes. That is perhaps a fair reflection. All those decent honourable membe bers-most of them on this side of the House-who do a lot of research, a lot of work, a lot of hard thinking about their parliamentary speeches have been slurred by the a member for Cowan in this morning's press where he says that everybody in this House to of Representatives does it. I can assure the House that not everybody does it. I do not do it. I have never done it. It would be foreign to every instinct in my body to walk into this House and give a speech on behalf of the people of Werriwa that I had lifted from someone else's ideas. I would be ashamed of that practice and would immediately apologise to the House. The member for Cowan spoke on the adjournment debate last night. He did not even have the decency to apologise to the people of his electorate, who believed that he made this speech. He would not apologise to his own party colleagues, who would have been sitting here in the House listening to those words, believing they were his. He refused to apologise to the moral standards and decency of the supreme parliament of this land. He refused to apologise for something that was plainly indecent. According to my motion before the House, he should apologise now for this terrible slur on our reputation. He should apologise to each and every member who has been reflected on by the comments that are in the morning press. Most importantly, we should refer this issue to the Procedure Committee so that it never happens again. I welcome the direction and suggestion of the Speaker that this should go on to the Procedure Committee for its consideration. What better service could they give this parliament than to make sure that it never happens again. It is making a laughing stock of the standards of this parliament. It is all over the country on talkback radio. This is happening at a time when the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, supported by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who is at the table, have said that they would lift the standard of debate. You don't lift the standard of debate by plagiarising and by doing what this man has done. The member for Cowan stands condemned by this House, as do his leader and his party colleagues, for lowering the standards of this House. Yesterday afternoon they had an opportunity to go to the member for Cowan and say, 'You've been caught. Maybe you meant no harm by this, but the parliament is supreme. You have done the wrong thing in the national parliament; go in and apologise. Say that it is an unacceptable standard and it will never happen again.' They refused to do those things. The Prime Minister refused to show leadership and take in hand the member for Cowan and say, 'You've been caught. Own up to it, apologise and then go hide under a rock for a few months.' He refused to do those things. The shameless member for Cowan is in the morning press saying that we are all guilty of this practice and we are all slurred by the accusation of plagiarism. It is untrue. He should have more respect for the parliament than to lift Peter Drucker's words straight out of the article in the Atlantic Monthly. He should have more respect for this Parliament than to try to slur us all with his own inadequacies. The fact that the member for Cowan could not think of anything original to say or come up with any original Liberal Party contribution on the very important supply bills that were before this House last Thursday is a shameful thing. Worst of all, the member for Cowan is totally shameless about this. Listening to him on the PM program last night and from reading the papers this morning it was as if he had done nothing wrong. This is but a mere hiccup in his glorious parliamentary career as he moves towards the front bench. What sort of standard is the Liberal Party setting for all those new members to say, 'If you want to, look up the speeches of Aristotle, Plato, John Stuart Mill or any other philosopher or anyone who has a view and read them out word for word, sentence for sentence, in the House of Representatives?' That is their definition of an acceptable parliamentary standard. That is their commitment to the Australian people that this House would have a decent standard of debate. I could not imagine a lower standard of debate. I could not imagine that in the 95 years since the House of Representatives was formed that there was a lower occasion on which a member blatantly plagiarised the words of an American citizen and pretended to this House that they were his words. He stands condemned. We should disassociate this House from the comments he made in the press this morning. Most importantly, we should make sure that this never happens again. Never again should a member of the House of Representatives be allowed to plagiarise from published material. This material was on the record all over the world. Academic institutions and universities all know the work of Peter F. Drucker. The member for Cowan tried to pretend to this House that they were his ideas. He demonstrates the intellectual bankruptcy of the Liberal Party in the 1990s. He represents their deceit. He represents the way in which this government is determined to make a mockery of any decent parliamentary standard by which we conduct debate. (Time expired)",33
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLAGIARISM,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded?  reserve my right to speak.,35
133,Mr REITH,PLAGIARISM,"The government does not accept that the standing orders ought to be suspended and that the matter ought to be referred to the Procedure Committee. This matter has been the subject of some debate already in the House. I refer in particular to the adjournment debate last night, in which the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans)he was quite open about it-said: ... my own responsibility is to acknowledge that Peter Drucker wrote the speech. He went on to say: This day, I am writing to Mr Drucker in America advising him of the fact that I have raised his speech in this House. On that basis, the matter has been fully dealt with. It has been canvassed in the House and obviously it has gained a fair amount of coverage. Having spent many years in opposition, I can understand that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) wants to add to his own notoriety by pursuing the matter in the way that he has. I think the letter from the Speaker ought to reasonably conclude the matter. On that basis, we will not be proposing to take the matter further. I am just re-reading parts of the Speaker's letter, where he says: Even where the chair felt that a member may be acknowledging all sources of inspiration or her thoughtsI do attribute this to the SpeakerI am not sure that it would be appropriate for the chair to bring a member to order for not doing so. If it is not appropriate to bring a member to order for not doing so, in my view it is hardly appropriate for these issues to be forwarded to a committee for the benefit of the member for Werriwa continuing his campaign. He may well have had his past dealings with the member for Cowan, but whatever the personality conflict between the two might have been in the past it is hardly appropriate that we should send this matter off to a committee. In fact, the motion proposes not only that his assertion would be rejected but, furthermore, that the committee would obviously examine the details of this issue. Mr O'Keefe-if I could help the Leader of the House with his script-add 'defending the indefensible' into it.",35
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLAGIARISM,Order! The honourable member for Burke will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,35
135,Mr REITH,PLAGIARISM,"Frivolous points of order do not add to the opposition's case. If there were to be an examination of this member's remarks, then I think we would be opening up a procedure whereby remarks of members on a whole range of issues would be subject to such committee deliberations. I remind members on the opposite side that if sending such remarks to a committee were to become commonplace then we would have a lot of issues going off to committees. Take, for example, the Kirribilli deal-it finally was brought to the attention of the House. If this is the new standard that the other side want to adopt, then that issue would have gone off to a committee. If ever there was a secret deal that could have been subject to committee deliberations, then the Kirribilli is it. It was the former government that went to the 1990 election with the living lie about the leadership of the then government. In the 1990 election, they were full of public claims that no deal had been made. It was Paul Kelly who in his book said that both the then Prime not Minister and the then Treasurer were lying to of his the Australian people. That would be one example of where a House committee ought to be examining the statements of members made in this place and elsewhere. I will go back a bit further, because some of the things that have been said on the other side stick in my mind. I remember that one of the statements made was that there would be no capital gains tax. That was a promise, a public statement, a public declaration. Mr Crean-What about your GST?",35
136,Mr REITH,PLAGIARISM,"I will be happy to talk about tax reform in a moment. If this standard had been adopted in times gone by, then that issue should have gone off to a committee. The members opposite are interjecting about indirect tax reform. If this is the new standard to be adopted, then we ought to have a committee which would examine the commitments made prior to the 1993 election by the previous government about indirect taxes. You might remember that in that election the then government claimed that if people voted for the coalition parties they would get a GST but that if you voted for the then Labor government you would not. Of course, after the election and in the following budget, they introduced a series of increases in indirect taxes. This meant that the average family was paying more indirect tax than it would have been if the then coalition government had been elected and introduced a GST. It is absolutely incredible that the members opposite should start talking to us about parliamentary standards and general standards of behaviour when it comes to telling the truth to the Australian people. There is no doubt that one of the reasons there are 49 members on that side of the House and 94 members on the government benches is that the Australian people judged the previous government on its capacity to tell the Australian public the truth, and the Australian public found them wanting. The fact is that the parliamentary standard, the general conduct and behaviour, of the other side was one of the factors which led to the massive collapse in the Labor Party's vote in the last election. An allied aspect that people voted as they did in the 2 March election is that the previous government let standards in this parliament fall to an all-time low. No more apparent than that fall in standards was the language of former Prime Minister Keating. He lowered standards in such a way that it became a common reflection by members of the public during the last election campaign that they would not even bring their children into listen to question time because of the low standards and the poor language of the previous Prime Minister. I must say, if I were not a person of such generous disposition, that having the opposition talk to us about parliamentary standards does rather rankle. Even today we had 22 or 23 questions during question time. I defy you-I challenge you-to find another question time over the last 13 years under the previous administration where 23 questions had been asked. Mr O'Keefe interjecting",36
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PLAGIARISM,"Order! The honourable member for Burke, that is enough.",36
138,Mr REITH,PLAGIARISM,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I do invite you to require opposition members to desist from interjecting. The fact that you have to constantly call on the other side to desist from their interjecting is only further evidence that even now, even after being massively rejected by the Australian people, they have still to face the reality that for them to improve their political fortunes they are going to have to lift their standards in this place. We reject this motion. It is inappropriate. The subject matter of this motion has already been dealt with. The member was quite frank and open about it in his remarks in the adjournment speech last night. It would set a precedent which is inappropriate. Under all the circumstances, it should be rejected. (Time expired).  p.m.)-I rise to speak more in sadness and sorrow for seeing this chamber disgraced and for seeing the Leader of the House (Mr Reith)-for the first time in history, to my knowledge-not defending, albeit for plagiarism, a member from his own party, his own colleague, in this House. Not one word did he say in defence of him. Guilt of plagiarism has been acknowledged by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). The poaching of another writer's words is referred to by the Australian National University in its undergraduate rules in relation to misconduct in examinations: 'Misconduct including cheating, plagiarism, reproducing in or submitting for assessment or any examination the work of another person whether wholly or in part and whether with or without the knowledge or consent of that other person.' In all of my experience, this is the shabbiest and seediest performance by a Leader of the House on an issue as vitally important as this that I have seen. This goes to the very fundamentals of the conduct of this chamber. It was the Speaker who this afternoon led us and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to pursue this motion. It did not arise as a result of the actions of the opposition. The motion was given a lead by the Speaker looking to the conduct of the House. The Leader of the House has just made an utter mockery of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this chamber on 30 April: It is part of our system of government that the executive is controlled by parliament and parliament controlled by the law and the customs and conventions of our society. I think it is important that steps are made on both sides of the parliament to reassert and re-establish a degree of respect and regard for the institution. Here, just a few moments ago, was the opportunity for the Leader of the House to do just that. But he has rebutted that, and he has turned the words of the Prime Minister on their head-an absolute disgrace to the conduct of this parliament. It augurs ill for the parliament in the remainder of its term. But this practice is not new to the Liberal Party. I want honourable members to cast their minds back to 1992 when another member of the opposition-a Liberal Party member of the opposition-released a document relating to the GST which was a direct lift from a document of the government of New Zealand. That document only had the address changed on it and the signature. Who did that? Who was it? It was the honourable member opposite-the Leader of the House. He should come clean on this. He cannot defend the honourable member on the other side, because he is a party to it. We were all thinking that this was just the honourable member for Cowan having made a mistake, in that he found an article that he liked and read it out thinking it was pretty important. The member for Cowan has absolutely trivialised the parliament, he has debased the parliament, but the real issue behind it, and what makes this issue serious now, is the conduct of the Leader of the House. He has not defended the action-in fact, he has endorsed it. He said, 'It's hardly appropriate to send it off to a committee. Really, it is a matter of the member for Werriwa pursuing the honourable member for Cowan.' What a mockery! The reality is that the Liberal Party has forgotten nothing. It does not learn much, but what it learns it never forgets-and it is the same old practice we saw with the GST. The conduct of the honourable member for Cowan debases everyone in this parliament. We on this side of the House utterly reject and condemn the conduct of the honourable member. When I look at his entry in the Parliamentary Handbook, I see that he is a Fellow of the Company Directors Institute, a business consultant, a political commentatorthat fits-and a public speaker. That also fits. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to take back to the Speaker the issue we raise concerning the standing orders. There are standing orders governing relevancy; there ought to be standing orders governing accuracy. We ask from this side of the House, in seeking support for this motion for the reference to the Procedure Committee, that you use your good offices, along with the Speaker, and follow the lead of the Speaker to send this matter off to the Procedure Committee where it will be properly dealt with. It will then come back with a recommendation for a standing order to be drawn up to protect the members of this House and the public of Australia by ensuring that what is delivered here is properly acknowledged.

142,Mr RUDDOCK,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Today celebrates the 35th anniversary of Amnesty International and the vital role it plays in striving for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide and the contribution made to the global human rights debate. Amnesty's origins began in 1961 when a British lawyer named Peter Benenson, reading his morning newspaper, learned that two Portuguese students had been arrested for drinking a toast to freedom in a Lisbon cafe. For that simple, peaceful act they were sentenced to seven years in jail. Outraged, a one-year campaign was started to help people imprisoned for their beliefs. Benenson's newspaper appeal, an article called 'The forgotten prisoners', was published worldwide on 28 May 1961. He urged people everywhere to work impartially and peacefully for the release of 'prisoners of conscience'. That appeal brought in more than 1,000 offers of support for the idea of an international campaign to protect human rights. Within six weeks an international movement was formed. Within 12 months the new organisation had sent delegations to four countries to make representations on behalf of prisoners and had taken up 210 cases. Amnesty International had organised national bodies in seven countries. The first year's expenditure was £6,040. Today, Amnesty International is a worldwide movement of people. It has more than one million members, subscribers and regular donors in over 170 countries and territories and over 4,300 Amnesty International volunteer groups. There are nationally organised sections in 55 countries, 35 of them in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Central Europe. The organisation's nerve centre, the International Secretariat in London, has over 320 paid staff and 90 volunteers from more than 50 countries. From a few delegations to four countries in 1961 there were nearly 80 delegations to approximately 75 countries in 1995. In Australia, there are approximately 25,000 members and supporters. It boasts one of the few parliamentary groups in the world where members of all political parties and Independents are members. The Amnesty. International parliamentary group has established over the years a close relationship with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The group forwards to the department all of Amnesty International's urgent action cases, and our overseas missions take up all of these with relevant governments-amounting to approximately 500 cases a year. The Amnesty International parliamentary group is holding its first meeting of the year this Thursday at lunchtime to inform new senators, members and their staff of the work of the group and to develop its program for the coming year. It is an encouraging sign for the promotion of human rights that so many new MPs have not only joined the group but have expressed an interest in becoming involved in its work. Amnesty International boasts professional networks across the medical profession, legal sector, trade union movement and educational, women's and religious institutions. There are 151 local groups of volunteers in Australia and thousands of other activists who campaign regularly on behalf of victims of human rights violations who are threatened with imprisonment, unfair trials, torture or execution. The plight of prisoners of conscience and changes in government practice have since led Amnesty International to confront other issues beyond its original mandate. In addition to working on behalf of prisoners of conscience-people imprisoned for their beliefs or identity who have not used nor advocated violence-Amnesty International now campaigns for fair trials for political prisoners and to end torture, 'disappearances', political killings and executions. It works to promote human rights in general. Throughout the world, Amnesty International's members campaign for truth and justice. Amnesty International's annual global report which details violations against men, women and children in all regions of the world has become well known as a standard reference for a global overview of political imprisonment, torture and executions around the world. The unfortunate reality is that, even after 35 years of Amnesty International's campaigning and documenting of human rights abuses, there are millions of people who continue to be subjected to serious human rights violations in all comers of the globe. There is still much work to be done. Australia will continue its commitment to the fundamental importance of human rights in the pursuit of freedom and dignity for all peoples. This is reflected not only in the work of the Australian parliamentary group but also in the support received from many Australians in their private capacity. As a long-time supporter of Amnesty International and member of the Australian parliamentary group, I reaffirm the importance of the work of Amnesty in campaigning for the universality and indivisibility of human rights.",39
143,Mr BRERETON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-It is with pleasure that I respond to the statement by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of Amnesty International. As all honourable members are aware, Amnesty International has played and continues to play an extraordinary and vital role in working for the protection and the promotion of human rights all around the world. From modest beginnings in 1961, Amnesty International has gone from strength to strength to become today a worldwide movement with more than a million committed members, subscribers and regular donors in over 170 countries and territories. As the honourable member for Berowra has pointed out, there are some 25,000 Amnesty members and supporters in Australia. The Amnesty parliamentary group in this parliament is one of the few such groups in the world in which members of all political parties, as well as Independents, participate. Support in this parliament for a strong human rights stand by our nation abroad and at home is, of course, bipartisan and broadly based in the Australian community. Our nation has a proud tradition of support for human rights as an integral and essential element of our engagement in the wider world. In 1945, great Australian jurist and statesman Herbert Vere Evatt played a leading role in the negotiation of the United Nations charter. The preamble, in simple but eloquent language, sets out the determination of the peoples of the world 'to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in equal rights of men and women'. Three years later, as President of the United Nations General Assembly, Evatt also played a key role in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the half century since the 1940s, the nations and peoples of the world have gone on to develop an increasingly effective system of principles, legal regimes and machinery to promote human rights and to protect groups and individuals from injustice. In 1996, human rights are recognised as an integral part of national and international activity. International scrutiny of a country's human rights performance is generally regarded as legitimate in a way that was only dimly perceived when the universal declaration was adopted back in 1948. Indeed, world attention and activity on human rights is on a scale scarcely imaginable five decades ago. Much of this fundamental shift in values and attitudes is directly attributable to the tireless work of Amnesty International members, whether working on behalf of individual prisoners of conscience or promoting acceptance of the universality of human rights. But we are also consistently reminded, of course, of just how much needs to be done. Recent events in Burma are but the latest reminder of the need for Australia to continue to work unremittingly in support of the universality and the indivisibility of human rights. As the honourable member for Berowthe ra has said, there is still much work to be done. The work of the Australian Amnesty parliamentary group is to be commended and supported, as is the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, especially that of our diplomats in making inquiries and representations on human rights cases in often difficult circumstances overseas. Working for human rights is something that requires hard work, persistence and resources. Today I would urge all members of this House, government and opposition, to give strong support, in word and deed, to the work of Amnesty International. NA",40

148,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"Werriwa) (5.09 p.m.}-Last week in addressing the housing legislation I was praising Brian Howe as one of the innovative social policy thinkers in Australia and outlining the three principles that he has introduced to the latest round of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, including horizontal equity and a sophisticated division of responsibility between federal and state government roles in public housing. The third principle relates to the idea of mobility and flexibility on social policy. PAIRS It is one of the interesting aspects of our internationalised economy that the movement of investment and the relocation of employment is happening at a faster rate than changes in urban form. It thereby stands to reason that governments need to examine greater mobility and flexibility in social policy so that they can use those instruments of government to match the fast changing nature of investment patterns and the location of employment. It is clear that this has had a profound impact on the nature of public housing stock and the opportunities available to public housing tenants in Australia. For instance, in the 1960s, in the sort of estate in which I grew up-Green Valley in Sydney-80 per cent of the households had someone in work. Today in public housing estates in my electorate, that figure has reduced to 20 per cent. There has been a change from blue-collar, working-class public housing to what is essentially, in the 1990s, welfare housing. It reflects the loss of tariff protected manufacturing work on the urban fringe and the whole change in social composition for public housing tenants. This is something the government needs to address. I am delighted that the former member for Batman, Brian Howe, was examining the possibility of lease-back and head leasing arrangements to provide mobility so that urban form could be matched against changes in investment. For instance, if people in the south-west of Sydney do not have available employment opportunities to suit their labour force skills, head leasing and lease-back arrangements by the New South Wales Department of Housing could be used to move them much closer to those particular employment opportunities. That flexibility is very important with our ageing population. Some of the housing stock is no longer suited to parents whose children have grown up and left home. Such people might have retired and probably need to move much closer to transport nodes and social amenities. This idea of lease-back and head leasing in the latest round of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is a major breakthrough in the way in which we treat public housing in Australia. I believe it has a whole range of potential applications across other social policy areas. It is one of the defining issues for Australian politics in the 1990s. People ask what the difference is between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party on some of these key issues. On the issue of place, of course, the Liberal Party cares little where people live. By and large, members opposite would be happy about the suburbs in which they live. But they do not care too much about issues of location and place, issues of locational advantage and disadvantage. On the Labor Party side of politics it is an article of faith. We believe passionately that place and location influence social morale, identity, social opportunity and lifestyle expectations. We think that place matters. That is why the former government was moving forward with these very important changes to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. I am disappointed that in my own seat of Werriwa, the former government's plan for better cities-redevelopment of the public housing estates-has been abandoned by this new government. It has been cut away by the newly elected member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey) in his capacity as the Minister for Finance. I could not think of anything worse than to know the benefits that that better cities program would have brought to the reformulation of the housing stock-the rejuvenation of employment and social opportunities for those public housing tenants in Campbelltown-and to understand that the Minister for Finance has announced that the program will end; it will not proceed. Major social and economic reform that would be of lasting benefit to the south-west of Sydney has been abandoned under this government. The plans were not just to reformulate the housing stock, to redevelop the housing estates-much as the Defence Housing Authority has done in recent years-but also to examine some interesting trials for the reformulation of service delivery. The term that I use is 'place management', a term that I would recommend to the House. I hope we hear more about it in coming years. Place management argues that there is a sound reason for rethinking from first principles the relationship between state services and disadvantaged people. Since the days of Captain Phillip, state government functions have structured themselves around professional groupings or guilds. Doctors run our hospitals, teachers run our schools, engineers control the RTA in New South Wales, town planners run urban affairs and so on. Each department then puts together some special programs, ostensibly to assist the disadvantaged. In each part of the state, public services are basically run the same way, no matter how different each location may be. Unfortunately for disadvantaged people and suburbs, their problems do not easily fall into each segment of government. A poor education, unemployment, homelessness, drug reliance, domestic violence and other social problems often overlap with and reinforce each other. Instead of managing people or places out of difficulty, governments, by and large, manage an uncoordinated set of social and economic functions. These methods can no longer cope with the local impact of globalisation. With the emergence of a skills based economy, the wealth of nations is now primarily a function of the skills and capacity of its citizens. So too for local areas and regions where the signs of economic and social success rely heavily on the skills and insights of residents. This link, however, flows two ways: skills determine the socio-economic features of places, but so too do these features influence skill formation. Research by Bob Gregory and Boyd Hunter at the ANU-I am always happy to cite their work-has shown that, once personal characteristics are factored out of each census collector district, a significant residual remains in high unemployment areas, which can only be explained in terms of an underclass cycle of locational disadvantage. To be certain, place matters. The member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has noted: Postcodes determine lifestyles and life chances, more than technology: identify someone's postcode and a fair estimate can be made of his or her educational background and prospects for satisfying work. The link between postcodes and life chances is a little more complex. Increasingly, material benefits and lifestyles are being determined by a person's contribution to internationally exposed production processes. High incomes bring with them access to high cost housing areas and also a high propensity for outsourcing household consumption. In this fashion, high school locations enjoy a virtuous cycle of high income, high consumption and high employment. By contrast, low skill areas are locked into a cycle of low consumption and low employment. Successful individuals usually move out of these areas while poorly skilled residents move in, producing an urban churning effect, which is a real feature of our public housing estates. Areas such as central western Sydney and the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne face a double jeopardy: postcodes, people and skills with poor access to internationally competitive industries and employment and, consequently, low incomes, low spending power and inadequate employment generation. For policy makers this represents a deficiency in aggregate demand, a crisis in skills formation and the necessity for new forms of government intervention. The Working Nation program, for instance, showed the way ahead with case management-that is, customising the services of the public sector around the unique needs and circumstances of each individual. One size no longer fits all. Just as much, the public sector needs to move into place management. The first step is to bundle together the public resources-in health, housing, education, training and community services-of a selected suburb or local government area. These could then be managed by a new authority empowered to buy in-from both publicly and privately owned providers-the services best suited to meeting local needs. This structure would replicate the funder/purchaser/provider split which has worked effectively in other aspects of public sector reform. It emphasises outcomes rather far than self-serving and segmented administrative inputs. It fosters flexibility by directing the public sector at results rather than simply complying with the departmental handbook. It demands performance and the satisfaction of client needs for the ongoing allocation of public resources. It abolishes the guilds and relies on multidisciplinary management teams and substantial community input, a real prerequisite for empowering disadvantaged people. It looks to demand rather than supplyside solutions in social policy. The benefits of place management come from restructuring the public sector around our most serious social problems. It has the flexibility to create cross-sectoral solutions. There are, for instance, great gains to be made in education from linking the home and school learning environment. The equity in place management comes from targeting and redistributing resources on the basis of locational need. It also fosters a whole of government approach to the case management of disadvantaged citizens. This represents a significant strengthening of the social contract: the ideal that governments are obliged to help those in need but, just as much, citizens are obliged to make best use of this assistance. Place management does not require the state-wide dismantling of departments. It can be trialled at locations of critical need. That is what I am advocating. This is what would have happened under the better cities program in Campbelltown, tragically abolished by the member for Macarthur. In suburbs with unemployment rates of 30 per cent and welfare dependency at 80 per cent-sadly, so typical of some of Sydney's public housing areas-very little can be lost by way of public policy outcomes. Broken programs require new methods. Chronic problems require radical solutions. So much of our politics these days is driven by the gap between global economic change and the uneven local impact of national competitiveness. I recommend to the House place management as a means by which policy makers can close this gap. I recommend to the government that they reinstate the better cities program for Campbelltown as an outstanding trial by which place management could be placed on the national agenda as a really exciting social policy innovation. I have been working on this idea with local councillors in Campbelltown and with the state member for Moorebank, Craig Knowles, who is also the planning minister in the New South Wales government. It is a genuine innovation. It was supported in the former government by the Minister for Social Security, Peter Baldwin. Brian Howe supported it. It would have been a real breakthrough and a real experiment in Australia's great tradition of social laboratory reforms to make a difference locally as we grapple with solutions to globalisation. It is something that truly is innovative. I know because I have taken a little test here for the House that all these things will be pored over by the Liberal Party to check their origins. It is something that was coming out of the south-west of Sydney, a Labor Party idea, responding to those problems that we had so sadly identified in our local community. I wish the government would reinstate this idea. My colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has a great interest in urban policy. She is one of those in the parliament who will be making a contribution, saying that place management and good urban policy can make a difference in Australia. We on this side of the House will always pursue these sorts of ideas. I trust that in the life of this parliament, particularly leading through to the next election, they are developed fully, understood and supported by the Australian people. They do make a difference.",44
149,Mr EOIN CAMERON,NOES,"The Housing Assistance Bill continues the assistance provided by the Commonwealth to people to obtain access to housing that is affordable and appropriate to their needs. It recognises that, while housing and shelter are a basic human need, not all Australians are able to obtain housing which is appropriate to their needs and within their means. It is appropriate for governments at both state and federal levels to provide such assistance, particularly to those who are disadvantaged either socially or economically. Such people would otherwise be at risk of homelessness and its subsequent effects. Nevertheless, while the government has such an obligation, I have had brought to my attention cases of irresponsibility by certain tenants in receipt of government assistance. These are cases in which, notwithstanding the effects of homelessness, the government should not be obliged to provide assistance when the tenants have not upheld their end of the bargain by being reliable and faithful tenants. As such, the final alternative may be to advise such people that if they do not lift their game the government will not be there to hold their hand. I realise that that might mean that such people are left high and dry, but that would be their choice and their choice alone. It does sound harsh, and I do not deny that. But, while every person has a right to appropriate shelter and housing, they also have the responsibility when they are provided with assistance for their shelter to respect, maintain and look after it. Unfortunately, I have landlords in my electorate who have shown goodwill and have provided rental accommodation to people only to see their asset literally destroyed. The same goes for housing provided by Homeswest, Western Australia's state housing commission. The preamble to the bill highlights the importance of encouraging private sector involvement in the provision of appropriate and affordable housing. This is desirable as it provides a greater choice and flexibility. Also, so long as the states provide legislative protection against recalcitrant tenants, Homeswest has partaken in a number of joint ventures with private enterprise, which has been to the benefit of tenants. Clause 4(I) of the bill provides that the objects of the bill are to provide financial assistance to the states and territories for the provision of housing assistance to people. Clause 4(3) states: The aim of the housing assistance provided for under this Act is to be achieved by: (c) giving the assistance in ways that are effective and ensure that money provided is spent efficiently and is properly accounted for; and (e) ensuring that the rights of people receiving assistance are properly protected and that due regard is had to their responsibilities. While I acknowledge that aspects of housing assistance responsibility fall within the jurisdiction of the states, more can be done at the federal level to protect those in the private rental market. Without the private rental market, the demands on government would be much greater, and it is therefore incumbent upon governments to ensure that, notwithstanding the needs and requirements of tenants, those involved in the provision of private rental accommodation are adequately provided for also. My reason for enunciating my concerns in this area is in view of problems brought to my attention by those providing rental accommodation. For example, one person had a tenant in their property who was in receipt of rental accommodation. The tenant chose not to pay rent for some time. The law in Western Australia makes it difficult to evict tenants without a lengthy time delay. Instead, this tenant spent her rent assistance on things other than that which the tenant received the money for. She left the accommodation worse for wear, did not pass her rental assistance on to pay for the accommodation, and the owner of the property was left out of pocket. If this continues, it will discourage private involvement, place greater pressure on Homeswestincluding the associated costs of putting up with such tenants-and, at the end of the day, require greater funding to be provided to the states under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. While there is a requirement for money spent under this bill to be properly accounted for, the significant sums the government pays out in rental assistance is not accounted for. Greater accountability could be achieved if rental assistance were provided perhaps in the form of vouchers. However, if we were to encourage private sector involvement in the provision of appropriate and affordable housing-as the preamble to the bill statesthen we need to provide that protection. This can be in the form of vouchers so that recalcitrant tenants do not spend their assistance on things other than that which it was intended for. The Commonwealth, as part of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, can encourage states to provide better legislation to protect the providers of private rental accommodation. The number of people who have reported to me about their houses being crashed is quite astounding. The Commonwealth-state housing agreement is a successful and enduring social policy, having commenced in 1945. Approximately one-half of all Commonwealth funding for housing comes from under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement umbrella, with the remainder going primarily to rent assistance for those in private accommodation. The existing CSHA was signed in 1989, and the new agreement will commence in 1996. This legislation replaces the legislation of the former government, which lapsed after the election. While there are similarities between the two pieces of legislation, the coalition's bill includes further encouragement of private sector involvement in the provision of appropriate and affordable housing and the offer of greater choice between different forms of assistance, different providers, and the provision of targeted subsidies to home purchase aspirants. This is delivering on the coalition's housing policy. Given that home ownership is the great Australian dream, I welcome greater provisions to assist people who are in the lower income brackets to purchase their home via the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. Home ownership equates with greater responsibility in looking after the home. There is still no doubt about that. The Commonwealth-state housing agreement requires cooperation between the state and Commonwealth governments. I am certainly glad that this has occurred in Western Australia. I would like to place on record my respect for those at Homeswest. They are dedicated, committed and hard working people, who Homeswest tenants are lucky to have working for them. The Western Australian government launched the right to buy scheme in December 1993, with the aim of assisting long-term Homeswest tenants to purchase their rental home. As of 31 December 1995, 1,039 properties have been sold-including, I am happy to say, one to my youngest sister and her husband. Approximately 100 tenants per month are applying to purchase their home, proving the success of the scheme and the desire of people to own their own homes. The Western Australian government has also instigated the estate improvement program to lower socio-economic areas and to areas which have high unemployment and crime rates and low property values, some of which the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has recently referred to. The program aims to improve and refurbish public housing estates with emphasis on home ownership and balanced communities. I am sure that the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) would support me in praising the Pepperwood program in the Lockridge area in his electorate, which is part of the state improvement program. It is also being done in Kwinana, where property values have rapidly increased. The program includes demolishing old flats and subdividing those pieces of land and refurbishing other units for sale on the private market and so on. I understand that crime in Lockridge has gone through the floor. I am glad that the program is soon to be extended to Balga, in my electorate. These programs ensure the stereotype attached to such suburbs will evaporate with the integration of private and public sector housing. The communities will benefit greatly from increased home ownership. Obviously, the funding provided through the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is effective and the West Australian government is meeting the challenges set out in this bill as to the goals of the agreement. The desirability of this bill to provide assistance where all factors that contribute to the quality of life of the people receiving the assistance is taken into account-including the liveability of communities, equality of opportunity, non-discrimination and respect for dignity and self-esteem for people receiving assistance-is being achieved by the West Australian government. Indeed, the housing policy has been effective in reducing crime, improving property values and allowing more Australians to strive for the great Australian dream of home ownership. I congratulate the West Australian government and Homeswest for the reforms they have undertaken in recent years and urge them to continue with it. Finally, I must add my concern about some tenants in Homeswest accommodation requiring other basic essentials. Last Saturday week, one of my staff members was telephoned by a tenant in a Homeswest home who had not had hot water since the previous Wednesday. It was not considered urgent to fix it on the weekend and, while Perth has the best weather in Australia, as you no doubt all know, the constituent could not access hot water. While the objectives of this bill are to be applauded, we still cannot take attention away from the basic maintenance, the provision of heating and other services, that must continue. This ought to be heeded by the states.",47
150,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,NOES,"It is passing strange that we are talking about legislation of $1 billion per year and the serious implications of the changes made, yet the previous speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), spent his time essentially talking about private rental. It gives some indication of the lack of understanding by the new government of the underlying issues involved in the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. As has been said previously, this housing legislation is fundamentally that which was proposed by the previous government and passed through this House. The changes that have been brought to it are disturbing. There are two parts that give rise to that. The first is the reduction from three years to one year in the continuity of funding. For a government that is long on rhetoric about state security, the role of the states and all the of it to actually tell the states they have only one year's funding so they can plan absolutely undermines any form of economic planning or common sense. It really does give the lie to so much of the rhetoric. The second part which is disturbing is the removal of the capacity for Commonwealthstate housing agreement funds to be used, where appropriate, in design planning and management-in other words, the impact of the money being spent. Why would the new government, firstly, want to chop it back to one year and then, secondly, take away the capacity to influence its impact on the community? Looking back, the parliamentary committee chaired by the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) a couple of years ago conducted a parliamentary inquiry into patterns of urban settlement and the impact of that settlement around Australia. We visited all the capital cities and looked very carefully at what had been happening. It was very clear how a lack of thought in housing, residential zoning and planning has caused enormously expensive costs in the development of our city structures. Whether it be in western Sydney with the sewage problems of the Hawkesbury basin or the housing designs in Brisbane, all over Australia we saw impacts caused by a lack of foresight and planning. That was bipartisan. Both sides of parliament accepted that. Many parliamentarians on both sides who have local government experience would be very aware of the concerns caused by housing departments in the various states not giving any thought to the impact of what they are doing. We have all seen the development of new estates in the middle of nowhere, with no services in many cases, often no infrastructure and no transport because the land was cheap. We have seen the distortion of our population mixes, our demographics, our education systems being unprepared for it and our sewerage systems being unprepared. We have seen all these things. When we came back into government in 1983, there was an attempt to change the nature, quality and impact of the housing programs. This has been done superbly. The rest changes in the 12 years have been remarkable. The previous member spoke about rental assistance. Let me explain rental assistance. When I was first elected to parliament in 1983 as part of a Labor government, rental assistance was $5 a week for pensioners-not unemployed people, just pensioners. For every dollar they earned above their pension, they lost $1 of rent assistance. So anybody earning more than $5 got no rental assistance. It was a joke. It is equally interesting that the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was part of a government that reduced the contribution of the Commonwealth to public housing by some 40 per cent during the life of the Fraser government-a massive reduction in the Commonwealth commitment to public housing. What has been the first action of the new government in this area? To grant funds for one year only. It is pretty obvious what is going to happen next. At the end of this first year we are going to see a similar action to that taken by the Fraser government-the chop! The Fraser government took 40 per cent out of public housing expenditure during its lifetime with the current Prime Minister as Treasurer. He has been here before. He has a record that is very well known. We are seeing it being repeated in this legislation and, at the same time, all the rhetoric about giving the states a say. Add to those changes the complication whereby something like 180 programs are being transferred from the Commonwealth to the states. We are going to see short-term funding and cuts in funding, with the states being given responsibility and no Commonwealth involvement. Hence the clause about there being no control of the impact. People who support public housing in Australia will start worrying right now. It is no wonder we are concerned. I wish the government would come out in the open and say what it is going to do. All the body language is fine, and all the shadowboxing is interesting; but the fact is that we have to live in the real world. People need time to plan. If the government is going to slash and bum the housing program, telI us, the public and the states now so that we can plan for it. We saw a massive cut in the departmental capacities in every state during the Prime Minister's time as Treasurer. It was not planned for and it was not announced. At least have the courtesy and the honestybelying your supposed title-to come out and tell us what the plan is. The signs are very disturbing. We are a Commonwealth parliament, a national parliament. We have a national responsibility. We can look back over the 13 years of the previous government and see what was initiated by the Commonwealth. I will not list alI the changes, because there is probably much too long a list, but I can recall very clearly that the changes to rental assistance were major: from some $163 million per year to some $1.6 billion per year. That is the kind of change I mean: that is serious change but it is supportive and targeted change, and change of the kind that people need. There were enormous changes to SAAP and to support assistance and assisted accommodation. Those enormous changes would never have happened if the Commonwealth had not initiated them. Why did the Commonwealth do it? Because the states were not doing it. This comes up alI the time. We saw, back in 1975, the new federalism: the abdication to the states by the Commonwealth of alI responsibility. We are seeing the new 'new federalism' now, except that they will not talk about it. We watch minister after minister abdicate responsibility, and they seem to be doing it with some sense of pride. As a federal parliamentarian, I find it absolutely amazing that they can stand by and abdicate responsibility for national standards and values and for a national approach to their portfolio areas. How on earth can a federal minister for housing say, 'I don't want to have any say over what housing does in any community in Australia. I don't care if it destroys the fabric and I don't care about the impact. I don't care if there aren't buses or schools or child care where we are placing our public housing tenants. It's none of my business'? How can any federal minister do that and then say they are a federal parliamentarian? They should alI shift to the state parliaments and become state parliamentarians, because that is the approach they are taking. The fact is that the states never have had and never can have the capacity to see a national perspective, because they do not live and function and work in the national parliament. Where does this go from here? A one-year term and no say over impact: the only answer, of course, is down. What does that mean? I should perhaps point out one of the tragedies of this kind of thinking. I have heard those opposite over the past four years denigrate the building better cities program. I want to talk about that for a few moments, as a local member and certainly as an ex-representative of local government. ",49
151,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,NOES,"A lapsed member. The greatest difficulty, no doubt, is planning. Planning for local government is enormously difficult, with the complications of boundaries, transport and so many other things that they cannot control. We can look at the inner core of cities like Newcastle, which are old industrial cities. The changed usage of technology, of industry and of housing design and technology, and the doughnut effect that we see alI over Australia and alI over the world, are welI classified and welI understood, but were the state governments ever addressing the issue? No, they could not. It was just too complicated and too expensive. In the building better cities program in Newcastle, the Commonwealth has contributed something like $70 million towards a program which is absolutely innovative. It is not about being an alternative to the housing department. It is about demonstrating new ways of doing things and about testing new ideas. Unless somebody takes the time to test, the fact is that the development market will always be 10 or 20 years behind what is possible, because people build only those urban developments that they can make money on. That was told to us at almost every hearing we had in the parliamentary inquiry I referred to earlier. I can recall being told by developers in Brisbane that villa units and small units did not work, because they knew it. They had either six-packs or much higher rise buildings. They didn't have the in-between or lower level ones, because they said it was not profitable. Yet Adelaide says the opposite. The fact is that the values in those cities are very similar, but what came through very clearly was that the development industry was not in the business of taking risks at all. Unless the system was proven, they wouldn't try it. Who is going to develop housing? Who is going to push the boundaries? Who is going to find new ways to repopulate our cities? State governments find themselves incapable, and they normally have only one or two cities anyhow, so to them it is not a major problem. But, as a nation, we have cities all over Australia and to us it is-r should be-a major problem, and it was to us in government. It clearly is not one to those opposite. The new government is back into its old abdication role and is saying, 'None of our business!' You can walk through the constitution and you can walk around it-you can duck and weave all you like-but the fact is that, as federal parliamentarians, it is your business. You cannot volunteer to come to this place and be a member of the national parliament and then say, 'These issues don't concern me.' That is simply a cheap way out, and I would suggest that those who feel that way should go back to being council aldermen or state members. No-one should aspire to this place who does not see things from a national perspective. As I said, the Commonwealth is contributing $17 million towards the building better cities program in Newcastle. It has been a very difficult process because it has involved local government, state government and the Commonwealth government in a tripartite approach to rethink and refocus how we do things. It has involved the building industry, the development industry and the community to varying degrees of success. In the last six to nine months we have seen-and certainly in the next six to 12 months we will seesome quite dramatic changes coming through. If it were not for that program, I can assure you the inner part of Newcastle would have a much bleaker future than it has now. Any members present, especially those on the government side, who represent electorates that have urban decline and urban decay should either tell their minister to look at the building better cities program or go and look at it themselves. They should then tell their minister what they are doing and what is happening here because this government is now walking away from a role which has been established, which has been piloted and which is now being recognised and successful. The concept of the states independently running programs of this nature might sound fine in the sense that they can set benchmarks. We set national standards. We can do performance monitoring and audits. We can do all those things, but the fact is that has been the talk for 20 years. The Fraser government said the same kind of stuff. Let us look at nursing horries. They are licensed by the state governments. They have been licensed by the state governments for yonks, but it was not until we as the previous government made equality mandatory and sent out inspection teams from the Commonwealth that we started to sort out the internal problems. We begged, pleaded, urged and encouraged both the owners and the state governments to clean up their act. But it was not until we made it mandatory-in other words, they did not get funded unless they performed-that anything changed. We have the HACC program. We have benchmarks, we have standards, we have all these other things; but the fact is that the state governments do not enforce it, and I reinforce the fact that, unless the Commonwealth enforces it, it will not happen. The scope for variation between the states in picking up these standards and making them work, whether it be in health, aged residential services, home and community care, housing, homelessness or care for the young, is enormous. Why do we have all these services? Why the Commonwealth involved? As I said earlier in my speech, it is because the states were doing their jobs. When the community starts to understand this government's real agenda, that of abdication, there will be a massive outcry. The breach of faith involved in is being done today and being done bit by all over the legislative program will be enormous magnitude when it all comes expenditure together. The Prime Minister thinks he can slip, and weave his way through all this stuff by arguments. saying he is keeping his promises. People are not that stupid or gullible. They will realise that cutting public housing breaches a promlegislation; ise, especially when he is talking about protecting the most vulnerable. You are vulnerable when the rules on rental assistance are shifted. I had a phone call the other day from some people in a retirement village. absolutely terrified because the story is now very strong and very clear: rental assistance may well be wiped out or certainly changed for people in retirement villages. These people have locked up their incomes and their lives in a fixed pattern. They made decisions for now and until they die based on government policies and what was available. To say them, 'The rules are going to change but will protect the vulnerable,' is absolutely disgraceful. These people are not stupid. All the rhetoric in this chamber and the of numbers might sound great to that large exuberant backbench, but when it starts hapbecause pening up there people will say, 'Come on, we don't understand that kind of code. We know what you mean when services start to be chopped. You said you'd protect us. You said you would do what Labor was doing do it better, not the opposite.' Labor would never have done this. We were working with the states to get a truly national approach a truly cooperative approach, and that was sensible and practical and, what is more, was effective. It was getting very good reBill sults. Why change it? Who wants to change it? Whose idea is it? The states do not want oneintroduced year funding. The states are certainly happy is to go along with better cities, so whose idea is it to change it? Where is the saving? What not is the benefit? So far in the past month we have not seen one bit of public policy justified. We have seen ad hoc ideological issues coming forward out of nowhere. Not once what have we heard anybody say, 'This is what bit Australia needs. We need a public service of of so many thousand,' or, 'We need a housing of this amount,' or, 'We need a regime of this nature.' There has been none slide of that. We have heard conclusions with no All the arguments that were put forward by the previous speaker were not about the they were about private rental housing. The fact that Homeswest in Western Australia does not provide a weekend service for hot water, and I agree with the member that it should, is not what this is about. If this legislation is passed, we will have even less They were say over what it provides. The member for Stirling is complaining about what Homeswest is doing and how one of his staff members got a phone call about it on the weekend-I wonder where his state colleague was, incidentally-but when this bill goes through it will have even less relevance. He should be supporting us so we can to keep some say over the spending because we eventually we are accountable. The Commonwealth raises the revenue and, eventually, we are accountable. All the ducking and weaving, use the slipping and sliding about promises and constitutional responsibility does not wash if you collect the money and give it to the states you cannot abdicate responsibility for what impact it has and how it is spent. That is what sensible federalism is about. This is not federalism; it is competition and between states as to who can beggar thy neighbour. This government will be held accountable for its actions, not in the next few and months but eventually. (Time expired)  it pleased to speak on the Housing Assistance 1996. In particular, it gives me a sense of pride, being the member for Chifley, that we are actually talking about a measure originally by Prime Minister Chifley in 1945; that is, with the prospect of the Second World · IS34 War ending and there being a gross shortage of housing, the Commonwealth should play a role in trying to overcome the shortage of housing. Therefore, we have the Commonwealth-state housing agreement and we have this bill. One of the things I am pleased the government has retained is the proposition that the maximum amount of rent paid by a public housing tenant should be 25 per cent of income. I commend the government for it. I have spoken before in this House about a particular problem that occurs in my electorate, which, in fact, has the highest density of public housing of any electorate-so I am led to believe-in New South Wales. There is a requirement by some state housing departments, including my own state, that where children or other members of that household other than the prime tenants receive income that income is taken into account as far as the rent is concerned. I know the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who is sitting opposite, has a deep and abiding concern for families, but this really does put an exceptional strain on these families. In my household it is true that my children are now at the age where they can earn some money, but they are not compelled to pay for the rental of the house. I am not responsible for them paying towards the rental of the house. Where you have a public tenant or someone who is on Austudy or someone who has an apprenticeship or someone who is working in the work force, the parents assume a responsibility for the siblings actually paying rent, it puts a strain on families. I know that children have been forced out of the family home because of this. I ask the honourable parliamentary secretary, given the rhetoric on the other side about families and given that I know his genuine concern about families, how can it be that we stand in this parliament and be proud of an agreement that has the effect of busting up some families. I know there is an argument about capacity to pay and a fair return on assets. Whilst this may be very logical and economically rational, I think we ought to look at what some of its side effects are. So I would seek that the government try to address this particular issue. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are probably quite aware that 50 per cent of the money the Commonwealth spends in this area goes to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. My own state of New South Wales receives $257 million as a block grant, $18.5 million for pensioner housing, $17.8 million for Aboriginal housing, $23.4 million for community housing, $10.5 million for mortgage and rent relief, and $13.5 million for crisis accommodation. This makes a total of $341 million in a budget of over $1 billion. I think that is very important. Another point I want to note is that we are reducing the agreement from a three-year term-so that states are able to plan and budget and expend their money on a rolling basis over a three-year period-to 12 months. I think this is very unfortunate. Much of the public housing in my electorate is now 30 years old. I am really delighted that I was able to participate in a ceremony in Bidwill, where the state government made the announcement-using Commonwealth money-that it was planning to spend $2 million on upgrading and refurbishing the whole estate of Bidwill. I think that was really exciting news. In addition to that, there were already pre-existing proposals to try to revamp a very modest town square and to change the name from Bidwill to Bidwill Gardens. I might point out that Bidwill was named after John Carne Bidwill, one of the and early botanists at the Botanical Gardens, so it is singularly appropriate that not only should we wish to change the name to Bidwill Gardens but we should want to green it at the same time. We might even be able to experiment with community gardens at the same time. But, starting this year, the state government is spending $2 million on the basis of this Commonwealth-state housing agreement. What will be involved is planning. They will try to involve the community by getting community input and then they will come up with an agreed community plan to change the public housing stock in Bidwill. What this bill does, of course, is place great uncertainty on that whole process. I think that is a real tragedy. I would like to leave this debate knowing that the excitement of the people of Bidwill can be sustained, realistically knowing that not only will this money that will be spent on planning come to fruition but also the many extra millions of dollars will be spent on refurbishing Bidwill. Of course, Bidwill was but one suburb on a rolling list within my electorate: So I am very apprehensive about the change of government and the new government's policies in relation to the refurbishment of Bidwill. I also said something at that ceremony. I have to be very careful to source these ideas. They came from a book from America. I cannot recall the author, but there are some very exciting things being done in housing stock in America; that is, they allow the tenants to develop a cooperative where they can collect the rent. I would imagine the rental collection from a cooperative of tenants would overcome the current problem that state departments of housing have with the rent strike situation that occurs. Not only that, but they allow the same tenants to be involved in the minor repairs and upgrading that are inherent in any public housing estate. So you really do have a number of processes occurring. Firstly, you have an empowerment process where the tenants are actually in charge of their own destiny. They are making decisions about their own destiny and their own housing. Many of course are unemployed and getting employment through actually being involved in the repairing and maintenance of that housing stock. Secondly, you get a real strong community feel. Unfortunately, Bidwill, along with the other Mount Druitt suburbs-and I am not trying to score points here-was a legacy of the Askin government, where little thought was put into how to identify a suburb and give it some cohesion and sense of purpose. There is no physical demarcation between the suburbs, so you can actually drive from one to another. There are no trees and no creeks-none of that sort of planning. Quite frankly, some of the housing stock is absolutely appalling. There is this problem of a constant chum factor within my suburbs-and Bidwill, to that extent, is no exception-in that people are constantly moving in and, as soon as they have moved in, they try to get out and find a better location. Whilst not all the problems can be seated down to it, many of the problems are man-made. I say 'man made' because they were men at that timeand the result of human planning; and of course this redesign is an opportunity to rectify it. The other clause that is being taken out refers specifically to the use of housing as a tool in design, planning or management of cities and towns. I think it would be pretty awful if we did a piecemeal redevelopment of any of those suburbs like Bidwill, Whalan, Wilmont or Shalvey. The really exciting thing is that you can involve the whole community and grab their energy, enthusiasm and ideas and translate that into something that they want and see as desirable. But doing it on a piecemeal basis, I think, is the wrong way to go and I find it very difficult to understand why the government would want to pursue that particular issue and take it out. I know that they have always stated objections to the better cities program, although I cannot but comment favourably on the impact of that program in my own electorate. If that concept of better cities were used to even further enhance the public housing stock in my electorate, I would have to say that the people would be the great winners. You are denying yourself that opportunity and they will not understand why. In the Labor Party we sometimes get into debates about an issue on which we fight very vigorously, but we can come down on different sides of the debate; and therefore I want to concede the arguments of my opponents but tell you where I particularly stand on the issue of tenants being able to purchase their houses. Of course, in my state and, I believe, a lot of other states, in the past we had a history of encouraging, indeed subsidising, if you like, public tenants into ownership. It was really marvellous because often in a family you would see the first home owner emerge as a result of that process. Of course, when you put lots of people in a suburb-a public housing estate-you have problems. Places like Seven Hills and Lalor Park in the past have had those reputations. But those suburbs-not in my electorate, I might add-in particular were able to take advantage of moving tenants into become purchasers of their houses and it added a great deal of stability to those suburbs. I have the aspiration of better allowing public tenants to acquire their houses in my electorate. Again, I know that this defies rational economics and I sincerely apologise to all those in this of that belief. The argument that I want to refer to which right. is held by others is the importance of maintaining a stock of public housing and that you do as I suggest then you are actually effectively pushing public housing tenants further and further out of Sydney. As I have said, I have always conceded that argument. But wanting to meet the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people-in this case, renters public housing-in being able to purchase house and what that does to the individual, the family and the community that perhaps should override it. I do not argue for maintenance of the funding that is going to public housing; in fact, I argue for increase. In the 13 years that the Labor Party was in government, I think the number of people the waiting list has gone from something 126,000 to 232,000. You might say that that is a terrible record, but of people were satisfied within that period. A whole group of people were recognised for the first time, and that is young people, who were previously excluded from aspiring public housing. That is part, but not all, of reason for the increase. Surely, any governate ment which aspires to carry the mantle of concern for families would wish to reduce the list of people waiting to get into public housing. It would be remiss of me if I gratulate the New South Wales state government for changing a particular policy that of concern to some of the older constituents in my electorate. For very worthwhile reasons, New South Wales had adopted the practice mlxmg tenants. Flats that had once been exclusively for older people-senior citizens, pensioners-accommodated a variety of other people, often much younger. Theoretically, there were reasons for that being desirable and beneficial, but in practice it never worked in my electorate. In fact, some senior citizen tenants, constituents of mine, were terrorised. As I said, I congratulate the New South Wales Labor government for reversing that policy. Senior citizens in public housing will not now have that worry. In their remaining House years they can be proud of their homes and feel safe and secure in them. That is a basic Last, but not least, I want to point out that, if while we already have a significant waiting list, the ageing of our population means that the call on public housing for pensioners will increase rather than decrease. We often hear it said that our richest resource is people, particularly our young people, but there are so of many of us in the western suburbs that our a need for aged housing will increase dramatically over the years. Frankly, there is little is something provision for it now. I support the amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister, the honouran able member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). The government should not be embarrassed by the full support it has received for this bill. The on need for housing is there. If you are conlike cerned about families you cannot distance yourself from the need to house families right course a lot of across the range. As I mentioned, interesting things are happening in America. We should be piloting those sorts of projects, be it in the electorate to of my friend the honourable member for the Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), my own electoror someone else's electorate. Let's try some different things that empower tenants and families, allowing them to have a say in the way housing stock is managed and operated, liberating them and giving employment. did not conI support the amendment.",51
152,Mr ROBERT BROWN,NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker, it is always an honour to have the opportunity to follow my good friend and colleague the member for  The level of concern and compassion that he brings to questions of the kind encompassed by the Housing Assistance Bill 1996 reflects admirably on him and helps to explain why the electors of Chifley continue to support him so very strongly. I also want to congratulate the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). The honourable member had only just come into the parliament when we put her straight on the front bench. ",56
153,Mr ROBERT BROWN,NOES,"I endorse that comment. She is proving herself on the front bench and I am delighted to have the opportunity to support her proposed amendment to this bill. I appreciate the commitment and talent that she brings to her responsibilities, particularly in the area of housing. We have concerns about the direction taken by the new government-which, from its numbers in this chamber, was certainly given a very substantial mandate by the people on 2 March-although the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who is at the table, is known for his compassion and concern. As the government pursues what it refers to as the '$8 billion black hole', I it does not chop into programs where the most vulnerable people-the most vulnerable families-in the community are likely to be adversely affected. The so-called $8 million black hole has become almost an obsession with the government. The front-bench--even backbenchers when they are asking questions-continually refer to its existence. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as all members on this side of the chamber know, the claim is false and cynical, and we will be taking every opportunity to expose it. We have taken the opportunity already in the address-in-reply debate and the debate on the supply bills. Perhaps the people who on 2 March voted for and endorsed a change of government will, in more dispassionate moments, have the opportunity to make a clearer assessment. We will be examining the extent to which those people with whom we more closely identify are then going to be made the scapegoats for the economic rationalists on the other side. I would draw to their attention the fact that, while the government received 54 votes out of every 100 that were cast on 2 March, we received 46. We received 46 per cent of the vote and we received about 32 per cent of the seats. I am not complaining about that. That is the way the system operates. When you have a large number of marginal seats you can expect changes of that kind. The Labor Party needs a swing of less than four per cent to get back into government. If there is a swing to us of five per cent-and have a look at the results in some of those electorates in New South Wales over the last weekend-whenever that next election is held, whether it is an ordinary election or a double dissolution, we will come back into government with a majority of 16. Let us serve notice on the government now. If the government thinks it is going to find $8 billion by chopping into programs that put people into houses, that put kids into schools, that put people into hospital beds, that provide assistance and security for people in their retirement, it had better think again. If members opposite want to enjoy the lUXUry of sitting on those government benches, then hope they need to understand perfectly that they will need to act as a government for all Australians-as the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said before the election, for all of us. We still do not know where the emphasis was placed in that slogan. But as time proceeds we will find out. I want to emphasise that the first Commonwealth-state housing agreement was introduced in 1945 by the Chifley government. That is not unexpected. When you look for examples of social initiatives, social reforms and social programs, it is understandable, you will see, that programs of that kind would be introduced by Labor governments. I am pleased that there has been, to some extent at least, a bipartisan commitment to the continuation of those programs. It is important that that type of commitment continues. I was concerned, though, by some aspects of the second reading speech of the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). To a large extent I was concerned about the fact that the speech was more enlightening by what was not said than what was said. We know, for exampleand the shadow minister has adequately drawn attention to the fact-that, while we were prepared to make a three-year commitment to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, the present government has chosen to make a one-year commitment only. That is part of the subject of the amendment that the shadow minister moved at the second reading stage. In the second reading speech, the minister referred to a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement with the states and territories and said: . . . for the purpose of providing housing assistance so that people may achieve housing that is affordstructural able, secure and appropriate to their needs. I hope they are not just words. I hope it is guarantee to continue the commitment that the former Labor government made and the a result Whitlam government made before that, following on from its initial introduction the Chifley government. Mr Ruddock said that, through this bill, the government is demonstrating its commitment to the agreement as an instrument in guiding national housing policy. Then Mr Ruddock said that we want to signal clearly our mitment. I do not know whether a signal a commitment of this kind is sufficient. After this current annual commitment, we want to see a future commitment to putting people into adequate housing taken further. Then he said that the government is keen to implement longer term reforms. I do not want keenness on the part of the government. I want to see all that translated into effective genuine commitments to the necessary funding that is involved. The minister also referred to the need achieve greater improvements in the efficienprovided cy and effectiveness of government housing assistance. We have no argument with that. fact, to a very large extent, they were efforts made by the previous government sure that not only the effectiveness and efficiency of this particular program was adequate but also the whole approach of national government towards the question of housing was balanced, coordinated and integrated. In that context, I want to refer to an observation that was made by the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), who drew on information which was made available initially in the Australian newspaper at the beginning of last year. He said that the number of families on waiting lists for public housing grew from 126,000 in 1982 to 232,000 in 1993-94. That was in a Labor government period. I have just been talking about a commitment on the part of a Labor government to housing. People ask: how do you reconcile those two statements? One of the chief reasons for that increase was the fact that as a result of all of these changes that have taken place in Australian industry during those years there a were at the same time very significant social changes that took place. That was largely as of very deliberate policies on the part of the Hawke government in the first place by and then the Keating government to make the Australian economy a much more flexible, adaptable, competitive and efficient economy so that we could compete with the rest of the world. Unfortunately, as a result of deliberate comgovernment policies in restructuring the for economy and as a result of technological change that was taking place in Australia and throughout the world, we had high levels of structural unemployment. So what had started to appear was that in those areas of relatively high unemployment there tended to become a concentration of public sector housing. That is not necessarily good from the point of view programs and of social considerations. In order to ensure a more effective distribution of people who needed assistance to get to into houses, the Hawke-Keating governments greater assistance by way of rental assistance. That rental assistance increased In from $163 million in 1982-83 to $1.4 billion in 1994-95. That is an increase in real terms in making of almost 400 per cent. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of the member for the Northern Territory, but the he saw that figure and thought there was some significance in it. I think he should see that it needs to be balanced against that enormous increase in the assistance that was made available for rented accommodation for people. People do not like these terms being used, but this was so that we did not finish up with ghettos of public sector housing in areas of high unemployment. That is not socially desirable. When I use that expression I do so with goodwill, but people know exactly what I am talking about. There are enough problems for those people who are trying to survive without finding themselves in areas of depressed services that are often associated with community arrangements of that kind. So it has been possible for those families to be more effectively spread through the general community, and I applaud it-some of the great levellers in a community of the kind we live in. When we aspire towards what we call egalitarianism, equality, justice, fairness and just a reasonable fair go for people and there are significant disparities of abilities, incomes and wealth, we will provide people with at least a certain fundamental number of basic services and rights as human beings and families. One of those is the right to live in a decent home. If people cannot provide that for themselves for whatever reasons, because we live in a humane, hopefully, and civilised community there is a responsibility on all of the community collectively to make sure that everyone enjoys the opportunity to live in decent types of housing. The second basic right is that of everyone to send their kids to school and know that those children are going to get a reasonable level of education so that there will be opportunities for them to unleash whatever capacities they have and to achieve whatever optimum their own abilities may be able to lead them to. The third one is a job. On that last issue we have not performed too well-not only in Australia but also in all of those Western countries which have all adopted, to a large extent, similar types of programs and approaches to the problems that had to be addressed. But we have not performed too well. There are people who are so supportive of the type of mixed economy that we have, people who insist on what we have come to call economic rationalism, even if it is not very rational. I know that the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) prefers to call it economic fundamentalism, which I think is probably a more appropriate term. If this system that we operate in and try to manage is not capable of providing people with the opportunity to make their dignified contribution to the collective efforts of the community and to earn their income, then there is something wrong with that system. Let us be perfectly clear. If there is something wrong with that system, as there quite clearly is, then there must be better approaches. We might not have the capacity, the skill, the wit or the wisdom to identify what those better approaches are, but there must be some which will provide people with the right to employment. We would not have, for example, 10 per cent of our labour productive capacity being wasted every day because 10 per cent of the people who want to work are not working. That becomes an enormous cumulative volume of potential production and welfare, material well-being, that we sacrifice along the way. All we need to do is apply our talents and I am sure we will all be able to find a better way. The Labor government since 1983, the period of the Hawke and Keating governments, increased the public housing stock by over 137,000 units. By this year the total number of units was expected to reach 400,000. They are figures of great importance, not only in terms of public policy but also in terms of those families that have been and continue to be so dependent upon the public sector for their housing. Through the national government and through the state governments, which act to a large extent as the administrative arms for these programs, they are ultimately dependent upon their neighbours. That is what we talk about when we refer to collective responsibilities and collective efforts. In the last three years alone there have been well over half a million new dwelling commencements. Low income earners renting privately receive rent assistance now totalling, as I said, $1.5 billion. In the three years to June of this year another 158,000 people have been placed in public housing. It is important for us to keep in mind the social importance, the individual importance and the family importance for those people who have been dependent upon it. I referred earlier to the fact that the Labor government's approach to the question of housing had been an integrated and coordinated one. So it was not just throwing money in one direction. What they did was concentrate on a coordinated approach to questions of public housing, home purchase, private renters, housing and industry exports, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing, homelessness, women escaping domestic violence, new homes for young people and the replacement of old homes with new. All of those, as you know, came together into a coordinated whole which, to a very large extent, has been enormously successful in meeting the moral and the national responsibilities of a national government. We only hope that the new government will continue with those initiatives, will continue with the commitment and will maintain the level of funding so that those people who benefit most by it will have the opportunity to continue to share the benefits of this community with their neighbours.",57

155,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"Hunter) (8.00 p.m.)Once upon a time there were three little pigs. Each went out into the world to build itself a home. Before going on any further, I should give recognition to the author of this tale. My illustration is based on a well-known children's story whose origins lie in a folk tale which was collected by J.O. Halliwell in 1853 and printed in Jacobs Book of English Fairytales in London in 1890. I believe it is important to recognise authorship, unlike at least one member of the government. The first little pig was a paid-up member of the Liberal Party. He decided without any real thought to build his home out of straw.",60

157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I think the honourable member is referring to a concept of housing. With the three pigs, if I remember rightly, there were three different forms of housing. There is no point of order.",60
158,Mr CADMAN,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a further point of order, I did not know that this parliament dealt with fairy tales. I thought we dealt with the substance of the government and the good management of this nation.",60
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,There is no point of order.,60
160,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"Since time immemorial fairy tales and other such stories have been used as an effective tool to illustrate one's point. I will start my last paragraph again. The first little pig was a paid-up member of the Liberal Party. He decided, without any real thought, to build his home out of straw. If it was good enough for his grandfather, it was good enough for him. The second pig was a member of the National Party. She put a little more thought into her dwelling-she used sticks. The third little pig was a paid-up member of the Australian Labor Party. He was a smart pig.· Indeed, he later went on to become a movie star. He was, of course, a paid-up member of both the Australian Workers Union and the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance. 8.00 p.m. The third little pig saw the folly of his brother's and his sister's approaches to housing, planning and construction. Both had built their homes, he believed, of substandard material and had given little thought to the location of their dwellings. His elder brother had put his straw house on a built-up swamp some distance out of town and was having difficulty getting to and from work, not to mention the problems with rising damp. His sister built in a subdivision far away from her friends and her family and she was missing the regular contact with both. The local childcare facility was unable to take her kids because of the recent large influx of people into the area. The third little pig quite wisely decided not to repeat the mistakes of his brother and his sister. He thought about the future and chose a vacant block in a proposed urban renewal area close to the train station and only two bus stops from his parents' home. He decided he did not need a big house to himself and chose to erect a brick duplex on his block. He knew that one day he would probably have a family and might decide to move to another part of town. But, for the moment, he believed, a duplex seemed the logical choice. He designed his duplex with a package of environmentally conscious energy saving features. He positioned it well on the block to maximise temperature control. He strategically placed windows and eaves to capture natural air flows and light. He used good soundproofing and he used landscaping to ensure privacy from his neighbours. This little pig did not have to endure the ravages of the wolf, because he had planned and used good design principles to build his home. This may be an adaption of a children's story, but the lessons for this government are salient. The moral to this story is that one must think ahead. In other words, one must plan. The former government's bill has been gutted by the removal from this bill of the subsequent year's funding commitment and the removal of its planning component. The pillars which hold up the Commonwealthstate housing agreement have been removed. Public housing is not just about shelter. It is not just about bricks and mortar. As our third little pig realised, it is also about things like jobs and educational opportunities; it is really about a sense of belonging to your community. Public housing is not something that can be left to market forces to determine. People invest a large portion of their lives in their homes and in their communities. As my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) pointed out in her most effective speech on this subject in the second reading debate, it is often unfair to ask people to uproot and move away from the town they have lived in all of their lives, even if employment opportunities in that area may be scarce. I agree that these areas should be renewed, not abandoned. This is very relevant to towns in rural and regional Australia which have lost traditional industries. We need to plan and broaden the economic base of these areas. I equate these areas with my home town of Cessnock. The local government area spans some 2,000 square kilometres, yet its population numbers only about 46,000. Within the local government area exist 23 separate villages. Those villages exist for one reason alone: they were established to support the local coalmine in the area. The villages remain, but the mines have moved on. The Cessnock local government area receives about one million visitors a year to its vineyard area, but people visiting the vineyard area have to travel through the town proper. It is a little sad for me to say that the town is not necessarily a pretty site. It is struggling, like many other rural and regional communities. Along with the wonderful work being done in the Honeysuckle project in Newcastle, much can be done under these types of funding arrangements to help declining towns like Cessnock in my electorate. Along with the city, country areas need well planned and designed housing. Because of transport and access issues, the need is even more acute in rural and regional Australia. When planning our towns and cities and their public housing requirements, we must be sensitive to changing needs. As identified in the 1994 housing assistance annual report, the major challenge we face in the next century is responding to the changing demand for housing and the nature of housing supply. That report identified pressures arising from the growing numbers of older people, sole parents, later marriages and smaller families. The former Labor government's response to the ever-changing needs of society leaves it with an excellent track record in this very important area of social policy. Unlike our conservative opponents, we believe that government has a real and important role to play in ensuring social equality. Under the stewardship of the former Labor minister, Brian Howe, we have witnessed real improvements in housing standards, housing design and the affordability and availability of housing in Australia. It is most important that this work is recorded in history as the work of Brian Howe and the work of the Australian Labor Party. As outlined in its explanatory memorandum, this bill authorises financial assistance by the Commonwealth to the states and territories. It allows for the provision of housing assistance. The objective is to ensure that people can obtain housing that is affordable, secure and appropriate to their needs. Accordingly, the bill aims to provide people on low incomes with home ownership assistance or affordable and appropriate rental housing. It dictates the accommodation should be of adequate size, acceptable amenity and should be strategically located. The bill specifies that these aims will be achieved by, firstly, identifying needs for housing; secondly, providing or arranging for the provision of housing assistance; thirdly, giving the assistance in ways that are effective; fourthly, encouraging the provision of different kinds of housing assistance; and, fifthly, ensuring that the rights of people receiving housing assistance are properly protected and due regard is had for their rights and responsibilities. It is good to see that the coalition is not entirely jettisoning all of Brian Howe's good work. The bill authorises the funding of the Commonwealth-State housing agreement. In other words, it authorises the Commonwealth to provide assistance to the states and territories in the area of housing assistance. But it is not just a handout; it is about entering into a partnership with the states in order to provide decent and affordable housing to all Australians. It is about ensuring that the great Australian dream-the dream of home ownership-is a possibility for people on low incomes as well as those well-to-do. Even more importantly, it is about ensuring the availability and affordability of appropriate rental housing. This bill is almost identical to the former Labor government's bill which intended that housing assistance should be directed towards people who are on low incomes or otherwise face barriers in obtaining the housing they need. It is not what the bill does but what it does not do that is of concern to me. The new government has bastardised the former government's bill in two ways. Firstly, the bill provides funding for the 1996-97 financial year only and, secondly, the states' ability to use funds provided under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement for the design, planning and management of cities and towns has been removed. Let me tum to the first point. By committing itself to the funding of the agreement for one year only, the government has destroyed the true essence of the scheme. It is not that holding up its end of the partnership. How can the states be expected to properly plan in such an important area without guaranteed funding continuity? How can the states enter into contractual arrangements if they are not fully informed of the terms? Let me quote from the second reading speech of the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). He says: Funding for subsequent years will be determined as part of the Commonwealth budgetary process ... We have been hearing that ad nauseam during question time. Ms Macklin-It's code.",60
161,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"It's code for, 'It will be cut.' To continue: . . . and in light of progress in implementing longer term reforms . . . Again, code for, 'It will be cut.' This is the best part: ... and the report of the National Commission of Audit. I suggest that the second part of the minister's quote appears to be a softener for later cuts in Commonwealth housing assistance. 'Sorry,' they will tell the states, 'you've failed to commit yourselves to our long-term reforms and the auditors say we need to save the money.' I wonder how that excuse will go down with the people in my electorate on the public housing waiting list. I think this quote may also reflect the coalition's desire to get out of housing and lump it back upon the states. The Liberal Party is and has always been a states rights party. The partnership between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories is crucial to the success of the aims of this bill. As in all successful partnerships, there has to be a level of trust and understanding. The previous government fostered this trust and as a result was able to develop excellent public housing programs. The former government has provided the broad policy direction and funding, while the states have effectively undertaken the task of implementing the objectives of the program. Let me now tum to the second point. The ability to use funds provided under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement for the design, planning and management of cities has been removed from the bill. This is probably the bill's most crucial fall. The key to providing decent standards of living lies the creation of opportunities. In Australia, these opportunities should be provided to people within their own local communities. If opportunities are not provided to people within or near their existing communities, they will simply miss out. The people we are attempting to assist with the measures taken in this bill cannot afford to be uprooted or to uproot their families and move on; nor should they have to. They are worthy of special consideration. These local opportunities can be created only through long-tenn planning and social infrastructure development. The words 'design', 'planning' and 'management' roll easily off the tongue. I would like to address each of them individually, as they should form an integral part of any housing assistance strategy. The first is design, which is one of the great problems with housing in this country. Poor design results in poor aesthetics, environmental degradation, poor amenity, conflict between neighbours resulting from a lack of privacy, poor access and poor security. On the other hand, good design can not only create comfortable, appropriate and environmentally friendly living but also gain for us as a nation recognition on the world stage. Adequate design funding and the use of new technologies should be the charter for public housing assistance. Public housing should be the frontrunner in Australian design excellence. It is an area in which no compromise is acceptable. We should be striving to provide the best public housing in the world and then marketing and exporting our designs as construction technologies to other countries around the globe. The second area to which I wish to refer is planning. How many towns around Australia are hamstrung as a result of a complete lack of planning? By removing this important facet of the bill, we are adopting a bandaid solution to housing. Without adequate, long-range planning we risk undoing much of the excellent refonn that has been done. Urban and rural development requires a totally integrated approach from federal, state and local governments. Public housing is an in integral part of urban development. What we cannot afford is the 'hand it back to the states and let them worry about it' attitude espoused by the coalition. We have all seen the damage which flows from the housing commission area stigma. This is the result of poor planning and one that should never be repeated in Australian urban planning. It worries me that the removal of planning as a responsibility of this bill will result in the return of outdated planning practices in the area of public housing. Effective and sometimes radical housing refonn requires consultation, and time must be allowed to put the correct models in place. The immensity of investment calls for careful consideration. The public housing we provide needs to enhance the landscape and fulfil the ever-changing needs of its recipients. The third area is management. The management of these processes is crucial to their success. We must ensure excellence in delivery of housing assistance. People in receipt of housing assistance should not be treated any differently from their privately housed counterparts. The other facet of management is the need for cooperation to properly manage the services in our cities and our towns. We must foster cooperation between the three levels of government to ensure the most effective use of the limited funds available to us. This bill does not encourage that partnership or the integrated approach. The concept of integrated local area planning is obviously lost on the parliamentary Liberal Party, whose approach to all areas of policy reflects the strong influence of the individual states and the wider party structure. In the Hunter region, and including local governments in my own area, the regional organisation of councils, Hunter ROC, is presently developing a working model for integrated local area planning. The aim of the project is to create a working example of the benefits of a fully integrated approach to planning. The project takes into consideration population trends, employment opportunities, land use issues, transport and access needs, individual requirements and projected public housing needs. I warn the government that I will be fighting for its support on these important projects. If the government ignores these vital amendments it will undo all the good work previously done. We indeed have much to learn from the third little pig, and I warn them to be aware of the wolf in the member for Bennelong's clothing. (Time expired) (Quorum formed)",62
162,Mr ADAMS,NOES,"I am pleased so many members of the other side have come into hear me speak about housing, because housing is a crucial factor in people's lives. Having shelter is of vital importance, and I wish to support the opposition's amendment that funds for the Commonwealth-state housing agreement be appropriated for three years rather than one, that the funds in each of these three years be distributed on the same basis as the last agreement and that the agreement explicitly allow the CSHA funds to be used with regard to design, planning and management of cities and towns. A year is just not enough time to get a package like this to work. . The bill is not unlike the one that we were working on last year. In fact, much of the Labor platform on housing has been mentioned in the bill's second reading speech. by only giving it a year it becomes an interim measure. Until when? Is it going to be thrown out the window this time next year? How can anyone plan with this sort of scenario? When people tamper with housing they tamper with one of the essentials in life, and that is shelter. Without accessible, affordable and secure housing, other things such as jobs, proper meals, health and cleanliness become an impossibility. The prospect of gaining quality in one's life becomes bleak. The last government recognised that changes needed to be made to the philosophy of public housing. The original dream of public housing for all was not achievable or desirable for many people. It is seen now as welfare housing, and there has never been an adequate supply of public housing. Now the needy are prioritised according to greatest need and there is no avenue for the more well-off to help subsidise those with less-as is the case in other models and older models of public housing. This makes public housing as such in Australia an absurd concept and one that is guaranteed to put a stigma on the housing and the people within it. In Tasmania, in the middle of the 1970s, 5,000 families were on the list for public housing. In the middle of the 1990s, they are still there. Remember that Tasmania's population does not grow and we have gone backwards a bit over that time. It was also the time when I was living in a public housing estate, now in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick. The 5,000 families in 1970 and the 5,000 families in 1990 are probably different people, but it is the same need and there is just not the housing to cope with it; nor will there be unless public and private housing can be made more accessible. There is a move to subsidise the tenants rather than housing. In Tasmania, unless we get reform to our tenancy laws, there will be a disaster. It will lock those on low incomes into a round of housing that is old, undermaintained and decrepit, yet the rents will be at the higher margin of the subsidy. In England, where similar arrangements are in place, there is an underground market of slum properties, as tenants which are eligible for the subsidy and looking for housing are identified But as being in a low income bracket. Those properties are then put forward but with upper market rents-rents at the top end. This situation works both ways. If landlords do not have some form of insurance to ensure that their investment is secure, then they will not bother to invest in decent or clean housing. Tenants will be stuck with insecurity, evictions and discrimination because they are on a benefit and have little hope of getting out of the trap they are in. There has been a bit of publicity lately-I think it was in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, so you would be aware of it-in relation to two public houses that were so called trashed. The press put the blame on the tenants, implying that they were ungrateful wretches for not appreciating and looking after public housing. It is hard to imagine what some of those people actually go through in some of those housing areas or go through to get housing. It is often those people who have no access to housing of any sort who cause the problem for public housing tenants. Some may have been denied housing, some may have been evicted or some may not qualify because they did not have enough points in the system due to the fact that they are not in extreme poverty or in danger of domestic violence. Maybe they had become disillusioned with life in some other way. They can sometimes threaten and frighten other tenants because the tenant has a house and they do not have access to one. They have nothing to lose. They do not understand that they are depriving people of housing. If they have never had a secure house themselves, how are they supposed to know what being responsible is all about? A house is often trashed because it is vacant, the tenants have fled, and it is a shortwith term squat for the dispossessed until it is finally trashed. This happens because there is insufficient suitable housing available. There needs to be more housing. There needs to be a quicker turnaround in the existing housing to help lessen the time vandals have to trash a house. Under the CSHA we must look at the cost of not housing people. There is a cost when you do not house people, when you do not give them the shelter they need. There is a link between the lack of affordable housing and homelessness. The impact of poor housing on the health and educational opportunities of individuals is great. There are economic costs and there are great social costs. Already we have heard of some of the costs to the community such as the trashed houses, as I mentioned. Other costs include family breakdowns, physical and mental health problems, the interruption of formal education and disruption in schools, unemployment, social isolation, violence and criminal activities. Some of the new arrangements, where the states are using the community and charitable sector to carry out some of the welfare work, are becoming more and more difficult to administer, mainly because the money is not given to assist in administration costs. Departments carry the administration costs through many means. There are fewer resources available to the community sector. Each cut to funding has restricted them even further. Any agreement must resource properly those who are administering any moneys of government. It is no good starting up a program one year, as this bill will do, and maybe defunding it the next. Whole groups of people who may have been helped for the first time face being abandoned again next year. Such a group is the elderly and frail poor. Either through adversity or family disaster, people are living in boarding houses, in hostels or on the streets. They are either being preyed upon by unscrupulous carers or being tossed out of rooming and boarding houses because there are no funds to support them. The charities are overloaded and cannot cope some of these additions without funding. So these people are left to live on the street or at the mercy of exploiters. The CSHA helps towards the administration of other government programs such as assistance for care and housing for the aged, which copes with another housing angle. It was a good program and was actually helping people-some for the very first time. Now, I understand, it may be cut too. I think the debate has to go on about public housing, because there is a need for public housing. There are many alternative forms of tenure to private housing, and some of my colleagues have mentioned those in this debate tonight. There is community housing, cooperatives or tenant associations, but there is no real alternative to public housing. Subsidies can help some sectors, but if the housing is not there in the first place how will funds ultimately help? They cannot. The CSHA is a way the Commonwealth can keep an eye across the states to ensure that the funds for housing are spent on that and in that way. We need to ensure that there is an overall direction on how to make the most of the funds available. We all know of states not using any initiative and not coming up with any of the ideas in the past, and it has always been the Commonwealth money that has taken us down a new direction. The building better cities program is one of those in which we have been able to look at alternative housing in different ways. Of course, in the Launceston area in Tasmania the building better cities program has been one which we hope will assist in that way. I think the one in the south near your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, which was on the drawing board, has probably already been lostMr Ruddock-I bet there isn't much in yours.",64
163,Mr ADAMS,NOES,"No, there are not a lot in mine, but there is some public housing. There are housing needs in my electorate, but most of the homeless kids in my electorate end up in Launceston or in Hobart. There are people in need of public housing right throughout my electorate, and there is public housing in some of the smaller towns. Tasmania has had a lot of public housing over many years to assist workers who have come to particular sites to take up employment. There are a lot of new ideas in housing, and they need to be piloted and mentored. Ultimately it will save money, but the Commonwealth has the responsibility to ensure that states trial and pilot new ideas. Keeping the Commonwealth-state housing agreement intact and workable over the three years is the only way we can help states overcome their housing and other related social problems, because housing is related so much to so many other issues in our community. Shelter is so important to people. Without it, they can be lost. I believe we need to maintain three-year funding agreements with the states in order to continue to have some influence over the states to look at those new ideas and to help promote new ideas in housing. I understand there are different people taking up this challenge around the world. They are writing academically and looking at ways to house people by using different models and different concepts. We need to be involved in that, we need to be on the edge of that and we need to have a national government which is helping initiate those ideas. That can come only from this parliament, from a minister going into bat, winning the battle within the cabinet, then pursuing his act and the funding that is coming from within the states and making sure that those seven different areas out there will achieve a result. Of course, what we are hearing at the moment from the present minister and the present government is that we are going to give it back to the states and the states are going to look after it. So there will not be any more initiatives or ideas. 'It will not be my problem'-they are giving it away in that sense. I believe that will take us backwards. I do not see us going forward in housing policy with that approach. In Tasmania, housing was put in the Department of Community Services and Health some years ago and housing policy seems to have been lost totally. Articles on housing or housing policy or debates in the Tasmanian parliament about housing are few and far between. We need new ideas, we need to continue to look for those ideas and we need a government which can keep some light on those states to keep them looking for those new ideas. I support the amendment. I believe that it will certainly add greatly to the bill. I believe the that members would do well to give the amendment support when it comes before them. It is very interesting in this debate that only one or two members from that side of the House have spoken on this housing bill. I do not think many people on that side of the house have had to worry very much about their housing or their shelter. Mr Nairn-Don't bet. Mr Ruddock-That isn't the case.",66
164,Mr ADAMS,NOES,"If that isn't the case, I accept that. Mr Marek-How can you make that statement?",66
165,Mr ADAMS,NOES,"I make the statement because there are only two speakers, I believe, on that side of the House. Mr Ruddock-That doesn't prove anything.",67
166,Mr ADAMS,NOES,"It says to me that people on that side of the House do not have a commitment to or a feeling for people who have faced housing difficulties. I believe they do not understand the importance of shelter to people. Having this bill that only funds the agreement for one year is a prime example of that, because it means when you get through the cuts you are going to give it back to the states and you are going to cut the funding. Mr Ruddock-You are making assumptions again.",67
167,Mr ADAMS,NOES,"I am making assumptions. Are you going to get up and refute them? I look forward to the minister's comments in refuting my assertions when he stands to his feet to close the debate. As I said, I believe members on that side of the House have always been able to take for granted shelter of some quality. Therefore, that is probably why they have not spoken very much on this bill. They do not have a feeling for or an understanding of the level of difficulties that some people experience in not having good affordable accommodation. I support the amendment before the House. (Time expired)",67
168,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"In concluding this debate on the Housing Assistance Bill 1996, I thank all honourable members for their contributionswhich is the usual courtesy-but note that some of their remarks show that they do not seem to realise that there has been an election, that they lost and that there is a new government. The honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) implicitly put the proposition that we should have accepted a bill proposed by the former government without giving any considered attention to the arrangements to be concluded between the Commonwealth and the states in the light of our policies, priorities and commitments. The purpose of the bill is to ensure that a period of 12 months there is an ongoing commitment of the funds to be specifically appropriated for this purpose. There is a capacity for the government to come to some decisions in the light of whatever consideration it gives to the matters that have been raised in those deliberations with the states. Ms Macklin-The states don't like it.",67
169,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"I think the states are keen to see this bill go through as quickly as possible, to see the funds appropriated, and to be involved in the necessary dialogue. I will inform my colleague the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) of the remarks made by the honourable member for Jagajaga, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the honourable member for Chifley  ton (Mr Robert Brown), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) and invite her to take up, where appropriate, some of their suggestions. In the context of such a wide-ranging debate, many of the matters raised went beyond the ambit of the bill even where they related specifically to housing. I noticed that the honourable member for Stirling raised the matter of rent assistance, the way it might be applied and whether there could be arrangements to ensure that landlords are able toMr Fitzgibbon-That is relevant.",67
170,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"I am glad the honourable member suggests that. I will let the Minister for Social Security know that if she is considering the proposal made by the honourable member for Stirling she might have support from the honourable member for Hunter. If she thinks it is a matter that can be pressedensuring that landlords' interests are protected in relation to rent assistance payments-she would like to know that there is support from the other side of the House. The honourable member for Jagajaga has proposed amending the bill so that agreements entered into under the proposed measure will operate for up to three years from 1 July, involve Commonwealth funding of for $1,067,863,000 in each of those three years to be distributed on the same approximately per capita basis as existing Commonwealthstate housing funds are applied, allow those funds to be used where appropriate for the design, planning and management of cities and towns. It is our view that the first point is a misinterpretation of the government's intention with this proposal. As I noted in my second reading speech, the interim agreement, to apply from 1 July 1996, will operate for up to three years and will form the basis for implementing longer term directions. The government appreciates that the states would like greater certainty for later years. Unfortunately, in light of the budgetary task ahead of this government, it is not possible to give such an assurance at this time. Whereas the agreement is negotiated with a capacity to deal with matters for up to three years, you must understand that the funding levels will be looked at in the context of the budgetary task ahead of us. The fact that the government has committed itself in advance to an audit commission report to maintain that funding for 1997 demonstrates its commitment to a continual partnership with the states for the provision of Gambaro, T. housing assistance. I am sure the honourable member is aware that the proposal to explicitly allow Commonwealth-state housing agreement funds to be used with regard to design, planning and management of cities and towns is unnecessary and will not of itself achieve anything. Lack of such wording does not mean that the funds cannot be used for such purposes, nor does it represent a lack of interest on the part of this government in the role of local government in such areas. The government's election policy states that the Liberal and National government will develop and improve community awareness of urban and regional design issues and opportunities in association with state govern- Somlyay, A. M. ments and representatives of local government and industry and work with the states, territorTaylor, W. L. ies and local government, together with the various interested professional organisations, to advance and assess the results of the urban and regional design for Australian communities. Again, I thank honourable members, on behalf of Senator Newman, for their contributions to this debate. I foreshadow that we will not be acceding to the amendment now or the later amendment that will seek to make and explicitly alterations to the bill.

I would like to see this text reinserted into the preamble of the bill. It was in the bill that was presented to this House last year. As many people in this House have already indicated, it is a very important part of the legislation, because it is incumbent on us to take notice of the areas in which we put housing in place so that services, employment, and NOES all the other things that make up quality of life can be thought about and planned. I am sure that some members of the government must be aware of problems that have arisen all around Australia when public housing investment has occurred without good planning. There are many examples in Melbourne that I am very familiar with. We have in my own electorate of Jagajaga the Olympic Village. One of the major problems there has been long-term decay. I am very keen to see that area redeveloped in the context of the whole of the suburb so that we think about employment, education, and the opportunities that are available to people. For the life of me, I cannot understand why you want to take out this part of the preamble. It is absolutely critical that $1 billion PAIRS of Commonwealth funds for public housing is invested in the best interests of cities and towns. We do not want to see large housing estates on the fringes of our cities or in regional towns where there are no employment opportunities. That is absolutely contrary to the best interests of people who live in public housing. It seems to me that it is yet again part of this government's attitude to better cities. It is not something that this government will take seriously. Once again, it will just try to hand this responsibility over to the states and local government and, of course, pay no regard to the environment in which tenants in public housing live. We on this side of the House are very committed to thinking about those issues, making sure that investment takes place that improves the quality of life of people in public housing, ensures that public housing is located close to employment and gives people the opportunities that they deserve. I commend the amendment to the House.",69

AIRPORTS BILL 1996 Cognate bill: AIRPORTS (TRANSITIONAL) BILL Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 May, on motion by Mr Sharp: That the bill be now read a second time.",70
174,Mr TANNER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"Melbourne) (9.25 p.m.)The opposition does not intend to oppose the cognate airports bills at this stage but does reserve its position for the future, depending on developments that occur with respect to the current controversy relating to the proposed second airport for Sydney to be constructed at Holsworthy. The legislation that has been introduced by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is in large part the same as legislation introduced by the former Keating government, but there are some significant differences and, of course, the circumstances which provide the backdrop to the legislation are, as I adverted to, different as well. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that: (1) no sales should occur until all Environmental Impact Statement processes are completed and the future of Sydney West Airport is resolved; (2) in order to ensure that the Commonwealth achieves the maximum lease payments possible as a result of the processes set out in the Airports Bill and the Airports tional) Bill, Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport should be included in the first tranche of airports outlined in the Minister for Finance's second reading speech for the Airports (Transitional) Bill, rather than be offered for leasehold sale at some later time; and (3) the road and other infrastructure developments associated with the Badgerys Creek proposal should proceed where appropriate, regardless of whether Sydney West Airport is built at Badgerys Creek"". I would like to make a number of points which relate to the provisions of this amendment. Firstly, the failure of the government to propose an approach to airport lease sales which involves selling Sydney airport in the first stage of the lease sale process will 1996 actually devalue the proceeds to the taxpayer as a result of the sale process. The Liberal and National parties blocked the sale process in the Senate last year, and it was subsequently estimated by BZW Australia that this would cost the taxpayer roughly $200 million in lost revenue from the sales process, because of the fact that Sydney was going to be removed from the initial sales and kept until last in the sale process. I would concede that the absence of the cross-ownership rules-which I will deal with at the consideration in detail stage and which were in our legislation but are not in the legislation before the House now-does reduce the impact in this regard, but still there is a significant problem with legislation for the sale of airport leases that provides for Sydney being held back. Selling the biggest and most substantial of the airports first would set a price in the market. It is clearly in the interests of anybody who is a seller in the market-in this case, the government and the taxpayer are-to set the highest price in that market, and that would necessitate selling Sydney in the first stage. It is possible that bidders for airports may hold back bids in the first tranche because they are more interested in holding Sydney rather than one of the other airports, or that they may put in lower bids or no bids at all. Alternatively-and both of these effects could occur-some bidders may face an invidious (Transichoice. They may want to own one airport lease, and they may want one of the top three or four, so they face a choice. Do they wait for Sydney, knowing that there is a risk that they may not get it; or do they potentially take what may be, in their terms, second best and bid for one of the cheaper ones, knowing that if they succeed in getting one of the cheaper airports-I am using the term 'cheaper' advisedly, of course-they will not have enough money remaining to be able to afford to bid effectively for Sydney? There are quite a lot of distortions imported into the market as a result of the decision to not sell Sydney up-front and to leave it towards the end-something which is not part of the legislation but which has effectively been indicated by the government and, because of the confusion now surrounding the future of Sydney West airport, something which is clearly unavoidable in the short term. In opposition, as I mentioned, the coalition delayed the sale of airport leases, purportedly in order to await the resolution of problems at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. It is interesting to compare the circumstances then with the circumstances now, because we have issues not yet resolved with respect to Kingsford Smith. Airservices Australia is in the process of doing a study with respect to flight paths, and is taking submissions. There is no proper community consultation, I might add. There are no community representatives on the committee that is involved with conducting the study, but that is not expected to be resolved until the end of this year. Recent changes that have been made with respect to flight paths, the reopening of the east-west runway and the like are too recent for any serious conclusions to be drawn about the impact of those changes. After some period of time obviously some conclusions could be drawn, but so far they are very recent and it is difficult to assess their impact at this point. Secondly, the real solution to the problems of Kingsford Smith airport-namely, the construction of a second airport for Sydneyhas now been put off due to some considerable confusion as a result of the proposal to conduct parallel EISs with respect to Holsworthy as well as Badgerys Creek. When we were in government, the coalition was saying, 'Sorry, we can't sell the airport leases because KSA's problems are not resolved.' Now we are in a situation where things are even more blurry and more confused with respect to the solution to KSA's problems and it is saying, 'We now want to sell the airport leases.' It is remarkable what a switch from opposition to government will do. When we were in government there was no valid reason for delaying the sale process because the government's policy with respect to both Kingsford Smith airport and the second airport for Sydney was clear. It was straightforward and it was being acted upon. Now it is confused. Now we do not know where the second airport for Sydney will be or, indeed, if there will be one at all. We should be delaying the sale of all airport leases, particularly Sydney's, until the EIS processes with respect to Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy are complete, until the government has made a decision as to which of these two, if any, it wants to make the site for Sydney's second airport and until the details of that airport-lengths of runways, curfews, sites of runways and various other issues-are determined. That would enable the government to sell the Sydney airport lease as part of the first tranche and, therefore, effectively set the market and remove the distortions in the market that I referred to. It would also leave much more certainty in the process wiih respect to the consideration of residents' concerns in the localities that are affected. If the Minister for Transport and Regional Development is to be believed, all the EIS processes and the like will happen in this forthcoming financial year. Apparently the EIS processes will be finished by the end of this year. Maybe there is not a problem, if he is to be believed. But as they say in the as: 'I'd like to see that.' On 28 September last year when the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the opposition leader, he said on the World Today with respect to the coalition's blocking of the former Keating government's airport lease sale legislation: ... Ralph Willis has said the fact that you defer the sale of something for a few months doesn't represent any fundamental undermining of the budgetary position. So all this talk about economic vandalism is just hyperbole. Why can the current government, the Howard government, not defer its decisions, its actions, with respect to selling the airport leases for a period of time in order to allow the EIS processes to be completed, in order to allow the Sydney West airport controversy to be resolved and decisions made? It could then allow the sale of Sydney airport to be at the front end of the process and not at the rear. A delay would also allow us to clarify the situation with respect to Badgerys Creek, in particular some of the infrastructure proposals that are part of that proposed second airport for Sydney. I refer specifically to some of the road proposals which have enormous spin-off benefits for western Sydney above and beyond their relevance to the airport proposal. I would suggest, as does my second reading amendment, that these proposals should proceed in any event irrespective of the airport. I refer to such developments as the western Sydney orbital and upgrading Elizabeth Drive. Economic modelling conducted for the former government indicated that the orbital road would cut transport costs for the community upwards of $870 million per annum and it would stimulate roughly $1.2 billion worth of extra economic activity for the western Sydney region. Clearly, some of the features of the Badgerys Creek proposal should be considered as stand-alone items that should be financed and assisted by both federal and state governments. Some delay in the airport leasehold sale process would enable these issues to be dealt with properly. Finally, some form of delay would give us the opportunity to get to the bottom of this mystery about the Holsworthy proposal, the Holsworthy scam. We are gradually getting bits and pieces of the story. Bit by bit it is being dribbled out through question time and through statements in the media. Most of them are unintentional but bit by bit we are starting to piece the jigsaw together. There is something called the Lawrence Hargrave project, and the people who represent that project had a meeting with various Liberal luminaries. It could have been in October 1994. Perhaps it was in July 1995. Perhaps there were two meetings. It is all a bit unclear. According to the Prime Minister, in October 1994 he attended a meeting with representatives of the Lawrence Hargrave project. He, as the shadow minister for industrial relations, did not actually tell us why he was attending such a meeting at the time. That is a bit hard to understand, but maybe he had some sort of vision. Maybe he is a clairvoyant and he knew that he was going to be the opposition leader shortly after that and Prime Minister shortly after that and, therefore, he had better come along. At this meeting-whenever it occurred-we had the opposition leader or the industrial relations shadow minister, depending on when the time was; the shadow minister for transport; the shadow aviation minister; the shadow defence minister; and a number of other prominent Liberals who are yet to identify themselves. Their diaries must have been pretty clear. This was just a routine meetingnothing special, nothing particularly important. It seems that they were just all available at the same time for just one of these hundreds of meetings putting forward different propositions about airports. We get them all the time, yet they had all of these key shadow ministers there. It is pretty surprising stuff really. They did not tell anybody about it. Their excuse now is that it was all commercial-inconfidence, which seems a rather peculiar way to describe a meeting that was just another meeting out of hundreds of meetings. They could not even tell anybody that they actually met with some people and talked about the possibility of having Sydney's second airport, a major project, at Holsworthy. They could not tell anybody about that. As the former Minister for Transport and honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) explained today, when he was approached by these people there was no suggestion put to him that anything they might say to him would be commercial-inconfidence. He was not requested to keep all of this a secret and, quite clearly, he did not. If confidentiality was required, then logically there must have been some prospect of what was being proposed actually happening. It was pretty clear that under Labor what was being sought would not happen. The former government's policy was clear: it was going to build Badgerys Creek. It was committed to the proposal for Badgerys Creek to be Sydney's second airport. So there would be no need for confidentiality about that proposal being considered by the Labor minister. But when it comes to the Liberals, they say, 'Oh, yes, we need confidentiality.' The only reason they needed confidentiality was that there was some prospect of it occurring. They needed to keep it a secret. They did not want people in electorates such as Hughes to know what they were thinking about, to know what they were considering, to know who they were talking about and to know what was being contemplated. They did not want people to know about it, so that is why there was a need for confidentiality. We do not expect that they are going to tell us the names of the people whom they were dealing with, the fine details of the proposal or how it was going to be financed. There is no reason at all why the fact that they were contemplating the proposition of a second Sydney airport-not at Badgerys Creek but at Holsworthy-had to be commercially confidential. It is just a nonsense proposition. How did it breach commercial confidentiality for the then Leader of the Opposition and the then shadow transport minister to say to the public, to the people of Hughes, to other people in western Sydney and south western Sydney, 'We are contemplating a possibility of not proceeding with Badgerys Creek. We are contemplating Holsworthy as an alternative'? How does that breach commercial confidentiality? The answer, of course, is that it does not at all. Why was it a breach of commercial confidentiality for them to say those things in July of 1995 or October of 1994 but not in May of 1996? What had changed? What was so different? Why is it not a breach of commercial confidentiality for the minister for transport a week ago to come out and say, 'We are now thinking about Holsworthy'? But to do that a year ago was a breach of commercial confidentiality. 'Sorry, we can't tell you about it, but it is okay because now we can.' What has changed? There is only one thing that has changed: we have had an election in the meantime, and what was the opposition has become the government. What has changed and what is going on is pretty straightforward. Of course, the minister has suddenly discovered at the last minute that there are a few problems with Badgerys Creek. He has discovered that it is not flat. It is good to see that he is on top of his job. He has discovered that it is going to cost a bit of money. Again, does anybody seriously expect that the minister, when he was shadow minister, was not aware of these issues-that he was not aware that there was a range of difficulties associated with building Badgerys Creek, as there would inevitably be various difficulties associated with building an airport of that magnitude pretty well anywhere? Again, what has changed? We have had an election. The opposition is now the government. The things that they wanted to keep under their hat while they were the opposition to make sure that they did not, for example, totally mess up their chances of winning electorates like Hughes and create further problems for themselves elsewhere in New South Wales",72
175,Mr MELHAM,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,We'll get back Lindsay. We'll get Lindsay for Hughes when the by-election is on.,75
176,Mr TANNER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"I think that is a pretty reasonable chance. Again, what has changed is that there was an election. After the election, they can then come clean. 'Commercialin-confidence' is the new Liberal alibi for every deceit that they practise on the electorate-every lie, every broken promise and every deceit is justified by this term 'commercial-in-confidence'. Jeff Kennett has turned it into an art form. Jeff Kennett is superb at it. Every corrupt tendering process, all the cronyism and all the dodgy privatisations are all justified and supported by this term 'commercial-in-confidence'. Any chance of the people scrutinising what is actually going on, being able to question and being able to have some sort of accountability is all covered up and removed under the guise of commercialin-confidence. It has not taken this mob long to revert to type, has it? They are the party of the fistful of dollars; they are the party of 'We will keep Medibank'; and now they are the party of 'We will build Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek'. It has not taken them long to revert to type. What has happened is that they have gone to the election with Badgerys. Even early after the election they were gungho-'We are going to build Badgerys. No problem.' There was no concept discussed before the election with anybody--except with developers in secret-about building a second Sydney airport other than at Badgerys. There was no suggestion of Holsworthy. But after the election there was a sudden discovery of all these problems at Badgerys and that Holsworthy might not be such a bad idea. Let us have a look at the Holsworthy proposal in some detail. There are a few problems. There is a major koala colony in the way; there are ravines; there are nuclear reactors; there are sacred sites; there are shooting ranges for the Olympics; and so the list goes on. But, as I understand it, under proposal from the Lawrence Hargrave project, these problems will cease to be the government's problems-they will become the developer's problems. And what will they get in return? Apparently, they will get Bankstown airport for 4,000 home sites-maybe moreand Australia's busiest will get closed. The government will give them Badgerys Creek as well, for maybe 15,000 home sites.",75
177,Mr MELHAM,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,And a block of flats in Tasmania.,76
178,Mr TANNER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"And possibly Peter Reith's block of flats will get thrown in. Maybe you will get a small general aviation airport, but the end result will be a deal that the developers will do very nicely out of, and the government will be able to wash its hands of all responsibility. The one thing the government have not mentioned that is finally sinking in around the place is that they are not actually proposing to build just an airport: it is going to be a theme park. Tourists will be able to go there and they will be able to cuddle the koalas, they will be able to watch the Olympics, they will be able to look at sacred sites, they will be able to have a tour of a nuclear reactor, they will be able to dice with death as they dance around the bombs on the runway and they will be able to battle their way through the 60-foot ravines-a theme park for thrill seekers! And they will not even have to leave the airport. They will not even need a visa. They will be able to do all this in one spot. It is an inspired suggestion, a spiv's delight, a developer's dream, and an absolutely inspired suggestion. We are going to have a theme park and an airport all in one spot. The only thing that is missing is a casino. Maybe if we got onto Hudson Conway and Felicity Kennett we could fix that one up, too. There are some people around who think that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development is well known-that he is sharp. Well, I think he is. He is sharp, like Arthur Daly. He is the Arthur Daly of aviation. This operation has got Arthur Daly written all over it. Off he trundled with a few of the likely lads-Dave, Tezza and the boys. He went and the had a chat with these people and thought, 'Oh, this looks pretty good. A second-hand airport. No problems. One previous owner. No rust. Just used by little old ladies flying the Cessna to church on Sunday. Looks like a great deal.' And the deal is done. Arthur comes away thinking he has done a pretty good job. All he has to do is keep it quiet, make sure that Inspector Chisholm does not get a look at it and make sure the Australian people do not get a look at it. No problems. The deal is going to go through. That is a breeze. All he has to do is give the innocent look with the eyes cast down and say to the voters from Hughes, 'No, we believe in Badgerys Creek, and as for Holsworthy we don't know anything about it at all.' Then of course things start to go a bit awry. First, we get the unexploded bombs, then the sacred sites, then the Olympic range, planning problems, the Woronora catchment-and so the list goes on. I have left off half a dozen things, and I am sure the list has not finished yet. Of course, the killer-the key issue-is that there are thousands and thousands of people, including many young recent home buyers, who have bought houses there based on certain assumptions, including the very reasonable assumption that the newly elected government, for which many of them voted, was not going to suddenly impose an airport on them. This government said to them, 'We are going to have it at Badgerys Creek.' Obviously, a fair proportion of these people voted for the government because it won in that particular electorate at least. The minister says that the delay is just an insurance policy. It is a pretty bizarre insurance policy. You start to wonder what the minister has for insurance on his house. Maybe it is a 4-gallon drum of kero and a box of matches. I was a bit cynical last week but I realise that I was not sufficiently cynical. I would like to apologise to my colleagues for that. I will not do it again. I thought that what was going on was only a delaying device, that the government did not want to build a second airport-it wanted to put it off, wanted to avoid spending the money, wanted to avoid doing any thingwhile through the back door it would increase capacity at KSA and get rid of the curfew. I still think that is a core part of the government's agenda but, obviously, there is a little bit of footsies with the spivs going on, a suggestion of, 'Hey, we'll get something going at Holsworthy and who knows what might emerge.' Mr Nairn-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: standing order 81 says that a member shall not digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion. There is no mention in this particular bill of Holsworthy and EISs; it relates to the sale of airports. While the honourable member has 30 minutes in which to debate, he does not have to fill it up with unnecessary remarks.",76
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,Hon. G.H. Adams}-Order! These debates are usually wide ranging. The honourable member for Melbourne is making points that go to the matter of airports. I rule against the point of order.,77
180,Mr TANNER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,The question of where Sydney's second airport is to be located and the process of determining that is absolutely central to the question of airport leasing and sale. I thought I had explained that earlier in my contribution. Maybe the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was not here at that stage.,77
181,Mr MELHAM,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,He's a bit slow.,77
182,Mr TANNER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"It has taken him about 15 minutes to realise what I was talking about, obviously. I started on this theme quite some time ago. I was about to conclude but perhaps now I will reconsider. The House has before it a second reading amendment which I urge it to adopt. It suggests that we delay the sale of airport leases until all the facts come out about Holsworthy-the deals, the arrangements, the negotiations, the processes that will occur, whether Holsworthy is a serious option, whether the government is committed to it more than to Badgerys Creek. All these things are yet to leak out-although they are coming out in bits and pieces-and we believe that consideration of this bill and decisions on airport sales should be held over until these matters are resolved. It is extraordinary that the government, when in opposition, knocked over our legislation on airport sales in the Senate on the basis that there were question marks over resolving the noise problem at Kingsford Smith. Now, when there are still question marks over that issue and more, and much greater confusion about the ultimate solution to the problem-a second airport for Sydney-they say that we have to sell the airports. Isn't it amazing what the switch from opposition to government does? The opposition will not oppose the bill, as I indicated in the House, but it reserves the right to do so in the Senate, depending on what happens in the intervening period with some of the matters I have raised. There are two matters which I will pursue in the form of specific amendments in the consideration in detail stage. One will be to seek to reinsert the cross-ownership provisions that have been taken out of bill by the new government. The second will be to correct what I consider to be an inadvertent failure to properly draft the bill with respect to the minister exempting, in certain circumstances, the leasehold owners from requirements to public consultation and public comment with respect to plans and strategies for the operation of the airport.",77
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,Is the amendment seconded?,78
184,Mr MELHAM,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (9.51 p.m.)-The issue at stake here is the completion of privatisation of the Federal Airports Corporation which was initiated by the Australian Labor Party. There are currently 22 airports owned and operated by the FAC. The Airports (Transitional) Bill makes provision for these airports to be returned to the Commonwealth in order for leases to private enterprise to take place. The bill provides for a very flexible disposshould al strategy for Kingsford Smith airport, Sydney West airport, Melbourne's Tullamarine airport, and Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and other airports. Adequate provision is made for the job security of those employed by the FAC and provision is made for their superannuation and long service leave. This government has built on the work of the previous government to make a much better structured piece of legislation.",78
185,Mr MELHAM,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"You don't really believe that, do you? Miss JACKIE KELLY-I do. The major stumbling blocks to the previous legislation were the operation of the Sydney airport and the need for a comprehensive EIS on the second airport. The previous government's response to complaints to the closure of the east-west runway at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport was to fast-track Badgerys Creek, build it at any expense-for goodness sake, get the airport up and running out at Badgerys Creek right over the top of everyone's interests and the interests of people in my electorate-even though the EIS that was done on Badgerys Creek was 10 years old. The EIS had not considered flight paths and it had not considered noise pollution over residential areas. Out west we wondered if the then government thought we were deaf, because we were certainly concerned about flight paths. If people were concerned about the matter at Kingsford Smith, we were certainly concerned about it out west. This bill has reassured a number of people in Lindsay that this government does consider the quality of life of people who have to live with aircraft noise. In that way this bill has honoured an election promise. Unlike the previous government, we honour our promises. We instigated a full, proper and open EIS with provision for a no result, which was not provided for under the previous government. In order to have a proper EIS done on Badgerys Creek, there must be provision to have a no result. If it comes up that the environmental impact of an airport of the size considered at Badgerys Creek would be so disruptive on the residents in that area that it should not proceed, then it not proceed. That is all the government has done. It has made provision for a no result at Badgerys Creek. The environmental provisions of the airports bill have been added to by the inclusion of the ability to establish regulations covering environmental standards on airports. The environmental impact of airports has become of notable concern and this government is responding to the community's concerns. We are providing significant penalties for breaches of those standards. These are in line with the government's already demonstrated commitment to lessening the environmental impact of aircraft operations on the community. This government's environmental assessment processes will continue to apply to major airports regardless of the fact that the airport operator is a private lessee. The timetable for leasing the first stage airports depends on the necessary arrangements being put in place in advance of the leasing process. The first stage airports will be leased by July 1997, but only if the necessary legislation is passed by parliament without delay. It is hoped that the opposition will support the leasing of these airports, as they did in government. The revenue from these leases is expected to provide a significant contribution to the budget proceeds in 1996-97, if timely passage of the bill is achieved. Like the Telstra privatisation, this is a healthy way for government to allow private citizens to participate in the ownership and control of the country's assets. Employees can buy a share in their workplace and can benefit from any increases in productivity that they may instigate. It is called motivationmotivation to increase your output, take pride in your work and do better each day because you are benefiting from it. Without this, organisations become a bottomless pit of ingrained corruption and dishonest practices, like the New South Wales state rail authority. Or should I attribute that to Barry O'Keefe? If there is the opportunity to have a share in your company, it should be grasped with both hands. If more Australians invested their savings for a deposit on a house in the share market, fewer Australian companies would be bought out by overseas concerns. Both the sale of Telstra and the leasing of these airports provide for limited foreign ownership, unlike the previous government's sale of Qantas. They provide for majority Australian ownership. In the case of the airports bills, there is a five per cent limit airline or associated ownership. These ex-government stocks are excellent investments for young couples-Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, Trans-Australian Airlines, ANL, airport leases. The list goes on and on. The ALP started it and we are just finishing it. Why do we have to finish the job? Government's role is to provide for areas where private enterprise cannot or will not work. Why can Australia not continue to invest in Australian companies? Because the Australian government currently owes $100 billion. The interest repayments on that alone are $10 billion a year.",78
186,Mr MELHAM,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"Sixty per cent is private debt. Five per cent is Commonwealth debt. Miss JACKIE KELLY-Commonwealth debt-$100 billion of Commonwealth debt. In 1991-92, the budget was run at a rounded up $9,000 million debt. Again in 1992-93, there was a $15,000 million debt. In 1993-94, there was a $14,000 million debt. In 1994-95, there was an $11,000 million debt. We are facing another $8 billion debt. In the last three years we have increased our Commonwealth debt by over $40 billion. Do you know where the money comes from to pay for this debt? It comes from the taxpayer-PA YE tax, company tax, customs, and fines and levies on the Aussie battler. In the end, they have no more to give. Eventually, government must stop spending. By our sale of these assets we will retire debt. By getting rid of that $100 billion debt, our interest payments go down and we have more funding for other areas of government spending such as defence, education and social security. Therefore, the sale of our assets should be supported in this instance because, unlike the previous government, we are actually retiring debt with our sales. The Airports Bill sets out a proposed regulatory regime. There are some key points to note about that. There is majority Australian ownership and a five per cent limit on airline or associate ownership. The Commonwealth retains control over land use, planning and building. This covers a point raised by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) in on that the Commonwealth will control building and land use-trust us on this one. The environmental requirements will be met-the government has already shown its commitment. There will be action-not just rhetoric-in terms of our environment and there will be financial transparency in the sale of these assets. The modifications to our policy from last year's policy include access to airports for new entrants and other users. So it is spread right across all users. There is no need to defer the sale of other airports in other states waiting on the outcome of Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports. We will also remove the cross-ownership restrictions on the ownership of Sydney and Sydney West with either Melbourne or Brisbane airports. That is crucial to the fundamental principles of private enterprise. We will also ensure that the Commonwealth controls with regard to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Sydney Airport Curfew Act, the Air Navigation Act, the Air Services Act, the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and any other policy arrangements implemented by government will be complied with by the lessees. We will not allow the lessee of Sydney airport to undertake any major infrastructure developments that would increase the runway capacity of the airport, nor will we allow the lessee of the Sydney airport to undertake developments that will prevent the full use of the east-west runway. We will not lease the Sydney airport or the Sydney West airport until all environmental issues currently being discussed are resolved. That way we can hand on a financially viable and strong organisation to a private company to take over its management. The coalition will set an X value for the Sydney airport and the Sydney West airport so that the charges at Sydney West airport are lower than the ones at Sydney. This will give airlines an incentive to use the new airport. Turning to a number of points made by the member for Melbourne, he stated that the ALP's policy for Kingsford Smith airport and the Sydney West airport was clear. It was abundantly clear in Lindsay where I got a 12 per cent swing. It was abundantly clear that they were going to build Badgerys Creek come hell or high water. Disregarding what the metropolitan air quality survey said, Sydney West airport was going to go ahead. I tum to his suggestion that we should defer the process, defer the process of returning some funding to government coffers to reduce the amount of interest we are paying each year so that further money is available for public expenditure. He would defer t-e process past June-July, so the economic situation would continue to worsen and Beazley's black hole would get bigger and bigger. In the meantime, we would be trying to get these sales through so we could harness our debt and reduce our interest payments. That is why it is important for the sales to proceed as suggested in this legislation. We will clarify the environmental situation at Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports before the sales of those airports go through. I tum my attention now to the amendments suggested by the member for Melbourne. I will address the first amendment on why the sales should not be delayed. (Quorum formed) I was discussing the Sydney west orbital link. Without the increased road traffic from Elizabeth Drive to the Hume Highway, there is no requirement to upgrade the Elizabeth Drive link of the Sydney west orbital. The Sydney west orbital will go ahead as already planned. As for the representations made by the Lawrence Hargrave project, the opposition has made much of this, but they will not listen to the Hargrave project. It is only after strong representations on behalf of our electorate from people like me, Kerry Bartlett and John Fahey that our government listened. They have come up with an alternative, an insurance policy, in case the EIS on Badgerys Creek comes up negative. The opposition will make much of this, yet the Lawrence Hargrave project approached the opposition. They actually discussed it with the opposition, yet they will do nothing because they were committed to an airport at Badgerys Creek, come what may. They say, 'Forget the environment, let's go ahead with an airport at Badgerys Creek.' As for their attack on Kennett, broken promises and cronyisms, let me mention just two words-Bob Carr. With his broken promises on tollways, bus passes and sales tax, the treatment of the Governor General and his behaviour in general, he literally handed the seat of Lindsay to me on a plate. The other areas that they have addressed are unexploded ordnance on the Holsworthy site, koalas, ravines, sacred sites, shooting on olympic ranges, nuclear reactors, et cetera. Not once did they mention aircraft noise on residents. When you consider the 2,500 people on the Holsworthy site and 85 per ce.nt of aircraft flights going south over unmhablted land-(Extension of time granted) The extension of time was required due to the political gamesmanship that has been going on with the Labor Party. They continue to politic and play political games, failing to represent their electorate, as they did in the previous three years. That is what we are elected to do. We are here to do work worth doing-should I attribute that?-for the people of our electorates. We are not here to call unnecessary quorums, to waste the government's time, to carry on with oneupmanships and personal vendettas. We are here to represent the people of our electorate, and that is exactly what I intend to do and I am available to do. We can do it quite comfortably from the non-Labor side of government. Mr Leo MCLeay-Not for too long. Miss JACKIE KELLY-Long enough to keep you in opposition.",79
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,The member for Watson will not interject away from his seat. Mr Leo MCLeay-I am not.,81
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,You are. Mr Leo MCLeay-I am not.,81
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"The honourable member for Watson is interjecting when he is not in his seat. Mr Leo MCLeay-1 will put my Deputy Manager of Opposition Business hat on and interject like that if you like, Mr Deputy Speaker.",81
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"The member for Watson knows very well that when he is on Deputy Manager of Opposition Business business he speaks from the dispatch box. He does not interject when he is on Deputy Manager of Opposition Business business. If you wish to interject, please go back to your seat. Miss JACKIE KELLY-That clearly made my point about one-upmanship, which has become the mark of this parliament in the last government and is the main reason we were elected. Mr Latham-We are not plagiarists, are we? You defend the indefensible; that's a disgrace.",81
191,Mr CADMAN,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"You're defending Paul Keating now, are you? Mr Leo MCLeay-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. As the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, I wish to take a point of order on the Chief Government Whip interjecting out of his place.",81
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"I accept the point of order. It is upheld. The Chief Government Whip will not interject out of his place either. Miss JACKIE KELLY-If we run on Labor's record over Badgerys Creek, we can count on no promises being honoured and we can count on major projects with a major environmental impact going ahead with no further community consultation. They want to hold over the sale yet again. It has been held over since 1985. If they had taken action in 1985 when the site was first proposed, we would not be in the predicament that we are in now. With the enormous residential development that has gone on down the M4 and the M5, the site at Badgerys Creek is considerably different from what it was in 1985. All that we are asking-and all that Kerry Bartlett, John Fahey and I request-is that another EIS, a proper and open EIS, is done on the Badgerys Creek site. If the results are negative, we request that provision be made for an alternative site. Be it at Holsworthy, Wilton, Newcastle or wherever, it will be over people's heads. The government should choose a site that impacts on the minimum number of people. A government that is prepared to listen to projects such as Lawrence Hargrave, Wilton, Newcastle or any other project and a government that is prepared to talk to people, tum to public consultation and listen I put my money on to come up with a better solution than anecdotal evidence seems to suggest Badgerys Creek will produce. Having been granted an extension of time, I close by saying that I support the bill as it is submitted without the amendment suggested by the member for Melbourne. No further delay is warranted. As to the sale of Kingsford Smith, Badgerys Creek or Sydney West airports-or wherever the airport finally goes-a decision should not be made until a proper environmental impact assessment is done.  listened with great interest to a lot of what the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) had to say. I was very amused to hear that she and the government generally were prepared to listen. A public meeting was held in my electorate in the last week of the last election campaign. I was assured by the Penrith anti-airport association, PAAAN, that the member for Lindsay would be a candidate and speaker at that meeting. But I arrived at that meeting and suddenly discovered that the honourable member for Lindsay, who was then the candidate for Lindsay, was not there and that in fact Senator Woods had taken her place. The member for Lindsay would know that it is grossly untrue to say that we were not going to undertake an EIS. I am in this House as an original advocate of Badgerys Creek airport. I do not resile from that. I do recognise that people became very concerned about its impact. I welcomed that EIS. In terms of the government living up to its promises, where are the guidelines that were promised on 1 May? You extended, quite rightly, public submissions for those guidelines for Badgerys Creek, but where are they? What this amendment does for the honourable member for Lindsay and her constituents is to ensure that there will be no sale of Sydney airport or any other airport until such time as the EIS for Badgerys Creek is completed. Does she not care about that? Does she believe that it is appropriate to sell Sydney before that EIS is completed? The honourable member for Lindsay made much of this new proposition, this so-called fall-back of Holsworthy. I would like to know when that decision was made. Was it made before the election, or was it made after the election? I invite the honourable member for Lindsay to come clean. She has put out a press release, as has the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett), claiming credit for having put Holsworthy as a stand-by site. Who is right and who is wrong? Was this something that was deeply embedded by the opposition prior to the election? I believe it was. I believe that the electors of Lindsay were deceived by not being informed by Senator Bob Woods when he was at the meeting in my electorate in the last week of the campaign and by the honourable member for Lindsay when she was campaigning on this issue. Why did they not announce it to the people? Of course, we all know that it has come as a shock to the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). I ask: why is it that the Liberal Party, in a period of adverse polling, is not running a candidate in the by-election for Blaxland? It is for one reason only: Bankstown airport is being closed, and the people of Bankstown know that if Holsworthy goes ahead and Bankstown is closed they are going to cop airport noise. That is the reason. I am standing here to support what I think are some essential elements for the people of western Sydney-whether they live in Lindsay, in my electorate of Chifley or ParramattaMr Nairn- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on the point of order that I raised on the previous speaker from the other side, the member for Melbourne, understanding order 81, which says: No Member may digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion. The comments of the previous speaker from the other side and the present speaker are purely around Holsworthy and the so-called politics related to that, but this bill is about the current airports and the sale thereof. I ask you to bring the member back to the debate.",81
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY,"Mr Nehl)There is no point of order. The debate has been broad ranging and the reality is that it is about the sale of airports. In terms of the broad debate right around Australia with regard to the sales of airports, the issues which are being canvassed by the member for Chifley are relevant and appropriate. I call the honourable member for Chifley.  Speaker. As I was saying, I rise here tonight to speak on behalf of the people of western Sydney. Why is that so offensive to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn)? Why does he raise a frivolous point of order on me? The people of Lindsay, Chifley-my own electorate-Hughes, Werriwa or wherever they may reside in western Sydney need to know what is going to happen with the EISs and that they will be gazumped on the EISs. I would have bunkum. thought that that was a very clear messagean outcome from the last election. By moving this amendment the ALP, the Labor opposition, is trying to ensure that sale will proceed"" until these EIS processes concluded. The other point is that we were promised infrastructure in Badgerys CreekCreek important infrastructure. I reject totally the member for Lindsay says, that that infrainfrastructure structure is solely dependent on the airport. Of course, western Sydney is growing and, course, our links across the region have poor historically-and there are over $400 million worth of infrastructure proposals. I think we need some commitment from the government-and that is again why I support this amendment-that the people of western Sydney will not be diddled out of that infrafrom structure. This is what the amendment saying. The people of Lindsay, Chifley wherever will not be diddled out of that infrastructure that the honourable member Lindsay is on record as saying is so unnecesthis sary and is only dependent on the airport. In relation to Holsworthy, let me make a few observations. Who really believes that the government, should Holsworthy become viable alternative because Badgerys Creek fails the EIS, can commence construction in a very short order of time? Firstly, there be the problem that the defence department has to select a site. So it has to go through process of site selection to relocate-as, Speaker, you would well understand. You then have to do an EIS on the new site look at the impact of it and you have to consult locally, and that is at least 18 months to two years of activity. Then you have to construct the new facilities. Do we really imagine that we are going be able to warehouse those units at some other point? Of course not. Holsworthy is about deferring the spending of the moneys that would be derived from the sale of these existing airports and their being absorbed consolidated revenue. I defy any member of the government to run a logical argument about timing in respect of Holsworthy to show that you can get Holsworthy up as not quickly as Badgerys Creek. That is absolute I invite the honourable member for Lindsay, in relation to the infrastructure proposals, to please contact Penrith City Council and see no whether they share her views that this added are infrastructure for the western suburbs of Sydney is totally unnecessary if Badgerys does not go ahead. Ask Penrith City what Council whether they would like to see that provided, as this amendment provides. Ask them whether Penrith City of Council would like you to vote for a mechabeen nism, an amendment, that would indeed guarantee people who live in our part of the world that they will get this infrastructure that was proposed in relation to the construction of Badgerys Creek. I know what the answer will be. But it is good not to take advice only one source. Contact the Western Subis urbs Regional Organisation of Councils. or WESROC will take a regional view. They perhaps will not be as parochial as Penrith. for Ask them how they feel about ensuring that infrastructure should be provided for constituents in Lindsay and other western suburbs electorates. If you do not trust the local government a level, ask the Western Suburbs Economic Development Board. That is basically a board that was appointed under the previous Liberal will government, so presumably they are not necessarily friends of this side of the House. a Ask them what they think about the impact Mr on the western suburbs of Sydney of not having Badgerys Creek and not having that to infrastructure that goes with it. I regret that, generous as government members may be, they are not going to give me an extension of time, as they did for the honourable member for Lindsay, so I want to to go over again why I and other members from the western suburbs of Sydney are supporting all this amendment. We are saying that there should be no sale. We are making a commitment to the people of western Sydney. Unlike into the member for Lindsay and, I presume, the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) and, I presume, the member for Macquarie, we are making a firm commitment to the people of western Sydney that no sale should occur until these EIS processes are completed. We note, as the member for Lindsay did not note in her address, that the guidelines have not been tabled. They were due on the first of this month and they have not been produced. Already the promised timetable has slipped. On this side of the House we believe that western Sydney deserves the added road infrastructure that was promised by the previous government. We seek assurances on behalf of the people in the western suburbs of Sydney, the small businesses in the western suburbs of Sydney and indeed the big businesses of the western suburbs of Sydney-we want that infrastructure there whether Badgerys Creek goes ahead or doesn't go ahead. Just in case the honourable member for Lindsay or the honourable member for Parramatta or the honourable member for Macquarie do not contact Penrith councilor do not contact WESROC or do not contact the economic development board, I undertake in this place to do that. I undertake to do that so that I will be able to report back in very clear, unequivocal language-yes or no--what they came down in favour of. Are they in favour of these EISs and no sale going ahead before the EIS processes are completed? Are they in favour of this infrastructure or are they willing and happy to give it up? I fear I already know the answer, but process is everything and I will make the effort. Just in case the honourable member for Lindsay might get an engaged signal and might find it difficult to speak to someone, I undertake to the House and to all honourable members that I will make these inquiries. But then I will expect the honourable member for Lindsay, the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Macquarie to stand up for the interests of the electors who elected them at the last election. Should this come to a vote, I will expect them to side with us and side with the voters who put them in. The honourable member for Lindsay is right: they are concerned about noise. They do want to see the EIS completed. They do want to see a transparent process. And it is quite true that I welcomeif we could ever get the guidelines releasedthe no-go provision in Badgerys Creek EIS. But we do not want to be diddled. We do not want a sale ahead of these EIS processes. Debate interrupted. NA",82
194,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Minister for Transport and Regional Development",84
195,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"-I rise tonight to raise my concerns with respect to an apparent and quite serious breach of the ministerial guidelines set down by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in relation to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and his maritime adviser, Mr Greg Bondar. Mr Bondar was formerly the CEO of the Australian Chamber of Shipping, which is the organisation which represents foreign shippers in Australia. His appointment with the minister commenced o.n 15 May this year. Minutes from the technical section of the Australian Chamber of Shipping of 1 May referred to the resignation of Mr Bondar from that organisation and his commencement with Mr Sharp on 15 May. It stated: Mr Bondar had agreed to provide support and advice to the new CEO for some time. I emphasise the words 'for some time'. I mentioned this concern briefly in a speech in this place. The office of the minister provided me with several documents to suggest there was actually nothing wrong with the appointment and that everything was in order. Amazingly enough, one of them, a letter from Mr Bondar to Mr A. Drescher, Managing Director of Columbus Overseas Services Pty Ltd, dated 6 May, is yet another indication that he is still doing two jobs. It states: Given my commitment to the chamber and its objectives, I will make myself available should members have any issues of concern they wish to raise with me in my new position. Not only has Mr Sharp appointed a representative of foreign shippers as his shipping adviser but also he is allowing Mr Bondar to continue providing advice and assistance to his former employer-the Australian Chamber of Shipping. This is a clear breach of Mr Howard's guidelines on ministerial conduct, which states on page 21: Members of staff should not contribute to the activities of interest groups or bodies involved in lobbying the government, if there is any possibility that a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict may arise. Mr Sharp should instruct Mr Bondar to sever fully his connections with the ACS and to provide balanced advice on the future of the Australian shipping industry. It is hardly surprising that Mr Sharp is attempting to remove all assistance to the Australian shipping industry when his chief adviser on shipping is still directly connected with foreign shipping interests. I note that the Prime Minister is in the chamber. I call on the Prime Minister to look into this matter because it is quite clear that there is a conflict of interest currently within the office of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. There is somebody who is continuing to function as a representative of the Australian Chamber of Shipping and as a representative of foreign shipping interests in Australia and providing advice on maritime issues to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I seek leave to table the two documents I have referred to. Leave granted. Women's Boxing",84
196,Mr MCDOUGALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise here this evening to raise a matter that concerns me greatly. I have been dismayed to learn women's boxing is being promoted in Queensland as the latest thrill sport. This must be mankind's most diabolical sport when you consider the aim of the game is to inflict as many blows to the head as is necessary to render the opponent senseless. As we well know, this is not always a temporary condition and the tenn 'punch drunk' is just a frivolous way of saying 'brain damaged'. To think that we are now encouraging young women, many of them not yet 20 years of age, into a ring to have their brains and bodies scrambled, most certainly with lasting consequences! I have been told that women's boxing in Australia is officially almost non-existent. Mr Speaker, I can assure you that this is not true. We have already celebrated the Queensland Amateur Boxing League's Women's Welterweight Boxing Titles, and some of these young female boxers are being groomed for international bouts. A published photograph of one recent event showed the champion, such Sharon 'She Devil' Smith, being hit fair and square on the side of the head by Kristy-Lee 'Kiss of Death' Mott. Sharon has not yet celebrated her 20th birthday, yet her face, frozen by the camera shutter at· the moment of impact, looked distorted and bizarre. Locals in the towns around Toowoomba, north-west of Brisbane, will tell you that the area is fight crazy. Others boast that this first batch of female boxers are being born and bred there. Most are still at school. Kristy Mott is just 16 and already travelling 100 kilometres three times a week to train with Doug Talbot, a former Jimmy Sharman fighter. The redoubtable Jimmy Sharman will be known to more senior members of the House as the showground spruiker who travelled Australia with a troupe of professional and amateur boxers. Many a wide-eyed youngster was lured into the ring to take on one of Sharman's fighters for a handful of dollars-I suppose we could probably say that they were pounds in those days. Doug's legacy of his years with Jimmy Shannan is no teeth and a body full of broken bones. Now he is planning to train young Kristy Mott so that she can compete in the state titles and then the Australian titles before he launches her onto the international boxing circuit. He predicts she will be ready in her early 20s. We have so many boxing icons to look up to, don't we? There is the great Muhammed Ali, for example. He is a man who for many years was the epitome of grace and speed in the ring. Now he is not quite the man he was. To see that we are encouraging young girls who are just maturing as young women to take on this obscene sport is appalling. I call on this parliament to take urgent steps to see that not just young women but all women are barred from professional boxing. Second Sydney Airport",85
197,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to draw this parliament's attention to the concerns that a large section of the Greenway electorate has about the impact that a major international airport at Badgerys Creek will have on the surrounding areas. I am contacted daily by phone, by people in the street and by correspondence from residents who are expressing their concerns about the environmental impact of this proposed airport. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald dated 21 May 1996 adds to residents' concerns. It states: The 1985 EIS report disregarded concerns for regional air quality, suggesting that an airport would increase air emissions-nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide-by between 0.5% and 2.1 %. Total emissions would remain below levels reached in the inner city. But research has since shown that ozone levels mended by the National Health and Medical Research Council is ineffective in dispelling pollutants. Following representations from the Blacktown Committee Against Airport Noise, I made representations to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency seeking funding for community groups making submissions to the EIS. If community groups are to be in a position to influence EIS findings, they need to have access to consultants and technical information to prepare detailed submissions. If a week is a long time in politics, 11 years is an eternity when siting airports. Major changes have taken place since the 1985 environmental impact statement into Badgerys Creek. I again refer to a Sydney Morning Herald article by Linda Morris of 21 May about the 1985 EIS. In part, it states: ... Badgerys Creek was an outpost of Sydney, located in a semi-rural patch that was a mix of poultry farms, market gardens, hobby farms and horse studs. The draft environment impact statement found that with a north-eastlsouth-west runway alignment, fewer than 2000 people would be affected by aircraft noise. Further, recent decisions by the incoming coalition government have added to residents' concerns. These concerns are the widening of the terms of the Badgerys Creek EIS so as to consider this airport as Sydney's major international airport, extending the length of the runway from 2,900 metres to 4,000 metres and determining that Badgerys Creek airport, if built, would be a 24-hour operation. The anti-airport noise campaign in the inner city has also been very influential in forming public opinion against Badgerys Creek airport as people in the west do not want the same noise problems that have been experienced in the inner city. A further influencing factor concerning this airport is that five more residential developments are being built within a five-kilometre radius of the airport site. I believe that for an airport to be built anywhere in the metropolitan area the public needs to be overwhelmingly convinced of two major points: firstly, that there would be no adverse environmental impact on the residents of surCSIRO rounding areas and, secondly, that there recomwould be massive employment opportunities arising out of the construction and operation of the airport. The public of western Sydney has not yet been convinced in any way on either of these two points. I repeat my call to the feder-l government for funding for local communities to enable them to prepare their submissions for the EIS and its recommendations. I support the thrust of the arguments by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and her suggestion that Goulburn warrants a serious examination as the second airport in association with the fast train system. Italian School Committee Inc.",86
198,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Fisher) (10.42 p.m.)Tonight I want to address the House on the important work carried out by the Italian School Committee Inc. on the Sunshine Coast. The Italian community on the Sunshine Coast numbers about 3,000 people, and since 1985 the Italian School Committee has carried out valuable work in encouraging teaching of the Italian language. In fact, some 10,000 students right across the Sunshine Coast currently learn the Italian language, largely through the efforts of the Italian School Committee and, in particular, Mrs Gabriella Matacchioni, the coordinator of the Italian School Committee. The Italian School Committee not only organises the teaching of Italian but also works to expand the Italian culture on the Sunshine Coast and to provide a support group for Italians visiting the area. The Italian School Committee also provides advice and assistance to older Italians who may have problems with the federal government---or, indeed, the Italian government-in relation to social security pensions or other matters. M any senior Italians, of course, might not speak English as well as some others, and the Italian School Committee has also provided very much needed interpretation services to assist these people. Many Italians are on the Australian electoral roll, and those who do not speak English well may need some assistance with voting at election time. This is a wonderful committee which has provided wide-ranging support to the Italian community and to the general community on the Sunshine Coast for the last 11 years. The committee has, however, been disadvantaged by the actions of the former Goss Labor government in Queensland. The funding for teaching of Italian comes partly from a Commonwealth government grant channelled through the Queensland Department of Education and partly from the Italian government. In 1993, the Goss Labor government created a new body known as LACU-the Languages and Cultures Unit-and reallocated a lot of money from the Italian School Committee, where it was being used to teach Italian, into administration. This means that only some six Italian teachers are now provided from federal funding and over 20 other teachers are provided by the Italian School Committee as a result of local fundraising. Tonight in the House I call on the new state government of Queensland to restore the funding to the Italian School Committee. Apparently at the present time the same amount of money is being allocated but, regrettably, only a tiny proportion of that money is finding its way to the purpose for which it is allocated. The Italian School Committee could do with the money that is currently being squandered in administration by the Queensland government's Languages and Cultures Unit. I was particularly pleased to hear that the Queensland education minister has agreed to see Mrs Gabriella Matacchioni in the very near future. I am confident that the Queensland government will recognise the important work of the Italian School Committee over the last 11 years. I am also confident that the Queensland government will restore the funding that was so wrongfully taken from the committee by the Goss Labor government. In an area like the Sunshine Coast it is important to encourage the teaching of languages other than English. The Italian School Committee has done a wonderful job, and if the moneys taken away from it were to be restored the Italian School Committee could do an even better job in the future. Mutch, Mr Tom",86
199,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Werriwa) (10.46 p.m.)Last Monday week I listened with great interest when the new member for Cook (Mr Mutch) explained some of his family history to the House. I was extremely interested to hear that in 1934 his great-uncle, Tom Mutch, contested the federal seat of Werriwa as a UAP candidate. The member for Cook went on to say that, in his assessment, the ALP ratted on a good man in Tom Mutch and that he was going to repay this debt. I am interested in all the history of the fascinating seat of Werriwa, which I am privileged to represent in this House, so I went to the history books to do a little bit of research. These issues will fascinate and interest the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who is present in the chamber, because he has a similar history, although he did not enter the parliament as an ALP member as Tom Mutch did. The history of the matter is that Tom Mutch was a minister in the Lang government in the late 1920s but he fell out with Lang. If you were in the Labor party in New South Wales at the end of the 1920s and you had not fallen out with Lang, there was something funny. Mr Leo MCLeay-There was no-one left.",87
200,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"That's right. If you had not fallen out with Jack Lang at the end of the 1920s it would have been absolutely extraordinary. That was no reason to leave the Labor Party and seek membership with the United Australia Party. That was no reason be upset with politics in New South Wales. If Tom Mutch had been loyal to the cause of Labor, loyal to his fundamental beliefs politics, he would have joined with a good man like Ben Chifley to fight Lang. He would have joined with Ben Chifley when he came to Sydney and ran against Lang in the state division of Auburn in the mid-1930s. There was every reason-what with the factions, politics and divisions in the New South Wales Labor party in the 1920s-to find a side that would fight Lang for you, such as Chifley's official New South Wales Labor Party. I totally reject the assertion that the Labor party did anything wrong to Tom Mutch. ger! Mutch left the Labor Party at the end of the 1920s because he had fallen out with Lang! Everyone fell out with Lang but not everyone left. Some joined with Ben Chifley and tinued to fight for the things they believed It is a fascinating thing to look at the conservative side of politics and at what actually happened in the division of Werriwa in 1934. Quite remarkably, between 1931 and 1934 the seat was held by Walter Ramsay MCNicoll, David MCNicoll's father, who at the time was the Principal of the Presbyterian Ladies College at Goulburn. MCNicoll get the chance to contest the election against Lazzarini in 1934 because he must have been knocked off by Tom Mutch for the UAP preselection. So Mutch has a fairly nefarious background in these matters. Once he left the Labor Party, for no good reason, he became a Labor rat; deserted the Labor cause. Once he did that, he well. must have knocked off the sitting memberagain, the member for Bradfield would relate to these things-in the seat of Werriwa and, in turn, unsuccessfully contested that seat against Bert Lazzarini, who went on to hold the seat with great distinction from 1934 1952, serving as a minister in the Chifley government. The Mutches have no cause for complaint. These were things in their own hands. They were masters of their own destiny. Tom fostering Mutch could have joined the fight with ley against Lang, or joined anyone of the many factions that were disputing those issues to in the New South Wales Labor Party. I note with interest that Mutch returned to local government in the 1930s. He contested in a by-election for the state seat of Coogee in June 1938, which he won, having earlier been unsuccessful in contesting the seat of Bathurst. So this fellow was a bit of a carpetbagger-and again, the member for Bradfield, who moved from Tasmania to Sydney, would the relate to this. Mutch tried Werriwa, which then took in the south-west of New South Wales, tried the state seat of Bathurst in the beginning of 1938 and then in June of that year ended up in Coogee. Talk about a travelling minstrel show! Talk about a carpetbagI think the Mutches have little cause for complaint in the history of these things. The new member for Cook should accept the conhistory that I have placed on the parliain. mentary record and accept that he has no gripe with the Australian Labor Party. If he has a gripe he should look through the family history and give the House a full account of his great-uncle'S folly in leaving the Australian Labor Party, ratting on the Australian Labor Party. He has no gripe and should rest those things easily, rest those things happily, did not in the Mutch family archives. Coolangatta Airport",87
201,Mr ANTHONY,ADJOURNMENT,"I first congratulate the member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) on a very esteemed appointment as secretary of the Malaysia he Friendship Association, and I do wish him I notice in the House there has been a lot of debate about Sydney's proposal for Badgerys Creek and for Holsworthy, but there is another airport that is of closer interest to my heart-Coolangatta airport. It is Australia's to sixth busiest airport, on the border of New South Wales and Queensland-Tweed Heads and Coolangatta. This is another airport facing critical testing when it comes to aircraft noise and the balance that has to be achieved by a critical tourism industry for that Chifarea-the Gold Coast and Northern Riversand also trying to rectify the noise issue which has now permeated the Tweed Heads area. The Coolangatta airport is the closest airport to any GPO in Australia, being three kilometres away. Indeed, over 25,000 people in New South Wales are directly affected by being under the flight paths. I would like to explain to the House that the government is taking a number of measures to ascertain the level of aircraft noise, and this will be used a blueprint to establish ANEF zones and ANEFCs for Tweed Heads and also for Currumbin. Airservices Australia has three noise monitoring devices currently in place now. These will be used to facilitate and audit. From the audit that will be complete halfway through this year, new contour lines will be drawn and obviously new flight paths will be established. One of the problems is that the previous Minister for Transport, who has gained quite a lot of notoriety in this House in the last couple of months, deliberately altered flight paths-it was with his full knowledge-which caused unnecessary concern to many residents in the Tweed Heads area. That is why we have a substantial noise problem which came about by the direction of the member whom I have replaced. There are a couple of critical issues with this airport that need to be addressed. I would certainly like the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to come to Coolangatta at the closest opportunity to look at the implementation of a limited curfew and to look at perhaps putting pressure on some particular operators-turbo props coming in the middle of the night, notably the paper plane, which does concern a lot of residents directly under the flight path. Great consideration also needs to be given to whether Coolangatta airport should have a runway extension, which would really be the precursor for internationalisation. Whilst our airport is critical for domestic traffic and New Zealand traffic, great care and consideration needs to be given if it is to be an international airport because of the added pressure that wide-bodied aircrafts would place on the residents of Tweed Heads and Currumbin. In conclusion, I ask that Airservices provide all the information to relevant interest groups within the Tweed Heads area, namely, the noise action group comprising Jim Boydell, Rupt Granot and Ronnie Hoskinson in cooperation with the FAC, of which Maurie Rowe is the chairman. It is a critical airport. For the future of our electorate and Northern Rivers, getting the right balance between the as residents and the future growth in tourism is of key importance. Legal Aid",88
202,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak in relation to legal aid. Last August there was a great fanfare in Dickson. The former Prime Minister and the former member for Dickson descended on the electorate of Dickson with great fanfare and the 'Justice for all' statement was launched. Anyone who was in practice, especially those who practised in legal aid areas, as I did, knew that it was the greatest farce one had ever seen in one's life. 'Justice for all' was anything but justice for all. The former member for Dickson spoke of the need to have a system whereby lawyers did speculative work. The implication was that lawyers ought to be made to do speculative work. I think he said that from now on lawyers would be made to do speculative work. I practised in the speculative area a great deal. In fact, for the last couple of years my practice would have been of the order of 70 per cent speculative work. That came about because so many people could not get legal aid. Frequently one had to advise the people with the tough case: 'Look, you've got a difficult case. I think you've got some prospect, but it is a very difficult case.' Inevitably, that sort of advice to the legal aid office was the kiss of death for people seeking redress. I can think of one particular example during also that last 12 months. A lady came to me seeking my advice in relation to the death of her husband in a hospital on the north coast. I was involved in the inquest related to that case. She came to seek my advice as to whether or not an action existed under Lord Campbell's act for the wrongful death of her husband. I looked at the matter in as quick a fashion as I could because Legal Aid was not prepared to fund such an advice. Legal Aid said, 'You give us an advice and we will make a decision.' Inevitably in a case like that my advice would have been, 'It will be a very difficult case; however, it is a matter that should proceed.' I knew what Legal Aid's response would have been. They would have said, 'No way in the world will we fund it.' The next question would be whether or not counsel would be able to spec the case. In other words, they would take the case on and if the case was successful-that means if damages were recovered-the barrister and solicitors would be paid. That particular proposition seems attractive on its face, but it inevitably is not attractive. Those sorts of cases would be taken on sometimes. Because of the absolute starvation on legal aid it has tended to happen more and more in recent years. Invariably, it was not the hard cases that were taken on. The cases that were taken on were ones where some reasonable prospects of success were envisaged. It would come close to the time when the court proceedings were coming to a head. Invariably delays would have preceded that, sometimes of the order of eight to 10 years, and the cost would be enormous. The out-ofpocket situation for the solicitor and frequently counsel was also enormous. You would get to the situation where the workers compensation board, more so than the compulsory third party insurers, I might say, would put the proposition of a settlement to counsel and solicitors acting for the plaintiff. Counsel and solicitors were put in that awful situation where frequently a very ordinary settlement was offered. The one thing counsel and solicitors had in front of them was the chance of getting paid for eight to 10 years work. It is not a good situation for counsel and solicitors to be placed in. That is why I suggest that we must look at that and perhaps create a fund, tax the fund-tax funds that are recovered-and have a fund held in trust so that an ongoing system can be provided to help people with those hard cases. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Dr Wooldridge to move: That the regulations contained in Statutory Rules 1996 No. 25, made under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, be disallowed. Mr Allan Morris to move: That the House: (1) condemns the Government's decision to close offices of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) in regional Australia; (2) notes that (a) this decision will deprive millions of Australians in regional Australia of direct access to officers 'of the Department, (b) the Minister responsible was a contributing member of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs' inquiry into migrant access and equity and supported its recommendations and (c) the deprivation of these services will seriously disadvantage regional Australia and totally contradicts the Government's stated intention of encouraging migrants to settle outside the capital cities; (3) expresses its appreciation of the staff of DIMA offices in Townsville, Newcastle, Chatswood, Wollongong, Sunshine and Geelong for their dedication and recognition of the quality of the services they have provided to their communities; and (4) requests the Government to reconsider this decision as a matter of urgency.

Of course, the money we are of what the forward estimates suggested for the targeted public sector and, in fact, a public OECD. There are few more rigorously targeted and focused on social outcomes anywhere in the which public sector is the best, but it is a good a targeted public sector and it is one where the outcomes. It makes a stark contrast with what we see announced as public policy, and what we fear the government parties in opposition and leaks they have been in government. of some of the cuts, but what concerns There seems to be no picture of the sort of pubsector we will have at the end of this project is coming next-the Commission of Audit-or after just a question of what public sector employment very important to many Australians.

NA MC 1572 MAIN COMMITTEE The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, outlined, sufficiently comprehensively so that it target-the so-called black hole-is a fiction. whatever reason, this government has set itself is arithmetically unavoidable: there can be public sector salary budget is only $1.5 billion. nobody, the only reason it would save more the cheques and provide the services. The salary the government has created for itself. One of the very intriguing questions about the new figures that came out yesterday-from show changed economic growth performance. the $8 billion figure-even on the basis of the that led them to that faulty conclusion-the going to get the $8 billion worth of cuts, anyway, growth figures are more encouraging and the government's figuring. We wonder whether the government will be flexible. We also wonder a magic wand and produce a balanced budget, being proposed, and about which speculation encouraged. The problem that concerns me is not that and important but it is one that is being debated questions. One is that many of the cuts are and the other is the related question of what Australian economy. If you have a vision like, it would seem to me inevitably to have technology, manufacturing and services; a commitment to a skilled work force. But what are we seeing? We are seeing in for cuts to research and development. I still are certainly in prospect. We see cuts to the ideas by the vandalism being proposed to Employment, Education, Training and Youth information technology industry, there is a purchase of IT equipment and services by industry is expressing concern about the implications market development grants scheme and its very the year 2000.

Those industries set themselves the road to achieving them. Four of the elements support for research and development; government and its research and development function; government Tuesday, 28 May 1996 the shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans), has needs no reiteration, the fact that the $8 billion Cuts of that level are not needed. But, for a target of $8 billion worth of cuts. One thing no $8 billion worth of cuts from salaries as the If the Commonwealth wound up employing money is that there would be nobody to send out budget itself cannot solve this problem that this very convenient figure of $8 billion is that reading the media releases on the AAP wireThe figures makes it clear that in relation to government's calculations, even on the premise gap is narrowing. We wonder whether we are even if that should generate a surplus. The deficit is less than that projected, even on the $8 billion figure is set in stone or whether the whether the government will be able to wave without the stringent cuts that are currently is being engendered and sometimes, I think, broader macro-economic question; that is profound by others.

(2) Has native title been granted in respect of any site in mainland Australia. (3) How many persons, and at what cost, have been appointed to administer the Native Title Act in each year since the Act commenced. (4) What are the details of the total cost of administering the Act in each year since it commenced. (5) What would have been the outcome if the sum referred to in part (4) had been spent on purchasing land for Aboriginal persons. Total Total Staff Cost in $ millions (4) The following table reflects the costs of administration NT A commenced. As for the answer to (3) above difficult to ascertain as staff numbers and functions reported. Also the table does not include several staff who may occasionally be working Department or Agency National Native Title Tribunal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission ** Attorney-General's Department - Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission - Legal Aid and Family Services - Office of General Counsel Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Total * This is the estimate for the full financial year. ** This figure includes the funding provided (5) There would be more Aboriginal owned land. The NT A would also not have been administered. Without the NT A processes for establishing whether native title exists, lengthy common law actions would proliferate, overburdening both federal and state judicial systems with native title claims.",137
239,Mr HOWARD,WA TANGNEY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The substantive provisions of the Native Title Act 1993 (NTA) commenced on 1 January 1994. (2) No native title has yet been recognised on the mainland. (3) The number of staff and the exact cost is difficult to ascertain as staff numbers and functions fluctuated in different agencies during the years reported. This table provides the number of employees of Government Departments and Agencies engaged entirely or predominantly in work relating to the administration of the NTA, and the approximate cost of employing them. 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 37 98 193 2.136 4.925 7.087 each financial year (in $ millions) since the it should be noted that the exact costs of staff are fluctuated in different agencies during the years Commonwealth agencies and departments which have on issues related to the NTA. 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96* 0.8 6.633 18.128 7.544 13.727 27.289 0.138 1.213 1.238 0.075 0.932 0.975 0.67 0.67 0.67 0.012 0.227 0.208 0.271 0.482 0.796 9.51 23.884 49.304 for Native Title Representative Bodies. It is not possible to predict the impact of a slew of common law claims on the cost of administering the courts, but it is reasonable to assume that these would be greater than the costs of administering the claims process under the NT A, which aims to reduce costs by emphasising mediation.",142
