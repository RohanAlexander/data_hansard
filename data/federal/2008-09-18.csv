4,Mr BURKE,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"It was not the member for Gippsland seeking a briefing from my office yesterday but another of his National Party colleagues, who was constructively engaging with the office. I have subsequently offered to the member a departmental briefing, which I understand he has accepted. In addition, I have looked into his concerns about responses to correspondence which were raised in the House yesterday. I can assure him that I am responding to the now 43 letters he has sent to me about EC matters-the first of which arrived on 20 Augustincluding the 13 which were received yesterday, six of them after question time. FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY NA NA AMENDMENT (FURTHER 2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Griffin, for Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
5,Mr GRIFFIN,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will provide the legislation for certain further budget and other measures affecting the portfolios of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs. The bill includes several amendments relating to the maternity immunisation allowDrought ance. This lump sum payment of $243.30 (from 20 September) encourages families to protect their small children by having them immunised. The allowance is currently paid for children aged between 18 months and two years if they are immunised to the recommended level or have a formal exemption. In the first maternity immunisation allowance measure in the bill, the allowance will be restructured to bring it more closely into line with the National Immunisation Program and give parents an incentive to have their four-year-olds given the recommended boosters before they start school. This will be done by paying the allowance in two payments for children who meet the 18-month and four-year-old immunisation requirements. The first payment will be paid when the child is aged between 18 months and two years and the second when the child is aged between four years and five years. The change will apply from January 2009 to eligible families who have not already been paid the full allowance. The new half payment rate, initially $121.65, will vary with continued indexation of the full rate of the allowance twice a year. In practice, the second payment may be higher than the first because of any intervening indexation. Among the important immunisations currently recommended for four-year-olds that will be encouraged by this measure are diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, mumps, german measles and polio. This measure should result in many Australian children having a better overall level of immunisation, consistent with the recommendations of the National Immunisation Program. In a second maternity immunisation allowance measure, the bill will extend eligibility for the allowance to children adopted from outside Australia who enter Australia before turning 16. Older adopted children will need to be immunised between 18 months and two years after arrival. Currently, families must claim the allowance within two years of the child's birth and must meet the recommended immunisation levels before the child turns two. Clearly, these age two requirements are not workable for older children adopted from overseas. This measure extends the allowance for those older children to reinforce the message provided by this payment in support of immunisation for children in the Australian community. This measure is an equity measure that gives effect to recommendation 10 of the 2005 House of Representatives Family and Human Services Committee inquiry into overseas adoption in Australia, which recommended: … the Minister for Family and Community Services amend the eligibility criteria for the maternity immunisation allowance in the case of children adopted from overseas so the eligibility period is two years after the child's entry to lia. The government is now implementing this important recommendation. The amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act included in this bill will cease eligibility for partner service pension for those partners who are separated but not divorced from their veteran spouse and who have not reached pension age. Under this measure, eligibility for partner service pension will cease 12 months after separation or if the veteran enters into a marriage-like relationship. A spouse who is a member of an illness separated couple remains the partner of a veteran and therefore does not lose eligibility for partner service pension. A couple who are illness separated must be unable to live together in the matrimonial home because of the illness or infirmity of either or both of them. Certain assessment criteria must be met. The amendments will also set the eligible age at 50 years for the partner service pension for the partner of a veteran who is in receipt of the equivalent of or less than special rate but above general rate disability pension or who has at least 80 impairment points under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Partners of veterans affected by this measure under the Veterans' Entitlements Act are those where the veteran is in receipt of: - general rate disability pension that is increased by an amount specified in any of the items 1 to 6 of the table in subsection 27(1); - extreme disablement adjustment disability pension; - intermediate rate disability pension; and - temporary special rate disability pension. Lastly, the bill will make some minor Austraamendments to the child support legislation. In particular, amendments are included to address some minor anomalies in relation to the child support formula reforms that commenced on 1 July 2008. One such anomaly that was identified relates to Child Support Agency-CSAdecisions about care. The amendments to the legislation will ensure that, in all situations where parents agree on the level of care for a child, that level of care will be reflected accurately in the assessment. Another amendment included in this bill will ensure that the CSA can make departure prohibition orders-DPOs-which prevent parents with a child support debt from leaving the country without paying, or making arrangements to pay, those outstanding amounts. The recent amendments which moved the DPO provisions from regulations into primary legislation unintentionally removed the ability for the CSA to issue a DPO for certain registrable overseas maintenance liabilities. The proposed amendments would allow the CSA to issue a DPO for international parents on a similar basis as for domestic parents.  journed. NA AMENDMENT (TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Debus. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
6,Mr DEBUS,FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Financial Transaction Reports Act was Australia's original anti-money-laundering legislation. Importantly, the act provided for the reporting of certain transactions and transfers to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, otherwise known as AUSTRAC. Many of the obligations in the FTR Act will soon be replaced with updated measures under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. The Financial Transaction Reports Amendment (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2008 will enable regulated businesses to continue reporting important information to AUSTRAC as they make the transition to the new reporting regime. The AML/CTF Act is being implemented over two years from 12 December 2006. The government has also provided a 15-month ‘policy principles period' after the commencement of each set of obligations under this act. During that period, the AUSTRAC chief executive officer may only apply for a civil penalty order against a reporting entity for a contravention of the act if the reporting entity has failed to take reasonable steps to comply with its obligations. This staggered implementation, along with the policy principles period, is allowing business time to develop the necessary compliance systems in the most cost-effective way. Items 1 and 2, and 7 to 11 establish transitional provisions under the FTR Act. These provisions authorise cash dealers to continue reporting suspicious transactions, international funds transfer instructions and significant cash transactions to AUSTRAC until 11 March 2010 or until they become compliant with the new obligations under the AML/CTF Act, whichever occurs first. The date 11 March 2010 accords with the day that the policy principles period expires. Item 3 will allow regulated financial institutions to continue to place relevant transactions in their exemption register. Again, they will be able to do this until they either become compliant with the reporting obligations under the AML/CTF Act or, if they do not become compliant, up until the end of 11 March 2010. This will ensure that appropriate records can continue to be maintained by the financial institution until this date. Items 4, 5 and 6 amend the reporting obligations imposed on solicitors. The amendments will enable solicitors who are reporting entities under the AML/CTF Act to continue to provide reports about significant cash transactions to AUSTRAC under the FTR Act. They will be able to provide these reports up until the end of 11 March 2010, or until they become compliant with the reporting obligations under the AML/CTF Act, if that occurs first. It is important to note that the amendments will not create any duplication in reporting obligations. In summary, the bill contains several amendments to the FTR Act which will assist businesses to make the transition from regulation under the FTR Act to regulation under the AML/CTF Act. In particular, the amendments will ensure that those businesses can continue to report important information to AUSTRAC during the transitional period.  journed. NA NA AUTHORITY BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Rudd, for Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
7,Mr RUDD,DONATION AND TRANSPLANTATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Earlier this year we opened up the doors of parliament to the people of Australia for the Australia 2020 Summit. We did so looking for new ideas for our nation's long term future-ideas for tackling the nation's future challenges. Many constructive ideas came forward, and later this year the government will be responding to each of them. One of the key ideas discussed for the future of Australia's health and hospitals system was to establish a national organ donation scheme. And that is why today I introduce, with some pride, to the House the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority Bill 2008-to provide the national leadership that Australia needs to lift organ donation rates and make it possible for our expert transplant doctors and health professionals to save many more lives, and return many Australians to good health. For too long, organ donation rates in Australia have lagged behind many other nations, despite high levels of community support for organ donation. For too long, Australians have been left desperately waiting, month after month, for a transplant that could mean the difference between a normal, healthy life and debilitating chronic illness-and, in some cases, the difference between life and death. For too long, people have talked about the need to lift organ donation rates but there has been no national leadership to take action on that goal. And for too long, we have failed to act despite projections of a rising prevalence of chronic disease, an ageing population and, as a result, increased needs for organ transplants. Last year, we made it clear that this government intends to end the blame game between the Commonwealth and the states and take responsibility for reforming our health and hospitals system. That the government I would lead would get on with getting things right. Today, the government delivers on that commitment. Today, I stand before the House to move a bill that forms a central part of a national plan to reduce unnecessary suffering for thousands of Australians who are waiting for transplants. Today, I move a bill that will help to honour our commitment to establishing Australia as a world leader for organ donation and transplantation. Organ transplants in Australia As Australians we are fortunate to live in a nation that has long been a world leader in the clinical outcomes we achieve for transplant patients-a nation where more than 90 per cent of people support organ donation. Yet we are also a nation with a very long-far too long-waiting list for transplant procedures. At any one time there are 1,800 Australians currently on waiting lists for an organ donation that could save or transform their life. Last year, there were just 198 deceased organ donors in Australia. This resulted in 657 transplants-meeting just one-third of demand. We should not tolerate so many Australians languishing on waiting lists for want of national leadership to lift organ donor rates. Despite the high quality of clinical care across our nation, we lag well behind many other developed countries in organ donations. The International Registry of Organ Donation and Transplantation reports that, in Australia, there were just 9.8 donors for every one million people in 2006. In contrast: - Spain had 33.8 donors for every one million persons-more than three times higher than Australia. - The United States had 26.9 donors for every million persons-more than 2½ times the rate in Australia. While Spain and the United States are world leaders respectively, Australia's ranking for organ donors per million population was behind Belgium, Austria, France, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Poland, the Netherlands, Argentina, Denmark, Switzerland and the UK. We need to do much, much better. This is simply not good enough-not for today, and especially not for the future. In the decades ahead of us we will have an older population, and a population with a much higher incidence of chronic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Several of those chronic diseases can result in the need for a transplant. Consider kidney disease. More than three-quarters of people waiting for an organ transplant are in need of a kidney. Even now, one in three Australian adults face an elevated risk of developing chronic kidney disease. And the incidence of kidney disease is almost certain to rise further, because of its link to other chronic diseases. Australia also has a high prevalence of hepatitis C infection. Hepatitis C infection causes increased rates of chronic liver disease, resulting in a greater need for liver transplants. Reducing costly waiting lists There are many other donor organs that are likely to be in greater need in the years ahead. The long waiting list for transplants also imposes significant costs on our health and hospitals system. For example, the cost for each person waiting on a kidney transplant is $83,000 per annum if they are receiving hospital based kidney dialysis. In contrast, the cost of a kidney transplant is just $65,000 per recipient for the first and only $11,000 for each year thereafter. Australians awaiting a transplant require extensive, expensive and time-consuming treatment. That can make it harder for them to carry on work, to play an active role in their community and to enjoy a reasonable quality of life, all of which are important. Lifting organ donor rates will help us build a more efficient health system and help sick Australians back to full participation in work and in the community. Restoring healthy lives for recipients But above all the reason why we must lift the number of organ donations is that, by doing this, we can help save and transform the lives of thousands of Australians of all ages. Let me mention just one example. A fortnight ago I informed the House that I had the privilege of meeting with Cordelia Whatman, her parents, big sister Octavia and grandparents. Cordelia had just returned home to her family and to Canberra after four months in hospital. For those of you who are not familiar with Cordelia's story, she was diagnosed with biliary artesia at 10 weeks. Biliary artesia is a chronic liver problem that affects vital body functions. Having undertaken an unsuccessful procedure in July 2007, Cordelia had been suffering from severe jaundice, a broken leg, lethargy, debilitation and inability to gain weight. But just a few weeks ago, that all changed. And it all changed for one reason-a donor organ became available to her. The transplant operation was performed at year, the Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney. Cordelia had a 13-doctor medical team, headed by Dr Albert Shun and Dr Michael Stormon. Each member of that team is to be congratulated. Shortly after, Cordelia was discharged from hospital, the transplant operation a success. Cordelia had to wait more than a year on a transplant waiting list. During that long wait, Cordelia was becoming increasingly sick. Indeed, the doctors had declared an operation urgent, and Cordelia's mother was only days from providing a liver donation herself. That operation could have placed her mother's life at risk. But it was made unnecessary when a donor organ finally became available. Today, Cordelia can look forward to a healthy life-because of the selfless act of a donor and their family. And we thank them. Cordelia's donor also provided six other organs, potentially saving the lives of others with their decision. In Australia today there are some 30,000 people who like Cordelia have benefited from an organ or tissue transplantation in this country. We have some of these people with us here today, as well as some who are among the 1,800 now waiting for a transplant. I would like particularly to acknowledge some of them who are with us today in the gallery: Felix Bulmer, aged 17, who benefited from a corneal graft that has dramatically improved his vision; Russell MCGowan, who has had a bone marrow transplant; Marjorie Taylor, the mother of Annette Taylor who expressed her wish to become an organ donor before her death at the age of just 13. Marjorie took it to then Prime Minister Whitlam to ensure that her daughter could go through with her wish-and so she became the first organ donor in the ACT. That was more than 30 years ago. These are just three of the 30,000 Australians who can tell a story of how an organ transplant can transform your life. Transplantation makes it possible for people of all ages to enjoy those things that we too often take for granted-the ability to live free of debilitating disease, the ability to live a fit and active life, the ability to continue as a healthy member of their family and community. The government is determined to make transplants possible for many more Australians. And that is why-and that is the only reason why-this bill is before the House today. A new nationally coordinated approach When we look at the nations that have enjoyed most success with organ donor rates, we learn one clear lesson. National leadership is needed to drive the change necessary to improve rates of organ donation. The nations that lead the world in organ donation and transplantation rates all have national systems to coordinate and drive this program actively within each individual hospital. Those national frameworks are supported by ongoing community and professional education. The bill that comes before the House today reflects international best practice. It forms a core part of the reform package that the government announced on 2 July this year, to lift Australia to world's best practice in organ and tissue donation for transplantation. The government has committed $151.1 million towards this objective, including $136.4 million in new funds. This is not cheap. To do it well takes money, and we are determined to invest this money. And this package was endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments when it met on 3 July. The national plan consists of five key steps: 1. $46 million to introduce a coordinated, consistent approach and systems under the leadership of a new, independent national authority-the Australian Organ Donation and Transplantation Authority-that is established under the bill that is before the House today. 2. $67 million to employ trained medical specialists and other staff dedicated to organ donation who will work closely with emergency department and intensive care unit teams in selected public and private hospitals across Australia. 3. $17 million in new funding for hospitals to meet additional staffing, bed and infrastructure costs associated with organ donation. 4. $13.4 million towards raising community awareness and building public confidence in Australia's donation for a transplantation system. 5. $1.9 million for counsellors to support donor families. This is a comprehensive plan, based on international best practice, that aims in the long term to establish Australia as a world leader in organ donation for transplantation. It will mean that: - potential donors are properly identified at hospitals across the country; - every family of a potential donor will be asked about organ donation; - a dedicated specialist will work with the potential donor and their family to provide support through what is often a very, very difficult process; - hospital staff will be able to focus on donor care knowing that the hospital has a separate budget to cover organ and sue donation; - families receive the support they need at the time of organ donation and afterwards; and - there is an equitable and safe process for managing transplant waiting lists and allocating organs once they become available - train professional staff to do that; One of the most important parts of this plan is to tackle the point at which our organ donor system is currently failing. That is in the emergency wards and intensive care units of our hospitals. Currently-and this is the core, practical problem-we do not have dedicated staff trained to help families through the difficult circumstances which they confront at that point and under which they may consent And with the pressures placed on our hospitals-and they are great-it is often difficult for clinicians to have these sensitive and delicate conversations with the families of potential donors. This problem is compounded by the lack of dedicated hospital resources to manage the clinical procedures necessary for an organ or tissue transplant. This explains why, despite an increase of one million in the number of organ donor registrations since 2002 to a total of six lion registrations, there has been no increase in the number of lives being saved through transplants. That is what we are trying to solve and deal with through this legislation. The majority of resources in the national plan will be dedicated to addressing this particular practical problem. The Organ Donation and Transplantation Authority The Australian Organ Donation and tis- Transplantation Authority will work with states, territories, clinicians, consumers and the community sector to build a world leading system for Australia. The authority will: - coordinate clinicians and other hospital staff dedicated to organ and tissue donation in hospitals across the country; - oversee a new national network of state and territory organ and tissue donation agencies; - introduce and manage a national data and reporting system; - lead ongoing community awareness programs about organ and tissue donation and transplantation; and work with clinical and professional organisations in developing clinical practice protocols and standards. The authority will enable all families of potential donors to be asked about donation. It will work with clinicians, hospitals and community organisations to educate people about donation, support families through this decision, and make sure that suitable patients will be considered as potential donors. It will encourage Australians to discuss their wishes with their family-it is a very mildifficult conversation to have-and provide every family of a potential donor the information, knowledge and support to choose donation. And, as a matter of reassurance, I note that the bill before the House today will in no way impede or restrict existing regulations for ensuring the safety of organ or tissue transplants - Gift of Life; Recent progress Since making the announcement earlier this year, the government is getting on with the task of putting this system into practice. All state and territory governments have signed up to the best practice national planand I thank them for it. Each of the states is working under the leadership of the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer to implement this plan. Work is on track to establish the national authority by 1 January 2009. The positions of CEO and Medical Director of the new authority have been advertised. Recruitment for new medical and nursing jobs in hospitals will commence as soon as possible. Preparation for a national community awareness campaign for launch in early 2009 is underway. Conclusion I would like to conclude my remarks on this bill with a few additional points. First, I would like to thank those organ donors and the members of families who have lost loved ones and who have assisted at a time of great personal distress and diffiof culty for them. Second, I would like to say thank you to the organisations that have played such an important role in promoting awareness of the importance of organ donation and who have helped the development of the government's national plan: - The Transplantation Society of Australia and New Zealand; The Cognate Committee on Organ and Tissue Donation; - Transplant Australia; - Zaidee's Foundation; and - ShareLife. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution from the Chief Medical Officer, John Horvath, as well as Jane Halton, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing. Third, on a personal level as the recipient of a tissue transplant some years ago, I want to place on record my own debt of gratitude to the doctors, the health professionals and the community that has promoted organ and tissue transplants for so many years. Finally, I would like to make an appeal to all Australians. If you are not now on the organ donor list, please think about it and get your name on to it. Maybe that is a practical challenge for us all here: to make sure in the next few weeks that every member of this House and of the other place has made sure that they have made that decision with their family. I would also make this appeal to the nation's media: get behind this particular proposal. I thank the media for the work that they have already done. I have noticed that whenever our friends in the media get behind this, and we have good and positive stories successful transplants, one thing happens: effective donation rates go up. This is a critical piece in the jigsaw. I thank the media for what they have done and I encourage them to continue to do it into the future. It really does help. I appeal to all Australians to talk to their family about this matter. Your family makes critical choices if ever the day arrives when it might be your organs that can save the lives of others. It is an extraordinary gift of an individual and their family, made in often very tragic circumstances. Lifting the level of organ transplants in Australia requires a cooperative and concentrated effort from the Australian government, from state and territory governments, from health professionals, from community organisations and most of all from the whole Australian community. This bill is a major step forward in coordinating our nation's efforts to save lives and restore quality of life for thousands of Australians. I thank the officials for their work in preparing this bill, given that I have been more than usually demanding in making sure that this bill was ready on time. I thank them for it, because they have really worked up against it. So my challenge to the nation is: let's get on with it. I commend the bill to the House.",20
8,Mr TURNBULL,DONATION AND TRANSPLANTATION,"I move: That the debate be adjourned. In moving that the debate be adjourned on the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority Bill 2008, and on indulgence, I congratulate the Prime Minister for bringing forward this bill. The coalition strongly supports the objectives of this bill. Promoting organ donation is a vital national objective. It is something we pursued when we were in government. We are delighted that it is being pursued with new measures under this government, and the Prime Minister can count on our support on this legislation and on other measures in the future. If this legislation proves to be inadequate, we will continue to work in a genuine bipartisan fashion to promote organ donation. Very briefly, on behalf of the opposition I add my encouragement to the media to promote organ donation. Awareness is absolutely vital. I acknowledge, too, the generosity and the courage of organ donors and their families and the powerful advocacy of the organisations that have promoted awareness throughout the community. They have done great work and, again, we are delighted to support this legislation. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE) BILL 2008 Cognate bills: OFFSHORE PETROLEUM (ANNUAL FEES) AMENDMENT (GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE) BILL 2008 NA (REGISTRATION FEES) AMENDMENT (GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE) BILL 2008 OFFSHORE PETROLEUM (SAFETY LEVIES) AMENDMENT (GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 September, on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson: That this bill be now read a second time.",26
9,Mr RUDD,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"The legislation that is before the House today is an important part of the government's long-term strategy to tackle climate change. The Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 provides the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework for carbon dioxide capture and geological storage. It will establish the foundations for the development of a greenhouse gas storage industry in Australia and it forms an important part of Australia's response to climate change. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges for the future for Australia, for our region and for both the industrialised and developing worlds. It is a challenge with enormous economic, national security, environmental and moral implications. How Australia responds to this challenge now will have a great impact on the future-our economy, our future prosperity, our environment and also our national security. The scientific evidence of climate change continues to accumulate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year predicted rises of between 1.1 and 6.4 degrees over the next century relative to the period 1980 to 1999. As the government's green paper on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme noted in July: Under a high emissions scenario, average temperatures across Australia are expected to rise by up to 5 degrees by 2070. The IPCC concluded that Australia's water resources, coastal communities, natural ecosystems, energy security, agriculture and tourism would all be vulnerable to climate change impacts if global temperatures rise by 3 degrees or more. The expert analysis points to severe global consequences and severe national consequences. These include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, more frequent droughts, floods and water shortages, large scale migration, increased threats to border security, the loss of infrastructure, civil unrest and regional conflict over increasingly scarce resources. Climate change will also have significant national security implications in our region, with many Pacific island nations exposed to severe and early impacts from rising sea levels. Australia is more exposed to the impact of climate change than probably any other industrialised nation, particularly through its impact on our agriculture, water supplies, tourism industry and environment. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forecast last year that by 2020 significant loss of biodiversity will occur in some ecologically rich sites, including the Great Barrier Reef and the Queensland wet tropics. Climate modelling by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology suggests that rainfall in southern Australia could be reduced by up to 10 per cent by 2030 and by 20 per cent by 2050. Acting now is the responsible thing to do, and that is what this bill is all about. We must prepare for a global transition to a lowcarbon economy. To delay any longer, to stay in denial, as the climate change sceptics and some members opposite would have us do, is reckless and irresponsible. For our generation, for our kids and for future generations, we must act now. There is no alternative. The longer we take to act, the more Australia risks falling behind in the race to build the clean, green energy industries of the future, the industries that will drive a global ecohealth, nomic transformation and create the highpaid, high-skilled jobs of the future. The Australian government is determined to rise to the long-term challenge of climate change and the long-term challenge of threats to our water and our energy security. We have committed to the long-term target of reducing Australia's carbon pollution by 60 per cent below 2000 levels by 2050. The government's strategy to achieve that goal is based on three pillars that address immediate challenges while also preparing for the long term future: (1) reducing Australia's greenhouse emissions; (2) helping to shape a global solution; and (3) adapting to climate change that we cannot avoid. On the first of those pillars, the best way to reduce carbon pollution while building long-term economic prosperity is through a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This forms part of the government's overall approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A further approach lies in what we do on renewable energy. A third approach lies in what we will do to increase energy efficiency across Australia as well. Next year the government will introduce legislation to establish the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme for Australia. It will be the largest reform of the Australian economy in many decades. It is also the most important because, by helping to reshape the Australian economy, we can position ourselves to thrive in an increasingly carbon constrained world. The government recognises that any restructuring of the economy will affect some sectors more than others. That is why we have made a number of key commitments to protect the most vulnerable in our community and to support the most affected. It is also why we propose to provide assistance to the most heavily emissions intensive, trade exposed activities in the economy. The government is consulting widely with the Australian community and with the business community on the design of this scheme. The government is also committed to a range of policies and measures to complement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and help lower the costs in both the short and the long term, including energy efficiency measures, the support of clean coal, carbon capture and storage, as well as renewable energy technologies. Energy efficiency will not only lower the costs of production in carbon pollution; it will provide other benefits like improved energy security, innovation and productivity improvements, greater household comfort and lower costs of living. New low-emission technologies like renewable energy and carbon capture and storage will be critical in transforming our energy markets. The legislation before the House today tablishes the legislative framework to make carbon capture and storage activities possible will in Commonwealth offshore waters and to provide a management system for ensuring that that storage is secure. This bill is therefore crucial to Australia's overall response to the challenge of climate change. It will help make possible projects that will be supported by the government's National Low Emissions Coal Fund. That fund will be supported by our half-billion-dollar commitment to the Renewable Energy Fund to support the development and commercialisation of advanced renewable energy technologies in Australia. We have also committed $150 million to the Energy Innovation Fund, a fund that will support the creation of an Australian solar institute to fund solar thermal and solar photovoltaic research and development. Each of the programs established by this government aims to build links in what the Garnaut review describes as the innovation chain-the chain from early research to demonstration, and commercialisation to market uptake-to turn ideas into solutions. We recognise that addressing climate change will require a massive collaborative effort between our scientists, our research institutes, CSIRO flagships, the CO2 Cooperative Research Centre, private capital and energy businesses themselves. This collaboration will be particularly critical in developing clean coal technologies such as CCS. The government believes that this legislation and these investments are important because Australia has the potential to be a world leader in CCS technology. If we succeed in demonstrating CCS technology, many other nations are likely to follow. The bill therefore contributes also to the second pillar of our long-term plan to tackle climate change: helping to shape a global solution on climate change ahead of the Copenhagen es- climate change summit in December 2009. Australia is continuing to work closely with the international community, including China, the European Union, Japan, Indonesia and the United States, to develop an agreement that is effective and equitable. In the meantime, Australia is also working closely with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to address deforestation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide sustainable economic development here in our own region. Regardless of our efforts to reduce Australia's emissions and to shape an international solution, some impacts of climate change are now unavoidable, given the level of carbon pollution already in our atmosphere. That is why the third pillar of our climate change strategy is so important: adapting to the climate change we cannot avoid. The government is already investing significantly in initiatives to help those parts of Australia most exposed to the impacts of climate change, including our farming communities and coastal regions, as well as the Great Barrier Reef. We have also agreed to a National Climate Change Adaptation Framework with state and territory governments, which includes providing $50 million in funding for a national climate change research facility. Together, these initiatives represent a comprehensive plan to tackle the challenge of climate change-not to avoid the challenge of climate change. The government is investing $2.3 billion over five years in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in innovative technologies. This includes the National Low Emissions Coal Fund, half a billion dollars over eight years; the Renewable Energy Fund, half a billion dollars over six years; Energy Innovation Fund, $150 million over four years; the Green Car Innovation Fund, half a billion dollars; and the Clean Business Australia Fund, $240 million over four years. Through COAL21, the coal industry will be contributing an additional $1 billion to our Clean Coal Initiative-and I thank the industry for that. Direct beneficiaries of funding provided under the National Low Emissions Coal Fund will include the research community, technology developers, operators of demonstration projects and developers of CO2 storage sites and associated infrastructure. CCS technologies are important because coal is such an important part of Australia's economy both for domestic energy generation and export revenues. Eighty per cent of Australia's electricity comes from coal-fired power generation. While we build our renewable energy and gas capacity, coal will continue to provide most of Australia's electricity for decades to come. That also means it will continue to be a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Right now, more than 30 per cent of our total greenhouse gas emissions comes from the use of coal. That is why the development and deployment of low-emissions coal technologies are so important to achieving substantial reductions in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. Meeting our greenhouse target will require substantial greenhouse gas reductions from the operation of Australia's coal-fired power stations. CCS technology is also important for the long-term future of our coal exports. Coal is now Australia's largest source of export earnings, earning an estimated $43 billion in 2008-09. If Australia can play a role in developing low-emissions coal technologies, we can secure the long-term future of the coal industry in a world that in coming decades must transition to low-carbon energy the sources. Carbon capture and geological storage is a key component of the government's strategy to reduce carbon pollution from the operation of Australian coal-fired power stations. Through the National Low Emissions Coal Fund, the government will support the demonstration of postcombustion capture at coal-fired power stations and also the carbon storage aspects of CCS. The passage of this legislation is an important step forward in advancing the large scale development of CCS and making sure that we in Australia are prepared for the future. This legislation will mean that the Australian government will offer exploration acreage for carbon storage sites as early as next year. At the same time, the national carbon storage mapping project will identify the nation's most prospective areas and match them with demand locations. That way, we can prioritise the carbon storage exploration infrastructure task which lies ahead of us. This work will be carried out by a carbon storage task force led by Keith Spence and including representatives of industry, the labour and environmental movements and the research community-we are determined to get this right. The carbon storage task force will also work closely with the National Low Emissions Coal Council. As I have mentioned, this legislation will help position Australia as a world leader on CCS. Internationally, carbon capture and storage is recognised as a critical technology in reducing the emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere from both power generation and other activities. The recent G8 meeting in Hokkaido endorsed seven particular recommendations made by the International Energy Agency and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, which focused on two areas: firstly, demonstrating CO2 capture through a commitment to 20 industrial-scale CCS projects by 2010 to allow the broader development of this technology by 2020; and, secondly, taking concerted international action to partner financially, support and share information to build the development of CCS. CCS has the potential to be a major lowemissions technology. That is why we need legislation that can create the certainty to underpin investments in large-scale demonstration projects into the future. The legislarest tion before the House will help Australia to develop technologies that have the potential to make a major contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Australia and around the world. It is a critical element of creating an environment for investment in the low-carbon energy industries of the future. The Australian government believes we cannot continue with a do nothing approach-the do nothing approach which characterised the government which preceded us. Acting now is our responsibility. Acting for the long-term interest of the Australian economy is our responsibility. Acting now for the long-term interest of the planet is our responsibility. The market for low-carbon energy technologies is growing rapidly and it will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in the future. Australia has the choice to be a hub of clean-energy technologies and businesses or to simply become a follower, an importer of technologies developed elsewhere. We do not intend to do that. We intend to be on the front foot. That is what this legislation is about. And there is more to come. But we will only achieve the critical mass of research, innovation and investment in Australia if we begin to move to a low-carbon economy ourselves. That is why carbon capture and storage technologies, alongside the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the government's comprehensive response to climate change, are so critical to Australia's future. Some in the community caution us against acting. Some say it is better that we just do nothing on climate change-that we just wait until other nations act, until other nations develop these technologies, until other nations show us the way forward. That is not the attitude of this Australian government. Some say we are only a small country so whatever we do does not really matter for the of the world. That is not the attitude of this Australian government. I believe those arguments that have been advanced are just wrong. They are unprincipled, they are short sighted and they are absolutely reckless in relation to this nation's economic future. They are also out of step with the best Australian traditions-the traditions of innovation, initiative and being among the first to raise our hand when the world is looking for leadership. This bill is about Australia providing that leadership. It is about preparing for the future with the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework for carbon capture and storage projects. It is about building a strong foundation for the future and seizing a potentially very large market opportunity for the future. The government believes that Australia should not be a follower on climate change; the government believes Australia should be a leader on climate change. That underpins the legislation before the House. I commend the bill to the House.",26
10,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"It is always nice to follow the Prime Minister. I am very pleased to be able to discuss this legislation, the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 and related bills, for a number of reasons and I would like to highlight those as I go. Most especially, I want to commend this legislation for its pioneering element and I want to commend the Minister for Resources and Energy, who is at the table, for the excelwent lent work that he, his advisers and the department have done in producing what is fundamentally a framework piece of legislation to allow for what will be a very important part of our whole approach to carbon pollution reduction. In this instance we are talking of course about the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008, which will establish a framework to allow people to prepare with certainty into the future to capture and then store carbon dioxide in our offshore reservoirs safely and securely, and we will be able to share with the rest of the world the technologies that are going to be encouraged by this. It is absolutely essential that we take the lead in this pioneering role which we share with others throughout the world, and I would like to discuss some of those a little bit later on. Also, as the Prime Minister has just mentioned, this is part and parcel of a suite of legislation and schemes by which Australia, led by this government-so under this government-will attempt both to reduce carbon pollution in Australia and to make its contribution to reducing carbon pollution throughout the world. I think it is really important to note that by just about any measure the Australian population believe in this thing called climate change, even though it is rather amorphous at times, and that they believe climate change is occurring. Yesterday I was in this House listening to the member for Tangney, who essentially repudiated the whole argument and the science for the rationale behind climate change. I was absolutely aghast because I regard the member for Tangney as having intelligence and articulation particularly in areas that I am particularly interested in, such as education. But I was staggered by the member for Tangney's claim. But it was part and parcel of a contrary day for me yesterday. I came across contrariness everywhere I yesterday. It started with the member for Tangney then I picked up my newspapers and I came across the contrariness of others. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Bevis, along with you I have a passion for education, so I read in the newspaper comments by Mr Kevin Donnelly, Mr Contrary himself on education. It is Kevin Donnelly versus the rest of the world-and the rest of the world is wrong and he is right on education! I thought yesterday I would do a bit of historical reading and I came across Keith Windschuttle. Of course here we go again with this contrarian view of history that I was served up yesterday. So I thought I would go back for a bit of political comment and I came across Janet Albrechtsen's work. Here was another contrary view of life. Of course you have to have contrary views once in a while, but yesterday the member for Tangney was completely contrary as if nothing was happening with climate change and it was all just seasonal-and I was staggered. He was supposed to be talking on this legislationthat is what I found extraordinary-and I do not think we ever got to the detail of this islation. This legislation is our attempt to do what we should do anyway: seek to attempt to reduce our carbon pollution. This framework seeks to do that, and I am very proud to be part of all this. I am very proud to have been part of the excellent inquiry which we have just conducted on the inquiry brief that we were given by the Minister for Resources and Energy. I think the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources is great reading for anyone who is struggling to sleep at night! It is called Down under: greenhouse gas storage. It is beautifully named-and I do not know which member of the committee suggested that! Anyway, one does not want to claim too much credit. This is a significant piece of legislation and I was pleased to see that the minister directed this to a House of Representatives parliamentary committee-I thought that was fantastic-and I know that everyone on our committee was very pleased about that, and perhaps this process should be replicated more often in this place: put things in the House of Representatives parliamentary committees where we can do the robust investigation that we would like to do and hopefully arrive at consensus. I believe from the minister that, of all of our recommendations, there are perhaps two that we are going to discuss further-but that was a tremendous result and I do recommend this report to all my colleagues. I was very proud to be part of the inquiry and I congratulate the chair, my colleague the member for Lyons, for his work. So what does this legislation do? I am a simple man and I like things to be simplified for me and I hope that I can go through and look at some aspects of this legislation and simplify them. Most specifically, the legislation establishes access and property rights legfor the safe and secure injection and storage of greenhouse gases into stable subsurface geological reservoirs in Commonwealth waters. In other words, we want to try to capture and store the carbon dioxide that is produced, most especially in the electricity production industries, through coal in particular and then transport and inject it into the ground and under the ground offshore. That is the heart of it. It sounds like scary science. But in actual fact our understanding of geological formations is quite extensive, having been gained over many decades, so we do have a very good knowledge of the geological structures that these gases are going to be injected into. We also look forward to these processes encouraging other technologies. What else do we want to do? We want to provide project developers with certainty, because this is going to cost a lot of money. We want to be able to provide project developers with certainty. This is required to commit to major low-emissions energy projects involving CCS, carbon capture and storage. The legislation also allows for the establishment of an effective regulatory framework-we must have that-to ensure that projects meet health, safety and environmental requirements. Whatever we do has to be good science, good engineering, good technology and good for the environment. That means it will be good for all of us, and that is what this framework legislation seeks to do. What else will it do, simply? We want to create an environment in which industry can invest in CCS projects with confidence and to encourage the commercialisation of technologies which have the potential to play a vital role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions in the future. It is not just here; is worldwide. The great thing is that we will be able to offer our technologies to the world so that others can use them and our small footprint will become a larger footprint throughout the world. The legislation also provides for appropriate consultation and multiple use rights with other marine users. We are going into an environment that many people use, including fishing and petroleum industries, and we have to ensure pre-existing property and use rights are properly preserved. They have rights there, and we have to ensure that those rights are respected. This regulatory framework sets out to create a mechanism so that people can use and co-use locations for a variety of reasons, and we need to do that safely and legally. In effect, the proposed legislation recognises the need to, firstly, provide greenhouse gas injection and storage proponents with the certainty needed to bring forward investment; secondly, as I mentioned, preserve preexisting rights of the petroleum industry as far as practicable to minimise sovereign risk to existing titleholders' investment in Australian offshore resources; and, finally, provide assurance to the community that CO2 is stored in a safe and secure manner. What is the context for this? I come from the renewable capital of Australia, Tasmania, which is based on renewable energy. It is excellent that the relevant minister is at the table, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, and I am really looking forward to hearing more about MRETs and the regulations involved with expanding the MRETs so that wind energy, particularly in Tassie, will continue to roar ahead-so much so that we will have so many wind turbines in Tassie that it will take off! I look forward to that. But I realise that we are a fossil fuel dependent economy. I am not used it to brown and black coal; I thought they were racehorses where I come from. However, it is a reality that we are a fossil fuel dependent economy. Indeed, 80 per cent of Australia's electricity is generated from coal. That is a reality. So what do we do about it? First and foremost you face that reality and then you set out to clean it, and that is what this legislation is involved with, along with other policies of this government. Eighty per cent of our electricity is generated from coal. I also understand that some 40 per cent of the world's electricity needs are based on coal and this will grow to some 44 per cent by 2030. I also understand, as the Prime Minister just updated the figures for us, it will be a $43 billion export industry in 2008-09. We are the largest exporter of coal in the world. Thirty thousand direct jobs are associated with this industry, so it is not something that you can walk away from. Others would have us close it down. I talked about the contrariness of the member for Tangney. We have contrariness in other places. Coal is absolutely essential to our economy and to our future. We can certainly lead the world in what we can do with carbon capture and storage. So, for the non-scientific amongst us, what is involved with this carbon capture and storage, particularly in our offshore petroleum areas? CCS involves capturing greenhouse gas emissions, predominantly from coal-fired power stations, before they are released into the atmosphere, thus preventing the gases from entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change-not easily done technologically, I might say, but a fairly simple concept. The gas is then injected and stored deep under the ground in geological formations similar to those which have stored oil and gas for millions of years. The original term for CCS was carbon dioxide geosequestration, but we call it CCS because we live on acronyms-you have them for breakfast in this place. The only other place know that has more acronyms is Centrelink. They have extraordinary memories for acronyms. Anyway, CCS it is. That is what we use so that is what it will be. That is a nology that involves combined processes of capture, transport and geological storage of CO2, carbon dioxide, and/or other greenhouse gases. For my simple brain, greenhouse gases may be produced by the combustion of fossil fuels or co-produced as a result of oil and extraction or some industrial processes. Instead of allowing the gases to be released into the atmosphere, because they are dirty, they are captured at the emission site where they are separated from other substances. The separated stream is then compressed into a concentrated volume and transported from the source location to the injection location. Geological storage comprises the injection of the compressed stream into the geological formation in the deep subsurface, its migration away from the immediate vicinity of the injection point and its subsequent trapping in geological formations. I did a little bit of research, because the member for Tangney, the contrarian, yesterday was telling me how unsafe this practice could be. In that research I asked: are there other experiments with this? Is there some evidence to say that this can happen? I noticed that in Saskatchewan, Canada, CO2 is being used for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn field-there is a trip!-and in Poland CO2 is being used to help extract methane from coal beds that are too deep to mine, and, very interestingly, in the Norwegian North Sea, in the first direct sequestration project, naturally occurring CO2 is being stripped out of methane from the Sleipner field and reinjected into a deep saline formation for storage 900 metres below the seabed. Since that project started, over 10 years ago, one million tonnes of CO2 per year has been I injected, and seismic techniques have monitored the successful dispersion and trapping of the gas within the formation. I believe also that in BP's In Salah project in Algeria natutechrally occurring CO2 is being removed from natural gas and reinjected into the gas reservoir. Injection is at a rate of up to a million tonnes a year. There is experimentation going on in Australia. The Otway project in south-west Victoria, operated by CO2CRC, is the first CCS gas project in Australia and is the world's most advanced demonstration project based solely on storage without associated CO2 production. The project aims to demonstrate that up to 100,000 tonnes of CO2, extracted from a nearby natural accumulation, can be safely transported via a pipeline and injected and stored, while trialling a significant number of potential monitoring and verification techniques. To date, the Australian government has contributed in excess of $25 million to this important project. To find out a little bit more-if I may share this with you to conclude-I looked to Rick Causebrook in AusGeo News, No. 76, December 2004. In answering the question: ‘How long will CO2 be trapped in the storage areas?' Rick Causebrook wrote: The petroleum industry is over a hundred years old and during this time geologists and other scientists have been studying the conditions under which oil and gas are generated and trapped in the subsurface. For over 100 years they have been studying it. Further, he wrote: The importance of oil to the world economy since the middle of the twentieth century has meant considerable resources have been directed at understanding the environment in which hydrocarbon accumulations occur and how they are preserved. He went on to say: Research in hydrocarbonbearing basins worldwide has shown that it is possible to determine the time that the source rocks started to generate oil and gas, and show how long these fluids have been held securely in the adjacent traps. In almost all cases this is tens to hundreds of million years. The fact that the sealing rocks have held naturally generated oil and gas accumulations over such a period, often with naturally occurring carbon dioxide, demonstrates that they can contain carbon dioxide that is purposefully injected into them for a very long time. I am very pleased to speak on this legislation. It is part and parcel of a suite of schemes and projects that Labor want to introduce to help to reduce carbon pollution. (Time expired)",31
11,Mr GEORGANAS,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"I too rise to speak in support of the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 and related bills. Let me start by congratulating the previous speaker, the member for Braddon, for his great explanation of what this bill will do and how we are combating climate change. As I said, I am here to speak on this legislation and to support the efforts of my parliamentary colleagues on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, who worked so hard to bring this bill to the House. I would also like to support the efforts of the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism, the Hon. Martin Ferguson, who has taken the tremendous step of putting forward groundbreaking legislation aimed fairly and squarely at combating climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gases to climate change, both in Australia and potentially around the world, while maintaining Australian jobs and economic prosperity. We have had a number of statements over the years from members opposite, and over the last 24 hours, whilst I have been following this debate very closely, I have seen that those statements and arguments have not changed. The opposition continue to be climate change sceptics. If we go down that path we will achieve zilch. We have heard those opposite, both in this place and in the media, discounting the science that continues to accumulate and mocking anyone who takes the issue of global warming and dangerous climate change with the seriousness that they clearly deserve. We have had senior members of the former government making their positions crystal clear, saying, ‘It's all too ambiguous; it's all too hard.' We have heard these arguments again over the last 24 hours; arguments like: ‘We're simply too small a player to be involved in any global attempt to limit the proportion of carbon dioxide and other gases in our atmosphere.' Over the last 24 hours they have said that it is not real, promoting broadcasts that cast the science and responsible leaders' reactions to the situation as a swindle. Yet virtually in the same breath they have attempted to swindle the Australian public by characterising their support of a non-viable nuclear power industry within Australia as their responsible policy towards tackling the very climate change they discount. The Australian public certainly believe the scientific consensus. We saw that last year as the average Australian voter showed their support for responsible government at the general election. They showed their support for federal Labor developing and implementing policies to combat the unsustainable polluting of our environment with ever increasing volumes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The Australian public continue to show their support for the Labor government's policies in this area. Recently, within the context of the Garnaut and Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme debate, the overwhelming majority of Australians voted yes, that we need to take these responsible and necessary steps to combat climate change. The bills before us today, the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008, the Offshore Petroleum (Annual Fees) Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008, the Offshore Petroleum (Registration Fees) Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 and the Offshore Petroleum (Safety Levies) Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008, in total, are designed to establish the context within which Australian industry can get on with the job of investigating options for the safe and secure storage of carbon dioxide within geological structures for many, many years to come. The Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism, in his second reading speech, called for the parliament to await the outcome of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources inquiry into such matters and, in particular, whether the bills before us establish the best balance between the rights of players within the extraction industry and the needs of the sequestration industry. As I said earlier, I commend the minister for willing the committee to report to the parliament for his and the parliament's fair and balanced considerations of the committee's recommendations towards matters, including those addressing the balance of respective players' rights and access. I note that in its report the committee congratulated the minister for his efforts in bringing the legislation to the House. It said: The Committee would like to congratulate the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism, the Hon Martin Ferguson MP, for this pioneering legislation. This legislation sets the groundwork for the establishment of a national GHGthat is, greenhouse gasindustry in Australia. If we grasp the opportunity provided, it will allow us to lead the world in the implementation and development of CCSthat is, carbon dioxide capture and storage. Some within the community question the wisdom of investing our support in geosequestration as a partial solution to increasing concentrations of global greenhouse gases. Some in the community believe that the government should limit our support in tackling climate change to possibilities that literally would be the best of all possible power generation technologies and systems. The position of the government is very clear: the government are encouraging the development of a suite of power-generating technologies utilising a range of resources. Not all of these technologies are totally waste free, not all of them are perfect in being fully sustainable, not all of them are likely to be systems fully accessible by all Australians and not all of them will be satisfactorily economical, nor even functional. But options that are being actively pursued around this nation have absolutely breathtaking potential. The federal Labor government have established the target of Australia, sourcing 20 per cent of our needed power for renewable sources by 2020. Within my own home state of South Australia we are currently very well positioned to take up opportunities to harness the power of wind, being in the roaring forties. More wind farms are being built from Cape Jervis to the Flinders Ranges. If South Australia has not already met the 20 per cent renewable target, we will be very shortly. This is a very realistic target. It is a target that we must meet to achieve Labor's longer term target of a 60 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050. South Australia is also blessed with natural resources in the form of hot rocks or radioactive granite under the ground in the midto far north of the state. Within my electorate office I have met with players from the geothermal industry and I am highly interested in this industry's developments, as I think we all should be. Geoscience Australia reportedly estimates that just one per cent of Australia's geothermal energy is equivalent to 26,000 times Australia's total annual energy consumption. Geothermal power generation has the potential to supply Australia with clean energy for hundreds, if not thousands, of years to come. The potential for this industry is really breathtaking. It is an industry that is receivtralian ing very real assistance from this federal bor government in the form of a $50 million Geothermal Drilling Program, which will provide grants of up to $7 million on a matched funding basis to support the high cost of drilling deep geothermal wells for proof-of-concept projects. The Geothermal Drilling Program, launched by the Minister for Resources and Energy on 20 August this year, is the first program to be launched under the government's $500 million Renewable Energy Fund. This fund is designed to accelerate the development, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy technologies in Australia. Which technologies will emerge as clear winners over the next decades? That will be up to the market and the industries which seek to take advantage of this amazing period of change within Australia and around the world. The responsible policy of this federal Labor government is to cut overall carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases within Australia through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This scheme will be the vehicle that drives investment in cleaner energy generation technologies and waste minimisation technologies, such as those required for geosequestration. With bills such as these before us today, the government can and is willing to set the framework for doing business in a fair and reasonable manner. The government continues to provide encouragement with innovative technology development before letting the competing interests work out their own destiny over the longer term within the private sector. I expect that most Australians would conclude that this federal Labor government is taking the problem of climate change very seriously indeed and is pursuing the right mix of policies for us to meet our objectives in the short, medium and long term, and at the same time maintaining Ausjobs and economic prosperity. I would La- like to congratulate the committee that worked so hard on bringing this bill to the House and recommending it to the parliament. I commend this bill to the House.",35
12,Mr BIDGOOD,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"I rise to speak in full support of the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 and cognate bills. This bill will establish a new range of offshore titles providing for the transportation by pipeline and injection and storage in geological formations of CO2 and, potentially, other greenhouse gases. The Offshore Petroleum Act 2006-otherwise known as OPAas amended by the bill will continue to apply only in the Commonwealth offshore jurisdiction. The new titles will therefore be located in the area between the outer limits of the states and the Northern Territory-three nautical miles of coastal waters-and the outer limit of the Australian continental shelf. Under the proposed greenhouse gas legislative model, the Australian government will be primarily responsible for administering the regulation in Commonwealth waters, rather than the current joint authority of state, Northern Territory and Commonwealth government arrangements applying to the petroleum industry. The responsible Commonwealth minister, known as RCM, will have ultimate regulatory responsibility. This approach is consistent with the industry's preference for a sistent and harmonised national approach and will improve the efficiency of project approvals and minimise administrative duplication. The government referred this bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, of which I am a member, for inquiry and report on 19 May 2008. The committee's bipartisan report, Downunder: greenhouse gas storage, was tabled on 1 September and strongly endorsed the government's CCS framework. With 80 per cent of Australia's electricity generated from coal, no serious response to climate change can ignore the need to clean up coal. The establishment of a carbon capture and geological storage framework represents a major step towards making lowemissions coal a reality. CCS is essential for the long-term sustainability of coal-fired electricity generation and to realise the tential of new industries such as coal-toliquids, which could improve Australia's liquid transportation fuel security. The coal industry is highly significant only to my electorate of Dawson and Australia's economic prosperity but also to the world's current and forecast energy supply. Coal currently provides almost 80 per cent of Australia's electricity generation capacity, and also some 40 per cent of world electricity needs. While coal's share of future power generation in Australia will decline in favour of renewable energy and less greenhouse intensive fossil fuels, such as gas, continue to provide much of Australia's electricity generation requirements well into the future. This view is supported by the Internafind tional Energy Agency. This monitors and forecasts global energy supply and demand. The IEA estimates that the world's future energy needs will be met primarily by fossil fuels, forecasting that coal will provide around 44 per cent of world electricity needs conin 2030-an increase on its current share. It is therefore vitally important that domestic and international greenhouse gas abatement solutions include policies that support the development and deployment of lowemissions coal technologies. Against this reality, it would be irresponsible for the Australian government to close down Australia's coal industry and forsake the economic opportunity that the global demand for coal represents for all Australians. Coal is Australia's largest export commodity, generating some $24 billion in export income in the years 2005 and 2006. This is to the nation's economic bottom line. According to the Queensland Resource Council, it generated some $18 billion in income in 2007 for the Queensland economy alone. Just this morning, we were honoured with the presence of the Prime Minister talking to this bill. He informed the House of the latest po- figures, which say that our exports will be worth $43 billion in the year 2008-09. Australia truly is the world's largest exporter of coal. The coal industry is also the lifeblood not of many of our rural and regional communities, and this is especially the case in my seat of Dawson. The industry employs some 30,000 people and one in four of those jobs are in the Bowen Basin. Low-cost coal supports Australia's high living standards and is the foundation for Australia's energy intensive industries. The success of CCS technology will guarantee the long-term future of the coal power industry and the job security coal will for power industry workers. If Australia were to stop exporting coal, countries like China and India would simply other suppliers to meet their demand. Therefore, any response to climate change pressures must also take into account the need to maintain adequate and reliable energy supplies by making fossil fuel use cleaner. The government recognises that new clean energy technologies, including both fossil fuels and renewable energy sources, are the key to a sustainable climate change solution. The Rudd government is providing leadership and policies that reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time ensuring that we continue to prosper from our abundant energy resources. In this context, and as a fossil fuel dependent economy, the Australian government has a pivotal role to play in driving technology outcomes that reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. A key part of this effort is the need to establish a framework to allow for the capture and geological storage of greenhouse gases emitted from fossil fuel use, both domestically and in countries which purchase Australian coal. The centrepiece of the government's climate change policy is its commitment to establish the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, known as CPRS, in 2010. The scheme will establish a forward price for carbon within the Australian economy. Placing a cost on carbon will encourage industry to develop and deploy low-emission technologies over time. In addition, the government has established the $500 million National Low Emissions Coal Fund to support the National Low Emissions Coal Initiative and deliver breakthroughs in clean coal nologies, of which CCS is a key part. The NLECI is being matched by the coal industry's COAL21 initiative. The industry has set up a $1 billion fund to support clean coal projects, to combat climate change and to reduce our emissions. This initiative will showcase practical ways to reduce emissions from coal use to our key major trading partners, such as China. The government's legislation will establish access and property rights for the safe and secure injection and storage of greenhouse gases into stable subsurface geological reservoirs in Commonwealth waters more than three nautical miles offshore. The legislation aims to provide project developers with the certainty required to commit to major low-emission energy projects involving CCS. It also allows for the establishment of an effective regulatory framework to ensure that projects meet health, safety and environmental requirements. The legislation will create an environment in which industry can invest in CCS projects with confidence and will encourage the commercialisation of technologies which have the potential to play a vital role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions in the future. The legislation provides for appropriate consultation and multiple use rights with other marine users, including the fishing and petroleum industries, and ensures pre-existing property and use rights are properly preserved. The government's framework comprises four bills which were introduced into the House on 18 June 2008: the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008, which is the principal bill to establish the Commonwealth's CCS framework; the Offshore Petroleum (Annual Fees) Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008; the Offshore Petroleum (Registration Fees) Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008; and the Offshore Petroleum tech- (Safety Levies) Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008. The bills will establish a new range of offshore titles providing for the transportation by pipeline and injection and storage in geological formations of carbon dioxide and, potentially, other greenhouse gases. The legislation deals primarily with the provision of access and property rights for greenhouse gas injection and storage activities in Commonwealth offshore waters and provides a management system for ensuring that storage is safe and secure while balancing the rights of this new industry with the petroleum industry in a manner that encourages investment in both industries. The proposed legislation recognises the need to (a) provide greenhouse gas injection and storage proponents with the certainty needed to bring forward investment, (b) preserve pre-existing rights of the petroleum industry as far as is practicable to minimise sovereign risk to existing titleholders' investment in Australia's offshore resources and (c) provide assurance to the community that CO2 is stored in a safe and secure manner. In his second reading speech introducing the legislation, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister Martin Ferguson, noted the need for urgent action in addressing climate change and the significant role that these amendments may play in developing one of the available methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The minister also noted that several large-scale projects have been considering their requirements for geological storage for some years. The proponents are eager to gain access to areas so they can commence detailed assessment of storage formations. In conclusion, Minister Martin Ferguson, who has visited my electorate on two occasions and has seen first hand the service industries that have developed to support the coal industry, noted that this bill provides proponents with access to potential storage formations and ‘will play a key role' in accelerating the development of the carbon capture and storage industry. In doing so, this bill provides a significant opportunity to tackle climate change in a way which protects jobs in Dawson and maintains our economic prosperity. Indeed, it will add to the nation's bottom line in this economy. We have the potential in this House today to be world leaders, not followers. We have the potential to show to the world the way of new technologies and new research, and we should go forward with confidence, not with denial. Because of this, and the leadership of the Rudd Labor government in carbon capture and storage, I commend the bill to the House.",37
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"I thank the honourable member for Dawson. While I do not want to be pedantic I draw to his attention the provisions of standing order 64. I think on at least two occasions the member for Dawson referred to the minister as ‘Minister Martin Ferguson'. Under that standing order he should refer to the minister by his ministerial office or alternatively by the division he is privileged to represent in the House. I did not want to interrupt the honourable member at the time. Mr Bidgood-I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker.",40

15,Ms LIVERMORE,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"The Offshore Petroleum Amendment that (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 aims to provide the regulatory framework for greenhouse gas storage activities and the further investment in carbon capture and storage technologies that we hope to see in this country in the near future. The purpose of the bill itself is to enable carbon dioxide to be stored safely and securely in geological storage formations deep underground in Australian offshore waters under Commonwealth jurisdiction. Specifically, the bill seeks to provide greenhouse gas injection and storage proponents with the certainty needed to bring forward investment; to preserve pre-existing rights of the petroleum industry as far as is practicable to minimise sovereign risk to existing titleholders' investment in Australia's offshore resources; and to provide assurance to the community that carbon dioxide is stored in a safe and secure manner. The bill is the first of its kind in the world is hoped and expected that it will act as a model for other jurisdictions both here and overseas as they develop and apply CCS technologies as part of their greenhouse gas reduction strategies. This bill is significant, and I know that Minister for Resources and Energy has made it one of his priorities to complete the consultation process with industry and other stakeholders and bring it before the House for debate. I had the pleasure of working with my colleagues on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources a couple of months ago as we worked through the issues raised in the inquiry into the bill. The inquiry was a great opportunity to talk to those involved in both the oil and gas industries and carbon dioxide injection operations. Through that process committee members gained a very good insight into what is needed to facilitate investment in carbon capture and storage at the same time as recognising that our national interest is served by ensuring that existing oil and gas operators have certainty with respect to their considerable investments in those other important resources: oil and natural gas. I am very pleased to see that the minister has accepted 17 of the 19 recommendations made by the committee. Some of those recommendations have been incorporated into the amendments that will be moved later in the third reading of the bill. As I said in the debate on the committee report a few weeks ago, the committee sought to provide common-sense recommendations based on the evidence received-common-sense recommendations to facilitate the uptake of carbon capture and storage technologies and to encourage cooperation between oil and gas producers and prospective greenhouse gas storage operators. As we have heard from the speakers in and it this debate-and certainly from the Prime Minister in his contribution earlier this morning-there is a great deal of support within the government for Australia to continue to lead the way in the development and widespread application of carbon capture and the storage technologies. This bill and the priority it has been given by the minister is another indication of that support. We recognise that carbon capture and storage is a necessary part of this country's response to climate change and the urgent need to reduce our carbon emissions. In dealing with the challenges presented by climate change and the imperative to act, we have to face the reality of the role that coal and other fossil fuels play in our economy. No serious response to climate change can ignore the need to clean up coal. To start with, as we have heard from other speakers in this debate, 80 per cent of Australia's electricity is generated from coal. In addition, Australia is the largest exporter of coal in the world, something that I and my colleague the member for Dawson know only too well as representatives of a very large coal producing area. Black coal accounts for over $25 billion of Australian exports annually. The coal industry is also the lifeblood of many regional communities, employing over 30,000 people. Low-cost coal supports Australia's high living standards and is the foundation for Australia's energy intensive industries, many of which are also major exporters and of course major employers in our country. While coal's share of future power generation in Australia will decline in favour of renewable energy and less greenhouse intensive fossil fuels such as gas, we have to acknowledge that coal will continue to provide much of Australia's electricity generation requirements well into the future. It is just not realistic or responsible to advocate the shutting down of the coal industry. Instead, the government is providing funding and support for initiatives to develop lowemission technologies. We believe that the answer for Australia is to perfect the technology that will allow us to benefit from our coal reserves while reducing our carbon emissions. The success of carbon capture and storage technology will guarantee the long term future of the coal industry and job security for those thousands of Australians employed in the coal and energy sectors. Of course, whenever you talk about the challenge of climate change you have to acknowledge that this is a problem on a global scale. While we take steps here in Australia to reduce our emissions we also have to be mindful of the global perspective. And when you are you realise that the need for a breakthrough on CCS technologies is even more urgent. You also realise that the opportunities for Australia are even more valuable. The Centre for Low Emission Technology submission to the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation a couple of years ago tells us that, internationally, carbon dioxide emissions are expected to grow by over 50 per cent, from 24 billion to 37 billion tonnes per year in 2030. The International Energy Agency, which monitors and forecasts global energy supply and demand, also estimates that the world's future energy needs will be met primarily by fossil fuels, forecasting that coal will provide around 44 per cent of world electricity needs in 2030-an increase on its current share. It is clear from those figures that the work we do in Australia to perfect and commercialise carbon capture and storage technology has enormous potential to reduce global emissions if it can be exported to other countries, especially developing countries like India and China. Demand for our coal and other resources will continue to grow. If we can continue to take the lead on clean energy technologies, we can also export those technologies and play a crucial role in reducing not only our own but also global carbon emissions. As this bill demonstrates, the Labor government is getting behind efforts to develop and commercialise clean energy. We have established the National Clean Coal Initiative, backed up by a $500 million Clean Coal Fund. This will be matched by $1 billion from industry through its COAL21 initiative. All in all, that is an available investment of $1½ billion to go towards the development and deployment of clean coal technologies. Much of the work on clean energy to date has been in the area of carbon capture. This bill enables work to proceed in the important area of carbon dioxide injection and storage. The government is also supporting that work through the recent establishment of a carbon storage task force. One of the first jobs of that body is to develop a national carbon mapping and infrastructure plan. This recognises that we are now at the point where we need to identify storage sites for carbon dioxide. We particularly need to find potential storage sites that match up with significant new energy projects, such as coal to liquids and gas to liquids. As we learned in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation inquiry into geosequestration technology, some of the sites with the most valuable storage potential are located in areas, like the Gippsland Basin, that are already under petroleum titles. The focus of this bill, therefore, is to provide access and property rights for greenhouse gas injection and storage activities and, very importantly, to balance the potential conflict of interest between the offshore petroleum and gas industries and an emerging greenhouse gas storage industry in a way that encourages investment in both industries. Another important aspect of the bill is the sections dealing with the regulation of this new industry to ensure that the government and the public can have confidence that carbon dioxide once injected is safely and permanently stored. It is easy for us to forget, when we have been engaged in discussions and debates about emissions trading, geosequestration and carbon capture and storage, that these are very new concepts for most of the community. The terminology is unfamiliar, and we are asking people to accept technology that is completely alien to most of them. It is important, therefore, that the lic is informed about the science involved and that we can point to very strong and effective legislation to say that this emerging industry will be properly managed and regulated. A lot of people I have spoken to about this technology have been surprised to learn that the science surrounding the injection and storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is actually well established and widely employed in the oil and gas industries. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its 2005 Special report on carbon dioxide capture and storage, confirmed that the injection of CO2 in deep geological formations involves many of the same technologies that have been developed in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Well-drilling technology, injection technology, computer simulation of storage reservoir dynamics and monitoring methods from existing applications are being developed further for the design and operation of geological storage. I note that in the report by the science innovation committee, Between a rock and a hard place, BP estimated that currently there are around 35 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year injected into geological formations around the world, mainly for the purposes of enhanced oil recovery. For example, there are around 150 sites in the United States already using that process. The Sleipner project in the Norwegian North Sea strips methane from natural gas and re-injects it into a deep saline formation 900 metres beneath the sea floor for storage. This project has been running now for 10 years, and one million tonnes of CO2 has been injected each year. Over that time, seismic techniques have monitored the successful dispersion and trapping of the gas within the geological formation. We heard during the course of our inquiry into the bill that in that project the pubgreenhouse gas is behaving as predicted in those models. Here in Australia, the Otway project conducted by the CO2CRC has this year begun injecting CO2 into the Naylor gas field. The project includes extensive monitoring of the CO2's behaviour, and new monitoring and verification technology will be developed with the aim of demonstrating that the injection and storage is safe and that any leakage of CO2 can be detected. The committee heard from the head of the CO2CRC, Dr Peter Cook, that the Otway Basin is the most comprehensive monitoring verification system anywhere in the world. So, once again, Australia is leading the way in this vital technology. It is expected that the results of the Otway project will confirm the IPCC's findings that the risks associated with CO2 capture and storage are low. The IPCC has stated that well-selected geological formations are likely to retain over 99 per cent of their storage over a period of 1,000 years. Overall, the risks of CO2 storage are comparable to the risks in similar existing industrial and operations, such as underground natural gas storage and enhanced oil recovery. The existing science and experience in industry gives us confidence that it is indeed safe to proceed with the development of this technology and to encourage industry to deploy CCS technology on a commercial scale. The bill and supporting regulations will make sure that companies know what standards are expected of them and give the government powers to oversee and enforce these strict standards. One of the key mechanisms in the bill when it comes to reassuring the government and also the community about the long-term safety of these processes, and of storing CO2 in these sites, is the site closing process. When a greenhouse gas operator has finished injecting CO2 into their site, they apply to the minister for a site closing certificate. As part of that application, they must set out the modelling that they have already done-and we are talking about timelines of 30, 40 or 50 years when it comes to the point of applying for a closing certificate, so by then there would have been a very good opportunity for the proponent to know exactly what had been going on and the behaviour of the CO2 in the subsurface. So the application to the minister must set out the modelling that the proponent has developed for the behaviour of the greenhouse gas. It must also set out the expected migration pathways-so what the CO2 is doing and is expected to do-in the geological formation. And it must also include suggestions for post-site-closing monitoring and verification by the Commonwealth. So, at the point where the minister is satisfied that it is appropriate and safe to award a site closThat ing certificate to the greenhouse gas operator, there are also negotiations around an amount of security to be paid by the company to the Commonwealth to cover the costs of long term monitoring undertaken by the government. So it is a very rigorous process that greenhouse gas storage operators must go through. One of the things that the committee suggested in our recommendations to give the community an extra bit of reassurance about this process is contained in recommendation 18: The Committee recommends consideration be given to making monitoring data associated with GHG storage project publicly available. I am pleased to see that the minister has indeed accepted that recommendation, and that is reflected in the amendments that will be moved later on in the debate. As I have said, public confidence in this technology is crucial. We have heard from speaker after speaker that both the economic interests of Australia and the future of our environment depend on getting this technology operating very soon and operating effectively. Part of that is going to be the public having confidence in this process. So what we do not need is for members of this House to be out there running scare campaigns about this technology, like the one that the member for Herbert has been conducting. And in his contribution to the debate yesterday he continued to perpetuate the myth that this is somehow going to impact on the Great Barrier Reef, when he well knows-or, if he does not know, then he should know, if he is serious about doing his job in this placethat in fact the government moved amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act a couple of months ago to explicitly and absolutely rule out any greenhouse gas storage operations on the Great Barrier Reef. is consistent with the government's policy and the provisions of that same act, which rule out mining and drilling operations on the Great Barrier Reef. So, as I say, public confidence in this technology is important, and our task as a government and as members of this place in supporting this technology is not helped when members put their own political interests first and run around with very irresponsible and completely inaccurate scare campaigns. So I encourage the member for Herbert to try and keep up with legislation which goes through this House and to understand that the amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act explicitly rule out any kind of greenhouse gas storage operations on the Great Barrier Reef. Of course, as a member whose electorate is adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef, I completely support the government's moves in that way to protect that beautiful natural icon. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, in closing, I commend the government for this bill. I commend the minister for making this bill such a priority so that we can get carbon capture and storage beyond the R&D stage that it is currently at, and really start being able commercialise this technology and make it a widespread part of our energy sector in Australia. As someone who represents an electorate that has a great reliance on the coal industry, I understand that this is absolutely vital for the future of that industry and that Australia can take the lead and can continue to maintain the lead that we have in developing this technology to secure the future of the coal industry, to do that in a way that acknowledges the need for reduced emissions, and to create opportunities for Australia to export this technology to the rest of the world.",40
16,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"Before I call the honourable the minister, I would just like to remind the member for Capricornia that the correct means of reference to the occupant of the chair is ‘ Mr Deputy Speaker', or ‘Madam Deputy Speaker'-unless of course Mr Speaker himself is here. The terminology ‘Acting Deputy Speaker' is inappropriate. To sum up I call the honourable the minister.",45
17,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (10.58 am)-in replyThank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Capricornia because I very much appreciate not only her support for this bill but also her great appreciation of the significance of the coal industry, especially to the area which she represents and also to Australia as a nation. On 18 June 2008, I had the pleasure to introduce the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 and associated bills, going to annual fees, registration fees and safety levies, into this parliament. As I outlined when I introduced the bills, this government is committed to comprehensive action to tackle climate change to whilst maintaining Australian jobs and economic prosperity. We are committed to the widest possible portfolio of responses, of which the geological storage of greenhouse gases is an important avenue being explored. Other activities include the development of renewable energy sources and a focus on improving efficiency in energy consumption. The consideration of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is also part of this armoury. And we are going through a detailed green paper process at the moment, leading to a white paper and legislation in 2009. We believe carbon dioxide capture and geological storage-or CCS, as it is commonly known-holds great potential as a method of avoiding emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Geological surveys have indicated that the storage formations in offshore waters made available by these amendments have the potential to securely store hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide. These quantities represent a significant proportion of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon capture and storage has the potential to substantially reduce Australia's emissions. The amendments I intend to introduce today enable a key component of the carbon capture and storage process-namely, geological storage-to be actively developed by industry proponents. Companies are keen to identify suitable storage sites to match their parallel development of carbon dioxide capture from coal or gas powered electricity generation and from other industrial and extraction processes. The bill focuses on the provision of access and property rights for greenhouse gas injection and storage activities in Commonwealth offshore waters and provides a management system for ensuring that storage is safe and secure. On 19 May I was pleased to refer the exposure draft of the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources for inquiry and report. The committee, chaired by the member for Lyons, Dick Adams, with the deputy chair, the member for Hume, Alby Schultz, received submissions and heard testimony from a broad range of stakeholders, including the petroleum industry, coal producers, governments and non-government organisations. The committee publicly released its final report, which included 19 recommendations, on 15 August 2008. On behalf of the government and the Australian community, I express my sincere appreciation to the committee for their hard work and insight. The committee's final report, Down under: greenhouse gas storage, did a superb job of distilling the key positions of the various stakeholders into a format that provides greater clarity of the government's legislative framework. It also speaks volumes for the committee structure of the House of Representatives and the need for all of us to consider referring detailed bills to the House of Representatives committee structure for consideration and report to the parliament. The process undertaken by the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources with respect to these bills clearly indicates the capacity of members to improve legislation, and I commend the process to the House. Most of the recommendations made in the report either endorse existing principles which are currently within the provisions of the bill-or which are part of the general policy framework-or refer to matters that are to be addressed in regulations and guidelines. These are supported by the government; however, I contend that a number of amendments, which I am tabling today, are required to the draft bill to give effect to the committee's recommendations, to remove ambiguities and to clarify processes. These amendments will contribute meaningfully to a robust and effective regulatory framework. I also note that the Senate Standing Committee on Economics is considering this billspecifically, the question of liability. The government will consider the committee's report when it becomes available. Yesterday I had the pleasure of tabling the government's formal response to the report of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources. I am pleased to note that the government supports 15 of the committee's 19 recommendations. A further two recommendations were partially supported. A number of recommendations required careful consideration to address underlying issues. These include recommendations 1, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 14. Amendments to the legislation are required to give effect to the matters raised by recommendations 1, 6, 8, 9 and 12. In relation to recommendation 1, which the government supports, a high-level objects clause has been included as part of the amendments. A more detailed objects clause along the lines suggested by the committee is not recommended, as it has the very real potential to impact on the interpretation of the detailed contents of the bill, including the balance of objectives relating to the interactions between petroleum and greenhouse sections of the bill. The government supports recommendation 6-renewal of greenhouse gas assessment permits. The current proposed term for greenhouse gas assessment permits-six years non-renewable-may not provide sufficient time for assessment works in a situation where demand for equipment such as drilling rigs is booked for an extended period into the future. However, to ensure that renewals are not used to warehouse areas, the renewal will be subject either to proposed work programs having been fully met but further work being required on them or to work programs having been subject to unavoidable delays. The government partially supports recommendation 8-recognition of integrated petroleum developments. The government recommends amending the bill to allow activities across different petroleum title areas to be permitted, subject to the normal approval processes where these are consistent with good oilfield practice, protection of the environment and occupational health and safety. It is not proposed, however, that the disposal of greenhouse gas substances consisting overwhelmingly of carbon dioxide be permitted across multiple petroleum title areas. If such an operation were to be undertaken, it should be subject to the greenhouse gas requirements of this bill and hence should be done under a greenhouse gas title. If injection of by-product greenhouse gases from multiple sources were to be permitted under a petroleum title, there is the ity that the amount of the greenhouse gas to be injected will exceed the quantity of fluids produced from the reservoir with no requirement for the operator to monitor the behaviour of the stored substance or to ensure that it does not migrate outside the boundaries of the title area. There is a need, therefore, to ensure that such injection projects be regulated under the requirements of the greenhouse gas provisions of the act. The main underlying issue is to give petroleum operators reasonable certainty that they will be able to obtain the greenhouse gas titles needed for an integrated operation. Giving these industries increased certainty is critical because they are likely to be early movers in the Australian greenhouse gas storage industry. This can best be managed by adopting the committee's recommendation 12, which would make the availability of a carbon dioxide stream for imminent injection a criterion when assessing bids for the award of acreage. The government partially supports recommendation 9, allowing ministerial intervention in negotiations between greenhouse gas and petroleum operators. The underlying concern that led to this recommendation relates to the potential for petroleum titleholders to effectively block greenhouse gas activities in an area by claiming that there is a ‘significant risk of a significant adverse impact' on their petroleum operations. While the government does not believe the recommendation can be adopted in its current form, there are a number of amendments that can be made to address the concerns of the committee. The government believes that the responsible Commonwealth minister having power to direct the parties to negotiate in good faith would be unlikely to assist the parties to reach a negotiated settlement. This is because each party will, albeit in good faith, inevitably continue to act in pursuance possibilof their own commercial interests. Giving the responsible Commonwealth minister the power to direct an outcome needs to be given separate consideration in relation to pre-commencement and postcommencement petroleum titles. In precommencement petroleum titles, the government considers that a power for the responsible Commonwealth minister to direct an outcome would be a substantial encroachment on pre-existing petroleum rights and would represent a major policy shift in the policy balance of this bill in its current form. Regarding post-commencement petroleum titles, there is already a circuit-breaker mechanism in place where parties fail to agree. In the absence of agreement between parties, or if the responsible Commonwealth minister is not satisfied with the terms of the agreement, the responsible Commonwealth minister has power to decide the outcome in the public interest. As I have already mentioned, a number of amendments to the bill are recommended to address the concerns of the committee. Regarding the ‘significant risk of a significant adverse impact test', the government recommends that the test criteria be strengthened and handled by regulations rather than in legislation. On that note, I have also given the committee an undertaking that we will present to them for consideration the regulations once they have been drafted. I appreciate their offer to also assist in that process. To strengthen the treatment of the ‘significant risk of a significant adverse impact test', the government is proposing to provide the responsible Commonwealth minister with the power to establish an expert advisory committee to provide technical advice. This proposal goes beyond the recommendations of the House of Representatives committee, but the government believes that it will help address the committee's underlying concerns about the balance between petroleum and greenhouse gas storage rights. The advisory committee would be convened on a ‘needs' basis. The amendments also cover such matters as membership, remuneration and conflicts of interest. The government also recommends that the bill be amended to give the responsible Commonwealth minister the power to request parties to report on any negotiations that have taken place and the outcome of those negotiations. The recommended amendments to the bill require parties to exchange information on their proposed activities. While the existing framework of the legislation has been prepared with the intention of providing incentives for commercial negotiations, explicit provisions such as these will provide further encouragement. Another area where regulations can contribute to addressing the underlying issues relates to data. The government recommends an amendment to the bill to allow the responsible Commonwealth minister to request production of any relevant information as an aid in decision making. The proposed amendment also makes provision, and appropriately so, for confidentiality. The government does not support recommendation 11, which provides for a one-off opportunity for petroleum operators to apply for and incorporate a greenhouse gas assessment permit over their exploration or production licence. While adoption of this recommendation would, as the committee suggest in their report, likely lead to increased exploration activity and knowledge of Australia's storage resource, it could alternatively delay implementation of some projects by locking out early movers which do not have existing petroleum rights. Another major drawback is that storage sites are very unlikely to match petroleum title boundaries. The underlying geology will be a crucial factor when selecting acreage for release for a greenhouse gas assessment permit because of the need to take migration paths into account, which is not a factor in determining petroleum title areas. As a result, areas that would be selected to give the best utilisation of potential storage sites would almost certainly be very different from the areas covered by existing petroleum titles. There is, however, one area where the Commonwealth has proposed that rights be extended. The bill provides for the holder of a petroleum production licence to apply for a greenhouse gas injection licence. Additional certainty will be provided by the mirroring of these rights to allow petroleum retention leaseholders to apply for a greenhouse gas holding licence. Only greenhouse gases derived from petroleum operations in the production licence area could be stored under an injection licence awarded under this provision. This need was highlighted in several submissions to the committee. There is also a need to include an amendment to ensure that if the holder of a petroleum production licence holds a greenhouse gas title through this mechanism then the titleholder should not be able to sell one title separately from another. This provision was aimed at promoting synergies between the petroleum and greenhouse gas industries, and allowing them to pass into several hands could result in these synergies being largely lost. Moreover, allowing separate sale could simply be ‘gifting' the petroleum licensee with a valuable asset that could be sold without public benefit. The government supports recommendation 12. The government recommends including the demonstration of a readily available carbon dioxide stream for imminent injection as a criterion in the amended criteria for assessing bids for acreage. The government does not support recommendation 14, which recommends a process for formal transfer of long-term liability to the government. This is an area which has critical implications for the public acceptability of the framework. The practical effect of the current legislative framework is that, after statutory obligations cease and when a closure certificate is issued, common law will apply. The existing bill sets out requirethereby ments that have to be met before a closing certificate can be issued. In particular, it requires the responsible Commonwealth minister to be satisfied that the injected substance is behaving as predicted and does not pose a significant risk to the conservation of natural resources, the environment, human health and safety or other matters that the responsible Commonwealth minister considers relevant. One possible impact of taking over all liability, as recommended by the committee, could be to lengthen the closure period and increase the complexities of the closure processes. This could occur because such a transfer of liability would likely lead to the responsible Commonwealth minister requiring a higher degree of certainty concerning long-term liability issues. As a result, the reduced uncertainty for industry as a result of transferring long-term liability to the Commonwealth could be offset by increased uncertainty concerning the requirements of the closure processes. Under certain provisions, which remain silent on long-term liability and hence leave the matter to common law, a greenhouse gas operator would likely only be liable if damage arose and there was fault or a failing of some kind, such as negligence on the part of the operator. The government therefore recommends that the existing framework remain unchanged. I also note that the Senate Standing Committee on Economics is considering the bill. The government will consider the report when it becomes available. I would again like to express my appreciation and the government's appreciation to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources for its contribution to this pioneering legislation. This bill is a world first and will play a significant role in developing one of the key available methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, assisting Australia to address the challenges of climate change. Large-scale projects for capturing and concentrating greenhouse gases involve potential investments of many hundreds of millions, or billions, of dollars. Several large-scale projects in Australia have already been considering their requirements for geological storage for some years. While they recognise the complexities that need to be addressed by this bill, the proponents are also eager to gain access to areas so that they can commence detailed assessment of storage formations. It is the government's belief that this bill provides that access and will play a key role in accelerating the development of the carbon dioxide capture and geological storage industry. In so doing, it provides a significant opportunity to tackle climate change in a way that protects Australian jobs and maintains our economic prosperity. In closing, I wish to thank all members for their positive contributions to the debate on the bills. I appreciate the spirit in which contributions have been made. Members of the opposition have indicated in their speeches that opposition senators may wish to move amendments once the bills have been introduced in the other place. The government has already commenced detailed discussions with Senator Johnston and the member for Groom, Mr Ian Macfarlane, on these matters of concern. I look forward to continuing those constructive discussions so as to reach consensus on this vital piece of legislation. I commend the bills to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

I clearly foreshadowed these amendments to the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 in my speech closing the second reading debate. Having gone into detail on those remarks, I would like to briefly summarise the main matters covered by these amendments. The commencement table in the bill has now been simplified, which became possible with the commencement of the Offshore Petroleum Act 2006 on 1 July this year. As foreshadowed in my second reading speech, the amendments include a high-level objects clause to give effect to recommendation 1 of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources. The proposed wording is as follows: The object of this Act is to provide an effective regulatory framework for: (a) petroleum exploration and recovery; and (b) the injection and storage of greenhouse gas substances; in offshore areas. A number of amendments are aimed at addressing concerns raised by the committee in regard to the potential for existing petroleum titleholders to block greenhouse gas operations. These amendments will give the responsible Commonwealth minister the power to, firstly, be able to request parties to report on any negotiations that have taken place and any outcome of these negotiations; secondly, establish expert advisory committees to provide advice-the committees would be convened on a ‘needs' basis; and, thirdly, make regulations for the ‘significant risk of significant adverse impact' test. The amendments identify the circumstances when this test should be applied and provide for decisions to be made ‘in a matter ascertained in accordance with the regulations'. The amendments also cover such matters as membership, remuneration and conflicts of interest. This form of words will provide the flexibility needed to deal with differing circumstances. With regard to the renewal of greenhouse gas assessment permits, the amendments provide for a single renewal of three years after the initial six-year period is complete. The amendments provide that any such renewal will be subject either to proposed work programs having been fully met but further work being required or to work programs having been subject to unavoidable delays. The amendments provide for wider criteria in assessing bids submitted for the award of greenhouse gas assessment permits. The amendments will specifically allow criteria to take into account economic, commercial or public interest matters as well as proposals for work and expenditure. This will allow the criteria to include giving prefand erence to proponents who can demonstrate a readily available carbon dioxide stream for imminent injection, as recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources. The amendments provide for the integration of certain operations across different petroleum title areas to be approved under regulations. The amendments mean that integrated petroleum operations involving storage of greenhouse gases will be permitted, subject to the greenhouse gas storage element of the project being undertaken under a greenhouse gas title. However, the storage of other substances derived from other titles in an integrated operation, such as formation water, will be permitted, subject to approvals under petroleum legislation. The amendments enable the holders of petroleum retention leases to apply for greenhouse gas injection licences under the area of the retention lease. This is an extension of the right already in the original bill for the holders of production licences. This would provide those existing petroleum retention leaseholders who have discovered large accumulations of natural gas with high natural carbon dioxide content with increased certainty. As I foreshadowed previously, the amendments will tie greenhouse gas holding leases and injection licences to the retention leases and production licences if the greenhouse titles have been obtained through this route. In this context the amendments provide that, if a greenhouse gas injection licence is granted to the holder of a production licence, any greenhouse gas stored under the injection licence must have its origin in the area of the production licence. Amendments have been included to ensure that consultation takes place between petroleum operators and greenhouse gas operators in the event that a greenhouse gas operator needs to undertake any activities outside their title area in the area covered by a petroleum title. Further amendments clarify the situation where more than one storage formation is included in a single greenhouse gas area. (Extension of time granted) In effect, these amendments allow the closure process to apply to individual formations and to allow operations which do not use all the formations in the title area. Another amendment allows for making regulations for the public release of monitoring data collected during greenhouse gas operations. The amendments also address a number of technical matters. Firstly, they add clarity to the concept of the spatial extent of greenhouse gas storage formations. The proposed amendments will leave the detail of that process to regulations. Secondly, they extend to greenhouse gas titles provisions in the Offshore Petroleum Act that deal with future changes in the datum. The datum is used to determine the location of greenhouse gas title areas. Thirdly, they allow regulations to be made authorising holders of petroleum titles to explore for greenhouse gas storage sites under their title. These amendments will not provide the petroleum title holders with any additional rights in terms of obtaining a greenhouse gas title but will allow them to seek potential storage sites that may become necessary if high carbon dioxide petroleum exists in the area. Fourthly, they expand the definition of ‘facility' to include greenhouse gas facilities so that these can fall under the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority for occupational health and safety purposes. Fifthly, they simplify the process for issuing a closure certificate if injection has not occurred. Finally, they delete items that are now redundant. I commend the amendments to the House and again express my appreciation for the constructive way in which this complicated bill has been considered by all members of the House. It is to be hoped that, as a result of further discussions, we can resolve any outstanding issues with the opposition so as to facilitate the passage of this very important bill-very important from a greenhouse gas point of view, to the coal industry, both domestically and internationally, and to the future of Australia. I commend the bill and the amendments to the House.",50
19,Mr HUNT,DESIGNATED AGREEMENTS,"Let me make a series of points in relation shore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 and amendments (1) to (93) as moved by the Minister for Resources and Energy. Firstly, the opposition endorse and strongly support the intention of the bill and the supporting cognate bills. It flows in fact from material which we commenced whilst we were in government. Secondly, we do appreciate, as the minister outlined, the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources and their inquiry into the exposure draft of the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008. It was an excellent example of House committees working to improve a bill, working on a bipartisan and constructive basis across this chamber on an issue of genuine resource security and national environmental importance. Thirdly, we also appreciate the minister's willingness to provide the exposure draft and to engage in genuine discussion with our representative in the Senate. That brings me to the fourth point. We have foreshadowed that we will be moving amendments in the Senate. They will be subject to debate, and I am hopeful that we will receive the support and agreement of the government on those amendments. The fifth point is a respectful point of disagreement in relation to these 93 amendments, not in relation to the content; we will scrutinise that carefully. I have been advised, and therefore my understanding is, there was an agreement that such amendments would be held back until after the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, which is also conducting an inquiry, had reported. I remain to be corrected on that, but it would certainly have been our preference in any event that the Senate committee, which is conducting a parallel inquiry and is due to report to the Senate on 16 October 2008, would have been allowed to present its findings before these amend to the Offments were moved. Nevertheless, the opposition will not be opposing these amendments at this point. We will consider them carefully as part of the process. We have a respectful view-to the minister and to the government-that perhaps these amendments were called forward to deal with a gap in the government's legislative agenda, which is not so much to say it is the minister's fault as to make a broader criticism about the government's absence of legislative material more generally. With all of those elements, we acknowledge the intention of the bill. We appreciate the work of the House of Representatives committee. We acknowledge the minister's general consultation on this. We foreshadow our right-and our intention, in fact-to present amendments in the Senate. Whilst not opposing the bill, we note our concern about the failure to wait until after the Senate committee had reported. I believe it would have been sensible, prudent and reasonable to have waited until after 16 October 2008 and after the Senate committee's material and advice was on the table. Nevertheless, for those reasons we support the intention of the bill and we choose not to oppose these amendments at this point as they pass through the House.",77
20,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,DESIGNATED AGREEMENTS,"BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11.30 am)-Can I firstly indicate my appreciation of the constructive comments of the opposition spokesperson. With respect to the debate, the bills were brought on because of their importance. The Australian government regard the intent of this legislation as fundamentally important to our economic and environmental future. They are therefore, in our minds, matters that require urgent and proper consideration by both houses. Hence, we wanted to facilitate this debate sooner rather than later because our desire is to endeavour to get them through both houses to enable us, sooner rather than later, to release acreage for proper consideration from a greenhouse gas point of view in a commercial sense. Secondly, can I say that I have no knowledge of any undertaking that the House of Representatives should delay its work to await the work of the other place. In this instance, the House of Representatives has finally started to seize the opportunities to consider legislation in its own right. Historically, this House has all too often not utilised its own committee structure to its advantage and has deferred to the other house. The House has been given an opportunity on this occasion to consider a bill in detail and to express a point of view that the government has responded to, and we all appreciate the huge amount of work that went into the preparation of that report. I indicated that we would respond to the House report to enable members to consider our response in the debate in the House of Representatives, because the report represents the consideration of the bill by fellow members of the House and therefore members of the House are entitled to know the government's view on the recommendations of the House committee. With respect to the opposition, there have been and will continue to be consultations about any outstanding issues. Our desire is to reach agreement with the opposition because we appreciate that in the context of this bill they are absolutely supportive of the endeavours of the government to put in place greenhouse gas storage opportunities in offshore areas of Australia, the responsibility of the Australian government. I know that was the desire of the previous minister, the member for Groom, who sat down on a number of occasions in detailed discussions with me and my staff, and we will continue those discussions, the last meeting having been as late as this morning. I commend the amendments to the House and simply express my appreciation to all members on both sides for their assistance in considering what is a very complex and difficult bill but one of major significance to our future in the 21st century.",77
21,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,DESIGNATED AGREEMENTS,"Can I endorse the words of the minister and thank him for the assistance that he, his office and his department have offered to the opposition on what is, as he said, an extraordinarily complex issue, an issue which will underpin by far the biggest proportion of the low-emissions strategy for the Commonwealth government of Australia as we go forward from here. As the minister said and as I am sure my colleague said, this is an extraordinarily complicated process. It is a process that spans back to the time when I was the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. It is a process that, if we are not careful, will span into the time of the next minister for resources. The member for Batman and I do not know when that will be Mr Martin Ferguson-I hope it is a long way into the future!",78
22,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,DESIGNATED AGREEMENTS,"I will be doing my best to make sure it is not. With due deference and total respect to you, may your time as minister be short!",78
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DESIGNATED AGREEMENTS,Order! The love-in appears to be evaporating.,79
24,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,DESIGNATED AGREEMENTS,"Okay, back to the issue. This issue has the potential not to be resolved, not because of any loss of goodwill from our side of parliament or loss of determination or goodwill from the government. It needs to be managed precisely as we go forward. There are complexities in the legislation which, as the minister said, as as this morning were still not resolved, and there are going to be issues between the shadow minister for resources, Senator Johnston, me as his representative in this House and the minister opposite and, I assume, the Senate economics committee as well. I understand their report may be released today but will not be formally reported to the Senate until 16 October. All those processes need to take their full time. We cannot afford to rush this because, if we get it wrong, whilst we may have legislation in place we will have actually gone backwards. We are trying to do in Australia what no-one else has done. We are trying to lay down a framework also, on behalf of the Commonwealth, which will be adopted, we hope, by a majority of the states. Some states will choose a separate process, but if they are smart, quite frankly, they will choose this process. We need to get it right. We need to ensure the holders both of petroleum exploration leases and, perhaps, of leases that have gone past that into retention leases and production leases are satisfied with the process. They may not welcome this occurrence but they understand the reason it is happening. At the same time we need to ensure that legal entitlements are maintained. This issue is of crucial importance, so I seek an undertaking from the government that they will ensure that all processes are given full run and that the debate and discussions that go on in the Senate are not forced through in such a way that the Senate Standing Committee on Economics is not able to present its report before the legislation is finalised. I commit the opposition to ongoing support of and dialogue with the government on this matter. I hope that we can bring about a satisfactory resolution for all parties involved.",79
25,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,DESIGNATED AGREEMENTS,"Batmanlate Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11.37 am)-I appreciate the comments of the member for Groom. Like the opposition, we await the Senate report to see if there are any other thoughtful proposals that can improve this bill. I give the member for Groom and the opposition an undertaking that in the lead-up to that Senate report and after it is received we will continue discussions. Our proposal to have this considered in the Senate as soon as possible will not stand in the way of seeking to conclude those discussions and of reaching an accommodation with the opposition. My office has commenced discussions with two Independent senators because of the importance of also consulting those senators who have taken an interest in these matters and are generally supportive of them, as is the opposition.

30,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report 94-treaties tabled on 14 May 2008. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",80
31,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"by leaveReport 94 contains the committee's findings on two treaty actions tabled on 14 May 2008. After a careful and extensive sifting of evidence both for and against ratifying the treaty which would open up uranium sales to Russia, the treaties committee recommends that the Australian government not proceed with ratification of the treaty until: (a) Russia's reform process to clearly separate its civilian nuclear and military nuclear facilities is completed and independently verified; (b) IAEA inspections are implemented for Russian facilities that will handle Australian obligated nuclear materials; (c) the government is satisfied that the Russian Federation is complying with its obligations under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) noting that this treaty is scheduled for review in 2010; (d) the government is satisfied that Russia will not subsequently abandon this treaty or other nuclear treaties; (e) further consideration is given to the potential ramifications for this agreement of recent political events affecting Russia; (f) further consideration is given to article IX of the agreement, ‘State Secrets', and the government is confident that this article will not undermine the intent of agreement; (g) further consideration is given to the justification for secrecy of ‘material unaccounted for'; and (h) the Australian government discusses with the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada and Japan, whether the problems of the past in relation to Russian nuclear material being stolen, have now been addressed satisfactorily. Clearly we have set the bar high, but each of the conditions represents a considered response to the evidence before the committee. Some Liberal Party members of the committee have dissented from the committee majority, arguing that we should ratify the treaty now and that our conditions are unnecessary. They say we can have confidence in the International Atomic Energy Agency. But when we went to war in Iraq, the Liberal Party insisted that we were at risk from weapons of mass destruction and advanced the notion of preventive war. This was a massive vote of no confidence in the IAEA. But now this same Liberal Party says the IAEA will ensure that nothing goes wrong-and this despite the IAEA not having carried out any inspections in Russia since at least 2001, and probably longer. The Liberal Party is so hungry for the uranium export dollars that they want to believe nothing can go wrong. They are prepared to turn a blind eye to what happens after we sell the uranium to Russia. If this sounds familiar, that is because it is. Remember the AWB scandal? Liberal and National Party ministers received numerous warnings that AWB was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein. They turned a blind eye to them. The present Leader of the National Party, for example, was warned by wheat grower Ray Brooks. His response was that the AWB blokes were this good blokes who would not do a thing like that. They were hungry for the wheat export dollars. This hunger blinded them to the need to be thorough, the need to check things out properly. It is the same here. The Liberal Party's hunger for the uranium export dollars blinds them to the need to be thorough, the need to check things out properly. I suspect there are those who will seek to portray the committee's recommendations as the product of left-wing, anti-uranium prejudice. Such a portrayal is without foundation. In the United States, both Republicans and Democrats alike have joined forces and withdrawn an agreement for civilian nuclear cooperation with Russia. It is in many respects a parallel treaty to this one. Are the United States Republicans and Democrats left-wing, anti-uranium zealots? No, they are simply reacting to the facts before them. That is what the treaties committee has done. We are not opposing the export of uranium. What we are saying is that uranium is an unusual product, dangerous to human health and the environment for thousands of years and capable of inflicting massive carnage in the hands of terrorists or rogue states. Accordingly, it requires great care. So concerned was the Liberal Party about the risk to us all from weapons of mass destruction that they took us into war in Iraq, with its death toll of thousands of innocent lives and its never-ending misery. Yet they are now so unconcerned about the risk of materials being diverted, stolen or ending up in the hands of rogue states like Iran that they are not even prepared to sign up for a set of recommendations which guarantees inspections, which asks hard questions and which challenges secrecy provisions-in short, which accepts our responsibilities. If you sell uranium, there are responsibilities that come with that. The committee majority has accepted these responsibilities. The committee minority has abdicated them. They would take the money and run. We owe the world, and ourselves, better than that. The committee has also recommended that binding treaty action be taken in relation to the treaty between Australia and the United States of America concerning defence trade cooperation. I thank the House.",80

SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008 Cognate bill: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 September, on motion by Ms Gillard: That this bill be now read a second time.",82
35,Ms JULIE BISHOP,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (11.50 am)While not opposing the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the consequential provisions, there are a number of matters I wish to raise, for, adding to the succession of Labor's botched policies since it came to government, this House is now to consider the establishment of Safe Work Australia-a body that will be dominated by state representatives making decisions about occupational health and safety policy for employers and employees who have little or no voice or influence in this process and who most certainly will have far less influence in terms of representation than they currently have on these issues. The government is seeking to replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council established by the coalition whilst in government to facilitate the tripartite coordination and harmonisation of workplace safety and workers compensation laws. Under the coalition, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council was designed to facilitate a national approach to workplace safety and workers compensation, utilising a tripartite, consultative method to draw on and include employer and employee knowledge and experience in the move towards a national occupational health and safety workers compensation system. While the coalition is broadly supportive of a harmonised national occupational health and safety system, it would be difficult to imagine a body better designed to fail in achieving this objective than the body proposed under this bill. Unlike the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, Safe Work Australia reduces the number of social partners-that is, the industry and union representatives-from three to two for each partner. That is, there will be a total of four, not six, industry and union representatives. This is a reduction by one-third of representatives for each social partner. Compare that with the representation on the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which is essentially being rebranded, albeit in a way that compromises the tripartite approach traditionally required for occupational health and safety regulation to effectively operate in workplaces. The government's proposed structure for Safe Work Australia will create an imbalance whereby workplaces directly impacted by the development and formulation of occupational health and safety will be denied the opportunity to genuinely participate in the decision-making process underpinning the formulation of such policy. Labor talksoften-about its commitment to occupational health and safety, yet Labor does not appear to understand that a process that does not seek to actively engage employers and workers in a meaningful way will not produce the improvements in workplace health and safety that are necessary for Australian workers. When it comes to effective safety in the workplace there can be no contest that improving and sustaining OH&S performance in the workplace from both an employer and an employee perspective is achieved by doing ‘with' people, not by doing ‘to' people. This is particularly the case where achieving outcomes involves significant changes, costly changes or changes to culture. Once again, Labor has failed Australian workers and workplaces with the proposed establishment of Safe Work Australia. The current composition of Safe Work Australia fails to have proper regard for the views of industry and employees, which will undermine its credibility and the outcome it seeks to achieve prior to the bill even being passed. For many years, Australian workplaces, particularly those operating across state boundaries, have been forced to endure seven separate jurisdictions with seven sets of occupational health and safety laws and workers compensation requirements. The costs to business are prohibitive. Funds that could have been better spent by business on training, employee development or additional safety mechanisms are required to be spent understanding, complying with and implementing numerous OH&S and workers compensation systems across every state and territory. In contrast, those companies fortunate enough to secure self-insurance under the coalition government have saved literally millions of dollars and yet have still delivered safe and healthy workplaces for their employees. In the case of Safe Work Australia, we are now witnessing a common Labor trait, where they cross their fingers behind their backs and tell Australian workers and business that they are doing one thing but, instead, make decisions and create ineffective regulations that actually create more problems than they solve. Labor is limiting the involvement of social partners, and this is just inconceivable. Why would Labor want to limit the number of representatives from employers and employees? This is no doubt going to lead to a situation where government representatives will be able to repeatedly override legitimate concerns raised by the social partners during OH&S harmonisation discussions, including concerns relating to increased costs, or to impractical safety proposals for workplaces. You have the bureaucrats outnumbering those who are actually working in the workplaces across Australia. With limited capacity to oppose various proposals there is no doubt Safe Work Australia will be used by the government to develop other codes, policies and regulations under the guise of safety to achieve certain industrial outcomes on behalf of minority interests that would otherwise need to be discussed with stakeholders at a state level. Clearly, the government has borrowed this approach from its Labor counterparts at a state level, where workplaces are already in many cases overwhelmed with impractical and unworkable occupational health and safety laws. Now federal Labor wants to introduce a body to achieve harmonisation which will be dominated by those same Labor governments, their bureaucrats and their advisers who have already failed to establish in many cases workable occupational health and safety and workers compensation systems in their own states. Remarkably, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is determined not to listen to stakeholders, not to listen to the representathat tives of employers, and of employees-the unions-with significant involvement in workplaces. Instead, the minister has chosen to reduce their representation and rely on state governments, who have already failed in their own backyards. The foundation upon which Safe Work Australia has been established is fundamentally flawed, with the direction and success of Safe Work Australia also being contingent on the cooperation and participation of the ministerial council to which it is required directly report. Members of the ministerial council have repeatedly failed to attend and/or cooperate with the Commonwealth in these meetings, which raises legitimate concerns about just how effective Safe Work Australia will be in an environment where state Labor governments have not been willing to cooperate and genuinely contribute to discussions about the harmonisation of occupational health and safety laws across Australia-particularly the New South Wales state Labor government, which has been reported by many as having the least effective and most costly OH&S system in this country. Where the ministerial council fails to meet or refuses to cooperate and to consider the Safe Work Australia issues, the work of Safe Work Australia comes to a halt-that is it. Just last year we witnessed the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations refusing to cooperate in a national discussion on occupational health and safety. He refused to cooperate! If anything, this Safe Work Australia Bill, in its current form, will make it easier for uncooperative state Labor governments to undermine the harmonisation process for their own political gain. Further, the proposed structure creates an unjustifiable imbalance. Improving OH&S performance is critically dependent on a collaborative effort and the buy-in of all stakeholders. A process does not seek to engage workers and employers in a meaningful way does not lead to improvements in workplace health and safety. Labor's duplicity is further highlighted by its unwillingness to report back to the parliament on the progress of Safe Work Australia. This is extraordinary. The bill currently proposes a process for reporting back to parliament on the progress of Safe Work Australia every six years. Every six years! It is incomprehensible that Labor wants to introto duce a state dominated independent authority that has no requirement to report back to the federal parliament for six years. I would have thought that annual reporting on an issue as important as occupational health and safety and workers compensation would be appropriate. But every six years? Beyond the term of a government? This is a nonsense. Safe Work Australia is just another botched policy-when it would have been so easy to get it right-on top of the failed Fuelwatch, the failed GroceryWatch, the proposed abolition of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and, in the past week, the failure of the award modernisation process, which industry says could potentially lead to significant job losses and inflationary outcomes. There is one common thread running through all of these botched Labor policies: the Labor government does not have a plan and is incapable of listening to Australians and delivering credible and acceptable policy solutions. An example of this is the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. It is under threat from the Labor government. Last year the construction industry contributed 6.7 per cent to Australia's GDP and employed approximately 940,000 workers, or nine per cent of the Australian workforce. The coalition's reforms and hard stance on lawlessness and corruption within the building and construction industry from 2002 onwards directly contributed to a significant reduction in the number and cost of strikes, increasing output and productivity. comparison to the $76 million being spent by the Rudd Labor government to maybe, just maybe, achieve a 0.8 per cent increase in GDP, the Office of the ABCC, for a fraction of that cost-an average of $30 million a year-has already achieved a 1.5 per cent increase in GDPMr Zappia-At the expense of people's lives. Mr Keenan-What rubbish! Protecting crooks like Kevin Reynolds and Joe MCDonald.",82
36,Ms JULIE BISHOP,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"yet Labor has placed this dark cloud over the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner at the behest of its union bossesand I take the interjection from the member for Stirling. By watering down the compliance powers of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and the national building code and then subsuming the body into some superbureaucracy, Fair Work Australia, Labor is opening the door wide and allowing the lawlessness, the corruption, to once again become the norm rather than the exception in the building and construction industry. If Labor were genuinely committed to ensuring the safety of workplaces, employees and employers, it would hold firm on the retention of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and the national building code-the two elements that have provided some degree of protection and safety for participants in that industry from the thuggish bullying tactics engaged in by certain elements of the building and construction unions. There is already reported and widespread misuse of safety powers on building sites, and now Labor is proposing a body that may well water down any capacity workplaces have to control or address the misuse of such In powers by watering down the powers of the ABCC and establishing Safe Work Australia, a state controlled safety authority. You can just imagine the representatives that the state Labor governments around the country will put on this body. In their quest to appease the union movement and abolish the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner as it is currently constituted, members of the Labor government are disregarding the reason for the establishment of the Office of the ABCC and the introduction of the building code in the first place. This is reflected in the terms of reference of the Wilcox inquiry, where once again Labor appears to be rewriting history, pretending the Cole royal commission never, ever happened. There is no reference to the Cole royal commission or the reasons for the establishment of the Office of the ABCC in any aspect of the new terms of reference. In fact, the final terms the inquiry contain no reference to considering the importance of retaining the independence of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, nor the decline in industrial disputation in the construction sector since its establishment, nor the increase in productivity since the creation of the commissioner and the national building code. Even worse, this month the head of the inquiry, Murray Wilcox QC, raised concerns about subcontractors being banned from tendering because they are non-compliant with code guidelines-non-compliant because they are, in many cases, breaking the law. Is the head of inquiry suggesting there is something wrong with employers being required to comply with the law? The purpose of the code and the building industry reforms in the first place was to prevent laws from being broken by union officials, contractors and employees. Why are we now hearing of concerns because the same parties are required to follow the law under the building reforms? Labor's terms of reference for the Wilcox inquiry contain not one reference to how it will ensure the rule of law will be maintained and not overridden once more by industrial might. There is only one reason for this: Labor has no intention of maintaining the rule of law in the building and construction industry. For its payback to the union movement and its attempts to undermine the effective operation of workplaces in the building industry, the Labor government should be condemned. The flawed policies all contributing to the demise of a once outstanding economic position keep on coming from Labor, with last week's release of a draft exposure award from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in response to a direct award modernisation request from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Not of only are there 1.88 million small businesses staring down the barrel of significant costs in the form of extended redundancy obligations but the retail and hospitality industries are predicting labour costs will increase by up to 20 per cent as a direct result of the employment minister's award modernisation request. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has been unable to comply with the employment minister's pledge to not increase costs for employers and not disadvantage employees. It was an impossible position that the employment minister placed on the AIRC. The national retailers association has said employers will have no choice but to pass increased costs on to consumers and reduce staff levels as a direct result of the employment minister's award modernisation request. The restaurant and caterers association of Australia has submitted that Labor's award modernisation request will add up to $40 million in additional labour costs, leading to excessive closures and job lossesanother botched policy decision leading to job losses and inflationary outcomes. A close inspection of recent ABS statistics shows that there has been an 800 per cent increase in working days lost in the first six months of the Rudd government compared with the first six months of last year. When the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations was asked about this very serious issue that affects workplaces across AustraliaMr Dreyfus-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. We have been waiting for the honourable member to return in some way to the subject matter of this bill, which is safety. We have just endured about 10 minutes",85
37,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Would the honourable member for Isaacs please resume his seat. I am aware of the standing order on relevance. This is a robust chamber where we do engage in wideranging debate, but I would ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to direct her comments to the bill.",87
38,Ms JULIE BISHOP,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. And when the minister for employment was asked about the number of strikes that had occurred under the new government-the industrial action that inevitably affects safety in the workplace, if the member for Isaacs has not ever understood that connection-the minister said in response that it was all to do with new agreement making. Yet the same Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that 74 per cent of the working days lost had nothing to do with new agreement making. We are still waiting to hear from Labor as to the cause of this massive increase in industrial disputation since Labor came to office. Labor came to office vowing to turn back the Liberal and National Party workplace relations reforms, albeit that they had delivered benefits such as low inflation and the lowest unemployment rate in more than 30 years. Labor must now manage economic problems such as inflation and slowing growth. It must now also seriously look at its workplace relations policies. What is at stake was made clear a few months ago by the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, discussing why 1970s style stagflation-that is, high inflation and low growth-should not occur today in Australia. He said: A key difference today, thus far, has been the behaviour of labour costs … If you go back to the mid-1970s, you had the government leading the charge in pushing wages up, you had a very different balance of power between the unions and business, a different quasi-judicial industrial relations system, and we had a serious wage-price problem back then … We don't have that at the moment, and we must make sure we don't get it. The importance of efficient and flexible labour markets to achieving macroeconomic objectives has been made clear in a series of OECD economic surveys of Australia. While the Labor government is very good at trying to suggest that the Reserve Bank gave warnings about inflation, when you look at those statements you see that that is complete fallacy on the part of Labor. They are rewriting history once more. They ought to take note of the OECD comments about a decentralised industrial relations system, less adversarial labour relations and greater labour flexibility. The coalition understood the central importance of workplace relations to the economic well-being of the country. The Rudd Labor government clearly does not. The Deputy Prime Minister and her department have made it clear that, in the 10 months since taking office, no analysis has been undertaken on the effects of Labor's workplace relations policy on unemployment, inflation or economic growth. Incredibly, the minister has not requested a detailed, rigorous analysis of Labor's workplace relations policy from her department nor sought assistance from Treasury. And the minister shows no intention of commissioning any serious analysis of the policies she is introducing. Instead, like the ostrich in the fable, the minister has buried her head in the sand, hoping to avoid any uncomfortable truths from the world around her. Labor's aversion to evidence is typical of its approach to policy. The Prime Minister promised evidence based policy but has delivered evidence-free policy. Labor ignored the advice of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Finance and other departments on Fuelwatch. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has stopped preparing written comments on cabinet submissions-at whose command is unclear. The fact is that the government is refusing to take advice, and the establishment of Safe Work Australia is yet another example of this. How could it possibly set up a body that reduces the voice of employers and employees if it were serious about improving occupational health and safety in this country? This lack of attention to evidence and the views of stakeholders does not end there. Yesterday the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations revealed her deep ignorance about a very fundamental economic issue: productivity and the measurement of productivity in Australia. In a speech at the National Press Club the minister said: … Work Choices was neither a recipe for fairness nor for prosperity. In fact, after its introduction annual productivity fell by two-thirds. I will repeat that. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said: ‘In fact after its introduction annual productivity fell by two-thirds.' Now, if that were actually the case, and Australia's annual productivity had fallen by two-thirds, GDP would now be closer to $370 billion than to $1.1 trillion. It is disturbing that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations does not understand such a basic economic concept as productivity. The minister also confirmed that the Rudd government's proposed new workplace relations regime will be a Trojan horse for the union movement to resume practices such as pattern bargaining-which the minister supported at the Press Club yesterday-unrestricted access to workplaces and compulsory unionism. The fact is that Labor's workplace relations changes-and this bill is part of this consideration-are going to cause a great deal of concern in workplaces across Australia. One serious concern is that Labor's introduction of so-called good-faith bargaining will result in situations where employers are dragged before Labor's industrial umpire and where unwanted conditions and wages can be imposed on workplaces. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations also said yesterday that pattern bargaining was not such a bad idea. We on this side of the House know that wage claims in one area of the economy which can absorb an increase should not be passed on and spread to other sectors of the economy which cannot absorb one. That is the type of environment for a wage-inflation spiral that can lead to the types of recessions we have seen under Labor governments before-and yet, astonishingly, the minister said yesterday that she supported pattern bargaining. The minister also confirmed that the Rudd government's proposed new laws will allow unions to force employers into deducting employee union dues on their behalf. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is another botched policy by Labor that reduces the voice of, incredibly, the unions, but also employers, effectively taking away the influence of those who know best when it comes to the issue of occupational health and safety in the workplace and putting it in the hands of state government bureaucratsanother job for Labor mates. What we are seeing is a watering down of the influence of the people who are best positioned to improve occupational health and safety in this country. Labor's workplace relations changes, like its emissions trading scheme, are major policies which, if poorly conceived and implemented, will add greatly to the nation's economic challenges. With the tumultuous international financial markets and the global financial insecurity we are now witnessing across the world, Australia cannot afford to embrace policies that cause job losses or job insecurity, but that is what we are seeing under this government's so-called ‘reforms' of workplace relations.",87
39,Mr MARLES,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise to speak in support of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008, which is a bill to create an dependent national body which will oversee occupational health and safety and workers compensation in this country, to be known as Safe Work Australia. This represents the first major legislative step by the Rudd government to create in our nation one single occupational health and safety and workers compensation system. Occupational health and safety is an issue which is very dear to my heart. In my previous life at the ACTU, and also as a member of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and then the Australian Safety and Compensation Council-both of which will be predecessor bodies to Safe Work Australia. I made many speeches around occupational health and safety to try and promote the issue of OH&S in the nation's public discussion. So it is a real joyindeed, an honour-for me to be standing here in what is really the heart of our nation's public debate, the House of Representatives, to repeat some of those words today. Before I talk about occupational health and safety, I would like, with your indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker, to take a moment to talk about an event which at first may seem unrelated but whose relevance will become clear very quickly. It is a significant event in Australia's history and one which is central to our national identity, and that is the ANZAC campaign at Gallipoli. Gallipoli is a story which is very much at the heart of our nation's culture. You can see that in all the Lone Pine Streets around our suburbs. The spirit of ANZAC is evoked on many occasions. Even the film Gallipoli is an icon in our Australian film history, starring, as it does, Mel Gibson and directed by Peter Weir. Why Gallipoli is so important to the Australian culture is not entirely obvious, but partly it must be that it is the story which embodies Australia's participation in the in- First World War. There can be no doubt as to why that conflict was so important in Australia's history. The loss of life of Australians in that conflict was staggering. Proportionately as many lives were lost by Australia in that conflict as by any of the allies who fought in it. That such an event happened so early on in our nation's history makes it clear why it should be seared onto our national consciousness. You cannot go into a country town or a city in Australia with a population of more than one or two hundred without finding in it a monument to those who died in the First World War. For the record, in the nine-month campaign at Gallipoli, 8,000 Australians lost their lives. In the greater World War I conflict, 60,000 Australians lost their lives and 156,000 Australians were injured. As I say, that may seem to be an odd way to start a discussion about occupational health and safety. So it is worth thinking about the situation of occupational health and safety in Australia today. The most conservative estimates say that well in excess of 2,000 Australians die each and every year as a result of their work, and there are many estimates far larger than that. To put that figure in context, with all its accumulated heartache, trauma and tragedy, the national road toll to the month of August this year was 1,510. In the 12 months leading up to September 2000, 477,800 Australians were injured at work, and it is estimated that, when all is said and done, something in the vicinity of 40,000 to 60,000 Australians will die as a result of work related exposure to asbestos. These figures are staggering and they beg the question of whether or not we should simply accept these figures as the price of doing business in a modern market economy. The human tragedy and misery that those accumulated figures represent for me completely answers that question: we must never accept it. When I first heard those figures, the only comparison that I could think of in terms of Australian life was indeed the loss of Australian life and injury during World War I. But, whilst the figures may be similar, the place that occupational health and safety holds on the one hand and World War I holds on the other in the national psyche could not be further removed from each other. There are no monuments in all those country towns to those Australians who have died as a result of work related exposure to asbestos. There is no film directed by Peter Weir and starring Mel Gibson which tells the tragedy of Australia's occupational health and safety record. While I completely understand that films and monuments are not going to save lives, that does say a little to me about the lack of priortold, ity that our nation places upon occupational health and safety. Given the lack of priority that we place on occupational health and safety, it should be little wonder to any of us that by international standards our OH&S record is found wanting. I have made that comparison on many occasions over the last few years, and, to me, something of an improvement in the profile of occupational health and safety has occurred in those few years, I think by virtue of two events. First was the tragedy of the death of Larry Knight at Beaconsfield and the accompanying drama of the rescue of Todd Russell and Brant Webb, which absolutely held our nation spellbound for the better part of two weeks. I think what we need to remember about the heroic rescue in that case was that underlying it was an occupational health and safety incident, and a major one at that. I also think one of the reasons we find it difficult to digest the effects of occupational health and safety injuries and deaths is the nature of the injuries and deaths. In fact, traumatic deaths are a small proportion of those who die as a result of their work. Far and away the majority of people who die as a result of their work do so by virtue of having contracted some disease. They die an often lonely and unnoticed death many years later in their homes or in a hospital. For those people, a story in the last couple of years has highlighted their situation, and that of course was the heroic life of Bernie Banton, who maintained a magnificent struggle against James Hardie in winning a landmark settlement with that company. In these two events, I think we have seen the profile of OH&S beginning to be raised in our national discussion. We are seeing this great untold Australian story beginning to be and that is very welcome. But it has not come too soon, because there are many statistics which indicate that the situation is getting worse. I said that in the 12 months to September 2000, 477,800 Australians were injured at work. In the financial year 200506, that figure rose to 689,500. Over that five-year period, whilst the workforce grew by 12 per cent, accidents in the workplace grew by 44 per cent, with an additional 200,000 Australians being injured in that year compared to five years earlier. Of the many indictments that exist of the Howard government years, for my money, this is amongst the worse. How we improve our occupational health and safety record is actually a difficult and complex question. Certainly it does involve telling the story of occupational health and safety in this country. But when you drill down to it there are a couple of issues which I think we do need to improve on if we are going to see changes in the workplace. For example, all too often, it seems to me, we regulate the symptoms of occupational health and safety hazards rather than the causes. For example, there is myriad regulation out there aimed at preventing people from tripping and falling at work, and of course that is a good thing. The single biggest reason why a person would trip or fall at work is that they were tired or fatigued at the time. However, there is barely any regulation around fatigue in occupational health and safety. Indeed, the great causes of occupational health and safety hazards in this country-fatigue, stress and bullying-go almost entirely unregulated, and in that we are a country mile behind the leading nations in Europe. Another issue, which is related to the first, is the manner in which we keep statistics in this country. We keep very good statistics around workers compensation. But if you take a moment to look at those statistics, you will find they are a measure of the symptoms. They are describing the kinds of injuries that have occurred; they are not describing the causes which gave rise to the injuries. As a result, when that is the base data that we are working with when we try and formulate policy, it should be no surprise that the regulation that evolves is regulation around symptoms rather than causes. But underlying all of that is this: to solve these issues and take the kinds of decisions that we need to around those two issues that I have highlighted, and to raise the profile of occupational health and safety in this country, we need to have a proper apparatus for occupational health and safety and workers compensation in Australia. That is why the bill that we are debating today is so important and why it is so critical to giving us the machinery to solve these issues. The first point to be made about what is wrong with our public policy architecture around occupational health and safety is that instead of having a single system in Australia we have nine systems-six states, two territories and the Commonwealth jurisdiction. Whilst there is a great deal of consistency between each of those jurisdictions, there are differences as well. In all my time in occupational health and safety, it was never obvious to me why a Victorian set of ears was more sensitive to noise than those in Western Australia. To be fair to the Howard government, they did understand this issue, but their response to it was a knee-jerk response which made the whole field of occupational health and safety and workers compensation even more complex, and in fact did the wrong thing in terms of providing a safety framework. Through an old regime of licences, which ultimately were an incident of competition policy, which in a sense is another story, the Howard government allowed a number of companies to access Comcare-the Commonwealth workers compensation schemeand then, via that, the Commonwealth's occupational health and safety jurisdiction. It was a cobbled together idea. There was no preparation in there. The single biggest issue is this: the Commonwealth jurisdiction is simply not set up to enforce occupational health and safety laws in environments that are heavily blue-collar like construction sites to or transport yards. If you look at the enforcement indicators that exist, in the financial year 2005-06 there were 70 prosecutions in the state of Victoria and none in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. In terms of provisional improvement notices, there were 11,168 in Victoria and 12 in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. Taking account of the relative sizes of the jurisdictions, if you were an employer in Victoria in that year you were 24 times more likely to be the subject of an inspection than if you were an employer in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. That is not a marginal difference; that is a situation where on the one hand a system is being enforced and on the other it is not. And it is absolutely fair to say that Commonwealth occupational health and safety under the Howard years represented the Wild West of occupational health and safety law. It was to that scheme that they tried to attract national employers through what was essentially a federal power grab. It was confrontational federalism at its worse. Today, in this place, the legislative process has begun to rectify all of that. The Rudd government are approaching this in an entirely different way. We are engaging in cooperative federalism by putting in place Safe Work Australia, a body which is being established with the cooperation of all the states and territories in Australia. portantly, Safe Work Australia will, for the first time, unlike its predecessors, be a body which is jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states so that the states have a real sense of ownership in what Safe Work Australia ultimately does. Safe Work Australia will be charged with the responsibility of developing national policy around occupational health and safety and workers compensation and, importantly, of guiding us down the path of harmonising our occupational health and safety laws to a more consistent regime of workers compensation in this country. It will look after the standards and codes which traditionally have been looked after by NOHSC and the ASCC. To be frank, the drivel that we just heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the kinds of people who are going to be on this body was astounding. It demonstrates that she has not the faintest idea how those bodies worked or how this body works. In fact, the best experts in occupational health and safety and workers compensation are, without a doubt, those people in Australia who are actually running these jurisdictions. This body will be a tripartite body, as NOHSC and the ASCC have been, which is very important because you then get the expertise of both the union movement and the employer movement involved in the deliberations. Safe Work Australia will also have responsibility for collecting data and, given the issue that I raised before, this offers real hope for actually getting statistics and information properly orientated around occupational health and safety in this country. Safe Work Australia will also be charged with the responsibility of developing a communications strategy. As I said at the outset of my contribution, raising the profile of occupational health and safety in our national discussion is very important. Safe Work AustraImlia will have an independent chair. I have worked under the independent chairs of NOHSC and the ASCC, Jerry Ellis and Bill Scales, both of whom have made an enormous contribution to occupational health and safety in this country in what I might say were very difficult circumstances for both of them. They have taught me the importance of having a strong, independent chair leading an organisation such as this. As I say, there will be representatives from each of the jurisdictions, from employers and employees, giving the body a proper tripartite basis. This legislative initiative today, together with the Rudd government's review of the Comcare scheme, together with the establishment of an independent panel which is looking at the national occupational health and safety framework in Australia, and together with the landmark intergovernmental agreement between all the states and territoabout ries and the Commonwealth around harmonising our occupational health and safety laws, represents a very significant forward program to rectify what is, by international standards, a very poor occupational health and safety record. We absolutely need to do that and as quickly as we can. Occupational health and safety affects everyone. Every year, hundreds of thousands of Australians have their lives changed because of an injury in the workplace. That means that every year Australia's poor occupational health and safety record breeds a well of misery which is unmatched in its scale in almost any other part of Australian life. It is time to start the process of changing Australia's occupational health and safety performance. That start begins with this bill.",89
40,Mr HARTSUYKER,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"At the outset, let me say that I fully support moves towards the rationalisation of workers compensation and occupational health and safety and towards making our workplaces safer. We need to do all we can to ensure that workplace accidents are kept to an absolute minimum and that, when accidents do happen, those affected can easily access financial support while they are unable to work and the physical support necessary to achieve a return to work whenever possible. Safe Work Australia is tasked with developing national policy, monitoring legislation and codes of practice, developing consistent enforcement policies and raising awareness of health and safety at work. It will report to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. If Safe Work Australia achieves these aims, it will be a step forward. However, the government should be aiming higher and trying to overcome the obstacles to reform that have existed for many years. The Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 will not do that. After looking more closely at what we should be trying to achieve, I would like to raise some issues with the structure of Safe Work Australia and then examine the political obstacles that will provide a test for the government and its good intentions. At the heart of this bill is the to reform Australia's systems of workers compensation and occupational health and safety with the overarching problem that each state and territory maintains its own regime, with Comcare operating at a federal level. This multiplicity of regimes imposes an unnecessary burden on any company operating interstate, without any corresponding benefit for employees. Indeed, in terms of the competitiveness of our economy, one could argue that employees are disadvantaged by reduced job security. For instance, Optus has calculated that a single national self-insurance scheme for occupational health and safety alone would save up to $2 million of its $6 million annual workers compensation costs. Insurance Australia Group estimates that multiple schemes added some $10.1 million to the cost of setting up its national IT platform and cost about $1.7 million annually to run. As long ago as 2006, the Productivity Commission calculated that a reduction in regulatory compliance costs could result in a saving of $8 billion a year-0.8 per cent of GDP-through developing a national approach to policy making in a range of areas. Australia has a population of just 21 million, and we are trying to compete with countries like China and India, which have huge and potentially profitable internal markets and vast export potential, yet we handicap ourselves with these unnecessary costs. The European Union, with its population approaching 500 million and its diversity of languages and cultures, is continually rationalising across national boundaries. We have been slow historically in dealing with inconsistencies between our states, and we continue to drag our heels. Our failure to rationalise, to put aside state and sectional interests for the national good, is holding Australia back. The benefits to the health service, say, of saving nearly one per cent of need GDP, as I mentioned, would be substantial. What if these resources were diverted to our schools? What if savings of that order could be offset against the cost of an emissions trading scheme or invested in clean and renewable energy production? It is high time we put the national interest above state interests. Of course, this kind of reform has been on the agenda of the Council of Australian Governments for some time, but it has to be said that there has been little progress to date. The cynic might suggest that the coalition government was never going to make any headway in transferring powers from Labor run states, even if it was good for the nationand I would suggest they were right. Turkeys do not vote for Christmas-and don't we have some turkeys running our states and territories! In the last few weeks, however, the cosy position of wall-to-wall Labor administrations has been looking less secure, as voters have indicated their desire that the turkeys should be plucked and stuffed. Western Australia is certainly a notable example. In the meantime, as we await further opportunities at the ballot box, we surely have the right to expect some progress. I acknowledge that the aims of Safe Work Australia do represent some progress-but do they go far enough? I note that Safe Work Australia will ‘prepare, monitor and revise model occupational health and safety legislation and model codes of practice' and ‘develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions'. The adoption by all states and territories of model legislation would at least mean that companies operating interstate would only have to comply with one set of requirements in the workplace. However, it would still mean dealing with a different jurisdiction in each state and territory. Any changes to the model legislation would have to be enacted in each state or territory, with the distinct possibility that differences would again arise between jurisdictions because of different legislative timetables. Consistent enforcement policies would also be welcome. I am sure that we have all heard stories of how inspections on one side of a state border can result in a warning, advice and a follow-up visit, whilst, on the other side of that border, the same set of circumstances results in immediate prosecution. Any move towards consistency is welcome, but how much better it would be if federal legislation were enforced by a single federal enforcement agency, with presumably some saving on cost to the taxpayer in addition to benefits to business. Turning to the composition of this new body: of 15 members, nine will represent the Commonwealth and states and territories. The remainder would be made up of two representing employers, two representing employees, an independent chair and the chief executive officer. It would make recommendations to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council, as I said previously. Its composition is, therefore, heavily political, and those members who one would hope would have some practical industry experience will be severely outnumbered. This is of particular importance when one looks at the voting arrangements. It transpires that they will not merely be outnumbered; they will in effect be marginalised. I quote from the explanatory memorandum to the bill with regard to clause 38-Decisions at meetings etc. This clause provides for a two-thirds majority of the votes of the voting members present and voting to determine a question at a meeting other than a question relating to the model OHS legislation or model OHS codes of practice. It goes on: … any decisions concerning model OHS legislation and model OHS codes of practice must be made by an absolute majority of all the voting members representing the Commonwealth, States and Territories. So any proposal on OH&S legislation and codes of practice, no matter how beneficial or practical, that fails to meet the vested interests of the states and territories will fail to get before the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. The explanatory memorandum continues with reference to clause 40 of the bill: This clause requires all members (including the CEO and substitute members) to disclose any pecuniary or other interest in matters under sideration by SWA. Members declaring an interest: … must not be present during any deliberation by SWA on the matter and must not take part in any decision on the matter. Then we come to the crunch, and again I quote: Howeverand this is a very important ‘however'this requirement does not apply to any decision with respect to the model OHS legislation or model OHS codes of practice. This ensures that the requirements of an absolute majority of the Commonwealth, States and Territories-as provided for by subclause 38(2)-are not undermined by ‘conflicting out' those members. This amounts to a political fix-to avoid causing the council any embarrassment by having to veto proposals it knows it cannot deliver. In the matter of model legislation and codes of practice, it seems Safe Work Australia will not be an independent body at all, merely a creature of the state and territory representatives. On the one hand, the government is paying lip-service to the principles of conflict of interest and then, on the other hand, it chooses to ignore them. So much for the independence of Safe Work Australia. It is only independent up to the point at which the interests of the states and territories are threatened, at which point the views and advice of those members with practical industry experience can be virtually ignored. It is the vested interests of the states and territories-and one state in particularthat have resulted in the existing plethora of different rules, regulations and enforcement practices in the first place. If the government is serious about reform, then how about this as an alternative: a body comprised entirely of employers and employees' representatives, reporting not to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council but to the Minister for Employment and Workcon- place Relations, who oversees federal legislation and enforcement? At this point, I acknowledge that some states and territories have gone further down the road of reforming OH&S matters than others. But, as we have seen with prolonged discussions over the fate of the Murray-Darling, it may only take one state to block the reform process, however critical the circumstances. In order to see how the interests of the states and territories are likely to be represented on Safe Work Australia, we need to look at their record of reform under the present arrangements. The international benchmark for modern OH&S practices in legislation was set following the UK parliamentary inquiry by Lord Robens in 1972. The Robens report noted the apathy that existed with regard to OH&S at the same time and made the following statement: … safety awareness industry and commerce can only be developed by an accumulation of influences and pressures operating at many levelsthat of the boardroom, the senior manager, the supervisor, the trade unions, the worker on the shop floor. The solution was to establish the principle that every individual involved in the work should be held responsible and liable for what they can practically and reasonably control. This principle of practical and reasonable control has become an international benchmark since it was put forward in 1972. Yet, when we look at the duty of care descriptions in the various Australian jurisdictions, we find that two states have still not yet caught up. In New South Wales, the employer has a total obligation to safety while the employee has only to take reasonable care. In Queensland, the employer again has a total obligation to safety while an employee only has to follow the employer's instructions. In all other jurisdictions, the duties of care are similar, as suggested by Lord Robens. I remind the House that Safe Work Australia can put forward changes to model legislation and codes of practice only on the basis of an absolute majority of Commonwealth, state and territory members. To make progress, it will have to rely on the goodwill of the minority in accepting the position of the majority. This may be optimistic, particularly in the case of New South Wales. The position was tipped even further against employers with the passage of a new OH&S act in 2000 in that state. This provided for a presumption of guilt against the legal employer but not against the employee, and for prosecutions to be carried out by the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales, where there is no avenue of appeal and no trial by jury. Therefore, although criminal convictions are recorded, the principles of criminal justice do not apply. Also, unions have the ability to bring prosecutions and can receive half the fines imposed in a successful prosecution. They may also have their legal fees paid. Clearly, it is right that prosecutions should be brought against negligent employers, but surely they should be brought by an independent agency and one which does not stand to benefit financially from the prosecution. It goes against the principles of justice that the person bringing the prosecution stands to gain from it. How would we feel if parking officers took a cut from every parking fine imposed? What impact would that have on the independence or the perceived independence of such officers? Last year, the Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council and other business groups and individual companies produced a paper entitled Making work safe. This reported that, with one-third of the national workforce, New South Wales conducted 63.4 per cent of all OH&S prosecutions between 1989-99 and 2002-03. Some 96 per cent of all New South Wales prosecutions resulted in a conviction in 2002-03. What we have in New South Wales is not a regime designed to deliver the best OH&S outcomes and safe workplaces but a punitive system-one heavily weighted against employers, with few obligations placed on employees to take reasonable care for their own safety-and also a cash cow for unions. Is it any wonder that New South Wales, with one-third of our national workforce, the largest state in Australia by virtue of population, is lagging badly behind in terms of economic growth and prosperity? Why on earth would anyone want to do business in New South Wales when they could do business elsewhere? To quote the Making work safe report again: For any business of size in New South Wales, it is only a matter of time, and luck, before managers, executives and directors face prosecution for incidents where they did not exercise control. It cannot be quantified, but it is fair to assume that this is adversely affecting the New South Wales economy as business views investment in New South Wales as carrying an unacceptably high, unfair and unjust risk of OH&S conviction for their personnel. The legislation has also had the effect of shifting the focus of OH&S management from the prevention of injuries to the mitigation of legal risk. The fact of the matter is that the New South Wales state government is controlled by the unions and, until that control is broken, New South Wales will be an obstacle to change on this and many other issues. There can be no clearer example of the malign influence of the unions than the fate of the New South Wales government's own attempts to reform. In 2006, with the support of employers, the government put forward draft legislation moving towards harmonisation with other states and territories and going some way to removing the presumption of guilt. First, the consultation period was extended. Then the legislation was referred to the Stein review, which conducted further consultation. The review concluded-surprise, surprise!-that the existing legislation should be retained, though the report of the review was not released until some months later. In response to this, the New South Wales opposition put forward the government's own draft legislation as a private member's bill, but it was then voted down. So, after two rounds of consultation, including with New South Wales WorkCover, which was overwhelmingly in favour of reform, there will be no reform of OH&S in New South Wales. I should also point out that the proposed changes did not affect the unions' ability to profit from prosecutions that they brought, so the cash cow under this legislation was still retained. There are only a few groups benefiting from the kind of archaic class warfare still taking place in New South Wales and those are the unions, interstate business competitors and international business competitors those operating in New South Wales. The unions are not making the workplace any safer for their members, and in fact they are just putting their own jobs at risk. By all means, let us harmonise our workers compensation and OH&S legislation, but the dead hand of the trade unions lies over proposals that the government has put forward. If this government is serious about reform, then it will set up a truly independent Safe Work Australia and it will commit to enacting its proposals, whatever the views of the teetering New South Wales state government.",93
41,Mr CHEESEMAN,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I have certainly noted the contribution just made by the current member for Cowper. I am appalled that the coalition would suggest that liability for workplace injuries ought to be pushed onto employees. The Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 brings together two core themes that the Rudd government has. There is the issue of reform of the Australian federation through cooperative federalism and there is the issue of better workplace laws, of which perhaps the most important one is worker safety. Cooperative federalism is one of our major reform areas. Cooperative federalism is about reducing duplication. It is a way we can improve consistency. It is a way we can improve efficiency. It is a way we can improve national productivity. It is a way we can simplify rules and improve public knowledge and understanding of rules. The Safe Work Australia Bill is about exactly that. This bill is good for workers as it will establish better national safety standards. It is good for workers as it will establish simpler, standardised, better understood, workplace safety rules. Safe Work Australia, as an independent national body, will have the role of improving occupational health and safety and of improving safety outcomes and workto ers compensation arrangements across Australia as a whole. These aims will be good for business, good for government and good for workers. These reforms are a part of the Rudd Labor government's goal of creating a seamless national economy that is not being dragged down by duplications and border disputes. Of course there is more to this than economic efficiencies. More than 300 Australians are killed each year at work. Many more die as a result of work related diseases. Each year, over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. The cost to our economy has been estimated at $34 billion per year. The cost to those injured and to their families, workmates and friends cannot be measured. My view is that 300 Australians dying each year is completely and totally unacceptable. We should not accept it. We should never accept that it is the way of the world that every year some fathers and mothers will walk out the front door while off to work, wave goodbye to their kids and families, and never come home. My view is that we have to raise the bar on workplace safety rules, raise the bar on knowledge of workplace safety procedures and raise the bar on adherence to those rules. Let us look at this comparatively. No, we are not the worse-off country in the world when it comes to workplace safety-not by a long way. We have indeed built a workplace system, thanks in large part to the efforts of the Australian trade union movement, that is one of the best in the world. Our workplace safety systems are some of the most advanced in the world. We have come a long way. But we still have a long way to go. Let us think of where Australia is today, broadly speaking-and Australia is one of the best countries in the world. Our workers compensation schemes are of course still very problematic. Workers compensation has been the source of major disputes between governments, businesses and unions for a long time. The schemes are very complicated and they are often very costly. There are all sorts of inconsistencies between jurisdictions. There is a long way to go in this area of workers compensation. Then there are safety standards. Safety rules and regulations are a mishmash from one state to another. There are different rules and different standards, making it very difficult for workers, businesses and governments. Workers who move from one state to another are often confused or ignorant about workplace standards and procedures, leading to non-compliance and then accidents. There are many reasons why workplace accidents occur. Two central reasons are a lack of knowledge of and a lack of adherence to workplace safety procedures. If you have six different systems, of course you are going to have more confusion, a lack of knowledge, often indifference and a reduced inclination towards compliance with our safety rules. As they say, knowledge leads to action; confusion leads to inaction. In the workplace, confusion often leads to accidents. The establishment of Safe Work Australia will ultimately lead to simpler, universal rules and a better understanding of rules by workers and their employers. And that will lead to action. Australia today has the opportunity to set a whole new standard in workplace safety. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is an essential part of the government's strategy to facilitate improvements to safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. Since we have come to office, the Rudd government have undertaken a review of the Comcare system, set up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national occupational health and safety review, and developed a landmark intergovernmental agreement with our state and territory counterparts to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation nationally. This bill, along with the intergovernmental agreement, brings a new era of cooperation between the state and federal governments on this matter. It addresses another key area of cooperative federalism that will save lives, simplify rules and reduce the cost of doing business. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was established by the Howard government and was a narrowly focused body with limited powers. Safe Work Australia will provide new benchmarks. It will be yet another example of why Labor is the party of reform. Safe Work Australia is being tasked with some important jobs. Safe Work Australia will develop a national policy relating to occupational health and safety and workers compensation; prepare, monitor and revise model occupational health and safety standards and model codes of practice; develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions; develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements; collect, analyse and publish occupational health and safety and workers compensation data and undertake and publish research; drive national communications strategies to raise awareness of health and safety in the workplace; further develop the National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy; and advise the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on occupational health and safety and workers compensation matters. It is a big, big job. When this is achieved it will be seen as one of the great reforms within Australian workplaces and Australian industry. Safe Work Australia, in short, will be a big step forward for workers, their employers and their communities. It will be a body which will take Australian workplace safety laws to the next level to simplify safety laws and make them more effective and efficient. I ask all members to think about this. There are four shires within my electorate. One of those shires-one of the smallest shires, the Colac Otway Shire-has had more than 900 work related injuries in the past five years, costing more than $18 million in rehabilitation and compensation payouts. That is a cost to local families, local businesses and a cost to government. Of course we always need to put things into some sort of absolute perspective. When the industrial world first came to Australia there were no workplace safety laws at all. In bits and pieces each colony, then state, put in place its own rules. These rules and regulations developed in their complexity in different ways in different states. Today, for the first time in Australian history, the states are committing to harmonising occupational health and safety legislation through this mechanism. This is essential and is a very productive reform. I would also like to pay tribute to some of my former friends and colleagues within the trade union movement who for many years have championed occupational health and safety within their workplaces and have contributed substantially to making workplaces much, much safer. Their efforts have led to many more families being able to enjoy safe workplaces. When incidents occur they are looked after through the necessary compensation arrangements that have been put in place. I commend this bill to the House as a very substantial improvement in workers' occupational health and safety.",97
42,Mr CIOBO,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise to speak to the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. What we see in front of the House today is another example of Labor's botched policy when it comes to so-called harmonisation of occupational health and safety across Australia. I know, as shadow small business minister, that the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Dr Emerson, travels around Australia highlighting how this proposal will herald a new dawn and how this proposal will be a key part of Labor's plans to bring harmonisation across Australia and to ensure a cost to that red tape is reduced. But, like so many aspects of what Labor does, the bills that are before the House today are bills that execute, in traditional Labor fashion, its great plans to centralise power, to centralise regulation and to ensure that, where possible, those who do not have knowledge about occupational health and safety-who, it must be concluded from the legislation, are employers and employeesshould, rather, turn to those who do have knowledge about occupational health and safety-who, it must be concluded again from the legislation, are in fact state government bureaucrats-to find out which is the best way forward. Because, like so many of Labor's policies, the execution of this icy, which the minister will talk about across Australia and say is one of those key 27 areas where Labor intends to harmonise legislation to save red tape, will in fact introduce Safe Work Australia as the overarching body with responsibility for Australia's national OH&S system as devised by the Australian Labor government. And in this case a number of key changes are being made. Most concerning for me is that the core of this bill sees a reduction in the number of social partner representatives-that is, industry and union representatives-from three to two for each of the partners. Labor does not hold a monopoly on concern for the welfare of employers and employees when it comes to safe workplaces. Labor does not hold a monopoly, even though it is a trade union dominated political body that says it is the only one in this chamber concerned about whether or not Australia's workplaces are safe. It is well and good to talk about having safe workplaces, but the execution of a policy designed to implement the best regulatory structure to achieve a safe workplace is a whole separate question, and that question is not best answered by the establishment of Safe Work Australia and a concurrent reduction in the number of social partner representatives. We see a one-third reduction in the representatives for the social partners when compared to the composition of the old Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which, through this bill, is effectively being replaced and rebranded-albeit in a way, as I have outlined, that compromises the tripartite approach traditionally required for OH&S regulation to effectively operate in workplaces. We now see, as a result of the execution of this bill, the creation of an imbalance whereby workplaces directly impacted by the formulation and development of OH&S will actually be denied the opportunity to genupolinely participate in the decision-making processes that underpin the entire formulation of such policy-and that point cannot be stressed enough. This Labor Party policy, despite it being sold-or perhaps a better phrase would be ‘despite the minister spinning it'-as being a step in the right direction, will actually see the massive centralisation of power here in Canberra and an increase in percentage and proportional terms of bureaucrats and not of groups like ACCI or, indeed, of the trade union movement. It is worth noting that we should not easily sideline groups like ACCI. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is a very influential organisation-and rightly so, because ACCI represents over four million employees and hundreds of thousands of employers. From my perspective, it is very clear that a group that specifically advocates for and represents hundreds of thousands of employers-and, through those employers, four million employees-should be listened to. To have a watering down of their role in this process seems to me absurd. But it does not seem absurd to the Labor Party, because we know, as I said, that Labor's approach in this bill is not to have a belief that employers and employees should have a place at the table in the same proportions as they did previously, but rather that the best decisions when it comes to OH&S are of course made by the bureaucrats. So that is the theme that we see woven throughout this legislation, and that is the outcome that will be achieved. There would be many employers and employees, I am sure, especially in Australia's small-business sector-which, of itself, represents about 2.4 million small businesses employing around four million Australianswho would be scratching their heads at this proposal by the Labor Party. They would be scratching their heads because we saw, up until last weekend, the Labor Party in power in every single state across our federation. They were glorious days for the Australian Labor Party. But, thankfully, that wall of trade union and political apparatchiks has now been broken. It is like the busting of dam. And there is a new sunlight over in Western Australia. But the dam wall has been breached, and we look forward to more of it coming down in due course. But, that notwithstanding, small businesses across Australia would be scratching their heads today because they would be wondering why it is that the Rudd Labor government believes the best way forward on OH&S is to ensure that maximum power is given to state government bureaucrats and representatives when they themselves are responsible for the mess of OH&S laws that exist across Australia today. The federal minister stands up and says how Safe Work Australia is a step in the direction, through the centralisation here in Canberra-one step removed from the state based OH&S systems that we hadand that that is a step forward. But, by the way, it will actually be the state based bureaucrats that have the majority say when it comes to the operation of Safe Work Australia. It is little wonder then that I have had small-business owners, employers and employees talk to me about their concerns about what this bill will actually mean. At the end of the day, it is well and good for the ter to stand up and make a comment, and it is well and good for the Rudd Labor government to claim that this is a step in the right direction, but the execution and the implementation of it are fundamentally different. I have genuine concerns that, when the coalition explores this further in the other place, the actual result of the implementation of this legislation will be that we will see employers and employees effectively sidelined from the formulation of OH&S policy developmentand that would certainly be a step in the wrong direction. The key reason, as I said, is because of the actual composition of SWA. It will, without a doubt, lead to a situation where government the representatives will be able to repeatedly override legitimate concerns raised by those social partners in the union movement and, for example, ACCI. During OH&S harmonisation discussions, including concerns relating to increased costs or impractical safety proposals for workplaces, we will see state government representatives saying, ‘Well, sorry; you are just going to have to cop that. That is just going to be part of it, because this is what we need because it will no doubt suit the bureaucracy, even though in practical application employers and employees could in fact be much worse off.' We see many examples of this in practice at a state government level today. We have seen many right examples of Labor's botched handling of of power OH&S at a state government levelexamples where, at a state government level, we have seen the encroachment of ridiculous attempts to ensure compliance and execute so-called safety concerns to actually achieve other outcomes that state Labor governments have sought. There are issues such as right of entry. How many instances exist in Australia where we see right of entry requirements executed through OH&S laws? How many times will minisAustralians-both employers and employees-now be subjected to encroachment by unions into workplaces under the guise of OH&S? My concern is that, with SWA effectively subject to ministerial direction, we could see this Rudd Labor government, which owes a very big debt to the trade union movement, making sure that they do their bidding. Let us not lose sight of the fact that this side of the House is not owned by any one organisation, unlike the Australian Labor Party. And the Australian Labor Party, we know, is the political wing of the trade union movement of Australia. I see members opposite shaking their heads-members of the government are saying that that is not the case. You cannot be a member of the Labor Party unless you are in a trade union. We know that the Australian government is only there today because about $100 million of trade union funds flowed into an advertising campaign to help get Kevin Rudd elected. The member for Griffith knows that he has a very big debt to pay back to Australia's trade union movement. There can be no doubt-and it should be of especially great concern to Australia's 2.4 million small businesses-that the government's rush to bring in SWA will actually see all sorts of opportunities created down the track, under this new, centralised, you-beaut, Labor policy, under ministerial direction, for unions to have access to workplaces, pretending to have, or being spun as having, genuine concern and regard for occupational health and safety. We see as well that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister Gillard, appears to be determined not to listen to stakeholders-those representatives of employers and employees with significant involvement in workplaces-because, through the reduction of their representation and the reliance on state representatives who have already repeatedly failed, as I have outlined, we see that that seems to be the strategy for the execution of this legislation and the development of Safe Work Australia. In addition, the foundation upon which Safe Work Australia has been established is also fundamentally flawed because it requires the direction and success of SWA to be contingent on the cooperation and participation of the Workplace Relations Ministers Council, to which it directly reports. We know that members of the ministerial council have repeatedly failed to attend or, at times, cooperate with the Commonwealth in these meetings in which there have been issues and legitimate concerns raised about just how effective SWA will be in an environment where state Labor governments have traditionally been unwilling to cooperate and genuinely contribute to discussions about the harmonisation of OH&S laws across Australia. Where the ministerial council fails to meet or refuses to cooperate and consider Safe Work Australia issues, the work of SWA will effectively come to a halt. That is another key concern that the coalition has about the proposed legislation. It will ensure that we see the creation of an unjustifiable imbalance. Improving OH&S performance will be critically dependent on there being an effort and buy-in from all stakeholders, and a process that does not seek to engage workers and employers in a meaningful way will not lead to improvements in workplace health and safety. Labor's duplicity in this regard is further highlighted by its failure to report back to parliament on the progress of SWA. How extraordinary that this bill proposes that SWA report back to this parliament only once every six years. Once every six years is what the Labor Party is putting forward as its plan to ensure that Safe Work Australia remains accountable to this parliament. We have the sidelining of employer representatives, the sidelining of employee representatives, the centralisation of power in Canberra and control being given to the state representatives who have failed in the past but who will now have the casting and controlling number of votes on SWArepresentatives who are also now being required to report back to the parliament only once every six years. This is potentially a recipe for a great deal of pain, problems, increased red tape, additional compliance costs and lower employment. That very reasonably is the expected outcome as a result of the creation of SWA. I say to all of Australia's small businesses-and also, of course, the large businesses-and to those employees who are genuinely concerned about the safety of their workplaces: keep a very close eye on the execution, implementation and development of OH&S laws under SWA. It is my concern that we will see a body that will be dominated by state bureaucrats, a body that will execute the same kinds of botched and failed policies that we have seen all over this country under the raft of Labor governments that existed-and still do exist in large part. We will also see a Prime Minister and a minister who are so indebted to Australia's trade union movement that, under ministerial direction, we see the thin end of the wedge getting driven into Australian workplaces. All of these concerns are the reason why the coalition will ensure that this bill is erly scrutinised, is thoroughly investigated and has its consequences fully explored in the other place. The coalition will not oppose this bill in this place, but we certainly reserve the right to examine it much more closely. Whilst in principle we support the notion of less red tape, we also have those very specific and genuine concerns about what this bill will actually result in for Australia's 2.4 million small businesses and, more importantly, across all workplaces in this country.",99
43,Mr BIDGOOD,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Dawson) (1.19 pm)Before I start to talk about the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008, I would like to acknowledge a few schools and students who are present in parliament today. I welcome the teachers and 52 students from Mackay West State School in the seat of Dawson. It was a pleasure to talk to them this morning and to give them insights into how this great democracy works. I also wish to acknowledge the students from Claremont Meadows Public School who are in the gallery today. I also wish to acknowledge the presence in the chamber of my colleague the member for Lindsay, who is a long-time resident of the Claremont Meadows community. It is always good to welcome students and teachers to this House and to set a good example of how our democracy works. I rise to speak in favour of the Safe Work Australia Bill. The government has set itself the task of creating a seamless national economy unhampered by unnecessary state duplications, overlaps and differences. We do this because we care about building a better Australia now and into the future. Occupational health and safety is a prime candidate for this sort of reform. It is a fact that more than 300 Australians are killed at work each year. Many more die as a result of work reproplated disease. Each year over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. The cost to our economy from death or injury has been estimated at $34 billion per year. The cost to those injured and to their families, workmates and friends is inestimable. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is an essential part of the government's strategy to improve safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. Since coming to office we have (1) undertaken a review of the Comcare scheme, (2) set up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national occupational health and safety review and (3) developed a landmark intergovernmental agreement with our state and territory counterparts to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation nationally. This bill, together with the intergovernmental agreement, ushers in a new era of cooperation and collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in this important area-a collaboration which will improve the health and safety of workers across Australia and reduce the complexity of regulation for businesses. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, established by the Howard government as an advisory council, whose functions were confined to coordinating, monitoring and promoting national efforts on health and safety and workers compensation. Safe Work Australia will (a) develop national policy relating to occupational health and safety and workers compensation; (b) prepare, monitor and revise model occupational health and safety legislation; (c) develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions; (d) develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements; (e) collect, analyse and publish occupational health and safety and workers compensation data and undertake and publish research; and (f) drive national communications strategies to raise awareness of health and safety at work. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation are too important to be neglected any longer. Workers' lives and health are at stake, and so too is the efficiency of our economy. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation reform will increase profitability and productivity and better protect the lives and health of Australians. The purpose of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 is to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body to improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. The bill will play a pivotal role in realising the government's commitment to work cooperatively with the state and territory governments to improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. It will do that by empowering Safe Work Australia to, firstly, develop national policy in respect of occupational health and safety and workers compensation; secondly, prepare model OH&S legislation and model OH&S codes of practice for approval by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council and adoption by the Commonwealth, the states and the territories; thirdly, develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure that a nationally consistent approach is taken to compliance and enforcement; fourthly, develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements across all jurisdictions and proposals for national workers compensation arrangements for employers with workers in more than one jurisdiction; fifthly, build expertise across OH&S laws and workers compensation schemes that will be readily accessible across jurisdictions and industries and will reduce the complexity and costs for businesses, including businesses that operate across state boundaries; and, sixthly, undertake data collection and research and publish findings to ensure that all jurisdictions and industries have access to up-to-date and industry-specific information that will enable employers and workers to adopt practices that will reduce instances of risk and injury in workplaces across Australia. Safe Work Australia will be a reform focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. Safe Work Australia will be 50 per cent funded by the Commonwealth and 50 per cent funded by the states and territories. The bill will also create and maintain mechanisms for review and revision of the effectiveness of Safe Work Australia in performing its functions. This will ensure that the body is active and operating efficiently and responsively in meeting its strategic and operational goals. One of Safe Work Australia's primary functions will be to develop national policy relating to OH&S and workers compensation. National policy developed by Safe Work Australia will be used to drive harmonisation initiatives, such as the adoption and implementation of model OH&S legislation and consistent enforcement and compliance strategies, and the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements across the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. I commend this to the House.",103
44,Mr HAWKE,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise to speak on the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. The primary purpose of the Safe Work Australia Bill is to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body to oversee occupational health and safety-OH&S-outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. I want to note my grave concern about this legislation as it stands before this House day, in the sense that the bill proposes duction in the level of industry and union representation in the mix of Safe Work Australia. Indeed, it seems to be harking back to that principle espoused by so many Labor governments around Australia that government knows better than the industry. I find it ironic that in this chamber we have heard speakers representing the ACTU-the Australian Council of Trade Unions-speak on how it is a good thing that there will be a reduction in the ACTU and Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry representation on the Safe Work Australia body through the specific reduction in social partner representation. This, of course, will have the undesired outcome of enhancing state governments' involvement in the decision making process on the presumption that somehow these state governments will produce better OH&S outcomes around the country. I do not think it stands up to a great deal of scrutiny that the states have done a superior job on occupational health and safety and will therefore do a great job as part of a national body. I acknowledge that some states have performed well on reforming OH&S legislation, but my own state of New South Wales is not one of them. For example, in 2006, New South Wales introduced bill some legislation to harmonise occupational health and safety with some of the other states. What we saw was a litany of delayscommittees, reviews and consultation. A report was produced after many months of uncertainty, proposed changes, discussion, consultation and so on. The end result was a recommendation not to proceed with this legislation which would have harmonised and produced a better result in the area of occupational health and safety. This was in spite of the fact that WorkCover New South Wales was in favour of this reform. Indeed, there is to- a need for reform. We do need to have a feda re- eral body to reform and improve national standards of occupational health and safety for the future. We need to take away the presumption of guilt that is thrown at employers. We need to ensure that we have not only a presumption of innocence but also rigorous mechanisms for delving into cases where employers might not be doing the right thing. At the moment, that balance has not been properly struck. The government has proposed in this bill that the composition of Safe Work Australia will include the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. But there are real concerns that the states, with their vested interest in not changing this legislation, will dominate the decision making of this body. It is the case that the states around Australia have been captured by unions and are beholden to unions. We have seen that at so many levels. It would be a poor outcome for Australia if we had a national body, formed under the guise of reform, that did not produce real reform-a body that could spend many months discussing and disseminating ideas but would have the voting power to vote down anything that may be meaningful or substantial. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions are serious bodies. They represent their members and workers well. With their respective responsibilities and roles, they do a great job for Australia. I would much prefer to have their input strengthened, because occupational health and safety is essentially about the relationship between the employer and the employee and ensuring that they are cooperating to produce great outcomes in occupational health and safety. The experience of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions will be valuable on this body. We should be seeking to increase and enhance their representation rather than reducing it in favour of state governments. I think it is quite accepted around Australia today that the states do not have a brilliant record on many things, particularly New South Wales. Certainly, in terms of infrastructure, they do not have a great record of providing public transport in my electorate. My electorate has the highest dependency on cars of any electorate in Australia. We have heard today that the $12 billion metro line that has been promised by the New South Wales government since 1999 is going to be scrapped-again-in favour of a heavy rail option potentially in the next 20 years. My electorate has the highest proportion of car ownership in Australia and it has no train line running through it anywhere. So I certainly do not accept the contention that the states dominating this body will produce a better outcome for occupational health and safety in Australia. I think it will give governments an undue influence over outcomes. I want to pay tribute to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I also note that the member for Corangamite mentioned Bernie Banton. Bernie Banton resided in my electorate of Mitchell, and one of my first sad duties as the member-elect was to attend his funeral. He was a great campaigner for occupational health and safety. His funeral at Homebush was a fitting and moving tribute to his life. I felt very privileged to represent the people of my electorate in recognising his service and his contribution to occupational health and safety. I note also that he was a great friend and longtime associate of my predecessor Alan Cadman. One of the difficulties with having a single federal enforcement agency that has nine Commonwealth, state and territory reps and only two employer reps and two employee reps is that, more often than not, you get a heavily politicised outcome. Industry experience is outnumbered. If you examine clause 38 of the explanatory memorandum you will see the way that voting is conducted. It requires a two-thirds majority of members on occupational health and safety mattersother than the model occupational health and safety legislation-and an absolute majority of the Commonwealth, states and territories. This again highlights one of the deficiencies of this bill, which is that we require an absolute majority of Commonwealth, states and territories to be present to achieve reform. Essentially, if even half of the states and territories do not agree on reform, we are not going to get reform-which again will lead to a domination by the states and territories, with their vested interests. It begs the question: where is the bold reform? Where is the new era of cooperative federalism? That is a term that has been bandied about in this debate. Cooperative federalism really produces cooperative bureaucracy-and cooperative bureaucracy does not produce outcomes; it produces bureaucracy. That is my fear in relation to the model that the government is proposing. I do feel that, if you examine some of the provisions, there is a good case for saying that a body that represents 350,000 businesses and 280,000 enterprises that employ fewer than 20 people, that has a national network through industry associations and chambers of commerce and that has been formed virtually since Federation ought to have a strong say in the occupational health and safety policies and procedures of this nation. But I also stand up, ironically, for Australian Council of Trade Unions. It represents two million workers and their families. It has been in place for almost 100 years as well. Look at the campaign in relation to James Hardie. Some great outcomes have been achieved over the years on behalf of workers. But this outcome is not a good one for either body in the sense that they will have a reduced say in future legislation and in harmonising OH&S legislation. The fact is that New South Wales has worked to stymie reform in occupational health and safety. It has worked to delay legislation that was looking to ensure that the presumption of guilt was examined and removed, even when WorkCover was in favour of this reform. I think that highlights that there are some flaws in this model and that there could be a case for some strong reform. I think the limitation of the involvement of the social partners will, without a doubt, lead to a situation where government reps override legitimate concerns that are raised by the social partners during their discussions. If we are really going to be serious about reform we should look at the notion raised by one of my colleagues-that is, to have a federal body where industry and the unions are the main partners, where they tackle the real issues and recommend a model directly to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I think that is a much better model than going through the ministerial council. It is another layer of bureaucracy that will, I think, stymie what may well be legitimate attempts at reform by the government and reform that we would all like to see in relation to occupational health and safety to ensure better workplaces. That is the approach that is adopted by this government too often: if we are in doubt, we may send something to a committee. If we are in doubt about the committee, we will have a review. If we have a review then we will need a rethe port. We will take time to look at the report and then we may be able to produce an insubstantial and weak policy response that will not do very much to address the core problems that we are having. That is not a good way to run government, and over time that may well produce some poor results here. I do not think this model, as it stands, will produce the results that the government is seeking. The states and their vested interests are set to dominate. We may well be back here at some time in the future to revisit this body in order to ensure that industry and the unions have a greater say at the table and are able to work together to propose new and meaningful reform. I find it a concern that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is determined not to listen to the stakeholders. I think the representatives of employers and employees with significant involvement in workplaces really need to be listened to on this. We should come back here, revisit this legislation and ensure that we have a body that has much more input from industry and the unions. The foundation upon which Safe Work Australia has been established does appear to have that flaw in it. With the direction and success of Safe Work Australia being contingent on the cooperation and participation of the ministerial council, it certainly raises some questions about whether, if the ministerial council is not meeting or not operating well, we can again move forward with reform. Safe Work Australia will be required under this model to report directly to the ministerial council. The fact is that there may be members of the ministerial council who repeatedly fail to attend or cooperate with the Commonwealth in these meetings, which raises some concerns about how effective it will be when state governments are unwilling to cooperate or genuinely contribute to harmonisation questions. As I stated previously, I think it is knowledged fact and maxim at the moment that most state governments are captive to the unions. Very little can be done in any of the states without getting a union seal of approval or a tick-off from the unions. Certainly a balance has not been struck between achieving good economic outcomes and good outcomes for members of unions. When we have states that are beholden to unions and captive to their policies and will not change their outlook on things that need modernisation and reform, we really have a blockage and an impediment to achieving reform in Australia that we do need to take steps towards removing. I think having all those partners that are so beholden to unions means that the whole structure of Safe Work Australia is out of kilter. If the ministerial council fails to meet or refuses to cooperate, there will be a concern that the operation of Safe Work Australia's reform program and its policies may well come to a halt. I do not think that will be a good development. Improving occupational health and safety, I might add, is a critically important area. It is critically dependent as well on a collaborative approach and a collaborative effort. If we are really serious about achieving some improvement in occupational health and safety, we want a process that engages workers and employees in a meaningful way. That is my essential criticism of this legislation. Many of the states have already rejected attempts at meaningful reform. Many of them have tied up reform in bureaucracy, committees and reports and then have ultimately rejected that reform. I do not think we are going to see much movement in terms of having states come to the federal table for more discussions, more debate, when they still have those vested interests and those blockages to achieving real and meaningful reform. The bill currently proposes an inadequate an acprocess for reporting back to parliament every six years on the progress of Safe Work Australia. I do not think it is acceptable that Labor wants to introduce a state dominated independent authority that has no requirement to report to this place for six years. That is an important point for us to make a contribution on. If you are serious about achieving real reform, I do not think setting a six-year time frame for a report to this place is really a meaningful time frame in which to say, ‘Look, we've got states that want some reform and we've got a Commonwealth that wants some reform. We're going to get a new body, Safe Work Australia, together. We're going to have a discussion about reform and we're going to set a report date to the Commonwealth in six years time.' I really do not see that as a genuine time frame for us to make a contribution. I do believe that this government sometimes has some reasonable objectives-and occupational health and safety does require some examination and, hopefully, cooperative federalism. But we are really getting a very weak policy response and we are really setting ourselves up for failure by setting up a body that is dominated totally by the states, without industry and genuine national union representation-without their input and without their ability to vote down or vote up proposals. In my view it falls into the category of some of the other failed government policies of GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch, the abolition of the ABCCMr Ramsey-Whale watch.",105
45,Mr HAWKE,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Yes, ‘whale watch', as the member for Grey said. Mr Dutton-Pension watch.",109
46,Mr HAWKE,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Yes, ‘pension watch'. I could go on but I will not. I will spare the House the continued examination of failed Labor policies. But there is a sense with this government that, in attempting reform, we get a weak response that is designed to make people think that something is happening when, actually, very little will change. Meaningful reform will be held up and the vested interests of the states will continue to dominate in this vital area of occupational health and safety, and that will not be a good outcome. We really should be examining ways of enhancing the input of the industry and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-the peak body representing businesses in Australia. We should be finding ways to ensure employers and employees are making a meaningful contribution to OH&S policies at a national level and collaborating to produce better results. That would be one way of ensuring there is real reform in the next five or six years. In summary I would say that, until we get a model that is cognisant of those facts, I think we need to pause and reconsider some of the mechanisms in this legislation.",109
47,Mr HAYES,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Werriwa) (1.46 pm)Before I turn to this very important piece of legislation, I would like to acknowledge the students from Claremont Meadows Public School who are in the gallery. They are constituents of my colleague, the member for Lindsay. Hopefully, they are furthering their education and seeing how we conduct ourselves here in the House. So I am assuming that they will not be here for question time. As I said, the legislation before the House, the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and associated bill, is very important. There are risks associated with any job, and far too often people get hurt or even killed in their places of employment. Injuries sustained at work can cause physical and emotional damage which may extend for lengthy periods of time or throughout a person's career. A large number of deaths occur in workplaces all over the world-and supporting working families should be near and dear to all of us. The statistics show that in Australia alone more than 300 people lose their lives during the course of their work and many more die as a result of a work related disease. A government member-Bernie Banton.",109
48,Mr HAYES,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I thank my friend for acknowledging Bernie Banton. His situation typifies the case of a lingering injury that affects not only the person concerned but also their family-and, ultimately, in Bernie's case, resulted in him losing his life. Over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured in the workplace each year. I was talking to the CFMEU recently and they advised me that in 2006-07 there were 40 reported fatalities on building sites alone. That was up from 33 the year before. I know it is a very dangerous industry. I have two sons who work in the industry, so I personally have some knowledge of it. One of my boys only recently came back from working in Western Australia, out at Port Hedland. He was due to stay there for some time working as an electrician. He rang me one morning to confirm what we would be doing at Phillip Island, as we were both going down to see the motorcycle races this year. He called me back some time that afternoon and, in a distressed state, told me that one of the people he worked with, Andrew MCLaughlin-a 52year-old-unfortunately was crushed to death on the site. My sympathies certainly go to the family of Andrew MCLaughlin, who had family in Port Hedland, and his work colleagues. I certainly saw how his death affected my son. It resulted in him deciding that it was time come home-which for a father is always good news. Notwithstanding that my son is 28 years old, you still care about your kids. That is why this legislation is so important. We all care about our kids and our families. Importantly, this legislation will ensure that we limit the risk for people who go about that normal, everyday function of going to work. It should be a normal, everyday function, with minimal risk of losing your life or sustaining a serious injury. Recently the RTA of New South Wales indicated to me that, in New South Wales alone, there were 95 fatalities from crashes involving heavy vehicles. Again, these are work related. We might put them down to being a road based statistic but they are nevertheless work related fatalities. It should also be noted that there were 1,658 serious injuries that occurred as a result of those heavy vehicle accidents. As a matter of fact, Tony Sheldon, of the TWU, indicated to me that one in five fatalities on our main roads involves heavy vehicles. So one in five of those fatalities can be considered work related. That is one of the reasons that I have exercised a lot of time in this House talking in support of the widening of the F5 freeway. The Hume Highway, which passes through my electorate, sees about 365,000 movements of freight per year involving heavy vehicles. For the people involved in driving these heavy vehicles there is a risk of work related injuries due to tiredness, fatigue or speed related accidents. That is why I supported, earlier this week, the AusLink bill, which contains provisions for this government to invest in rest and decoupling areas for heavy vehicle drivers, to ensure that when they are on the roads they are at a maximum level of alertness. I should acknowledge that I have just had to lunch and a meeting with Barry Dawson and Gerry Ping-Nam from the National Electrical and Communications Association, NECA. This group spearheads the training of apprentices. In New South Wales alone there are 350 apprentices who go through this training agency. As a matter of fact my son Nicholas, whom I referred to a little earlier, was a product of their training regime. He became an electrician's apprentice after leaving school and went on to become an electrician. NECA does a fabulous job in training our apprentices. One thing that Barry Dawson and Gerry Ping-Nam indicated to me today was the time and effort they put into ensuring that these young people develop not only a work ethic but a safety ethic, which they take to any job they go to. It is not one based on one employer being more vigilant about safety than another. Every graduate of the NECA training system has ingrained in them right from the outset the need to be specifically engaged in looking out for the safety not only of themselves but of their work colleagues. I congratulate Gerry Ping-Nam and Barry Dawson on what they are doing for young people in New South Wales in advancing a training regime and agenda which has the issue of safety front and centre. A recent report of the Australian Safety and Compensation Council shows that workplace fatalities were 16 per cent higher in 2006-07 than they were in 2003-04. I know many will put that down to the fact that there were more people in the workforce. But we are talking an overall percentage, which is something that is critical to the way in which we advance training and safety procedures in workplaces. We do not want to have a regime that simply produces work at any cost. The value of life and the value of safety in the workplace are things that just cannot be compromised. The ABS survey Work-Related Injuries, Australia, 2005-06 indicates that 689,500 workers experienced a work related injury or illness, a 44 per cent increase from the year 2000. That is an extraordinary increase. These are not just statistics; these are mums and dads or kids like my own or yours, Madam Deputy Speaker, who go to work each day. We should never look at these numbers as just statistics. They represent real people and they underpin our commitment to a safe, efficient and practical workplace. fight, I understand, can never totally be won, but there are things that we must stay fixed on if we are ever going to reasonably address what should be a fundamental fairness in the workplace. Monday fortnight, 29 September, is National Police Remembrance Day. This is a day on which to remember all those police officers who have lost their lives during the course of their employment. They too are workers. They too deserve safe workplaces. We expect the police to be the thin blue line that protects society from anarchy, but at the end of the day we have responsibilities to them. For that reason I have given notice that in the House next Monday I will move that we support and recognise the role of our police and recognise that many of their number put themselves in life-threatening positions on a daily basis and that many, unfortunately, have lost their lives in just causes on our behalf. Reducing work related deaths and injuries is a formidable task. What we are looking for is a seamless transition to incorporating safe practices through education, through monitoring the way in which employers run workplaces and through people simply being able to do their jobs in a fair and safe manner. One thing that should be apparent to everyone in this place is that there have been numerous inconsistencies between the various state and territory jurisdictions on issues of work related health. These inconsistencies unfortunately lead to poorer safety standards in the various states and territories. There is also an economic cost-if I could appeal to the economists amongst those on the other side-to doing this and getting it right. These inconsistencies and complexities increase the paperwork and costs of some 39,000 Australian businesses that operate in more than one state or territory. The estiThis mated cost to our community is $34 billion per year. When you add to that the costs of injuries or deaths-including the cost to their families, friends and work colleagues-the figure is incalculable, and one that needs to be addressed. If anyone here has been unlucky enough to experience losing someone in the workplace they will know what I am talking about. As I said, my own son lost a work colleague. I know how it impacted on him. For those reasons we should stay fixed on this. Safe Work Australia is a critical first step in improving safety outcomes for all Australian workers.",109

51,Mr RUDD,BEIJING PARALYMPIC GAMES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, last night the 2008 Paralympic Games in Beijing came to a close. Our Australian team, the largest we have ever sent to an away games, continued the tradition of doing Australia proud. Our team brought home 79 medals in total, including 23 gold medals. Those medals included inspirational victories like the men's basketball team victory over Canada to clinch the gold medal. They included tremendous individual performances as well, like that of Kurt Fernley, winning gold in wheelchair marathon, mirroring his feat four years ago in Athens; like that of Matthew Cowdrey with his extraordinary haul of eight medals and five world records in the pool; like that of Lisa MCIntosh, who won gold in the sprint double, the 100 metres and the 200 metres; and like that of Tim Sullivan, who took Australia to victory in the four-by-100metre relay on the track and won the 10th gold medal of his career, making him Australia's most successful paralympian everwhat an extraordinary achievement. Over the 11 days of competition, our team showed the determination and commitment that we have come to expect from our worldbeating athletes. They proudly wore the green and gold, and we cheered them on from back here at home. Their performance in Beijing was absolutely outstanding. Their challenge now is to do the same in Londonand it is only four years to go. After some well-deserved rest I am sure that the team will be back in training again with their sights set firmly on the next Paralympic Games. Any sporting team that aims for world success also requires dedicated support from professional trainers and other support staff. The success of our Paralympic team is testament to the determination not only of the athletes and their families but also critically of the support staff who made it possible. It is also testament to the direct, personal and continuing support of individual family members. Australia's paralympians have done the nation proud. On behalf of the government, and I am sure all members of the House, we offer them our heartfelt congratulations. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",112
52,Mr TURNBULL,BEIJING PARALYMPIC GAMES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, the opposition joins the Prime the Minister in complimenting and congratulating the Australian Paralympic team at the 13th Paralympic Games, which finished last night in Beijing. The Prime Minister has spoken of some of the outstanding performances, including those of Matt Cowdrey and Tim Sullivan. He has reminded us, and we agree with him, of the way in which these people triumph over adversity-adversities which most of us will never face in our lives-achieving athletic performances that most of us of sound limb with no disabilities would be unable to achieve. This is a real triumph of the human spirit over adversity. Above all, it shows the great spirit and the great humanity of Australia, and not just from the courage of the athletes. I make a special note of the group of Australian technicians who volunteered their time in the athletes' village, along with their counterparts from Germany and other countries, and provided free prosthetic limbs to competitors from poorer countries who cannot afford new ones. That is a true embodiment of the Olympic spirit. All of them-the supporters, the managers, the athletes and technicians who are providing new prosthetic limbs to those athletes from countries too poor to buy them-have done Australia proud. They have been great ambassadors for Australia, for the Olympic spirit and for the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. We wish them well. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Age Pension",112
53,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister has said that he would find it impossible to live on the pension of $273 a week, why won't the Prime Minister support the coalition's plan increase the pension by $30 a week before he jets off to address the United Nations in New York next week?",113
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Liberal Party indicated only a few months ago he had no policy to increase the pension. That the first point. Mr Turnbull-We didn't have one then but we've got one now.,113

56,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,113
57,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The further interjection from the Leader of the Liberal Party is, ‘We don't make policy on the run.' I would have thought that when you deliver the budget reply, which was then delivered on behalf of the opposition, that is the formal response to the government's position. In that government budget we outlined our proposal to increase the allocations to pensioners through the utilities allowance and the telephone allowance, which actually represented something like a doubling, almost, of the additional payments to pensioners made in the the previous Liberal budget. That is the first point. Dr Jensen- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: can't you get the Prime Minister to give a straight answer? The question was about $273.",113
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Tangney will resume his seat. That was not a point of order, and I warn the member for Tangney.",113
59,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The second part of the answer is that, consistent with the position again adopted by the Liberal Party in support of the Senate inquiry on pensions and retirement incomes, that review is underway. That is the review which you also called for, and to the government will deliver a comprehensive package of reform based on it. The third part is this: the proposal put forward by the Liberal Party excludes 2.2 million pensioners-carers, widows, and others. We, therefore, do not believe in that is sort of policy on the run. We believe in comprehensive reform. That is what is necessary for all pensioners and carers out there-not the single, opportunistic call on domestic party politics which has been made by those opposite. Economy",113
60,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the government's response to developments overnight on global financial markets?,113
61,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian economy faces tough global economic times. The developments in US financial markets during the course of this week have underlined that fact. There was more uncertainty in financial markets in the United States overnight. Stocks fell in the US, with the S&P 500 down nearly five per cent. Financial stocks were particularly weak, with the S&P financial index losing nearly nine per cent. Approximately US$4.4 trillion of market value has been erased from global stocks this week. This is a very significant global financial crisis that we are in the midst of. Honourable members will be, in part, familiar with the US regulators' response, including the action by the Federal Reserve to lend up to US$85 billion to the American International Group, AIG, the significant global insurer which was the subject of some discussion in the House yesterday. The Fed said: The Board determined that, in current circumstances, a disorderly failure of AIG could add to already significant levels of financial market gility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduce household wealth, and materially weaker economic performance. The US Treasury also issued a statement overnight announcing that it will sell more debt to enable the Federal Reserve to expand its balance sheet to accommodate any subsequent bailouts. The program will start immediately with a US$40 billion auction of 35day bills. The proceeds will provide cash for use by the Fed as it seeks to boost liquidity in credit markets. Furthermore, in another development in the last 24 hours-and the government welcomes this particular development-the US Securities and Exchange Commission has taken action to strengthen investment projections against naked short selling. The SEC actions apply to the securities of all public companies, including all companies in the financial sector. The SEC chairman, Christopher Cox, has said: These several actions today make it crystal clear that the SEC has zero tolerance for abusive naked short selling. The IMF managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has said in relation to future developments in global financial markets, ‘We continue to anticipate a gradual global growth recovery in 2009.' I note, in particular, that the IMF's managing director has been very, very balanced with his remarks about the state of US and global financial institutions over the course of the last 12 months. Australia is not immune from these developments in the global economy, but we are better placed than most to weather the current economic and financial storm. I have been in contact with our regulators, including APRA, the RBA and the Treasury. We are, in fact, closely monitoring the situation on a daily basis. APRA today advised me of their fraassessment of developments around AIG, HBOS and other relevant financial institutions. Their advice is as follows: Australian deposit taking and insurance companies supervised by APRA are well-capitalised, profitable, and well-regulated, and are weathering the turmoil well. Australian depositors and insurance policy holders can be confident in the soundness of Australian financial institutions. That was from John Laker, the chairman of APRA. The government has already taken action to advance the financial claims scheme, which was recommended by the Financial Stability Forum in April this year and had also been the subject of domestic recommendation here in Australia five years ago. The government has also been actively implementing other Financial Stability Forum recommendations concerning strengthening the prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management; enhancing transparency and valuation; implementing changes in the roles and uses of credit ratings; strengthening the authority's responsiveness to risks; and establishing robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system. It is not just Australian national action which required in these areas but also appropriate international action. The Australian government and the Australian economic regulators have been in daily contact with their American counterparts in recent days, given this most recent spate of developments in financial markets. Earlier this year, in March, I met with Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson; the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Kimmitt; the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke; the Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Christopher Cox; and the Managing Director of the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Also on that occasion, when in the United Kingdom, I met with the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King. When I am in the United States next week my intention is also to continue contact with the US regulators at this difficult time. I will be meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I will also be meeting with the President of the World Bank and other representatives of the critical regulating agencies of the US financial system. These levels of contacts are necessary in the current environment for the simple reason that we face a series of global developments in global financial institutions which are, of themselves, significant in terms of confidence across the global economy. For our regulators and for the government to be aware of likely future actions on the part of the US regulators is of paramount importance to the continued health of Australia's financial institutions as well. If I could conclude with this remark, it is important at times like this",113
62,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,115
63,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This seems to be the subject of some hilarity on the part of various members on the front bench. We do not regard is these developments as faintly unserious; they are of a deeply serious quality. It is important on occasions such as this that, in fact, we have a responsible economic and political commentary from the heads of political parties in this country. I noticed earlier today some loose commentary on the part of the alternative Prime Minister of Australia concerning the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and remarks which he had made. I say to the Leader of the Liberal Party that, whether he approves or disapproves of the language of a particular speech given by the Reserve Bank governor, the most important thing is that, at times like this, at times of great global financial crisis, no-one-repeat: no-oneincluding the Leader of the Opposition, cast any doubt over the authority of the public statements by the Reserve Bank governor about the health of this nation's financial with the head institutions.

64,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to my remarks made this morning, to which he was referring in his previous answer, where I said, ‘I would say our economy",115

68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. I will judge whether or not the question is in order.,115
69,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. He referred to some comments of mine earlier today and I ask the Prime Minister whether he agrees with these comments: … our economy … is stronger, it is more resilient. Our lending practices have been more prudent, our banks are profitable and better capitalised than those in other markets, in particular in the United States. Having said that we are not immune from the impacts of this crisis and it has already had an impact on interest rates, on the availability of credit, on business activity around the world, including within Australia. Does the Prime Minister agree with those remarks of mine and, if he does, why did he leave them out of his press conference today?",115
70,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member, the Leader of the Opposition, has drawn my attention to his remarks earlier today, and I indeed will respond to his remarks earlier today where, in commenting on the Reserve Bank governor's statement about Australia's strength and resilience, the Leader of the Opposition said, ‘It's just a question of language.' Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: I have put to the Prime Minister propositions about the stability of the Australian economy and he is not prepared to respond to them.",116
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has commenced his response. I am listening carefully.,116
72,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member's question referred to his remarks this morning. The question he was asked this morning was as follows: Do you take comfort from the words of the Reserve Bank Governor yesterday that ‘… conditions in Australian banks are light years away from what's happening in other banking systems around the world?' Mr Turnbull said: Yes, I do take comfort from that. I don't know that I'd use the word ‘light years', I think. He was asked: Is he wrong?' Mr Turnbull said: … I'd express it slightly differently. than My point is that, at a time of significant, global financial crisis, the challenge here is not to provide rolling literary commentary on the content of the Reserve Bank governor's speech but is this: either you support the authority of the governor's statements on the robustness of Australia's financial institutions or you seek to separate yourself from them. You chose the latter, trying to make a political point, and you are rightly condemned for so doing. Economy",116
73,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the importance of responsible economic management at this time of global economic turbulence and on developments in global markets?,116
74,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lindsay for his question because honourable members would be aware that it has been a very difficult week in global financial markets. Of course, stock markets have fallen substantially in the last few days. We have seen the fourth largest investment bank in the US go bankrupt and the third largest bought out by the Bank of America. And, of course, we have seen that lifeline given by the Federal Reserve to AIG. Overnight we have seen the UK's fifth and sixth largest banks in merger talks. So this is a serious time in global financial markets-a very serious time-and that is why the Prime Minister and I have been in regular contact with our regulators. And, of course, we have been in regular contact with our counterparts internationally as well. As the Prime Minister said before, we have been advised by APRA that Australian deposit-taking institutions and insurance companies, supervised by APRA, are well capitalised, profitable and well regulated, and they are weathering this storm pretty well. It is the case that our banks are well capitalised; it is the case that our banks are well regulated. Let us consider this one fact. Australia's largest four banks are among only 12 of the world's top 100 banks with a AA credit rating or more. That is what we mean when we say that our banking institutions are well regulated and well capitalised. What it does mean is that the situation in this country, when it comes to our banking sector, is light years away from what is happening in the United States. What the Leader of the Opposition did today, when he was commenting on the speech of the Reserve Bank governor, was to fundamentally question the Reserve Bank governor's assessment of our banking system. That is what he did. It is not a very smart thing to do; in fact, it is an unwise thing to do in the circumstances in which we find ourselves. He will begin to learn that this motormouth approach to politics does not serve him well in these circumstances. This was the Treasury spokesman who, before the budget, said inflation was a fairytale. This was the Treasury spokesman who, before the budget, said there was no need for spending cuts and no need for a significant surplus. This was the Treasury spokesman who, after the budget, said that we had not cut hard enough. This was the Treasury spokesman who said we should have had a bigger surplus-and this is now the Leader of the Opposition who was raiding that surplus. He is consistently inconsistent, because he is out there all the time promoting himself. He is not out there promoting the national interest. All members could see it here before, when he asked the question of the Prime Minister. You could see his sense of selfsatisfaction just waft out; he was quoting himself. The problem is that when you are the Leader of the Opposition you have to be responsible. I say this to the member for Wentworth: the Leader of the Opposition has to be responsible in the language they use. And they have an obligation to be even more responsible at a time of global financial turbulence. That is why those opposite should not be raiding the surplus to the tune of $20 billion. It is a surplus we need, at a time of global uncertainty, to act as a buffer against that global uncertainty. What we do not need is those irresponsible statements from the Leader of the Opposition undermining confidence in our banking sector. NA",116
75,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery today the former member for Prospect and former New South Wales state minister, Janice Crosio. On behalf of members, I convey to her a warm welcome. We also have members of a delegation from the National Minority Supplier Development Council from the United States, led by their president, Ms Harriet Michel.

76,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Given that more than 50 per cent of the income for major private health insurance companies comes from their investment portfolios, and given that Treasury advice notes that more than half a million Australians will drop out of private health insurance as a direct result of the government's changes to the Medicare levy surcharge, will the ministeras a responsible minister for prudential regulation-guarantee that private health insurers are in sound financial condition?",117
77,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow minister for the question. It is a serious question and a serious issue. I do not think it is approtalk priate in the House for us to be doing anything that would be unnecessarily scaring the markets. We on this side of the House take very seriously that the regulation not just of the health insurance industry but of a range of other insurance and banking industries needs to be taken care of in this difficult time. I am not going to try to answer this on the run, because I think that it is far more important to make sure that we dignify what is a serious question, in difficult financial circumstances, with a careful response. I will consult with both the Treasurer and our minister responsible for prudential regulation in the other place to see if there are any issues that are of current concern to the health industry. Local Government",118
78,Mr GIBBONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask: how is the government working to forge a new alliance with Australia's system of local government?,118
79,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that in his community the role of local government is particularly important, as the role of local government is across our nation. Today the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and the President of the Australian Local Government Association, Paul Bell, and I announced that here, in late November, we would convene the first meeting of the Australian Council of Local Governments. That will be an important gathering, because we hope it is going to bring together representatives from each of this nation's 565 local councils. The reason we are doing this is that local government is one of the critical arms of the fabric of this country's administration. We about reforming the federation; that is important. That is the relationship between Canberra and the states. But the missing third arm of this administrative arrangement in Australia is local government. That is why we need to make sure that we have a proper consultative arrangement with local government into the future. We need to make sure that the infrastructure responsibilities of local government can be delivered at the local level. There was a report in recent times by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers which found that there was a $1.13 billion annual underspend on infrastructure renewal at the local government level and a $14.5 billion backlog in infrastructure renewal work. We regard local governments as partners with the Australian national government's nation-building program for Australia, because state governments are critical in this respect; and local governments also have a critical role to play. That is why we wish to bring the heads of local government to Canberra to engage them on our future strategy. Local government across Australia performs a critical function. The numbers speak for themselves: 657,000 kilometres of road across Australia; $150 billion-plus worth of invested infrastructure across Australia, under the control of local government; activities worth some $22 billion a year, employing some 168,000 people. Local government has to become much more of a central part of the national affairs of this country. The government, through the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and through others, intend to take that challenge seriously. Therefore, prior to the election we committed ourselves to the establishment of an Australian Council of Local Governments. We now, with the statement today, honour that commitment. Come the end of November we will convene in the Great Hall of this parliament representatives from each of those 565 local authorities. Two specific matters, and possibly a third, will be on the agenda. One is: how do we the national government now partner with local authorities in their local infrastructure needs in the future? This is a critical area for the future. It is a critical area needing reform; it is a critical area needing extra financial assistance to underpin that reform. That is agenda item No. 1. Agenda item No. 2 is the particular needs-the planning needs, the development needs, the urban design needs-of our major cities. As I travelled across the country, as I am sure my colleague the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has, and saw the state of public transport across Australia and the other critical urban design needs of our major cities, I acknowledged that it is a crying shame what needs to be done, what needs to be invested and that is why, in part, we have our nation-building fund as well. The third item is this: prior to the last election we undertook to provide constitutional recognition for local government. In doing so, we intend to get the direct views of local government about what form that should take. Rather than Canberra handing down to the states a form of language to be put to a referendum we would much rather engage with local government on the most appropriate language to be considered for inclusion, by way of amendment, in our Constitution. This is a significant new area of national reform for the government: firstly, to ensure that we have a regular, annual national Australian Council of Local Governments meeting here in Canberra with the full cabinet of the Commonwealth; secondly, to use that as a means to reform the way in which the national government delivers infrastructure funding and assistance to local government; and, thirdly, to look particularly at the languageMr Morrison interjecting",118
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cook is warned!,119
81,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that we will then subsequently put to the people by way of constitutional change. This is an important area of national reform for the nation. Nation building is the business of this government, including what we do out of Canberra, what we do with the states, whether they be Labor or Liberal, and what we also do with local government, whether they be Independent, Labor or Liberal. Nation building transcends party politics. Private Health Insurance",119
82,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister advise the House how much money Medibank Private has lost on its investment portfolio over the last six months and how this will affect the premiums for almost three million members over the next six months?,119
83,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The opposition is on a very slippery slope here.

86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for O'Connor will resume his seat. I am not sure whether or not he wants the early flight; that is the problem. He will behave. I will be listening very carefully to the minister's answer, but the minister is addressing the question.",120
87,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did mention this in passing in an answer to a question yesterday, but it is something that the opposition needs to think very carefully about-that is, we face very difficult circumstances in this economy as a result of the financial situation in the United States. That has a significant potential impact on a range of things in Australia, but we are very well placedMr Hockey-The Medicare levy surcharge",120
88,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will get to the specific point if you will just hold off for a moment. We are very well placed in this country to ride out these very difficult circumstances. But one of the critical factors in this is dence in our institutions and in our major organisations, and the opposition is getting onto a very slippery slope by deliberately seeking to undermine confidence in the Mr Hockey interjecting",120

90,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. As the shareholder minister for Medibank Private I have had recent direct contact with Medibank Private in the ordinary course of events with respect to their corporate plan and financial circumstances. At the time that occurred, which was very recent-I cannot give you a specific date-their finances were in entirely robust shape. I cannot give a specific answer to the question that the shadow minister asked about the six-month period. I am happy to go back to Medibank Private and examine the situation again. But I can assure you that at the most recent time, which was within the last couple of weeks, Medibank Private were in perfectly respectable shape financially. I would also suggest to you that you and your colleagues think very carefully about where you are heading with this line of questioning. Mr Dutton interjecting",120

95,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Flynn for his question and for his interest in these issues, the latest instance of which was his hosting of my visit to Gladstone just last week. Today the Prime Minister announced that the government will forge a new partnership with local government, that level of government that is often closest to our communities. That partnership will begin with the inaugural meeting of the Australian Council of Local Governments here in November. We are bringing local government into the heart of the national government, right here in Parliament House. And we are fulfilling a Labor election commitmentanother Labor election commitment being fulfilled by this government-because in recent times there has been a disengagement between the Commonwealth and local government. Today we set a new direction. Today we give communities a real voice in the nation's future-a future that is based upon respect for and recognition of the important role that local government plays as the third tier of government, not just in providing local roads and bridges but, most importantly, in terms of service delivery, libraries, child care, ronmental and health services, which is why the government is committed to taking steps to recognise local government in the nation's Constitution. That is why we will establish next year the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. The government recognises that infrastructure is critical to our economic prosperity, and that is why we have a whole-ofgovernment approach. We have established Infrastructure Australia and the Building Australia Fund for nationally significant infrastructure. But we also recognise that local community infrastructure is also important for quality of life, regardless of where Australians live, whether it be in regional communities or in our cities, whether it be in the area of the Brisbane City Council, which has a million people in a growing community, or whether it be in the Shire of East Pilbara, which takes in some 378,000 square kilometres in some of the most remote parts of Australia. That is one of the reasons why already, this year, in the budget, we have delivered record assistance to local government-some $1.9 billion in financial assistance grants. That is why we have extended the Roads to Recovery program for another five years and increased funding by one-quarter of $1 billion over that period of time. Today's announcement has been worked through with the Australian Local Government Association, in meetings that I have had as local government minister, with the various state and territory local government associations, with individual councils-and all of them have said to us, ‘Why is it that in the past we have not had that direct relationship?' Well, we are going to give them that direct relationship, beginning with a meeting to be attended by all of the government ministers here in Parliament House, one which will enable us to move forward in this new partnership, today forging that missing link enviin our federation in terms of the reform that is necessary. Local Government",120
96,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his announcement today of a local government summit on Friday, 28 November, involving all 565 local councils across Australia. Is the Prime Minister aware that on Saturday, 29 November, all 79 local governments in Victoria go to the polls?

Furthermore, I said in my response to the question today that the event would be held in late November. We will ensure that that continues. But you know something? The key thing here is the reform of the relationship between Canberra and local government. The key thing here is the reform in the relationship between the national government and those who deliver infrastructure services at the local level. The key thing here is as follows: whether you are going to reform the delivery of funding to local government to deliver local infrastructure services.",122
111,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,122
112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,122
113,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And so, in the riotous celebration on the part of those opposite-led by the member for Higgins, who has come back to life, I notice, all of a sudden-about whether we are going to have the first meeting of the Australian Council of Local Governments on 28 November or a few days either side of it-big point!-the key thing is whether in fact we have any such engagement with local government at all. And I would say to those opposite: if they were faintly engaged in serious national reform, if they were faintly engaged in the need for local government to have constitutional recognition or faintly engaged in the local funding needs of local government, what they would do is endorse what the government is doing rather than seek to make cheap political points. Taxation",122
114,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the reasons the luxury car tax should be passed in the Senate as part of a responsible approach to economic management?,122
115,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, because at a time of global economic uncertainty it is important that we have a strong budget surplus. This is not understood by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition said at his first press conference that he was going to provide new economic leadership. What does that amount to? It amounts to the same old Liberal Party economic leadershipvandalising the surplus in the Senate, economic irresponsibility. I am pleased to tell the House that so far we have seen some responsibility from the minor parties in the Senate. We have seen a lot more economic responsibility from those minor partiesfrom the Greens, from the Independent, Senator Xenophon, and from Family Firstthan we have seen from the Liberal Party because they do understand the importance of a budget surplus. They understand the importance of having a strong surplus at a time of global uncertainty and they also understand the importance of that in terms of giving the Reserve Bank room to move when it comes to interest rates. What do we get from the other side? The Leader of the Opposition had his first press conference. It went for 20 minutes, and he spent $20 billion. This is the same spendathon that the member for Higgins introduced the country to in the previous few years. There is absolutely no difference between the member for Wentworth, the previous Leader of the Opposition or the member for Higgins. They are all old-style, big-spend liberals who want interest rates higher for longer. We on this side of the House stand for responsible economic management. Those on that side are utterly irresponsible. Emissions Trading Scheme",122
116,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to reports from the Australian Food and Grocery Council that the government's carbon tax will undoubtedly result in significantly higher food and grocery prices for Australian mums and dads and pensioners. Given this impact on families and given the worsening turmoil in international financial markets, will the Treasurer reconsider his rushed timetable for the introduction of an emissions trading scheme?",123
117,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. That was just a completely dishonest question. We have put out a green paper which canvasses all of the issues for a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We are proud of the fact that in that green paper we put forward a compensation scheme for both households and businesses, particularly those that are strongly affected. For the member not to acknowledge that at all in his question just shows how desperate he is now that there has been a change of leadership in the Liberal Party, and they now do not have any responsible approach to climate change either. We are going to approach this issue in a measured way and in a responsible way, and we are going to do it in a timely way. For 12 long years we had inaction from all of those on that side of the House. The member for Higgins could not even bother to mention the words ‘climate change' in any of his budget speeches. What we are getting now is simply more irresponsibility from the new Leader of the Opposition. Desperate to cobble together the numbers, he is now going to walk away from climate change and he is now going to walk away from emissions trading. They are utterly irresponsible and they should be condemned. Taxation  is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. How might threats to the government's budget surplus undermine fiscal policy?",123
118,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The Rudd government is committed to delivering long-term, sustainable growth in the Australian economy. That is the central focus of our economic policy. While we are dealing with the implications of the international financial crisis centred in the United States, it is very important that we not take our eyes off the longer term-investing for the future of all Australians-and, indeed, the reform task that is associated with that objective. We must not overlook the important structural challenges that we face: a high current account deficit; exports that have been underperforming over a number of years; relatively low savings; inefficient regulation, particularly as between states; and, of course, inadequate infrastructure and skill formation. These are the big issues that the Rudd government is seeking to tackle. The budget, the budget settings and the surplus are the rock on which these policies are based. It is extremely challenging to be dealing with these issues in the international financial circumstances that we face, but the government remains firmly committed to pursuing the long-term reform agenda to build prosperity for the future. The budget surplus puts downward pressure on inflation and interest rates, it delivers money for long-term infrastructure investment through the three infrastructure funds and, of course, it is a buffer against the potential effects of the international financial crisis on the Australian economy. The Liberal Party, the opposition, have been intent upon blowing very substantial holes in the budget surplus through their actions in the Senate. We have seen them attempting to valiantly defend the interests of Porsche, Rolls-Royce and Ferrari buyers; fortunately, with some modifications, it now appears likely that the luxury car tax measure will get through the Senate. But they are still there fighting valiantly for cheaper alcohol for teenage girls for the benefit of big distillcan ing companies, they are still there fighting for tax breaks to continue for big oil companies and, of course, they are still endeavouring to block tax relief for middle-income earners from the impact of the Medicare levy surcharge, which was originally put in place by the former government to apply to higher income earners, not middle-income earners. I note there has been something else by the Liberal Party going on in the Senate today-something that may have implications for the budget surplus-and that is that the Senate Select Committee on State Government Financial Management has handed down a report, recommendation 7 of which is that state governments have the power to impose income tax. This recommendation, I understand, was opposed by the Labor members of this committee. Were state governments, in addition to the federal government, to have powers to impose income taxes, that would have significant implications for the structure of the federal government's finances in ways that are perhaps unpredictable. It might be interesting to know exactly what the Liberal Party has in mind in proposing this particular policy, and no doubt we will hear more of this from the Leader of the Opposition in due course. I will be interested to know his view. Finally, can I reiterate that the government is committed to delivering a very strong budget surplus and to maintaining sound fiscal management. The previous Liberal government left us with inflation at a 16-year high, 10 interest rate increases in a row, government spending growing at five per cent per annum in real terms in the middle of mining boom and, of course, enormous waste and profligacy in government programs and government spending generally. The government is working to sustain the fiscal settings to ensure that we have sustainable long-term growth for the future, that we improve our export performance, that we can improve our skills basis and that we have better infrastructure for Australian businesses to use. It is about time that the Liberal Party stopped its sabotage in the Senate and got on with the business of thinking about what it actually stands for. Workplace Relations",123
119,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Given that the budget forecasts that 134,000 jobs will be lost in the next 12 months and that the Reserve Bank has forecast an additional 100,000 job losses, can the minister inform the House how many jobs are forecast to be created by the government's proposed workplace regime? Can the minister explain why she failed to mention job creation once during her hour-long address at the National Press Club yesterday?",124

124,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party's question is premised on the false choice that the Liberal Party tried present to the Australian community in 2007 and which the Australian people rejected. It is premised on the false choice that when you are making workplace relations arrangements you need to choose between prosperity and fairness, between jobs and fairness at work. There is no such false choice alive in our economy. And the Australian people saw right through the Liberal Party's cant about this at the last election. Modern, simple workplace relations is good for workers and it is good for business. Of course, if you are doing things that are good for business, you are doing things that are good for employment. Let me tell you what was bad for business. What was bad for business was the system set up by the former government where agreements went to the back of a 100,000long queue so businesses did not know what was happening for three months, four months, five months, six months or seven months. Screaming abuse in defence of Work Choices is not going to make that right. Having small businesses wait five, six, seven or eight months under Work Choices to be told what had happened to their agreement",125

132,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline what action the government is taking to combat climate change and Australia's water crisis?,125
133,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Makin for his question. I know he has a particularly strong focus on the interests of his local community, as a former mayor. In fact, I have visited various projects which the honourable member has had running in his former municipality on local water conservation. Climate change is a challenge for us all. It is a challenge for the future. It is a challenge which requires the nation to act nationally and internationally. That is why this government's approach to climate change rests on three core pillars. Firstly, how do you reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Secondly, how do you shape a global solution which means being part of the Kyoto process, not pretending that it does not exist? Thirdly, how do you also adapt to climate change, which is of such a critical concern to so many out there in rural and regional Australia as well? Our response to this-on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions-is what are the practical ways forward? The Treasurer has spoken to one in the parliament already today: a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This is a very significant reform both for the environment and for the economy. It will be tough. It will be hard. It will require difficult decisions, but this government is determined to take those difficult decisions. The second way forward is: how do we go about boosting energy efficiency in our country? The government is developing an energy efficiency strategy to that effect. The third way forward is: how do we also boost the renewable energy role within the overall national electricity grid? Once again, the government is developing a strategy on that as well. In the period ahead, however, we have got this huge challenge with coal-fired power stations. What are we going to do about emissions now from coal-fired power stations and into the period ahead? We have more than a passing interest in this-not just in terms of our domestic reliance on coalfired electricity generation but, beyond that, in the critical role of coal exports for this country. We are the largest coal-exporting country in the world. We, therefore, have a particular responsibility given our national energy requirements, as well as our national export requirements, to deal with this challenge of ensuring that coal-fired stations in the future are as clean as possible. That brings us to the question of clean coal technology and carbon sequestration. How do we deal with this effectively? Earlier today I spoke on legislation which has been introduced by the Minister for Resources and Energy concerning the regulatory regime for offshore sequestration sites for Australia. This is a world first. This is something which those opposite fiddled around with, but they never actually got their act together to bring the legislation through.",126

135,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They did not. They had a lot of time to act on this but failed. Legislation has been put forward by us. It has been introduced into the parliament, and I commend the actions of the minister for energy in what he has done on this in making sure we have got something which works for industry but, critically, works for the national economy as well. CCS technologies are critical for the future.",126
136,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,126
137,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would say this to those opposite, as they howl in interjection: we have an opportunity for Australia to be the world leader in CCS technologies. The question is whether the government is going to get behind industry on this or push industry to one side. This government intends to get right behind industry and work with them, because we believe it is absolutely critical for CCS to work. The G8 recently in Hokkaido came up with a proposal to have 20 demonstration projects, up to 250 megawatts each, tion by 2020, capable of demonstrating that this technology works. The practical question for all of us is: how is that going to happen?",126
138,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,127
139,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Those opposite find this enormously amusing. As Australia is the world's largest coal exporter-I really find it interesting that those opposite find this so amusing-we are interested in protecting Australia's long-term coal industry. We are interested in protecting Australia's long-term coal exports. We are aimed at doing this both for our own economic interests and to make sure that we are doing the right thing by the global environment. Mr Morrison interjecting,127
140,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I remind the member for Cook of his status.,127
141,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is why CCS technologies are so critical. Our government's ambition is to become the world leader in this technology and its application. We will have more to say about this in the days ahead. I suggest to those opposite that, rather than carping and being critical about it, they should get on with the process of supporting the government's actions. The other part of the honourable member's question goes to the impact of climate change on water. Here again we are confronted with a dilemma in terms of the posture of those opposite. We know that the Murray-Darling is suffering from enormous stress. That stress, contrary to what the vious Leader of the Opposition said, is partly the product of climate change. It is also the product of historical overallocation of water entitlements. Our challenge is: what are we going to do about it? Therefore, what we have done since coming into governmentand I say ‘done' since coming into government; we have not dreamt about it like those opposite did for so long-is begin to buy in opera- back water entitlements.

145,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How many gigalitres did the Liberal government ever buy back? Government members-None!,127
146,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They had 12 years to buy it back and how much did they buy back? Government members-None!,127
147,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"None. What we have done in nine months is begin the process of buying 35 gigalitres through the initial $50 million purchase which has been exercised by the preMinister for Climate Change and Water and, secondly-and this is where the rubber hits the road for those opposite-Toorale station. Together with New South Wales, we have taken a decision to buy back the water entitlements associated with the purchase of that station-20 billion litres of water to the Darling, peaking up to 80 billion litres in flood times. What do we have from the shadow minister for water security on behalf of the National Party? His statement is that this is an ‘anti-rural Australia act'. So the view of the coalition-because he is the shadow minister for the coalition-is that they are opposed to our buying back 20 billion litres worth of water entitlements to the Darling and up to 80 billion litres in flood time. I would say to the shadow minister and to the Leader of the Opposition: how does that square with people like the member for Sturt and the South Australian members here in this parliament who day in, day out call upon the government to buy back water entitlements in order to provide environmental flows down the Murray and to ensure that we can act in time to save the lakes at the mouth of the Murray? My challenge to the Leader of the Opposition is this: do you back the shadow minister for water or do you back the member for Sturt? Where does the Liberal Party stand on buying back water entitlements? In nine short months, we have acted on this. We have purchased 37 gigalitres. We have now purchased a station which possesses a potential to buy back another 20 and up to 80. Where does the",127
148,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has concluded. Ms Ley- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister misleads the House. He has bought back not 35 gigalitres but empty space in the dam.",128
149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not a point of order. I will just get comfortable before I call the member for Kennedy! Has he got two pages? Grocery Prices,128
150,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, you are taking advantage of my kind nature here. My question without notice is to the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs. Is the minister aware that food retail margins in Britain, as published in Food Statistics 2007, show a mark-up of only 163 per cent over farm gate price and that, on a basket of selected households items produced in the parliament on 28 August, the Australian mark-up was found to be 267 per cent? Would he not agree that this should be expected, since in Great Britain the two top retailers hold under 40 per cent of market share, whilst in Australia the two top retailers hold over 86 per cent? Finally, would he not agree that the last government had to know the average farmer was getting 30 per cent less than his OECD counterpart, whilst the average housewife, according to these figures, should have been paying, similarly, $100 less per week for her groceries? Would he not agree that that government should be condemned?",128
151,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs. The last aspect of that question was bordering on opinion, but I get the point.",128
152,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He certainly holds these views passionately. We have had the chance to discuss similar items outside the House in some detail. It is important to note that the ACCC's report recommended significant changes to the horticultural code, which have been widely welcomed by farmers and which are being worked through by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It is also important to note that the ACCC's report into grocery prices found that the margins of Australian retailers by and large match the comparable margins of nations with similar concentration levels. It is also the case that the ACCC did recommend, and the government agrees, that there should be substantially more competition in the Australian retail grocery market, which not only benefits consumers but would also give farmers and wholesalers more opportunity to choose to whom they sell their products. The government certainly agrees with the honourable member that the former government needs to be condemned for lack of action in relation to competition in the grocery market. We certainly hold the view that there needs to be more competition in the grocery market. That is why we have freed up the foreign investment laws. That is why we have made planning a priority in relation to the COAG process, ensuring that the planning process in Australia is used to promote competition, not inhibit competition. That is why we are moving on creeping acquisitions, to limit the ability of powerful players in the market to increase their market power even further. That is the program of reform by the government in relation to competition in the grocery market, which will not only benefit retailers and consumers but will also benefit farmers and wholesalers. Mr Katter- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the document from which I quoted",128
153,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is leave granted? Mr Katter-which proves Mr Samuel is a liar.,129
154,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjectingLeave granted. Workplace Relations,129
155,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Minister for Social Inclusion and the Deputy Prime Minister. Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister provided details on how the government was delivering on its election promise to replace the Howard government's Work Choices with a fairer, simpler workplace relations system. Will the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House on the response to this announcement? And will the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House on progress in processing employment agreements?",129
156,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Of course, she chairs the House of Representatives committee that is conducting an inquiry into pay equity. As a result she would be well aware that the workers who suffered the worse under Work Choices, as the statistics undoubtedly show, were women workers-rip-offs of women workers, working Australians, that were endorsed by the Liberal Party, by the Leader of the Opposition and by every member of the Howard government, and that are large and still endorsed by those people. Apart from their endorsements of the ripoffs of working Australians, of course, they endorsed a shambolic system that was bound up in red tape. The member for Hasluck has asked me to provide an update to the House on the question of the processing of employment agreements. I am pleased to do so, because Work Choices was bad for Australian workers, enabling them to be ripped off, and bad for business, which had to intersect with a red-tape nightmare. As a result of changes that the Howard government made to Work Choices last year, the Workplace Authority started with a backlog of 54,000 agreements-54,000 agreements sitting in a ginormous pile, unable to be processed because of the shambles and red tape of the Howard government under Work Choices. Small businesses and big businessesbusinesses that employ people-were waiting desperately for an answer but, because of the shambles of the Howard government and its Work Choices laws, they could not get one. That queue blew out to more than 100,000. It fell to this government to clean up the mess that the Liberal Party created for business with this huge backlog. Mr Hockey interjecting",129
157,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that the member for North Sydney believes in Work Choices. He defends Work Choices every day. He did it every day in government at this dispatch box, and he is doing it now. He is doing his defence of Work Choices. Maybe the member for North Sydney, in defending Work Choices, might like to defend the shambles that happened under his administration, which needed to be resolved by this government. I am pleased to report to the House that we are resolving the Liberal shambles. Of the 337,000 agreements lodged under the previous government's so-called fairness test some 281,000 have now been finalised and 15,500 are back with employers for them to provide further information or amendment to meet the requirements of the act. So the Liberal Party that said to the Australian people, ‘You should be able to be ripped off at work' also said to Australian employers, ‘Here is a mountain of red tape to tie you up in.' We fixing both. I am asked about responses to my announcement yesterday about further details of Labor's Forward with Fairness plans to ensure that Australian working people get treated with fairness while businesses are able to get on with the job with a simple workplace relations system. I am pleased to advise the House that there has been a positive reaction to this announcement. For example, the National Farmers Federation gave an endorsement to the government's Fair Dismissal Code, which is showing a new way to balance fairness at work for working Australians with the needs of small business. The National Farmers Federation said of the Fair Dismissal CodeMs Julie Bishop-Tell them about the Telstra announcement!",130
158,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition cannot stand it when people are not engaging in Work Choices and industrial relations extremism, but she might like to show some simple respect to the National Farmers Federation. I am trying to read their words. Ms Julie Bishop-What about the 800 Telstra workers sacked today? Mr Hockey-800 jobs slashed today! Mr Truss interjecting",130
159,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left! Leader of the Nats!,130
160,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously she does not want to listen to the National Farmers Federation. The National Party might want to think about that. But the National Farmers Federation said that the government's code is ‘striking a sensible, practical balance for employers and employees'. And the endorsements did not stop there. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia's are CEO, Mr Tony Steven, said about the fair dismissal code that it is providing ‘a simple checklist to follow' and he congratulated the government on this achievement. The Australian Industry Group welcomed the ‘positive progress' that the government has made in developing the new workplace relations laws. Here we have a Liberal Party that professes a concern about jobs-maybe it wants to listen to the organisations that represent people who create jobs and reflect on what they have said. What we know from yesterday's reaction to the government's announcement on Forward with Fairness is that the government is getting rid of Work Choices and going on with Forward with Fairness. There are positive reactions from the business community to Forward with Fairness. The only people who support Work Choices in this nation are the industrial relations extremists sitting over there as members of the Liberal Party. We are asking them, despite their extremism, despite their love of Work Choices, to actually let the government get on with the job and deliver what the Australian people voted for. Business has had a positive reaction to that. It is time that the Liberal Party actually listened to the people who create jobs instead of just screaming abuse out. Murray-Darling River System",130
161,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and relates to comments made by the Prime Minister, senior ministers and scientists that a major part of the Murray-Darling crisis is caused by climate change. Could the Prime Minister quantify how many gigalitres of lost inflows in the Murray-Darling system are caused by climate change? Given Professor Garnaut's admission that his recommendations of five or 10 per cent emission reduction targets by 2020 will not alleviate the Murray-Darling crisis, would the Prime Minister initiate a cost-benefit analysis of potential intercatchment transfers of water to cancel out the climate change components of the reduction in inflows?",131
162,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know his deep concern for the state of the Murray-Darling. His questions are always properly framed and they go to the whole question about what we can practically do about the challenge which is faced there, given the history of overallocation and the scientific consensus about the impact of climate change in making that system more stressed than it has been in previous times. The scientific consensus most recently reflected, from memory, in a CSIRO report, which also involved the Bureau of Meteorology, was that climate change was a factor in bringing about the current stress of the Murray-Darling system. Therefore, in our response to it, the key challenge is dealing with the long-term measures: how do you act on climate change nationally and globally and how do you take off water pressures now? That goes to what the government is doing on the overallocation of water entitlements, which are the points contained in the answer I gave earlier to the member for Makin. Thirdly, what do you do to increase the efficiency of the irrigation system? I will come back to the question which the honourable member has asked about a cost-benefit analysis. These are the three practical measures which are necessary in the here and now to deal with the stress which is currently being experienced by the system. That is why in the meeting most recently with the Council of Australian Governments we allocated billions of dollars to the states and their respective irrigation systems, to do one thingincrease the efficiency of the irrigation systems, which, we are advised, if properly invested in, could result in 30 per cent greater efficiency as against the current water loss from often antiquated systems. That is the first point. The second is: what do you also do to draw down the overall take of water from the river system? That goes back to what I said before to the honourable member for Makin's question about the investments we have made in buying back water entitlements. They are the two practical measures which are currently underway. On the cost-benefit analysis which the honourable member has asked about, I will seek to come back to him in terms of what we can do practically on that question, because, unlike those opposite, who simply howl in response to any question on the Murray-Darling, I take the member for New England's questions seriously because they are seriously intended. I believe he deserves a response on that question of the cost benefit analysis. Alcohol Abuse",131
163,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister bring the House up to date on community concerns about alcohol and why urgent action is needed?,132
164,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. Alcohol abuse is an issue of concern across the whole community, but it has been of particular concern in Cairns following some particularly violent incidents. I wanted to take this opportunity to talk about some of the very worrying statistics about alcohol abuse in our community, to highlight some of the action that governments and community organisations are starting to take across the country and to invite the Liberal Party to consider whether they might want to be part of tackling this serious problem rather than standing on the sidelines. I want to share a couple of the worrying statistics about in our community. On alcohol consumption in any given week, approximately one in ten 12to 17-year-olds is binge drinking or drinking at risky levels. This is not young adults; this is 12to 17-year-olds. High levels of alcohol consumption are leading to alarming levels of hospitalisation. The number of young women, young adults, aged 18 to 24 being admitted to hospitals because of alcohol has doubled in the last eight years. And we know that binge drinking leads to violence. Last year, more than three-quarters of a million Australians were physically abused by persons under the influence of alcohol. That is why I wanted to take the opportunity to draw to the attention of the House campaigns being run by two local papers. One by the Cairns Post is called ‘Just Think' and is why the member for Leichhardt was particularly interested in raising this issue. The campaign called ‘Just think' actually commenced in Geelong. On this front page from the Geelong Advertiser there is a photo of the result of some violence-violence which has been highlighted in their community. I know that the members for Corio and Corangamite have been actively involved in this campaign. I want to congratulate those newspapers for being prepared to take a lead within their community to raise this issue, particularly for the sake of young people. It is not a message that says, ‘You can't go out and have a good time'; it is a message that says, ‘Just think about what you are doing and make sure you take care in the circumstances when you are drinking.' I think they are running a really good campaign. I understand from conversations with the member for Corio that a Facebook campaign that has been set up by the Geelong Advertiser has something like 40,000 members-an enormous sign that the community is worried about this issue, that young people themselves understand that there are risks. We need to do all we can to raise awareness that these sorts of issues can cause harm in the community. While talking about this issue, I want to also raise a report that was released yesterday. Members of the House might have read some coverage of this. It is a report by David Collins and Helen Lapsley. This report was actually commissioned by the Howard government. It is entitled The avoidable costs of alcohol abuse in Australia and the potential benefits of effective policies to reduce the social costs of alcohol. This report, commissioned by the Howard government, states: … that increasing the tax rate on alcoholic drinks which are specifically targeted at the youth market (for example, alcopops) is likely to be effective. It further states: There would appear to be strong justification for the April 2008 increase in the Australian tax on pre-mixed drinks (alcopops) by 70 per cent. In other words, we have independent experts, in a report commissioned by the Howard government, backing the action that the Rudd government is taking. I want to lay down a challenge to the new Leader of the Opposition: stop playing politics with the rest of the community and start working with us on finding serious solutions to these very serious problems. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Grocery Prices",132

169,Mrs ELLIOT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Today I was very pleased to join Alzheimer's Australia and the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia to launch Dementia Awareness Week, which will run from 19 to 26 September. Parliamentary Friends of Dementia is a bipartisan group led by Senator Marise Payne and the on this, join member for Newcastle. The Australian government is the principal sponsor of Dementia Awareness Week and provides more than $370,000 to Alzheimers Australia under the National Dementia Support Program to run the event. Dementia Awareness Week provides an opportunity to raise the profile of dementia related issues and to help promote wider understanding of dementia in the community. The theme for this year is ‘Mind your mind-and reduce your risk of dementia'. The events will focus on this theme and some of the events across the country will include: tion centres in Townsville, - a brain fitness program launch in Perth, - an open day at Alzheimers Australia historic buildings in Melbourne, - a tea dance in Darwin, - a photographic display in Adelaide, - a dementia awareness expo on the Sunshine Coast, - a symposium on risk reduction in Western Sydney and - seminars on prevention across the ACT. We all recognise that there is growing evidence that healthy eating, intellectual stimulation, exercise and the prevention of cardiovascular risk factors reduce the risk of developing dementia. Prevention is a clear priority as we face the impending challenges of the ageing of our population. More than 200,000 Australians currently live with dementia. That figure is expected to increase to almost 465,000 by 2031. There are also 10,000 people with younger onset dementia. Alzheimer's Australia says nearly a million people are involved in caring for a family member or friend with dementia and there will be around 57, 000 new cases diagnosed in Australia this year. That is more than 1,000 new cases a week. In 50 to 70 per cent of these cases, the diagnoses will be Alzheimer's disease. That is why more than $120 million a year from the Australian government is provided through the dementia initiative. This includes: - $90 million a year for extended aged care at home dementia packages - $24 million a year for dementia research, prevention, early intervention and improved care, including research grants offered through the National Health and Medical Research Council and funding for three dementia collaborative research centres - $7 million for training for aged and community care staff, carers and community workers such as police. Our investment in dementia research includes $16 million over three years for the Dementia Research Grants program and $7.2 million over three years for the dementia collaborative research centres. Through the National Framework for Action on Dementia, the Australian government is committed to working with state and territory governments to help improve the quality of life for people with dementia and their carers. Also, the Australian government formed an advisory group to provide advice to me and the Department of Health and Ageing on issues relating to the monitoring and evaluation of the dementia initiative. Members of the Dementia Advisory Group are drawn from peak body groups for people living with dementia and their carers and from nursing and medical professionals and academia. All have particular expertise and knowledge about dementia. It also includes people directly affected by dementia. The 16-member advisory group is co-chaired by former Brisbane Lord Mayor, Ms Sallyanne Atkinson, and by Ms Sue Pieters-Hawke, author of the bestselling book Hazel's Journey. The other members of the advisory group consist of experts drawn from dementia peak organisations, the aged-care sector and the nursing and medical professions. Earlier today I was very pleased to launch three new $600,000 dementia training resources. These resources are designed to support the training provided to aged-care workers, community workers, volunteers and carers who are caring for people with dementia. These were developed for communities with specific needs to ensure greater equity in the care of those with dementia. The first of these resources is ‘Local knowledge: a dementia care e-learning resource for rural and remote aged care workers'. A consortium led by Alzheimer's WA produced this elearning resource which will enable rural and remote care workers and volunteers to undertake self-paced, on-demand dementia care training. The second resource is ‘Strangers in a strange land: cultural competence in dementia care'. This CD-ROM resource focuses on people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and was produced by Workplace Learning Initiatives. It features interactive learning materials about people from diverse backgrounds presenting scenarios based on real stories and characters which span all environments of dementia care. The third in the series is ‘2 young 4 dementia: meeting the needs of people with younger onset dementia'. Younger onset dementia is used to describe any form of dementia diagnosed in people under the age of 65. Dementia in younger people is much less common than dementia affecting people over the age of 65 and can be difficult to diagnose. However, correct diagnosis is very important. The most common cause of younger onset dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Other types of dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, acquired brain injury and alcohol related dementias, are more common in those with younger onset dementia than in those with dementia who are over the age of 65. Several types of younger onset dementia are hereditary. Genetic screening may therefore be considered by family members in certain situations. Of course, the person with younger onset dementia and their family and carers face additional challenges to those faced by older people with dementia due to the stage of life that they are in. This training resource was produced by Alzheimer's Australia ACT to support improved dementia awareness and care for younger people. I note that in the ACT alone there are 2,660 people with dementia. All three resources will be made available across Australia over the next three months. The Department of Health and Ageing will be sending these resources to training providers, particularly those funded by the government to provide Certificate IV in Aged Care, and to health and aged-care services as well as volunteer carers. They will also be available free of charge. In keeping with this week's theme, Alzheimer's Australia is also publishing a new paper, Dementia risk reduction: what do Australians know? Source material for this paper was produced through the Dementia Collaborative Research Centres, which are funded through the Dementia Initiative. Survey findings revealed that few people are currently taking steps to reduce their dementia risk. The paper suggests that there is poor knowledge of the current evidence to actually reduce the risk of developing dementia. The Dementia Initiative has achieved a great deal since 2005. To keep its work current and relevant, it is presently being independently evaluated. Together with advice from my Dementia Advisory Group, this evaluation will inform future directions for the program. Together, we are making great progress in raising the level of overall understanding about how to improve the quality of life for people living with dementia, their carers and families. But there is certainly much more to do in the future. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for MCPherson to speak for eight minutes. Leave granted.",133
170,Mrs ELLIOT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mrs May speaking for a period not exceeding eight minutes. Question agreed to.,135
171,Mrs MAY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I, too, was pleased to join Alzheimer's Australia and the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia at the launch of Dementia Awareness Week. Both the Minister for Ageing and I were there at this important occasion this morning. Alzheimer's and other dementias are expected to increase dramatically in the coming years as our population ages. We certainly heard a little bit about that this morning. It is estimated that approximately 26 million people around the world currently live with Alzheimer's. I think that is a staggering statistic. It is certainly very frightening to think of the impact that is having on the world and, indeed, Australia. We understand that the prevalence of Alzheimer's is expected to increase to more than 100 million cases by 2050 around the world. That will mean that one in every 85 people will be living with Alzheimer's. The cost to our healthcare system will be enormous. The personal cost to families will be even greater. Many of us know of someone with dementia, but in a few short years it will be one or both of our parents. It might be a sibling. Madam Deputy Speaker, even you or I could be living with dementia. But the future does not have to be all grim. This year's theme, as the minister has indicated today, for Dementia Awareness Week, ‘Mind your mind', places emphasis and focus on awareness. I cannot stress enough how important this is. My own electorate of MCPherson has a large number of senior citizens, and I place great stock in encouraging awareness of dementia in my electorate. It is incredibly important, and it will become even more important in the future, that we start to help ourselves. It is time for Australians to stop and take stock of their lives. I often speak about taking responsibility for one's choices in one's life in this place, and we can do something about Alzheimer's and dementia by taking stock of our lives. One thing that did hit home this morning from the launch of Dementia Awareness Week is that few people are actually taking steps to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's and other dementias; yet, as the Minister for Ageing said, research consistently shows that there are a number of modifiable risk factors associated with dementia. These include mental and social activity, eating healthy foods and regular exercise. I think we all know what we should be doing. Alzheimer's Australia's paper Dementia risk reduction: what do Australians know? has the following to say: There is general consensus in the literature public health interventions to modify risk factors have the potential to reduce dementia incidence by reducing risk or delaying onset. To design and implement effective interventions, an understanding of the current awareness of, and attitudes to, dementia risk reduction in the community is required. I support this unreservedly. The Minister for Ageing rightly asserts that governments have a role to play in supporting organisations like Alzheimer's Australia. I commend the minister for providing funding to Alzheimer's Australia, under the National Dementia Support Program, to run Dementia Awareness Week. It is, I am sure we all agree, money well spent. The minister highlighted the funding her government has given to dementia research and initiatives but she seems to have overlooked that the previous government had an outstanding record in aged care. It was the Howard government that made dementia a national health priority and provided funding of $320.6 million in the 200506 budget to make it happen. The last budget of the Howard government provided funding of $1.6 billion over five years for the Securing the Future of Aged Care for Australians package. But government support and government funding should not be a replacement for or an alternative to individuals taking responsibility for their own lives. Surveys by Alzheimer's Australia reveal that 20 per cent of Australians believe nothing can be done to reduce the risk of dementia and 28 per cent are unsure what, if anything, can be done. The surveys also reveal-and this was highlighted during the launch this morning-that few people are actually taking steps to reduce the risk of dementia and, alarmingly, too many people lack the motivation to do something about it. This must change. Earlier today, in the adjournment debate in the Main Committee, I gave a speech about that the prevalence of depression in older Australians living in nursing homes. I spoke of the need for better training of nursing and medical staff to improve their ability to detect depression among low-level-care residents. As would be expected, there is a high rate of dementia amongst nursing home residents. Dementia and depression can often occur together. As I highlighted in my adjournment speech, it is often difficult to diagnose depression in nursing home residents, but when the two occur together it is even more difficult to distinguish between them because the signs and symptoms are similar. These symptoms include confusion, memory disturbance and impaired ability to concentrate. Misdiagnosis of dementia could mean a person with depression does not get the support and treatment they need. Likewise, incorrectly diagnosing dementia as depression could lead to inappropriate treatment and, more so, unrealistic expectations of improvement. It is a lamentable fact that dementia is incurable. I hope-and I am sure every member of this House hopes-that one day a cure will be found for those people suffering from dementia. Until that day it is up to all of us to take responsibility for our lives and futures and address the risk factors that could reduce the prevalence of dementia. The social and economic costs require us to act now. We must take the necessary action now to raise awareness of ways to reduce the risk of dementia. I congratulate Alzheimer's Australia and the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia for a successful launch of Dementia Awareness Week. As the minister noted, there are many activities taking place right across Australia during Dementia Awareness Week from 19 to 26 September, and I encourage all Australians to get involved and learn more about dementia. Finally, I would like to thank the minister for advising my office of her intention to make a ministerial statement on this important week and for affording me the opportunity to say a few words in support of Dementia Awareness Week. NA Water",135
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's mismanagement of water as shown by its approval of the disastrous NorthSouth pipeline. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",137
173,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is a government of water wallys. They have been silent as the states have wasted 1,800 billion litres of water a year off our coasts by a failure to support recycling and by an agreement with the approach of pumping pollution off our coasts, and all the time they have adopted a simple approach. Their simple approach has been to take from the country to give to the city, whereas our approach has been to look at recycling, stormwater and water efficiencies so the city finally gives back to the country. That is what water reform is about, that is what water efficiency is about and that is why we as the previous government put in place a once-in-a-century water revolution. What we have seen by comparison is a white flag on water. Before I begin in detail, let me turn to what Tim Flannery said about that plan. Over a year ago, on 2 February 2007, the then Australian of the Year said: I think it's an excellent plan; it really is. It's the best we could hope for and I applaud the Prime MinisterJohn Howard, the then Prime Ministerand Malcolm Turnbull on that plan … They were Tim Flannery's words. That was what he said about the plan-and I am delighted that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has seen fit to join us on this matter of public importance. What have we seen by comparison? We have seen no money for infrastructure, we have seen no real power to the national authority and we have seen no money for rural communities as the structural adjustment funding has been stripped away. One and a half billion dollars which was intended to help rural communities to adjust has gone, and there is a disastrous pipeline plan to water from the communities of the Goulburn, from the communities of MCEwen and, ultimately, upstream from the Murray. At the end of the day to take that water is to defeat the very purpose of the national plan on water-for which, as Tim Flannery said, credit is due to the then Prime Minister and to the now Leader of the Opposition. They have defeated that plan because they have dropped the ball, they have raised the white flag, by taking away the money for infrastructure and by taking away the money for rural communities, and instead of having a plan which focused on three parts: (1) most importantly, water efficiency for the farmers to help them and to share the benefits with the rivers; (2) to allow for water trading-we believe in water trading and its role but only where there are wise choices and not where the water efficiencies have been denied from the outset; and (3) where you have traded, to have support for the communities. Parts one and three have gone. The water efficiencies have gone. The money for the community has gone. What they have is a plan to buy water from farmers which is not real and which has not been effective. They paid $50 million for 35 gigalitres, the Prime Minister told us. The reality is they paid $50 million for 10 swimming pools. There are people around this country who would love to sell this mob a bridge or two because, when it comes to sensible purchasing, they are kidding. What we want to present to the House today is a very simple proposition: that this is a government of mismanagement, or water wallies, when it comes to water. The example of the disastrous north-south pipeline highlights, in a way which is absolutely clear to Australians, that instead of saving water in the city to share with the country they have a simple plan: take the water from the farmers and from the country, take it to the cities, take make no changes in water efficiency in the country and make no changes to this disastrous waste of water, which is dropping 1,800 gigalitres off our coasts, polluting our coastsMr Gibbons-That is totally wrong. Try telling the truth!",137
174,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you believe in polluting our coasts, good for you, mate. Pollute our coasts and do not recycle. They are a disgrace when it comes to water. I want to do this in three parts. Firstly, we will deal with the question of the water revolution. Secondly, the member for Calare will deal with the particular problems that rural communities have faced through this theft of water from the country to the city without giving the farmers the chance of water efficiencies. The Minister for Climate Change and Water said the Lower Lakes will not get a drop from the purchase of Toorale. Thirdly, the member for MCEwen will deal with the impact of Pete's pipeline on the people of the Goulburn and on the Murray. This is the reality of Pete's pipeline. While everybody is here, let us look at what the local people are saying about this pipeline: ‘This week Peter Garrett betrayed our communities-No savings; no water; no meeting.' That is about the future of water. It is about the future of the communities. At the end of the day this government has sold out rural communities, failed to make the water efficiencies there and gone soft on the state governments, who continue to pump off our coasts 1,800 billion litres of waste water, which the rest of the world is recycling. The member for Cook witnesses that 400 billion litres of waste water, primary treated sewage, goes off the coast of Sydney. As the member for Wentworth and Leader of the Opposition has previously said, basically they take out the sandshoes. It is a nightmare and a disgrace in terms of environmental pollution. It is water which the rest of the world recycles for industry and agriculture. is water which comes off the member for Kingsford Smith's own electorate and yet is not recycled-and I am not aware that he has stood up in protest at the nearly 100 billion litres of polluted waste water dumped off his coast every year by Sydney Water and that he has called for that water to be recycled now and for this pollution nightmare to stop. Let us look then at the question of what should occur. We put in place a once-in-acentury water revolution. There was $6 billion in money for infrastructure, there was $3 billion in money for communities-of which half would help to assist in purchasing water, but after the infrastructure was put in place so the farmers could make the savings-and $1½ billion dollars to help fund rural communities. That money for rural communities, as the member for Calare will tell us, has gone-and that is what the people of Bourke and the surrounding districts will face. If we talk about evaporative losses, that is money which has evaporated. And the people of Bourke, who look set to lose 100 jobs from Toorale alone-and however many more from the region-will suffer as a result of not having a real rural adjustment plan and as a result of this bad purchase. Secondly, we had $1 billion for the Bureau of Meteorology and other elements to do with monitoring and with making predictions on the effects of climate change-and we never, ever make the mistake of having a fundamental problem of misallocation and a fundamental underlying drought. We need to recognise that these are real and happening and we also need to make real assessments as to what might occur in the future. The other critical thing that we put in place and which, in this once-in-a-century revolution, the member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition, oversaw was the It creation of a true national authority. It was a program which was intended to say to the states: ‘You cannot continue to mismanage.' But what we have seen from the member for Kingsford Smith and from the new Prime Minister is the waving of the white flag on national water reform. The reason they have done that is very simple: they are weak. They have sold out to the state premiers. The state Labor premiers have seen them coming. They have apologised for the premiers. Instead of ending the blame game they have begun the apology game. When they talk about the blame game what they are doing is apologising for the mismanagement of state Labor premiers-and the apology for state Labor premiers on water continues because they have put off real reform. They had a chance; they had a blueprint; they had a plan; they had money; and they had an outcomeand they failed on all of them. Let us look at what others have said about this once-in-a-century water reform. The President of the National Farmers Federation, David Crombie, said: It was a strong announcement and I think there are probably few issues that are more important to all Australians than the efficient management and certainty relating to water and water supply. The New South Wales Irrigators Council, through Doug Miell, said, ‘The plan is breathtaking in its scope.' Simon Ramsay, the President of the Victorian Farmers Federation, said, ‘We certainly welcome the announcement of a significant investment in water management and infrastructure.' It is that infrastructure component which has gone begging under this government. Instead of helping the farmers to make savings and water efficiencies which could be shared fifty-fifty with the farmers and the environment, they have said, ‘Sorry, guys; the money hasn't gone to the farmers.' What they are going to do is buy the farmers out, take the water away, not make the efficiency savings and not make the savings which could be good for the environment and good for the farmers. And they have completely forgotten about something which the member for Calare talks about, the member for Murray talks about, the member for MCEwen talks about, and so many others on our side of the House talk about: food security. They have a oneonly approach, and that is: ‘Buy the lot. It doesn't matter if we're buying empty space in dams. It doesn't matter if we're simply buying rights without water. It doesn't matter if we are spending $50 million on 10 swimming pools. We want to look as if we are doing something, and we don't care if we are not actually doing something.' At the end of the day, it is the farmers and the environment that miss out-from people who do not care about the country and do not care about our coasts. That brings me to the fact that the government have dropped the ball on water reform on a truly national Murray-Darling Basin Authority with real powers at the national level. What they have also done is to put in place Pete's pipeline. What this minister for the environment did was to make a decision on Pete's pipeline which is based on no evidence, no environmental impact statement and no concern for the rural community. That is what the member for MCEwen, the member for Murray and many others have said. It was an election promise that no water would be taken from the north; no water would be taken across the divide. That promise has been broken by both state and federal governments and, in their heart of hearts, they know it and they should feel ashamed. It is a misallocation, because if you do make these savings, as we proposed making savings, the savings should be shared first to the farmers and second to the environment-to the Goulburn, which is one of the most stressed rivers in Australia, or to the Murray, which we know is stressed. But these rivers miss out; instead, the farmers and the rivers will both be the poorer from a plan which is misconceived, misguided and a misallocation of water. There is an alternative. We would not be able to stand up here and criticise if we did not have an alternative. On the one hand, we have their approach: water from the country to the city, the breach of the promise, the pipeline. On the other hand, we have our approach: water from the city to the country. Firstly, there is the potential for recycling and a water revolution. Eighteen hundred gigalitres of water-1,800 billion litres of water-is washed off our coasts by state Labor governments every year around the country. Four hundred billion litres of primary treated sewage gets dumped off Sydney's coastline every year and is not recycled. It is too hard for the Carr, Iemma, Rees, Tebbutt governments-or whoever it is in the future. We see it in Victoria: 300 billion litres, including 150 billion litres of effluent at the shoreline at Gunnamatta Beach in my own electorate. If we go to South Australia, which admittedly is the best in the country, we still see the best part of 100 billion litres off the coast. If we go to Perth, we see another 100 billion-plus litres off the coast and in Brisbane we see 200 billion-plus litres-but, fortunately, we put $400 million into ensuring that there will be a recycling scheme, which means that the water that comes out at Luggage Point will no longer be wasted. We see in the South Australian Liberal Party a plan to save 75 gigalitres of water by harvesting the stormwater, which is also wasted and sent down the gully traps and into the ocean. We have a plan which is real, and that is a plan based on two things: firstly, recycling and stormwater for our cities and, secondly, real water savings in the country-savings which go to the farmers first and then go to the environment, but which are based on real action and real investment in infrastructure, not a meaningless pipeline. That is why this government should be condemned.",138
175,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts) (3.57 pm)-I have to say that, of all the contributions to a matter of public importance debate on an issue which is of critical importance to Australia, I am seriously disappointed at what we have heard from the opposition this afternoon. I have to say that I actually expected a lot better from the member for Flinders, as he made a series of totally inaccurate, unsubstantiated claims about the government's position on water and particularly about the Sugarloaf pipeline. For the record, I should simply say that this project, in particular, is subject to specific tions in relation to the responsibilities that I am required to discharge under the Environment Protection Act. The Victorian government has provided assurances that there will be no reduction in flows to the environment, and particularly to the Murray River, as a consequence of this decision. I have also imposed conditions to be sure that Victoria's assurances are met. The proponent in this project, Melbourne Water, is no different from any other proponent. They are bound by the law to comply with the conditions that I have imposed, and it is a specific condition of approval that no water can be taken from savings allocated to the Living Murray Initiative, from the Waters for Rivers entitlements or from environmental reserves, and that all water savings projects supplying the pipeline are compliant with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It is also a condition of my approval that the water savings must be directed to Melbourne through the pipeline and that they must be independently audited. The member for Flinders knows full well that this is part of a larger project in place, the Food Bowl Modernisation Project-which he saw fit not to mention on one occasion at all-which has identified potential savings of 225 gigalitres, of which a third, a third and a third will go to the city of Melbourne, to the environment and to irrigators. This matter of public importance comes at a critical time. It comes at a critical time because of the parlous state of the Murray-Darling Basin and the fact that we do have a problem of extreme drought impacted upon by climate change conditions which are seeing allocations, entitlements and water generally within the system at all-time historic lows. So you would think that the opposition would come in here and, firstly, be able to condiagree on what its position is-and I will come to that later-and, secondly, recognising the seriousness of this challenge on water, not come forward with some scattered political attack and funny little punchlines about ‘Pete's pipeline' and so on but rather address in substance what this government is actually bringing forward in Water for the Future. What has happened here is that the member for Flinders has seen this MPI as an opportunity to audition for his position on the front bench. That is what has happened. As in his past activities, the shadow minister is searching for a headline. This is the shadow minister who accused a minister in the other house of being akin to Saddam Hussein. I have to say, with all respect, that I thought that that was an overreach on your part, Shadow Minister. This is a shadow minister who referred to Brendan Nelson in the same breath as Abraham Lincoln and Churchill. I thought that was a little bit of an overreach as well. This is the shadow minister who jumped out of a plane with a parachute to say that solar panel rebates were going into fall when in fact they were heading to an time high.",141
176,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You'd better speak to the solar panel sector, mate.",142
177,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I speak to the solar panel sector quite often. The facts of the matter are these. The government take seriously the questions of reform and of making sure that we address this issue which has bedevilled the Federation for decades. We recognise that, after nine months, we have already put in place a series of comprehensive reforms and commitments to do what the opposition failed to do for 12 long years. Let quickly look at a bit of history to set a text for this matter of public importance. It was the Labor government that initiated water reform. It was Labor that established the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council in 1985 and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in 1988. It was Labor that led the historic COAG agreement in 1994 that set out the principles for water reform. So the principles for water reform were set out when the incoming government came to office. Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask you: what happened at that particular point in time, when the incoming government came to office? Mr Howard was confronted with the reform framework that the Labor government had put in place and with the stresses and strains on the federal system and on the river system and, of course, with some warnings about climate change. There were a number of warnings about climate change at that particular point in time-warnings which specifically directed the government of the day to the fact that climate change impacts upon water allocations within the Murray-Darling Basin and on water in the system would need to be addressed and need free- to be taken into account. What happened? all- The answer is: nothing. That is what happened: nothing. There was a stony silence. I think some people listening to me speak in the House will recognise that there was a stony silence until the now Leader of the Opposition became the minister responsible for water. We know what happened next, but I will come to that part of the story a little bit later on. Let me just go back and remind members opposite of the Liberal coalition history of inaction on this issue. In the 2004 and 2006 budgets, the Howard government committed us some $750 million to return water to the con- Murray-Darling river system under the Living Murray program. But not a single drop or a single bit of water entitlement was recovered directly using that Commonwealth funding. Then, just 10 months before Mr Howard lost office, he announced his plan, the National Plan for Water Security. I assume this was the plan that the member for Flinders was so proud of. This was a plan that displayed all the aspects of good governance that we came to know the Howard government for. This was the plan that the now opposition leader and the former Prime Minister concocted literally on the back of an envelope, with $10 billion worth of taxpayers' funds. This was a plan that was brought forward without consultation of the cabinet. They did not consult the Treasury. They did not consult the National Water Commission. They did not consult the farmers. They did not consult the states. They did not consult the territory governments. That was the coalition's approach to one of the most important pieces of water reform that we have seen in the Federation. It was nothing other than a ploy to catch up quickly, to pretend that they cared-just like they pretended that they cared about climate change-and to deliver something which would get them a couple of quick headlines. If we look specifically at the detail of plan, what do we see? We see that only one-half of one per cent of the $10 billion was committed in the 2007-08 financial year. Just to take us back to that time, to remember what else was going on there: we were having a vigorous debate in this parliament about climate change and about climate change impacts, much in the same way as the member for Flinders is having a vigorous debate amongst his own party about the merits or otherwise of securing properties like Toorale and others to ensure that there is more water that can flow into the system, particularly-and we pray very much for this-in the case of rain arriving. What was going on in the parliament? We were having a vigorous discussion about climate change. The Prime Minister was getting up to the dispatch box, day in and day out, and bringing up that strain of climate change scepticism which is still in evidence on the opposition benches whilst at the same time sitting on reports which specifically point out that the impacts of climate change on the health of waters and the river systems in the Murray-Darling Basin were likely to be parlous-and then they did not go and spend any money on it at all. Then we came into government and we committed ourselves to Water for the Future. There is $12.9 billion invested: some $3.1 billion to be invested in entitlements and allocations and some $5 billion to be invested in infrastructure and savings. We have made a specific commitment to purchasing a property-a property which I think is going to make a huge difference to the health of the river system-and those opposite are criticising us for it. The other thing the member for Flinders was saying in his matter of public importance was that we were stealing water from people. I completely reject that and I think the use of the word ‘theft' in this instance is that particularly irresponsible on the part of the member for Flinders. The fact of the matter is that we do have critical needs in our cities and we do have critical needs in our rural communities. We understand that. We are not pretending to care about it; we understand it very well. When we went to the community cabinet meeting in Kingston, we sat there and we listened to those people in the lower end of the system and we heard what they were experiencing. We identified with it and we want to respond to it. But what kind of approach is it from an opposition that is prepared to try and play one part of the Australian community off against the other? What kind of approach is it from the opposition when it wants to continue to play the states off against the Commonwealth. This is a stereotypical ‘olde worlde' way of playing important politics in the 21st century and, frankly, the Australian public deserve and expect a great deal more. On a matter of public importance-with the audition that the member for Flinders was making in front of his leader for the position of shadow minister-he actually stopped talking about the Sugarloaf pipeline altogether and ended up talking about recycling and water that is going out in coastal areas. These are matters that are deserving of debate, but this is a matter of public importance on what the government has done about Sugarloaf. We have imposed the appropriate conditions in respect of this approval and there are other conditions that will be imposed subsequently when other referrals of this kind are made to us. We have also specifically committed-in the purchase of Toorale Station last week by the federal government and the New South Wales government-to the capacity to return an average of 20 billion litres of water to the environment every year. I ask myself, listening to those opposite complain about this particular action: what is the problem? What is wrong with the federal government actually committing taxpayers' money to add water to the river system? It is a river system that needs water-that is the point. That is exactly why we are taking those actions. I am absolutely bewildered but can only assume that the views of the member for Calare and the views of the member for Flinders are not at one. In fact, their ments of the last couple of days show that to be the case. Significant environmental assets will benefit from the purchase that the Rudd Labor government has made-wetlands of national importance at Menindee Lakes and the Darling River itself. I refer the member to the recent CSIRO sustainable yields audit for the Barwon-Darling system which found that the middle zone of the Darling River is in poor condition. We are responding specifically to that science. We are acknowledging that there was a willing seller-and there was. We made an offer at a fair market price and a property was sold to the Commonwealth and the government of New South Wales. I was particularly pleased that, in a property which has about two-thirds of its land mass as flood plain, we would actually get a significant environment heritage as well. With the national park on the other side of the river, hopefully people will come to share that experience and it will produce some income for the local economy. It is frankly a win-win. It is a win-win for the river system and it is a win-win for the environment. The opposition has got to make up its mind whether it is going to accept that at this point in time, in a highly stressed river system, in the midst of one of the most serious droughts that we have seen, with significant additional impacts from climate change, the program that the Rudd Labor government is bringing forward to deal with and address those issues is one they might find the goodwill and the good politics to support. If it does not, we will have what we had today: a matter of public importance which referred to a series of matters which were unsubstantiated, a matter of public importance which proposed to criticise the government on the basis of the actions that it is taking on the Sugarloaf pipeline, which ranged far and comwide to matters of coastal outfalls and New South Wales political governments, and a matter of public importance which actually requires us to accept that in nine months we did what it did not do in 12 years. We have taken the action to deal with this important and critical area of our natural, economic and rural infrastructure. If the best that this opposition can do, coming into a matter of public importance like this, is bring forward contradictory assertions, wild exaggerations and baseless historical reflections of their own inadequacies, then God help us all. The Rudd Labor government is committed to delivering water to the people and to the environments of the region. I will continue with that job.",142
178,Mr JOHN COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am glad I lived to hear two things-that is, for the first time ever I believe I heard the member for Kingsford Smith in his speech on the matter of public importance mention drought and rain. Apart from that, it has been nothing but climate change. I cannot believe that I just heard him talk about the devastation in the Murray-Darling Basin on the one hand-and that is about the only thing that he got right in the last quarter of an hourand, at the same time, skite about the fact that they are increasing that devastation by taking 110 gigalitres from the Goulburn River in the Murray-Darling Basin into Melbourne. About an hour or so ago, the Prime Minister mentioned the fact that I had called him and his government ‘antirural' because of action they took last week just below Bourke at Toorale Station. To take water they do not actually need in New South Wales, they spent almost $24 million of taxpayer funded money on Toorale Station. I wonder why I might call him and his government antirural. I will tell you why. Do they know for one second what they are doing to one of the oldest communities on the oldest inland port in Australia? They have bought the best bit of land on the Darling River, the most productive bit of land on the western side of the Darling River. Within 24 hours of that action, which is totally devastating one of the oldest communities in western New South Wales, the member for Kingsford Smith proudly announced that he was okaying the Goulburn to Melbourne pipeline that will enable them to take 110 gigalitres of water, which will in effect be high-security water. In a time of drought, as we have now under the emergency plan, this will put Melbourne on a basis way above anyone within the Darling Basin, from which they are taking that water. I would have loved the Prime Minister to have stayed in the House another five minutes. I would have asked him a question. I would have said to him, ‘You and the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Penny Wong, have just bought Toorale Station. That is four per cent of the general rate base Bourke Shire. It is between seven and 10 per cent of all the stock that are run in the Bourke Shire. It is 15 per cent of the water that is used for production in the Bourke Shire. There are about 100 jobs there which are gone forever'-because, as we all know, they are turning that over to the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. The best land west of the Darling River in New South Wales will become a national park. They will no longer pay rates-they will absolve themselves from all commitments to that region. Everybody else in the Bourke Shire will have to find another four per cent to pay because the Bourke Shire will still have to produce the roads, provide water and sewerage and do everything it has always had to do, but not with the help of the New South Wales government. If they had an ounce of decency, an ounce of guts-because they have gutted the Bourke Shire-they would now stand up and say, ‘On that station, the New South Wales government or the federal government will pay the rates that that property would have paid before.' They bought that station without inspecting it, without doing due diligence, without actually knowing what they were buyingexcept it was the largest station out there and it had 14 gigalitres of water. I find it incredible. As I said, within 24 hours they announced that they were buying what is possibly 14 gigalitres of water, after a flood down the Warrego. We are talking about the bottom of the Warrego. There is no dam there. There is no public storage to provide that 14 gigalitres that the member for Kingsford Smith kept talking about. He actually had his figures wrong. He was talking about 20 gigalitres; it is actually 14 gigalitres. I will tell you something else about Toorale Station: it has man-made structures that are actually older than the barrages on the Lower Lakes. And, yes, half the wetlands of the he was talking about-he tried to correct himself, but he knows there are wetlands there which are man made-now have infrastructure there. They have wetlands that have been made, just as man has created his own form of ecosystem in the Lower Lakes. All that we have heard from him and his Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Penny Wong, in recent times is how we have to look after the Lower Lakes-and I agree with that; any sensible person would. But let me tell you something about this drought. This drought exists in St George in Queensland, in Goondiwindi, Moree, Brewarrina, Walgett and Warren. It exists in a lot of places and the people at the top have a right to the water as do the people at the bottom. But, so far, all we have heard is how they are going to take water from rural communities. I would have asked the Prime Minister, ‘Did you do a socio-economic study on Bourke before you devastated it? If not, why not? Are you going to do one before you spend another $400 million devastating communities from the Menindee all the way up to St George?' On Monday this week the Minister for Climate Change and Water let out a tender where people can take another $400 million. And, yes, of course they will get water. There are people in deep trouble out there. The one thing the member for Kingsford Smith got right today was when he talked about how terrible it is in the Murray-Darling Basin, five minutes before had the gall to talk about how proud he was to sign off on water going from the Goulburn River to Melbourne. Melbourne has its own ability to deal with this. It can put in a desalination plant. can recycle water, as the member for Flinders said earlier. Why in heaven's name do you have to devastate every other community? It is just showing off to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane and making them believe that you are doing something. This is a gutless, cheap, easy way of doing something that is going to forever affect rural Australia, because we are talking here about the food bowl of Australia. The member for Flinders quite correctly said that we talk about food security for a very good reason; because this is also about food security for Australia. The big issue of the 21st century is food and water security. Heaven knows where the population is going. But the one thing the Murray-Darling Basin does-or it always has done until this drought-is to ensure that we have good food at reasonable prices and the communities that use it prosper, as do the people who get the best, the cleanest and the cheapest food in the world. But that is not going to last because after this drought, after the drought of Mother Nature, we are going to have the Rudd drought in rural Australia, and it is going to be one heck of a serious one. I shudder to think how Bourke is going to deal with this. I wish the Prime Minister had found time-before he ducks off oversees at the end of this week, or today, or tomorrow, or whenever the heck he is going-to go to Bourke today and listen to the rally there as the people asked, ‘What in heaven's name do we do now?' because Mr Rudd, the Minister for Climate Change and Water and the member for Kingsford Smith are proudly talking about how they have ruined our community. We had a plan that was going to be sustainable. We were not going to spend $3.6 billion buying water and devastating those communities. We were not going to make long-term decisions based on a sixor sevenyear drought-and that is what it is. There It have been droughts this long before and there will be droughts again. It was incredible and it was gratifying to hear the member for Kingsford Smith, for the first time ever, say, ‘This is a drought, very affected by climate change.' Well, it might be affected to some extent by climate change but this is a drought and, if you make long-term decisions that are going to affect every rural community within the Murray-Darling Basin, if you make long-term decisions based on a drought, then heaven help us in the future. We had $10 billion, as the member for Flinders said, and that was a plan. That was a plan to invest in the community, to work out where the major problem was, to spend $1½ billion on buying water if we could not get it through efficiencies, from willing sellers. But this is not a plan; this is a war. This war against the Murray-Darling Basin.",144
179,Mr DREYFUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance that the member for Flinders has proposed here today raises the so-called north-south pipeline in my home state of Victoria-and, by that, I take it that the member for Flinders is referring to the Food Bowl Modernisation Project and Sugarloaf pipeline in northern Victoria, which, as the House has heard from a number of members, is a large water project in northern Victoria. It is a state government project, of exactly the kind that was endorsed by the now Leader of the Opposition when he was the parliamentary secretary for water. I will come back to that in a minute. But if the member for Flinders thought that he was making a job application by putting up this matter of public importance, he needed to check what his now leader said when he was the parliamentary secretary for water in 2006 about projects of exactly this kind. I just want to make a few points about the project itself. This project, which is a very large project that is designed to improve an irrigation system that has not had any major work done on it for over a century, is about taking action in the face of drought and climate change. This project that is taking place in northern Victoria will not reduce flows to the environment. This project is part of a program to distribute water savings, firstly to the environment, secondly to irrigators-and they are the same food bowl producers that those opposite have been talking aboutand, thirdly, to the people of Melbourne. The opposition has demonstrated by the two speeches that have been given on this matter of public importance that they are in total confusion about the nature of this project. I want to come back to the extraordinary inconsistencies presented here today by the member for Calare and the member for Flinders-and on previous occasions in this is a House by, in particular, the member for Murray-in using exactly the same phrase that the member for Flinders used here today, which was, ‘theft of water from the country to the city'. Far from it being the theft of water, this is about increasing available water. It is about using that increased available water to send water to stressed river systems, to irrigators and also to the people of Melbourne. This is what the then parliamentary secretary for water, in September 2006, said-and this is the same person, the member for Wentworth, who is now the Leader of the Opposition: Many people fear water trading between irrigation areas and towns and cities. In Victoria it is a particularly controversial matter. However, rural to urban trade may offer more opportunities to rural Australia than threats. The first thing to remember is that the amount of water needed by cities and towns is very small compared to the amount of water used in irrigated agriculture. To put it in the right perspectivethis is the member for Wentworth speakingGoulburn Murray Water's CEOthat is the same area of northern Victoria that we are talking abouthas told me that his Authority loses every year through inefficient distribution infrastructure around 900 GLs; about twice the water Melbourne consumes! Now, there is no doubtthis is still the member for Wentworthirrigation areas can save a lot of water by more efficient infrastructure both in the distribution system and on the farm. If the cost of saving in an irrigation area is a fraction of the cost making a GL in the city (through recycling or desalination) then a commercial opportunity is created from which farmers can benefit. … … … The improvement in efficiency is enormous. The then parliamentary secretary, the same man who is now the Leader of the Opposition, went on to discuss a project of this type to supply water savings from rural areas to Perth, and then said this: This type of win-win partnership between city and country should not be overlooked as a real option. So that ‘win-win partnership' the member for Flinders chose today to describe as ‘theft' and which the member for MCEwen, on a previous occasion in this House, has described as ‘theft' and which the member for Murray chooses to describe as ‘theft'Fran Bailey-It's an accurate description.",147
180,Mr DREYFUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What was ‘accurate'thank you very much to the member for MCEwen-was what the then parliamentary secretary for water said in 2006 when he described it as a ‘win-win partnership between city and country'. And let us all hope that, in his new capacity, the new Leader of the Opposition will demonstrate some leadership and stop the kind of nonsense that has been talked here today on this matter of public importance by those opposite, who do not understand the role of the federal minister in environmental regulation and have demonstrated yet again that they do not believe in science. They do not believe in the science of climate change. They want to deny that. They do not believe in the science of environmental assessment. They want to deny that, too. They think, and they have demonstrated by their speeches here today, that ministerial decisions are only a matter of party political advantage. They do not undera GL stand, because that is the way those opposite of behaved when they were in government. It is always party political advantage-it is never the national interest; it is never taking decisions in the long-term interests of this country, which is what this government is doing. The reason that massive projects of this nature, of the nature of the Sugarloaf pipeline and the Food Bowl Modernisation Project, are needed in places like northern Victoria is that we had, for nearly 12 years, neglect by the former government and, before that, in Victoria we had neglect by the Kennett government. I say again: the irrigation system in Victoria is over 100 years old. It has had some very piecemeal updating over the last few years, but it requires overhaul of the whole system. The project that the state government has put in place is an overhaul of the whole system and it should be being commended by those opposite, not smeared by the kind of deliberate campaign of, really, emotive misinformation that is being promoted in the area by the member for Murray and is being promoted here by the member for Flinders. I notice, indeed, that the member for Murray has chosen not to speak on this matter. It is absurd to suggest that this project is not paying attention to food security. It is paying close attention to food security. It is absurd to suggest that anything has occurred here that is anything other than complete respect for the environment. The approval process that the federal minister for the environment has engaged in will ensure that there is no adverse impact on matters of national environmental significance. There are conditions that the minister for the environment has imposed which will ensure that that occurs. Debate interrupted. NA",148
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Water FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen) (4.30 pm)-I am very keen to follow the previous speaker in the MPI debate. It has been stated here in various ways that the Rudd government has a detailed water management plan. Let me put to the House that this is nothing more than a plan of political expediency. There is no greater example of that than the north-south pipeline that previous speakers have derided. Let me give the genesis of the approval process that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has so recently signed off on. Before the last state election, the then Bracks state government promised that there would be a water-recycling Melbourne and that they would never divert water from north of the divide to Melbourne. Within a couple of months following that state election, the state government did a 180-degree turn, cancelled the waterrecycling plant and announced that they would divert a minimum of 75 billion litres of water from north of the divide, from an area which has been so stressed and has been suffering severe drought for many years, from a catchment area that, when they made that announcement, was at only 14 per cent of its capacity-CSIRO having said that you need at least nine per cent in Eildon to deal with a blue-green algae outbreak at any time. The state government has built its case on supposed water savings. Let me tell this House that the state government has only budgeted, and only plans, to fix five per of 7,000 kilometres of water channelling. And that so-called fix of the five per cent only lining the channels, not even covering them. This is why no water scientist and no public official has been prepared to publicly verify the so-called water savings as stated by the state government. This is an absolute disgrace. The federal minister has given his approval to a project which, firstly, has had no environmental impact assessment and, secondly, for which nobody, but nobody, will verify the so-called water savings. Let us look at what the state government are saying about these non-verifiable water savings. On the one hand they say that these are going to go to the Living Murray. On the other hand they say that only water that comes from savings will come down the pipeline. They cannot have it both ways. It cannot be going into the Living Murray while at the same time coming down the pipeline. We know they can never save more than 30 billion litres of water when they have stated that they are going to send down at least 75 billion and probably 110 billion liplant in tres of water. The minister's press release makes the position perfectly clear. We know why he has approved it. He actually says: Securing water supply for our urban populations is of fundamental importance. That is what this is about. This is about the federal minister for the environment propping up his state mates because they have got themselves into bother-no environmental impact assessment and absolutely no science whatsoever. Not only has he done that; he has further given them wriggle room because the state government has to specifically allocate the amount of water savings that it is sending into the Living Murray. Unless the state government specifically allocates and says how much that allocation will bewhich they have not done-that water does cent not go into the Living Murray. So for the minister to stand in here and acclaim the is government's water management plan for the Murray-Darling Basin is an absolute travesty. The Goulburn River is one of the hardest-working rivers of that system, and the Victorian Premier decided to remove the Goulburn from the Murray-Darling system simply by putting out a press release and making that announcement. It is a travesty. (Time expired) Blaxland Electorate: Australian Hearing Centre",149
182,Mr CLARE,ADJOURNMENT,"Blaxland) (4.35 pm)Cynics say that governments do not deliver for what some might describe as a safe seats. But in nine months we have demonstrated what a difference a Rudd Labor government can make for a place like Blaxland. In the first nine months we have ruled out the expansion of Bankstown Airport for large passenger aircraft. We have provided more than 2,000 computers for our local high schools, worth more than $2 million. That is more than in almost any other electorate in Austratravel lia. We have allocated money in the budget to start planning work to duplicate the M5 East tunnel; opened a family relationship centre in Bankstown to help local families; and provided $25 million to local councils, including an additional $222,700 to fix dangerous black spots on our local roads. We have announced the development of an autism-specific childcare centre in south-west Sydney. And we have assisted local support organisations with over $2.2 million in refugee settlement grants, more than in any other electorate in Australia. These decisions have a big impact on the quality of life for the people of Blaxland. So do the local services provided by government. Under the Howard government, the tax office and immigration office were both pulled out of Bankstown, and with them went 750 jobs. In 2004 we also lost our permanent Australian Hearing centre. It was replaced by a temporary facility that provides limited services, by appointment only, one day a week. Hearing aids are not fixed on site. If your hearing aid breaks, you have to live with it for up to 10 days while it is repaired somewhere else. My predecessor in this place, Michael Hatton, raised this issue on a number of occasions. Unfortunately for the people of Blaxland, the last government was not listening. In this chamber in March 2004 Michael said: … I look forward to Labor coming back to government and I look forward to having services put back into Bankstown … to directly service the people of Bankstown, who have been so badly dealt with by this governmentthe Howard government… which has treated them with utter contempt. This issue was first raised with me at my first street meeting in Yagoona in June last year. Narelle Buckingham raised the plight of her 17-year-old son, James, who was forced to out of the area to access essential hearing services that were once available in Bankstown. She told me she was forced to take time off work to travel about 20 kilometres to drop hearing aids off and pick them up again. And if they were not working properly when she took them home for her son, which often happened, she would have to go through the whole routine again. When I was elected I invited Senator Ludwig, the Minister for Human Services, to a public meeting in Bankstown to talk about this issue. Hilda and Charlie Garwood, 85 and 88 years young, the two people who first raised this issue with Michael Hatton, turned up. They told the minister how this had impacted on their lives. Hilda told the minister: If Charlie didn't have his hearing aids because they were being sent to Liverpool for repairs, which took 8-10 days, the TV was so loud, I couldn't sit in the same room as him. Services were provided at the back of a medical centre one day a week. The consultation room was tiny. The staff had to bring all the equipment along with them each week and set it up on the bed and around the floor. All they did was testing and make moulds. There were no repair services. Minister Ludwig listened carefully and promised to see what he could do. True to his word, the minister wrote to me on 28 May advising that Australian Hearing would open a new permanent centre in Bankstown. The new centre will open its doors next week, on Tuesday, 23 September. Can I take this opportunity to thank Minister Ludwig on behalf of the people of Blaxland. I also want to thank the former Member for Blaxland, Michael Hatton, who worked so hard in the previous parliament for the return of Australian Hearing to Bankstown. This will make a big difference. When I told Narelle Buckingham she told me she can now cancel next month's appointments in Liverpool and Parramatta and reschedule them in Bankstown. I also spoke to Hilda and Charlie. Hilda said: This is fantastic news. It will mean a lot for Bankstown. These new facilities will be a great help to us and everybody else in the area. It's good to see the Rudd government is listening. This is the end of a long campaign and I am proud to have been a small part of it. It is a great win for our local community and a great example of the difference a Rudd Labor government can make. Cowan Electorate: Kingsway Christian",150
183,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"On Monday, 22 September students from Kingsway Christian College will once again make the journey across Australia to Canberra from their school in the suburb of Darch, in my electorate of Cowan. I understand that this is the 17th year of visits by Kingsway Christian College. This year 64 students and 10 parents or teachers will visit. I look forward to joining them for their visit. I have a great regard for this school, as I like the message and the positive values that it promotes. The Kingsway Christian College is a non-denominational Christian day school with students from kindergarten to year 12. The school was established in 1984 based upon strong Christian beliefs and values. The first students graduated in 1988. Today the college provides education from kindergarten to year 12, has an enrolment of 1,100 students and employs more than 120 staff. My association with the school started a couple of years ago, and I have been to two very well run ANZAC Day ceremonies. From these events it is clear that they take this important day very seriously and their effort and commitment shows what a well balanced school they are. Mrs Jeanette Giroud is the principal. Jeanette is a very positive and supportive leader of the school community who strongly promotes the educational, co-curricular and spiritual aspects to the education of her students. I am also privileged to know Mr Ruston Long, the community relations manager. Not only does he perform this key role for the school but he also is very active at the Warwick Church of Christ, which is also my church. The Chaplain is Debra Kerbey, who leads pastoral care at the school. Mrs Kerbey is a bright and highly positive spiritual influence for the students and school community. College Last Friday I had the honour of opening the 2008 Kingsway Christian College art exhibition entitled The Journey Continues. This was the first time. I have ever opened an art exhibition. To say that I was impressed would be an understatement. There were hundreds of imaginative and inspired contributions from the students of the school. I enjoyed a range of art from Indigenous inspired painted boomerangs to landscapes. The influence of artist in residence, Mrs Francine Riches, was very clear, as was the creative leadership of Mrs Necia Drazevic, the head of art. In opening the exhibition I stated my encouragement for young people making their mark on the world. But I drew the stark comparison between those who think making such a mark on the world is accomplished via graffiti or tyre rubber and the correct way, via building or creating something which is positive. The exhibition was an example of the positive contribution that the students of the Kingsway Christian College make to the local community. I had the opportunity to speak with Miss Renee Clark, a year 12 student. I congratulated her on the pieces of art that she stood next to. I said that she should be very pleased with her results, to which she replied that she had worked very hard and made sacrifices to achieve those results. What I would like to say about Renee is that, apart from being a highly skilled artist, she has already learnt that no success comes without effort and commitment. I am sure this young lady will succeed in her coming exams and in the future after graduation. I should also mention that Renee won the public choice award for secondary school artwork and is about to have her work featured in a state art competition. Last year she was a state finalist for WA at the Apex Australia Teenage Fashion Awards. From my experiences and visits to Kingsway Christian College I find it very easy to have confidence that the students and the school will be counted, both now and in the future, as good and positive influences on this country. In a recent email from Liz Robertson, the teacher leading the 2008 visit to Canberra, she included a proverb which is perfectly accurate and appropriate for all of us who are parents. The proverb is 22:6: Teach your children to choose the right path, when they are older, they will remain upon it. Never a truer word. I want to thank Jeanette Giroud, Debra Kerby, Ruston Long, Necia Drazevic, the staff, the board and the school community for the positive and important work they do for the students at Kingsway Christian College. It is a excellent educational institution because they have their priorities right. I look forward to the continued success of this great school. Deakin Electorate: Whitehorse Community Indigenous Plant Project",151
184,Mr SYMON,ADJOURNMENT,"I draw to the House's attention the excellent work being undertaken in my electorate of Deakin to restore our local natural environment by the dedicated volunteers at Bungalook Nursery, in the suburb of Blackburn South. I recently visited Bungalook-also known as the Whitehorse Community Indigenous Plant Project-to support their efforts to get behind National Volunteer Week in May this year. Soon after my visit, Bungalook were extremely helpful in supplying plants when I recently got behind the efforts of a local school in the area that wanted to plant more native trees. Prior to being the member for Deakin, as a local resident I would occasionally get down there for my garden plantsback when I actually used to have time to get some gardening done. Unfortunately, those days are long gone! There are many nurseries in the seat of Deakin but even those that stock native plants do not have this range of truly local natives. Going there recently in my new capacity, I was reminded of what a fantastic example they are of a local volunteer organisation on the very front line of tackling climate change and saving water. They are a fantastic showcase of what we are all about on climate change and of course on saving water, and that is community involvement, acting at the and local level with truly local solutions. They actively encourage local residents, schools and organisations to go back to using plants that once dominated the natural landscape in the local area. They work every day to preserve, maintain and enhance the status of Indigenous plants and strengthen the biodiversity within the Whitehorse region. The nursery itself is a fascinating place. You could spend hours just walking around and discovering just how many Indigenous species-that is, plants that are truly native to the local area-actually exist. Their stock list boasts almost 100 species of plants indigenous to the Whitehorse region, which are all grown at the nursery, ranging from Indigenous grasses to shrubs and trees. From their fully functional rain garden to the lands that they are slowly developing at the rear of the property, and the rows and rows of natives on offer, the entire nursery has a charming natural feel that is full of the sounds of busy volunteers and native birds. Bungalook functions as a business and generates income from the plants it sells, it is very much a place of learning, information sharing and upskilling locals in native plant management. Volunteers of all walks of life come to Bungalook to learn how to propagate natives and to share their tricks the trade in a very easygoing, social and cheerful environment. These volunteers collect Indigenous seed and vegetative material and propagate about 30,000 plants per year, and every day you go there you will see various schools and other community groups coming to collect those plants to take them back and plant them in their own communities. Having the benefit of experts, they have the capacity to support students doing horticultural courses. Students can do their required work experience hours there for course accreditation. Importantly, the nursery actively engage the general public, participating in guided walks through local bushland and taking people on excursions to sites of interest outside of Whitehorse. They even put on morning teas for the volunteers and reflect on the work they have done and how they can do things in a better way. This terrific organisation, run from day to day by Liz Henry and Margaret Witherspoon-two extremely colourful people with an encyclopaedic knowledge of local plants-has a great history. They began as the Nunawading Indigenous Plant Project, which originated with a bicentenary grant in truly 1988, with the aim of propagating plants truly indigenous to the Nunawading area from seeds collected in the area. The nursery was originally located at the rear of the Horwetticultural Centre in Jolimont Road, Forest Hill. With the change of name of council and with the relocation in 1999, they became incorporated and changed their name to the Whitehorse Community Indigenous Plant Project. Soon after, they moved to the current site in Fulton Road, Blackburn South, which but was officially opened in September 2001. It was at that time that the name for the nursery, Bungalook-Wurundjeri for ‘stringybark'-was chosen. Its facility there was built from the ground of up through the dedicated efforts of its supporters and it has benefited from various sources of financial assistance-from the local Whitehorse council, the federal Landcare grants scheme, various local organisations and their own locally raised money. This is a tremendous example of a local organisation working hard-and also having a great time-to help us tackle climate change. also I congratulate Liz and Margaret and every volunteer at Bungalook on their work. Keith and Shirley Lillee Disability Employment Services",152
185,Mr IRONS,ADJOURNMENT,"I would first like to acknowledge the 60th wedding anniversary of Dennis Lillee's parents, who live in my electorate of Swan. Keith and Shirley were married on this date 60 years ago and are the proud parents of Dennis Keith Lillee, who became an Australian sporting legend and arguably the greatest ever fast bowler. Congratulations to Keith and Shirley, and I wish them many more wedding anniversaries and a return to full health for Keith. I would now like to raise the important sue of employment opportunities for the disabled in my electorate of Swan. I commend the excellent work being done in my community by local organisations to promote employment for the disabled. Last week I had the pleasure of launching the Microbusiness Forum for People with Disabilities in Canning Vale, Western Australia. The event was organised by the dedicated people of the Canning Coalition to raise the profile of ployment opportunities for local community members with disabilities. It was a privilege to be there and meet such an inspirational group of people. Many of the speakers on that day talked about how rewarding starting their own businesses had been. For example, Sally Richards from Canberra spoke about the great satisfaction her son Jackson, who has Phelan-MCDermid syndrome, gains from the business they run, called JACKmail. Similarly, it was wonderful to hear about the success of Richard Hill as Director of Riccom, a website design and disability awareness training company. Equally, Norma and Nathan Hatchett should be commended for their innovative Hooked on Hessian textile company. Whilst the day was a positive experience, I was left in no doubt about the extreme lenges faced by disabled people to achieve their goal of employment. I would first like to refer to how the good work of the Canning Coalition in promoting employment for the disabled is being threatened by the Rudd Labor government. The Canning Coalition came into existence in 2006 following a Howard government policy for a national network of 213 local community partnerships regions. Local community partnerships are incorporated, not-for-profit, community based organisations that work to help young people gain skills, experience and career guidance as they move through and beyond isschool. Unfortunately, the Local Community Partnerships program is at risk. The Rudd government has refused to commit to the program beyond 2009. This has led to a great degree of uncertainty for the Canning Coalition, who are hamstrung and unable to plan properly for the future. The good work this organisation does is at risk. Secondly, I would like to consider the Labor government's lengthy delay in producing em- the National Mental Health and Disability Employment Strategy. On 15 February 2008, the government announced the development of this strategy which the member for Maribyrnong referred to as, ‘A new strategy to get people with a disability or mental illness into work.' I genuinely believe that the member for Maribyrnong is a man of integrity who wants to make progress on this issue. However, to have to wait for the end of the year is disappointing, especially given that the government has been much more forthcoming on staging the Business Services Excellence Awards, which were recently held at the National Disability Services Employment Conference. Thirdly, the government needs to ensure its own departments improve on their record of employing people with disabilities. The chalAustralian on Monday reported that a Rudd government agency had written to the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Graeme Innes, to ask for a clause to prevent disabled people applying for hundreds of jobs on health and safety grounds. Mr Innes said: … the public sector's efforts to employ the disabled had been “pathetic” … the agency's conduct would embarrass the Minister for Employment Participation, Brendan O'Connor, and the parliamentary secretary for disabilities, Bill Shorten … At the moment, 80 per cent of people with a disability who are employed work in the private sector. Government departments must do better. I would like to draw the attention of the House to how difficult it is for the disabled and their families to make the decision to start their own business. Whilst the disabled and their families are eligible to apply to New Enterprise Incentive Scheme for assistance in setting up their own businesses, they immediately must forfeit all special pensions they receive. This raises the risk threshold and denies many disabled people the empowering opportunity of starting their own businesses. In summary, I urge the member for Maribyrnong and the Labor Party to focus on the following points. Firstly, the Labor government needs to commit to the future of Local Community Partnerships. Secondly, the government needs to be more focused and work more quickly to release the National Mental Health and Disability Employment Strategy to ensure Australians have a fair idea of what is planned for them. Thirdly, the government needs to ensure that the public sector vastly improve their record of employing people with disabilities. Finally, the government should provide support and encourage those applying to the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme by not taking their pensions away immediately. It is vital that we keep building employment opportunities for the disabled and that both sides of parliament accept this challenge. Mrs Linda Lavarch",153
186,Mr SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Longman) (4.54 pm)On Monday evening, the member for Dickson made some very generous comments in this chamber in relation to Linda Lavarch, the state member for Kurwongbah in his electorate who has announced that she is retiring at the next state election. I had the privilege of serving in the Queensland parliament with Linda, and my wife and I have known her and her husband, Michael, for nearly a quarter of a century. Michael, of course, served in this place and, as I understand it, he once occupied the very seat that I now occupy in the chamber-which we think is very serendipitous. Linda and Mithe chael, of course, completed a rare double in the fact that Linda served in the state of Queensland as Attorney-General and Michael served in the federal sphere as Attorney-General. As the member for Dickson indicated, Mrs Lavarch has been an exemplary member of parliament, a very hard working local member, an effective backbencher and an effective Attorney-General in the Queensland government. I should add that Linda entered the Queensland parliament much earlier than she might otherwise have wanted to do as she had two small children at the time. She entered because the previous member, Margaret Woodgate, had retired on medical grounds. Female members of parliaments throughout the country who are struggling with this job and raising young families I am sure would understand exactly the situation that she was in. However, I found that the comments of the member for Dickson were a little disingenuous in that he went on to dump on a person who may or may not become the candidate to replace Linda Lavarch in the new seat in that area of Pine Rivers. The decision on Labor's candidate in that election will be made when nominations for preselection are closed and the members of the party are able to select a candidate-and that is yet a week or so away. As with all parties, there is likely to be some argy-bargy as people shuffle for position. This member's participation in what is an internal Labor Party matter does him no credit. The member for Dickson's first speech in this place made reference to his own pride at winning his own preselection and he understands exactly what the preselection process means to a person interested in a political career. But he also needs to be reminded of the old adage, the one that says, ‘People in glasshouses shouldn't throw stones.' As the Liberal candidate for Dickson in 2001, Peter Dutton had tenuous links at best with the electorate of Dickson. Sure, he lived nearby as a child and went to school at Bald Hills as a teenager, but his claims to strong links with the area go to weekends spent on his grandparents and uncle's farm. How does he reconcile that with his expressed view that all that is good about a local member includes coming from the local area? How does he reconcile that view with the fact that his political hide in 2007 was saved by voters from the Brisbane Valley who were added to his electorate as a consequence of the last redistribution and with whom he had no prior connection? By his own expressed standards, does he acknowledge that in respect of those constituents he falls short of being a good local representative? Carolyn Male may or may not emerge from this process as Labor's candidate in Pine Rivers. Her own childhood and teenage years were spent no further from Pine Rivers than Mr Dutton's. But if she does emerge as the candidate, the electors of that electorate will have the opportunity to select a representative with a wealth of experience after nine years of parliamentary service. When criticising an MP for changing seats, as the member for Dickson did, he should also bear in mind his earlier attempts to enter the Queensland parliament in a seat much further removed from the seat he now holds than Carolyn Male's current seat is from Pine Rivers. The difference is that on the member for Dickson's first attempt to enter parliament, he simply was not good enough. On his next attempt to hold his seat, I am sure we will find out that he simply will not be good enough again, and that Fiona MCNamara will prevail in 2010 or 2011 when we have the next federal election.

I piece of road south of Tenterfield on the New very dangerous indeed. Even at low speeds transport using that road. The other area-and I have spoken to the the need for a bypass around Tenterfield.

There are many other areas in the electorate any area should be spent on priorities. If that I am not happy but I will go along with it money on and some logical basis to that. They electorate will say, ‘Why didn't you mention in my electorate at the moment. Another issue that I would raise is AusLink. policy for the future. It seems to me that most that the sorts of transport movements that we movements we will have in the future. That elephant in the room in all of this-is this so-called warming debate and what that means for the same sorts of global transportation I will raise an example, which one or two something that we do in this country that involves the things we do as a global player is grow we send it overseas and exchange it with some money to an Arab or something to try and cause we do not produce all the energy that chasing energy, in the form of oil.

It is very, it is quite dangerous, particularly with heavy minister privately about this particular issue-is is probably one of the most beautiful buildings, but it does have a very narrow side and a slope coming in the other. They have range of things. Because of the narrowness of the et cetera, B-doubles and other heavy transport asked the minister for some funding to go into future. That will have to happen. Again, I would raise that, because it is a deathtrap waiting to and there will be again.

Is there another way of reducing what does that mean in terms of the requirements in some of that infrastructure?
