2,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEES,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (9.31 a.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Laboratory complex for CSIRO Division of Minerals, Clayton, Vic. The development at Clayton will be designed to accommodate the 130 staff from Port Melbourne, including a number of visitors and students. The staff will include 70 research personnel; 54 personnel in management, give administration and research support; and six visiting scientists and students. Completion the project is expected by late 1997. proposed complex will be consistent with long-term CSIRO strategy to integrate and consolidate compatible research resources and facilities on a small number of major regional sites. The Port Melbourne site is a converted paint factory on a state government lease. It has been the subject of an adverse OH&S Secretary investigation and is inadequate due to its old buildings, lack of space and high infrastructure cost. The proposed complex will amalgamate two research groups of the newly formed Division of Minerals who are currentPublic ly dispersed-one being at Clayton and the Standing other at Port Melbourne. The amalgamation ation will allow improved communications between Delfin the two groups in synergy with divisions already on the Clayton site and Monash University. The existing Port Melbourne site lease be terminated. The construction project budget of $15.5 million, which has been approved by the CSIRO board, and will be funded from within the CSIRO 1994-2000 tive capital investment plan. All construction will take place within the existing CSIRO site at Clayton in accordance with the current site plan, and construction is proposed to commence in early 1996 and be completed in late 1997. I table the attached drawing and commend the motion to the House.",11
3,Mr BEALE,COMMITTEES,"I rise to support this referral of works to the Joint Committee on Public Works. Clayton, Springvale and Oakleigh are areas that have been very badly hit by unemployment, particularly in the ethnic community. Unemployment in that part of Melbourne is about 50 per cent the higher than the national average, and ethnic unemployment is up to three times greater than the national average. In that area, the unemployment rate of the Vietnamese in the community is about 30 per cent and the unemployment ratee of those of Greek extraction is about 15 per cent. For that reason, I hope the public works committee will make an early analysis and approval to this project so that, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for of Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has said, we can The look forward to construction commencing the there in early 1996 and to ongoing employment in that very difficult part of Melbourne. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",11
4,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services(Mr Walker), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Committee on Public Works for considerand report: Joint venture development with Property Group of The Willows, Townsville, other CSIRO for defence housing. at There is a need to provide adequate housing for service families posted to Townsville, for will which the Defence Housing Authorityhas a referred to as the DHA-is responsible. Originally, DHA formed a joint venture with Delfin Property Group to tender for an attracparcel of land at Douglas in Townsville. Unfortunately, the tender was unsuccessful. But soon after DHA, on behalf of the joint venture, successfully negotiated the acquisition of 107 hectares of land at Kirwan known as the Willows, which was available for sale by the receivers of Kern Corporation. The DHA acquired the land on behalf of the joint venture, subject to the approval of the public works committee and the minister. The joint venture has proceeded with the development of a portion of the la,nd on the eastern side of the main stormwater drain with the approval of the public works committee and wishes to proceed with the development of the balance of the land. It is intended that the DHA acquire approximately 25 per cent of the lots from the joint venture at a reasonable discount and thereon provide new housing for service families which has been specifically designed for the local climate. The total development cost for the joint venture is estimated to be $37 million. However, the maximum exposure for DHA is approximately $3.8 million in mid-1995. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND NA ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1994 Consideration resumed from 29 June 1994. Second Reading",11
5,Mr FREE,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (9.36 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to initiatives announced in the context of the 1994-95 budget. This bill proposes to provide grants to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling. Under the new provisions, $8.7 million will be made available to assist children from kindergarten to year 3, with special emphasis on those disadvantaged by low socio-economic backgrounds. Additionally, $4 million will be made available to provide grants to school authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. This program will replace an existing program which supports eight languages in each state and territory. The bill provides for a number of other changes: strengthening the Commonwealth's new schools policy for funding new and changing non-government schools; simplifying administrative arrangements for approving block grant authorities under the capital grants program for schools; and funding schedules for capital grants for government and non-government schools for 1995, funding schedules for grants for community languages for 1995 and a revised funding schedule for grants for rural student hostel projects for 1994 to 1996. With this bill and the government amendments I propose to introduce, total grant levels for schools for the 1995 program year are estimated to be $3.086 billion. Funds appropriated for the 1995 program year are estimated to be some $2.459 billion for general recurrent grants to government and non-government schools, $316.7 million for capital grants to government and non-government schools, $289.1 million for national equity programs, $14.7 million for the school language program and $6.3 million for other programs. I commend the bill to the House and present the supplementary explanatory memorandum.",12
6,Mr RONALDSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Ballarat) (9.38 am.)I am'grateful for the opportunity to eventually speak to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994. This bill amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to the following budget initiatives: $8.7 million is to be provided in 1995 to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling; $4 million is to be allocated in 1995 to provide grants to school authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. This program will replace an existing program which supports eight languages in each state and territory. The bill will also give effect to changes to the Commonwealth new schools policy. It will give effect to changes to administrative arrangements for approving block grant authorities under the capital grants program for schools as well as funding schedules for capital grants for government and .nongovernment schools for 1995 and funding schedules for grants for community languages for 1995. I believe further amendments will be moved later this morning in relation to supplementation. After much consideration and consultation, my position will be consistent with that of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who, when the bill was introduced last year, gave an undertaking not to oppose the bill. That is not to say that we fully support all initiatives provided in this bill. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) expresses its grave concern at the direction of the Federal Government's new schools policy, and calls on the Government to abandon this policy; (2) despite the widespread cynicism as to the Government's motives in commissioning a review of arrangements in this area, the Government to have this review completed as soon as possible, and no later September 1995"". Mr Free--Any particular date in September?",12
7,Mr RONALDSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Well, I personally might decide on 1 September. What do you reckon? That might be a good start. I would even be prepared to extend that to 30 September if it would make it any easier for you. To fully understand many of this bill's implications, it is important to have a background understanding of what these measures involve. With regard to the new schools policy, in order to gain provisional approval and eventually final approval for general recurrent funding, schools must meet certain eligibility criteria, including an advanced notification requirement and a sufficiently high funding priority. Under the 1992 act, a school wishing to operate ata new location, amalgamate, provide an additional leyel of education or separate into two or more schools must give notice two years before 1 March in the year in which the change is proposed. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary EducationAssistance) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 extends this notice period to three years before 31 October for changes proposed on or after 1 January 1997. Clause 23 of this bill introduces a further notification requirement for changes or proposals intended to occur on or after 1 January 1998 so that notification of a change or proposal to be funded in 1998 will be required by 31 October 1995. Keep in mind, Mr Speaker; that we are already a quarter of the way into 1995 and not only has this bill not been passed but one must question the ability of schools which have not acted pending the outcome of this bill to give adequate notification by the end of October this year. The coalition maintains its policy position of the last election, which is to abandon the new schools policy. Make no mistake about it: Labor has always been philosophically opposed to non-government school education, and this policy is just one example of this outdated philosophical position. The principal calls on objective of this policy is to make it as than difficult as possible for new schools to start. It is that simple. The policy is opposed to real parental choice in schooling, with the post1992 funding policy effectively pricing nongovernment schools out of the reach of many parents. The coalition is committed to parental choice in schooling and we believe that this should be an affordable choice. Turning to the block grants authority proposal, under the general element grant administered by DEET, funds are provided in the form of block grants to state education authorities for the government sector and to block grant authorities-BGAs-for the nongovernment sector. There are two BGAs in each state--one Catholic and one independent-and there is ajoint Catholic-independent BGA in both the Northern Territory and the ACT. This bill amends the principal act by removing the requirement to re-approve a block grant authority every time a school or hostel joins or leaves a BGA. I am sure the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) will be pleased to hear that this proposal is supported by the coalition, as it will clearly not only simplify the existing arrangements but also will do away with unnecessary administrative burdens. The priority language incentive elementPLIE-has been aimed at promoting a collaborative effort with the states to improve national proficiency in languages other than English. The objective of the element has been to provide financial incentives to increase the number of students studying priority languages other than English at the year 12 level. The bill also has the effect of curtailing operations of the priority languages element to the program years 1993 and 1994, and to give effect to a new program to replace the PLIE from the beginning of program year 1995. The new program will provide grants to government and non-government education authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. The coalition believes that the serious decline in skills in languages other than English needs to be addressed. We believe that skills in languages other than English are also important for Australia's international competitiveness. It is clear that successful exporters tend to be companies that have staff skilled in the language of their non-English speaking customers or potential customers. I will now return to the new schools policy amendment of the bill. The coalition has long been opposed to the government's draconian new schools policy. The policy is restrictive, intrusive and designed to restrict true parental choice. The coalition has been vehemently opposed to this policy since its introduction. It is an issue on which we believe very strongly and it is an issue on which we have consistently campaigned in successive elections. Unlike the government, the coalition still listens to those who work in the field of non-government schools. They have said to us that the policy should be renamed the 'no new schools policy' as it significantly retards new schools growth. Labor is philosophically opposed to nongovernment schooling and private education. It has been for a long time, and the new schools policy is a manifestation of its disdain for this sector. The government in its arrogance is proud of this policy. We on this side remember all too well being continually chastised for our policy to abolish the new schools policy, a policy position, I am proud to say, we will implement on our return to government. The former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, now Minister Jor Finance (Mr Beazley), declared in a press release prior to the last election that to abandon the new schools policy would be to the 'abandon the government's stable, needsbased system school funding'. In a speech to the National Press Club on 19 October 1992, the former minister emphatically stated: The Opposition promised to scrub the New Schools Policy which places some sensible restraints on the growth of the non-government school sector. He went on to say: The Government has an understandable pride of ownership in major achievements ... The strength of that pride is reflected in the strength of our concern when such achievements are so obviously threatened. According to the former minister, the coalition's policies would threaten the school system, 'facing a threat to its quality and equitable funding base'. Let all members of this chamber be very clear on the government's position on the new schools policy. To abolish this policy would be to adopt-and I again quote from a press release by the former minister-'out of date and unworkable education policies'. So wedded is the government to its policy, so proud is the government of its stranglehold over non-government sector that in this very chamber on 7 October 1992 the minister stated: We will notand I repeat' not'abandon the propositions that we have in place under the new schools policy proposal. How things have changed. The government has now buckled under the pressure of the opposition and the non-government. sector, especially the Christian sc-ools, wIth !he Minister for Schools, VocatIOnal EducatIOn and Training (Mr Free) announcing on the first of this month a review of the shameful policy. I read with great interest his press release on this issue, which will go down in the nongovernment scho.ol sector as o.ne ?- the great opportunistic polIcy reversals mllvmg memory. The press release announced th- view, and in doing so, gave the most SpUrIOUS of reasons for the policy backflip and that is, 'that the environment in which schools operate has changed'. And the evidence for this? According to the minister, it is the expanded use of computers and increased retention rates. How this in any way can be used as justification for the review will be lost on the non-government sector.It is a proposition that totally lacks any credibility. What the press release should have stated was: The Commonwealth Government has decided to review the way new, non-government schools are assessed for Commonwealth funding. I will give the minister a copy of this so that he can put it out this afternoon. It goes on: Since the new schools policy was introduced in 1986 the Government has been attacked by the Opposition and the non-government sectorMr Free-Have you checked the spelling?",13
8,Mr RONALDSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I will have a chat to you about some of your press releases in that regard too. I can tell you that you now have a system on your computer where you can run it through, and I am sure that we will not see mistakes like those that I picked up the other day, using that new system. We might both be better off as a result of it. I suspect that there may well be other members of this House who will get great benefit from the grammar check on that system. This is the minister's press release that he is going to put out this afternoon. It further states: ... for continuing to have a policy setting which is anti the establishment of new non-government schools. In his explanation for the reason for the backflip, the minister said, ""Well, in all honesty I've been getting so much pressure from. the Opposition and non-government sector, especially those in the Christian education sector, that I thought it unwise to go to the n-xt election without having said something that might try to placate them. The last paragraph of that press release should read: The minister went on to say that he had asked for the review to be finalised in March 1996, which in all likelihood, meant that he would not b- required to make a decision before the next electIOn. Put in its simplest terms, the terms of reference of the review make a mockery of the bill. The bill and the direction it takes in relation to the new schools policy only seek to re-enforce the wide-held belief that the latest review smacks of no more than political expediency. Mr Free-Shame!",15
9,Mr RONALDSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"You agree with that. This review should be seen in the context of the bigger picture and that is the utter hypocrisy of the government that is tryi-- to curry favour with a group whose opposItIon to the government is mounting while at the same time instructing the various government departments to look at ways to slash funding to the non-government sector. I am sure the minister saw press comments some months ago about proposed cuts to the education sector and would be aware that if they were to come into place it would totally decimate Australia's non-government sector. I must admit that I really am very surprised that the minister did not move to in any way cut short the debate on this. There was no denial from him. Nothing at all came out which would indicate that he either supported or denied those mooted cost cuttings. The question that must be asked, given his silence is whether he is indicating support for the proposed measures. Equally importantly, may they become a budget reality as opposed to a departmental review? The other matter of great concern to the school sector is the government's constant about face and buck passing in relation to various matters of great concern to the school sector. I vividly remember holding the government to account for the drastic decline in retention rates, only to be told by the minister in a press release of 30 January 1995: The Member for Ballarat criticises the Federal Government because retention rates were down in the past year. But it is the states which have responsibility for running schools. The minister seems to forget that on 30 May 1993 in this chamber, when talking about retention rates, Minister Beazley stated :. . . . is a reflection of the extraordinary extent which this government has been prepared to invest in the development of our higher education system. On 4 June 1994, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) boasted to this House, 'Of course we have now increased retention rates in schools to nearly 80 per cent.' However, the most glaring statement to this House which makes crystal clear the extent of the minister's duplicity was made on 8 November 1994. He said: Everybody knows that this governrJ?ent'.s policies have achieved an absolute revolutIOn III school retention rates. It appears that everyone knows who is responsible for the retention rates except you or, should I say, only when it is convenient for you to know. The minister is trying to emulate the feats of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) whose selective memory is legend not only in this House but also in the state of Western Australia. Let us be in no doubt that through the review of the new schools policy, and the possible slashing of funds to the non-government sector, we are seeing the government establish a framework to avoid taking responsibility for the non-government sector. This is Labor's true commitment to the non-government school sector.",15
10,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SECONDARY EDUCATION,Talk to them about the $10 million cuts in Fightback.,16
11,Mr RONALDSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"If that is the best contribution you have to make to this House, I suggest to you that you go away and get another job. That is old hat; and if that is your only contribution you will be judged accordingly. Make a sensible contribution to this debate or pull your head in. Dr Theophanous interjecting",16
12,Mr SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,I think the parliamentary secretary might let it go.,16
13,Mr RONALDSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I note with interest that this bill also proposes $8.7 million to be provided in 1995 to foster literacy developmentfor children in the early years of schooling. The coalition supports this measure and we believe it is· long overdue. However, Australian parents have every cause to be doubtful as to how well this initiative will work once implemented. After all, the to government's record on literacy is one. of distortion of the truth, and a never-endmg stream of go nowhere funding with no result. I would like to place on record the initiatives we have had to date from Labor over 12 years in office. We have had the International Literacy Year 1990;. the literacy challenge, strategies for early intervention for literacy and learning for Australian children, December 1992; International Literacy Day on 8 September 1990; early literacy piogra-s; adult literacy programs; the 1991 AustralIan language and literacy policy; the 'Book it' program of 1990; and the literacy awards in 1992-and the government is currently administering a national literacy survey. Not only is the minister, in his own words, not sure of the end result of these past efforts on the state of our literacy, but up to 25 per cent of Australian school children are battling literacy problems. What is needed is accountability and testing of basic skills. States s-ch as Victoria and New South Wales are showmg much needed leadership in this area. If the government were serious about improving these figures, it would tell its left wing union teacher mates to back off and allow such testing to continue. I mentioned the minister's position on the issue of accountability, especially given the fact that the Commonwealth invested over $3 billion into this sector. I wonder whether the minister agrees with the editorial in the Age this week. I am sure the minister is acutely aware of the fact that the Age is not necessarily a great supporter of the state government. Mr Free-What does Kennett call it?",16
14,Mr RONALDSON,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I suspect he would probably call it not a bad rag if he read this Age editorial. It is hard to see why teachers oppose the formal testing of the basic competence of eight and 10year-old children in Victorian schools. If the tests reveal problems, surely that will be valuable information for teachers, parents and schools as they work to enable all children potential. Surely this should be the aim of education; not to treat every child as if they have the same potential or can achieve the same outcome. Every child should have the opportunity to become fully literate and numerate and those who do not reach acceptable standards should have the right to assistance. Some studies indicate that educational standards are declining and that as many as 25 per cent of children now leave primary school with inadequate literacy and numeracy skills. The article goes on to talk about who should be receiving this information. I support the view of the Age that indeed it is something that should be between the school and parents. I would not like to see any system where children themselves are put at risk through being handed documentation about their basic literacy skills. But surely the question of testing is not something that this minister or this government should be opposed to. I would have thought it was basic to ascertain whether there are problems and, if there are problems, then you can address them. The only way they can be addressed, if you do not avoid the problems, I suspect will come out in the truancy inquiry. The minister knows that I am a member of that committee, and I suspect that he and I will be fairly horrified at its outcomes. I support the move to find out the levels of truancy because, until we find out what they are and ascertain some of the reasons, we will not be able to address what is a continuing and growing community problem. I think we will probably find, and indeed there seems to be plenty of evidence to support this, that basic literacy problems lead to truancy problems. So I draw the attention of the minister to that Age editorial as I think it really sums up the position we have. The concern is that the lowest common denominator has become the benchmark in Australia's education system as a direct result of the lack of testing. Labor is now torn between its union mates and the figures which show that little has been achieved by listening to them in the past. The time has come for some accountability in the education system, but this will not happen under the present to reach their full government. I have been informed that one of the reasons for the delay with this bill is the issue of supplementation. I have been informed that, although supplementation of recurrent grants is usually paid at the end of the schooling year, this was not the case in 1994. The reason, it would appear, was that the unexpectedly high amount of supplementation caused the minister to give long consideration to whether he would fulfil the government's commitment to supplementation in line with movements in the AGSRC. However, the government will now be paying supplementation. I would like to quote from the February edition of the Australian Parents Council Review. I am sure when the seconder to the motion arrives he will be extremely anxious to support the comments that I will make in relation to this matter. I am sure the imminent arrival of the seconder will make that task considerably easier. It is good to see the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) here; I know he has great concerns about education in his electorate as well. I can now go on to quote from the Australian Parents Council Review with renewed vigour: ... it says that it will be doing so on the basis that ""it would be inappropriate to provide any further funding for schooling in 1995 beyond the existing programs"". The supplementation amount, the Government says, will serve to meet the Commonwealth Government's share of any additional costs to school and system authorities to cover the Australian Vocational Training System and will also offset demands for any extra funding the non-government schooling sector makes for superannuation, special education and capital needs. The Commonwealth Government says that the 5.1% supplementation outcome is particularly high when compared with, for example, a Consumer Price Index . . . In the light of this, the Commonwealth Government states that it will be revising the components of the AGSRC. In a letter dated 25th January 1995 to the Australian Parents Council (APC) in response to APC requests that the Commonwealth Government honour its supplementation policy. Special Minister of State, Gary Johns says with regard to the review of the AGSRC: ""In particular the Government believes that those components such as teacher redundancy payments should be excluded from the index in future to more accurately reflect the normal annual costs of running government schools. A revised index is under consideration. In the meantime supplementary payments for schools for 1994 will be paid as soon as possible."" What is the council's response to this attempt by the government to push them into a corner? I again quote from the A.P.e. Review: No doubt non-government school authorities and organisations will be vitally concerned with this any other proposed outcome of revision of the AGSRC. Given past assurances to these organisations by various government ministers, especially prior to the last election, the non-government sector has every reason to be concerned at the broken promises which this government is notorious for. The concerns we have with this bill have been shown to be legitimate to the extent that, even the minister acknowledges the new schools policy-which this bill serves to further restrict-needs further review. Had the government the courage to listen to the opposition in the first place and abandon this obnoxious policy, the sector would not be in the chaos it is in today. What we have witnessed in this House would almost be comical if it were not so serious. We have a piece of legislation which is virtually unravelling as we speak. We have a minister who is at odds with his predecessor and with his party's policies. In all this, we also have the non-government school sector looking for nothing more than security and a commitment to honour past promises. This is not how it should be and this is not how it will be under a coalition government. Before I finish, when the minister stands up today I would like him to give this House and, indeed, the non-government schoolsespecially those with a vital interest in the new schools area-an undertaking that this review will be completed by September. There is no reason why that cannot be done. A discussion paper is due to be released in July. We are now getting to a time frame of March 1996. I think the minister can see that this is an extremely serious matter concerning not only the coalition but also the nongovernment sector. There is an extraordinary amount of cynicism, especially in the Christian schools, as to why a discussion paper can be released by July but the review can be put off until March 1996. There can be only two reasons for this: it is either a political stunt during the election campaign or the fervent hope of the minister that the matter will go well past the next election and he will go into the next election and saying, 'Well, I can't do anything until the review of the new schools policy is released.' When we go into the next election campaign, the coalition will give a very firm commitment that this policy will be abolished. That has been our firm policy position for some time. It has been constantly reiterated. Our policy will satisfy growing community concern, especially amongst the Christian schools sector, about the total inappropriateness of this government's policy, which has been an unmitigated disaster since it was introduced. This review is no more than the minister trying to placate a rapidly growing sector; a sector that has been urging him personally for some time to address what it sees as gross inequity in the non-government schools sector. That is his challenge. I would like to hear whether he is going to take it up.",16
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Mr Rocher)Is the amendment seconded? Mr Lieberman-I second the amendment, and reserve my right to speak.",18
16,Mr LATHAM,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I have been listening closely to the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), and I say to him at the outset that I, along with other government members, refute totally the suggestion that the ALP is in any way philosophically opposed to non-government school education. I think the member for Ballarat, along with many of his colleagues, has lapsed in time back to the lacklustre days of Menzies when the state aid debate raged through this parliament. The truth of the history of government funding for non-government schools brings enormous credit to the Australian Labor Party. Funding of non-government schools in this country was first proposed by a Labor government in New South Wales in the early 1960s-a Labor government in the early sixties wanting to fund, for the first time, non-government schools. To this proposition Menzies responded, typically as a political opportunist, with a limited proposal for the federal funding of non-government schools and their science blocks. The truth of the matter is that substantial federal funding of those schools did not come into place until the election of the Whitlam Labor government in 1972 and establishment of the Australian Schools Commission in 1973. I provide the member for Ballarat with some of the background. The national government has been providing funding for specific purposes for schools in Australia since 1964-that limited Menzies proposition. Since that time, both the scope and size of Commonwealth outlays for schooling have increased substantially. Expenditure on school education through the various states grants acts has grown from $9.9 million in 196465-that is, less than $10 million after 15 years of Menzies Liberal government. The member for Ballarat should note that talked about truancy. He must have been playing truant when it came to Australian political history lessons during his time school. The grants and aid grew from less than $10 million during the period of Menzies to outlays in 1994 of over $1 billion for government schools and $1,563 million for nongovernment schools-$1.5 billion of Commonwealth assistance for non-government schools established and confirmed by this Labor government. For the member for Ballarat to suggest that there is any philosophical opposition to non-government school education on the part of the Keating govern the ment is an absurdity. I am sure that the member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), a strong supporter of non-government and government schools throughout the country and his own electorate, would agree that all say, 'Ifthat is the philosophical opposition of the Australian Labor Party in 1994-95$1.5 billion of funding for non-government schools-let's have more of it.' It is an absurdity for the member for Ballarat to base his whole argument on a question of philosophical opposition by the ALP to non-government schools. He has lapsed comfortably back from his perspective to the lacklustre era of Menzies and that redundant state aid debate. On the substance of this legislation, its purpose is essentially threefold: to require greater notice of proposals to establish new non-government schools which seek government funding or alter the status of nongovernment schools receiving government funding; to introduce procedures for situations where additional levels of education are introduced progressively at a particular school; and to establish a list of priority languages for which Commonwealth grants shall be paid. I support these purposes entirely, but I also wish to make some broader observations about the effectiveness of the nation's school education system. I do so against a background of rapid change in teaching and the learning environment in Australia's schools. During my lifetime, and it is an experience - He which I am sure has been shared by the member for Parramatta, there have been two great changes in the school education system. at The first is, as I have mentioned, Commonwealth involvement-substantial Commonwealth funding of both the government and non-government school sectors. Unfortunately, this has not led to the creation of a national system. We have had enormous growth in national funding, but we are yet to establish a national school education system in Australia. We are still relying on eight state and territory based systems. There are obvious problems such as a lack of coordination, a lack of efficiency, a lack of integration and tremendous difficulties that arise with students who, because of their parents moving across territorial and state boundaries, move into new education systems with different standards, different curricula and different the schools would requirements. The second change in school education during my lifetime has been the convergence of general and vocational education. Schools have become much more concerned, particularly in the past decade, with the question of employability and the provision of broad vocational education. This represents a convergence not only of general and vocational education in schools but also a convergence between the concept of work and the concept of education. It is now recognised that the most successful forms of work organisation are those which encourage people to be multiskilled, creative and adaptable. In this sense, the quality of Australia's school education system has become a key determinant of competitive advantages and disadvantages for the national economy. With the proliferation and pace of international capital movements, human resources and skills have become the primary means by which national economies compete against each other. All other factor marketsresources, capital formation and technological progress-have jumped over and well beyond national boundaries, particularly with the development of knowledge-based industries. In the 1950s and 1960s in Australia young people looked forward to employment once they, through the school education system, had acquired relatively simple and repetitious skills. This was because our economy was organised around systems of high-volume, standardised production. Whether in agriculture, manufacturing or office work, each employee took a simple but interconnected part in the production process through which productivity was guaranteed by high volumes and low unit costs. Skill requirements for adaptability and innovation were restricted to a small group of managers who planned and designed the production process. Most workers simply followed orders within the limits of rigid work roles and job classifications. If they did this with due discipline and tolerance, then their working life would most likely require just one set of simple trade based skills. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, this mechanistic production process was transformed by the advent of knowledgebased technology. This has flattened the old production hierarchy and given workers a much better chance to contribute innovations and ideas to the production process. A successful working life in the 1990s requires a range of adaptable skills, with a lifetime commitment to training and retraining, multiskilling and reskilling. These changes have also been a function of Australia's new trading position. Following the elimination of old protectionist policies and tariff walls, it would have been much harder for Australia to compete against cheap labour nations if the competitive environment still relied on high volume-low cost, standardised methods of production. Our only feasible option has been to compete not on the basis of the cost of labour but through the value of labour-the capacity of Australian workers to add value, quality, flexibility and ideas to the production process. By this strategy we produce not only more interesting work in Australia, not only more cooperative and successful workplaces but, most importantly, we preserve the integrity of our national values and aspirations for a high wage-high employment economy. I take inspiration and guidance from the policies outlined by the US Labour Secretary, Robert Reich, in his 1989 book, The resW'gent liberal. Of course, he is talking about small '1' liberals. There is nothing resurgent about the big 'L' Liberals in this place. Reich, nonetheless, states in his book from 1989: for managers this path means continuously retraining employees for more complex tasks, automating in ways that cut routine tasks and enhance worker flexibility and creativity, diffusing responsibility for innovation, taking seriously labour's concern for job security and giving the workers a stake in improved productivity via profit-linked bonuses and stock plans. For workers this means accepting flexible job cIassificationsand work rules, agreeing to wage rates linked to productivity improvements, and generally taking greater responsibility for the soundness and efficiency of the enterprise. Reich goes on to outline how such an economy relies, above all, on a work force capable of rapid learning. The key transformation is how policy makers in this area, including the member for Ballarat, should be linking changes in the nature of work to changes in the school education system. Reich has this to say: Because the future economy will depend to an even greater extent on thinking, rather than repe-ting learned information, future reforms must motivate teachers and students alike to engage in the process of learning. Rather than prescribe exactly what should be learned and how and when the information should be doled out, reformers should aim at improving students' capacity to learn .... rather than teach students to assume that problems and solutions are generated by ot-ers (as they - ere under high-volume standardised productIOn), students should be led to understand that problems and questions are created -... the emphasis should be on allowing students to experiment for themselves with solving the problems they help define. One could not find a better statement of the cha.llenge for educators and education policy makers in the 1990s-to have teachers who engage students in the process of learning. I think that matches the experience that members of parliament would have had in their own school years. Studies have found that few people remember any amount of the content they were taught at school. The lasting significance of the school education system is to pick up a certain way of learning, a certain way of thinking. That is a very important point to understand. It is not so much the content that people take away from school, not s- - uch the rote learning and knowledge; It IS a process of learning, a way o- - hinking. If ';'Ve use this common sense propositIOn-somethmg that happens in any case in the school education system-we can certainly produce schooling in Australia in the 1990s better suited to the new nature of work and changes in employment. The link between school education and employment is still, by my assessment, unde-­ estimated in the public debate. Our emphaSIS in this parliament and through government policy in recent years has been on post-sch?ol training and retraining-such as the WorkI-g Nation program implemented by DEET. ThIS, unfortunately, by my assessment has left the school education system and its contribution to training and work force skills as a second order consideration. It should not be so. It should be a first order consideration. In Australia, the comprehensive system has focused on minimum standards across the nation without linkages to regional economic development. Even so, fast growing regions have been under-resourced in education through the recent period of spending restraint. Yet these are the areas that require the greatest boost to human skills. As Gregory and Hunter concluded from their study of the spatial structure of the labour market: The structural change of Australian employment into less manual work in the service sector has favoured those workers in the good regions with more education. The workers in the low status areas have largely failed to secure employment in the growth industries and appear to move into the unemployment pool once they lose their jobs in manufacturing. This highlights a failure to match the school education system to the economic restructuring process still under way in Australia. The process of restructuring has changed the nature and the definitions we apply to work force skills. In the 1950s and 1960s it was assumed that white-collar work was relatively high skilled and that blue-collar work would be relatively low skilled. Now, with an internationalised economy in the 1990s, there is an entirely different definition of skills and their requirements in employment. It is the traded sector, the sector exposed to international competition, that requires the highest level of skills, be that in whiteor blue-collar work. Close to my electorate, I recall an inspection of the A1catel factory where the workers were producing telephone switching equipment for a large market in China. They were not wearing blue overalls but white lab coats. This reflects how the manufacturing work environment now requires an intensely capable level of education and skill development. It is the non-traded sector that is more likely to have the relatively low skill base. This refers to those sectors of the economy, such as community services and the retail sector, that are not exposed to international competition and not part of any internationalised production process. This demonstrates some of the problems that have occurred in making the transformation, the adjustment, in skills and job opportunities. Unhappily, there has been a concentration of unemployment in a group of regional economies. Poverty rates have become a problem. Welfare dependency has become a problem. In fact, the correlation between public housing, poverty rates and unemployment is strong, based on location. My colleague the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has said that you can predict someone's employment and lifetime aspirations based on their postcode. Unfortunately, with unemployment and rates of poverty, that has become a reality on a regional scale. It is important to rethink the training agenda and understand that the school education system can potentially play a strong role in making young people job ready. While the government is justly proud of the huge rise in school retention rates since 1983, these figures say nothing about the quality and suitability of education for students who would otherwise have left school after years 9 or 10. There is a strong correlation between students who respond poorly to an academic style school curriculum and long-term unemployment. Education policies need to address the needs of young people who disconnect themselves from the academic learning environment. The limited data available to the green paper on long-term unemployment in 1993 year suggested that between 10 and 20 per cent of students require special assistance to enhance basic literacy skills. This problem is particularly acute in disadvantaged regions, reflected ultimately in higher rates of long term unemployment. The government's substantial investment in DEET training programs for the young long term unemployed-especially those dealing with personal development skills-is in many ways correcting problems which arose at a much younger age in the school education system. The cost effectiveness of government outlays-federal and state-would be substantially improved by addressing the needs of these students at years 9 and 10. I welcome the initiative in Working Nation to progress vocational based education, a vocational based curriculum and work experience for years 11 and 12 through the Australian student traineeship system. Along with the honourable member for Bourke (Mr O'Keefe), who has written a discussion paper on this subject, I urge the government to extend the Australian student traineeships into years 9 and 10. Compared with other OECD nations, Australia has a low participation rate of its 15to 18-year-olds in vocational education. We need to tum that around. We tum it around by applying work experience and vocation based training not only in years 11 and 12, but also years 9 and 10. The education system in this country has traditionally been seen as a source of meritocracy; the great equality of opportunity and great liberator of the disadvantaged. This was true during the period of full employment in Australia, but it is a more difficult proposition to sustain when the country has less than full employment; especially when, with the greater emphasis on labour force skills, access to employment depends, firstly, on how well someone performs within the school education system and, secondly, where someone lives-his or her post code. We need to reassess the role school education can play in the internationalised economic environment, and particularly how to best improve the regional economic opportunities. I briefly outline four reforms worthy of consideration by policy makers. The first proposition is to end the dominance of universities in setting the school curriculum. Unlike other OECD nations, industry and vocational considerations have little input in Australia. The tertiary entrance score and rank is designed for entry into university, not for work force entrance. There needs to be a shift from this 1960s model where the smarter kids go on to university and the rest get a job in the full employment labour market. That is no longer the environment in the 1990s. There needs to be greater input from business people, industry leaders and those interested in vocational training to ensure the entrance score and rank in year 12 is based as much around vocational work force needs as for tertiary education. My second proposition is to end the dichotomy between general and vocational education. I refer honourable members to the outstanding report in December last year by the Schools Council entitled The role of schools in the vocational preparation of Australia's senior secondary students. That report outlines the way in which an integrated system can be developed in Australia to ensure that not only our academic standardsliteracy and numeracy-are sound, but also that schools provide the best opportunity for vocational training. My third proposition is to rethink the way in which the disadvantaged schools program is run, to try to adapt to new opportunities parental training and parental involvement in the education system, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and to use the new technology on the so-called information superhighway. My fourth proposition is to change the nature of teacher training so that it adapts to the new economic environment. Again I refer members to page 78 of the Schools Council report. They are the four propositions. I look forward to elaborating on each of these propositions in greater depth on another occasion as the government continues its outstanding record on school education. (Time expired)",18
17,Mr KATTER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"In rising to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 today I think some overview should be taken of the situation in education today. If we had suggested 50 or 100 years ago that from now on half of our lifetime-20 or 30 years-should be taken up with training in the work force and that people of 26 years of age would still be in a training mode and be unable to move out into the real world, people would think that there was something wrong with us intellectually or psychologically. Today we have reached not only that place in our development but, with very deep regret, a worse aspect of the education system where, if we had suggested 100 years ago to people that from now on the only way they can become a doctor is if they are born to be a doctor, you are put through a series of tests-some would argue that they are aptitude tests, but whatever the case may be; they change the grading system in Queensland every three years on some sort of mythical basis that it is not going to remove the competitiveness, but in my experience it only makes the competitiveness greater-and if you are not able to achieve a score of 995 then you will not become a doctor. There are a lot of caring and intelligent people who would be absolutely wonderful doctors. It was rather intriguing that the college at the University of Queensland, which I had the great honour of being president of when I was there, introduced a system where we elected a resident doctor, a resident for lawyer and a resident expert in each field so that anyone in the college who had a legal problem could go along to the resident lawyer and get advice, and similarly with the resident doctor. The resident experts were people in their last year or two years of their course or who may have been tutoring in their profession. The bloke who was elected from our college as the resident doctor was not the brightest fellow. I think he stumbled and fell about three or four times, but he predated the system whereby you had to be amongst the top 100 or 200 achievers in the matriculation examinations and managed to get into medical college. He was elected two years in a row, despite having failed three years of the course, to my memory, because the people did not want an Albert Einstein looking after them. They wanted someone who cared about them and someone who, if he did not have the knowledge, would have the humility to go to someone who did have the knowledge to find out what needed to be done to fix them up. When the students were given the .choice of whom they wanted, even people that had come out of the apex, if you like, of the academic system of the colleges at Queensland University-you had to have a very high mark to get in there in the first place-they did not opt for the academic achiever; they opted for the carer. But no longer in the state of Queensland-and I am quite confident in every other state in Australia-is that available to society. When I had a number of high school students over in their final year for lunch I asked, 'Are you happy with the system?' One student-one of this kid's forebears was of Aboriginal descent and his parents were not wealthy; they had very humble, low income jobs-said, 'No, I am not happy with the system at all because I would like to be an engineer and I have no hope of ever becoming an engineer.' I asked him, 'Why? Explain that to me.' He said, 'Because, under subjective assessment, I have got a teacher who does not like me.' I asked if he could prove that, and he said, 'Yes, as a matter of fact, I can. I have been scoring 312 out of seven in my essays in English. I put the same essay I scored 312 on to the new teacher who came three weeks ago and she gave me a six. Other teachers who looked at this have said, ""Yes, you should be getting a six."" Unfortunately, I had a blue with her and she has taken it out on me, and that's my fate. But I am prepared to do whatever work is necessary to achieve the results I need to become an engineer.' The end of the story is that the kid did not get the marks to become an engineer-he was too low in English-so he went off and got an apprenticeship. He topped the apprenticeships in the state two years in a row. He was given a pass conceded at James Cook University, went through his university course with distinctions and is now holding a very prominent job as an engineer in Sydney. I tell that story to indicate that not only we put through an objective assessment which grades us in some Brave New World or Nineteen Eighty-four reality that has come upon society-and no matter how much you want to go into a particular field that is cut off to you-but also our children are cast to the tender mercies of some enormously pettyminded school teachers who, for some personal vendetta reasons, may completely, or do their best to, destroy their entire future. In days past, we had on-the-job training. People were not sent off to an elite institution. Having gone through the University of Queensland, I know it is very hard to go to a university, particularly that type of university, and not come out thinking that you are a great gift to humanity. In his book, Trevor Sykes delineates the terrible occurrences of the 1980s, with the loss of $28,000 million in this country. I spoke with a very successful businessman in North Queensland who told me that he was the youngest ever credit manager for the Bank of New South Wales in QueenslandWestpac, as it is now called. I asked him why he got out of banking and he told me it was because he could see the disasters coming. I thought he meant those in the 1980s and he said, 'No, that wasn't quite what I meant. That was a manifestation of the disasters.' So I asked him what he was referring to and he said, 'As a kid, you started working in a bank as a clerk. Typically, you were sent out to a western town where you were forced to play football with the local yokels. Rich, poor, black or white-you were all cast into the same football team. You perhaps belonged to the local Apex club, and you knew everybody in your community. You also knew their bank accounts: who was paying up, who was reliable and who wasn't.' He continued by saying, 'Then you rose to be a teller and probably joined Lions, Rotary or something like that. You had a very intimate knowledge of and a responsibility to oversight their accounts. When you became manager your toes were cut off with a rusty razor blade if you failed to make the right decisions about people. But you learnt and understood people, which was by far the most important thing in banking.' I then asked him are what the disaster was that befell banking in Australia and he said, 'All of those positions that I occupied were cut of completely.' Mr Les Scott-It's got nothing to do with bill.",23
18,Mr KATTER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"We have only one debate in this place-unlike the two we used to have in the state House in Queensland-because it is a wide ranging debate in the first place. We also do not have the opportunities to speak very often on issues that are very relevant to, for example, the field of education, but I will move on. The businessman then told me that in Queensland through the 1980s all of those positions were made available only to the bright young MBAs coming out of the universities-interestingly enough, a lot of them foreign universities. He said that a Harvard MBA almost guaranteed you a senior position in the Bank of New South Wales or the National Bank. He said, 'Can you imagine one of those bright young elitist ""gifts to the world"" being taken to dinner in a Rolls Royce by the likes of tough, rough nuts like Alan Bond? Do you really think he would have had the temerity to raise the issue of security value at the lunch? Not likely! It would have been naive for a person of his stature to talk of such a petty matter. He would have had no understanding of human nature to go with it. That led to what happened in the 1980s.' I think he made a very interesting statement. Another very important issue needs to be canvassed. I sat down on one occasion and went through what I thought were the 23 major technological breakthroughs in the last hundred years. With one exception, which was radio, the other 22 major breakthroughs-whether they were television, the electric light, the telephone, the motor car, internal combustion engine, refrigeration, the polarisation of light or photography-were achieved by people who had no tertiary qualifications. Isn't that interesting? A lot of people in argument to that would say that in the old days a lot of people did not have tertiary qualifications. I expect that argument, but the instamatic camera and the polarisation of light were pretty recent inventions of Edwin Land. The jet engine, which was effectively invented in the last year or two of the Second World War, was another invention by a person without tertiary qualifications. A lot of commentators on these issues say, 'What you have here is an assessment on the basis of your ability to memorise and regurgitate the conventional wisdom. A person that is very good at absorbing the conventional wisdom and accepting it without questioning is a person that will be very good at the examination system.' Edward De Bono would say that he is an absolutely hopeless as when it comes to formulating something new. As one person put to me recently, 'The last thing in the world we want is someone on steel rails. We want a four-wheel drive operator.' He was talking about a mental four-wheel drive operator; a person able to see the opportunities and move in any particular direction. I think there is a very important part to be played by universities with regard to these matters - that is, as libraries, sets of living encyclopedias and marketplaces for information. They should be right there with the runners-the Edisons, Ottos, Alexander Bells and all of their modern equivalentsunderstanding those breakthroughs, stepping side by side with those breakthroughs and being able to provide that information to the wider community upon request. I do not want to denigrate steel rail thinkers. We need steel rail thinkers, technocrats and people to man the magnificent achievements of some of the people responsible for the great breakthroughs. It impossible not to go sideways for a second and reflect upon that most incredible person, Henry Ford. Every single year for the 22 years that Henry Ford produced his famous the motorcar, the model T Ford, the price went down, not up. For 22 years, every single year, that car got cheaper and cheaper. As many model T Fords were sold as all the cars sold in the rest of the world put together. Here was a person who had built the motor car. I think other people could claim to have built the motor car but, if we had to look to someone who was the most successful inventor of the motor car, we would look no further than him. Again, he was a man with no tertiary qualifications. The Ford group decided that the Europeans were well ahead of them. They were winning all the motor car races and Ford had to find out why. They found out that the metal alloys being used were vastly superior. So the Ford group, which at the time was probably the biggest and most successful company in the world, monetary wise, searched the world for the best metallurgist they could find. They found him, after searching the world, in the Ford factory: it was a kid who had been paid to sweep. He was shoved over to be a worker in metallurgy and rose to be the head of the metallurgy section. He was the person that knew most about metallurgy in the whole world. They had the money to buy the best. They had the money to search the world for the best and the best was already there. He was self-taught, self-trained and he had all of the knowledge of anyone else in the world. That great raconteur, Malcolm Muggeridge, said that modern education is very much like the giant armadillo of prehistoric times. With every successive wave of evolution, the giant armadillo clothed itself in more and more armour plating until, eventually, it was invulnerable from attack from any other animal that walked the earth. It was a great evolutionary achievement. However, there was one problem. The armour was so heavy the armadillo could not forage for food and it very rapidly became extinct. There are no giant armadillos today. The most important thing I have to say today is that, sadly, without an education almost every door is closed. In society today, with the crushing of the agricultural sector in Australia by this government and other governments-I do not hesitate to say that-and the crushing of small business, all doors are now closed. The corporations own everything. The .corporations will own everything so, if you cannot get a job with a corporation or the government-you most certainly cannot get jobs with them without degrees or tertiary qualifications-every door of opportunity is closed. Nowadays, not only do people living outside the cities and very large towns not have a right to tertiary education but also they do not have a right to secondary education. Areas I represent in North Queensland, such as Feluga, Normanton, Georgetown, Burketown, Richmond and Julia Creek-and, sadly, soon probably towns like Winton-will be left without secondary education. Recently, the Julia Creek school lost all of its secondary department. The only way people in these areas can secure an education is to go away to boarding school. There is no other way it can be done. It is ludicrous to say that people can gain a secondary education by correspondence. There is too much competitiveness out there, and figures clearly indicate that is the case. Very few even try. There is no secondary education in those sorts of areas unless you can go away to boarding school. When I was a young person, unless you were rich you could not go to boarding school. By Cloncurry standards, I was lucky enough to belong to a rich family and was able to go away to school. Later on, if you were of Aboriginal descent, you could go to boarding school. I can remember being embarrassed that I had this great advantage over 80 per cent of the kids in Cloncurry. I could go as far as I wanted to because I had a secondary education and they did not. Kids from boarding schools walked with pride. They had been out in the bigger world and tried themselves against bigger people. They had this thing called education, which they could intimidate everybody else with for the rest of their days. It was very sad. I can remember the embarrassment I felt during those years. I was lucky enough to be in a government which pioneered in Australia equality of education, so education in Queensland was provided on an equal basis for every single person. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the entire cost of going away to boarding school was picked up by the state and federal governments. Because of the inaction of this House, and because of the inaction of the Queensland government, now only half the cost of sending children away to boarding school is covered. I am not talking about elitist GPS schools, as we call them in Queensland; I am talking about ordinary garden variety service schools, which are the sorts of schools I boarded at in Charters Towers. They believe they have a duty to provide something the kids must have, which is a secondary education at the cheapest possible cost. But, even with those schools, you are still looking at a shortfall of about $6,000. If you have two or three kids and come from a town such as Hughenden, where the cost of living is 26 per cent higher than Brisbane-I am quoting specifically from two separate reports-there is no way in the world you can afford to send your kids away to school. It is that impossible. We are now back to the bad old days where education is available only-I am not talking about tertiary education; I am talking about secondary education-to the rich or those of Aboriginal descent, whose numbers are much smaller. This is a dreadful indictment upon this government and other governments of Australia, and must be fixed up. (Time expired)",24
19,Mr LES SCOTT,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"It is always entertaining to listen to the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). He gives us the opportunity to have a wide-ranging debate, and some of the points he raised were rather interesting from a Queenslander's point of view. We can see why the people of Queensland woke up to themselves back in 1989 and replaced the National Party government with the Goss Labor government, which has a very strong commitment to social justice and education for our young people. The member for Kennedy was a minister in the BjelkePetersen government, and we should remind this place of that bad era in Queensland. Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The speaker is casting personal aspersions upon me and I request that he withdraw those remarks which are offensive to me.",27
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,Mr Rocber)There is no point of order.,27
21,Mr LES SCOTT,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I will move on and talk about the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994, but I could not help but take the opportunity presented to me to make those comments. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support this bill, which amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992. The changes this bill will introduce will enable the government to provide additional funding to enhance early literacy development, and the important task of providing education in 10 priority languages. I will come to that area later, particularly in relation to Aboriginal languages. I was a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in 1992, which looked into Aboriginallanguages, and I will refer to that report later. of things are pertinent to what we are speaking about today. I should begin by saying that there are few more important tasks than the one Australia's 220,000 teachers carry out every day of their working lives-it is important to acknowledge the work of the educators of our childrennamely, educating our children and helping them become responsible citizens not only in this country but in the whole world. There are few jobs that would be more challenging and ultimately more rewarding. I understand that the Australian Teaching Council is attempting to have International Teachers Day acknowledged and celebrated every year. I wish them well in that pursuit. This bill will give effect to the initiatives announced in the 1994-95 budget, including the provision of$8.7 million in 1995 to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling, and the provision of $4 million in 1995 to provide grants to school authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. This program will replace an existing one which supports eight languages in each state and territory. The bill also gives effect to changes to strengthen the Commonwealth's new schools policy from the new and changing non-government schools, changes to simplify administrative arrangements for improving block grant authorities under the capital grants program for schools, and funding schedules for capital grants for government and non-government schools for 1995 and funding schedules for grants for community language for 1995. This bill is an example of this government's commitment to education for young Australians, the country's future. It is an outstanding commitment that this government has shown over the many years it has been in office. I think we would all agree that the key to a successful future, both as individuals and as a nation, is a good education. The member for Kennedy was probably right in highlighting the need for a good education, which is available to many young people today. Australia can be justifiably proud of its record in providing a good education to our children, and the high rate of school retention to year A lot 12--currently near the 80 per cent markshows that the policies of the past have been winners with young Australians. They are the policies of this government. Young people recognise-as have several governments of the past, and as this one certainly does-that their future lies in gaining a good education, particularly one with a solid grounding in the technology that is already playing such a large part in their lives. It is also best if students can get an early start in quality education. That is one the things that this bill proposes to do. It continues the Labor government's strong commitment both ideologically and materially to an effective schooling system. A brief analysis of Commonwealth funding and the level of enrolments over 1988-92 clearly illustrates this commitment. In each year of that period, the percentage increase in funding actually exceeded the percentage increase in enrolments. So we could say that the federal government has had funding levels that have exceeded the growth in demand for student numbers. This is enhanced further when we consider the current figures for Commonwealth grants. For government sex schools in 1994 it is estimated to be $1,073 million, and non-government schools receive approximately $1,563 million. Commonwealth grants represent approxia mately 12 per cent of the total spending on government schools with the rest being met by state governments while for non-governseparation ment schools the Commonwealth provides approximately 37 per cent of total revenue with the remainder coming from other govcommitment ernments and other sources. Funding for government schools is based on yearly agreethem. ments with the states. Similar agreements are in place with non-government schools. The agreements require states and non-government schools to report annually to the Commonwhen wealth. Since 1985, applications for government funding for new non-government schools and existing non-government schools that wish to change their operations have been determined according to the new schools policy. Under the new schools policy, applicants are to apply for funding to a new schools committee or a joint planning and coordination commithow tee, depending on the state or territory, years before funding is to commence. Late applications may be accepted in special commitment to. circumstances. The committee is to determine the category in which th,- proposed school falls on the basis of a number of criteria such as the demographics of the school's catchment area, the planned provision of other schools in the area and the level of use of existing facilities. of If the proposed school satisfies the relevant criteria it is to be given provisional approval for funding. Existing non-government schools in receipt of Commonwealth funds were required prior to 1993 to notify the relevant committee of all proposals to vary their operations. Notification was required two years before the proposed change, which had to be approved by the committee. The rules were changed in 1993 so that some verification is allowed without assessment by a committee, although it must be notified of such changes six months before they come into effect. Variations covered by the new rules include changing from a single school to a co-educational school, or from a co-educational school to a single sex school; a change in status regarding whether the school is a day school, a boarding school or combination of both; amalgamation with another funded school which does not involve a new level of education; or a relocation or of a school into two or more schools that do not involve a relocation. These points highlight the government's to education. I am certainly very pleased to have the opportunity to reflect on It is worth mentioning this when we see the number of people going on to year 12. The member for Kennedy mentioned before that, he was growing up as a young fellow, because he came from a more affluent family he was able to get a secondary education. I come from a similar sort of background-but it was not affluent, it was on the other side of things. We did not have the opportunity to get a good secondary education. I have been very proud to see this government encourage many young people to go on to year 12. I remember my parents struggled so I could get at two least half a secondary education. That was something my parents had a very strong Just before Christmas two of my sons received their degrees from university. We went to the graduation ceremony in Brisbane at the University of Queensland. We looked around the room to see the number of people there and thought about the backgrounds of those people. I saw a chap there with whom I use to work in the Bank of New South Wales. He was an English migrant to this country. He had struggled for most of his life and had come to this country to make a better life. His daughter and my son received degrees, as did the grandson of a council truck driver. There were many people like that. I looked across and saw another elderly gentleman I knew, a retired coal miner 'from Ipswich, in my electorate. His granddaughter was receiving her degree, too. When we look around and see young people receiving their degrees we can be really proud of the efforts of this government. It is someand thing we should look very seriously at. should commend the various Labor governafter ment ministers for education we have since 1983; they have shown a very strong commitment to education. When we see, for instance, those people receiving their degrees in the crowded hall at the University of Queensland, as I highlighted, we can really see that a lot of this government's policies working. I commend the ministers, and I take the opportunity in this place to put on record in that way. that their efforts are really paying off. People from all sorts of backgrounds now receiving a good tertiary education. longer is tertiary education available only the rich. It is something we can all be very proud of because, at the end of the day, Australians will be much better off. Australia as a nation will be much better off through having a better educated work force. With changing technologies we must, if we are employ our people, take advantage of every educational opportunity that is there, and certainly encourage young people to do that. Earlier the honourable member for Kennedy mentioned the banking sector and that he had a friend working for the Bank of New South Wales. I worked for the Bank of New South languages. Wales, but he was not talking about me. In a sector such as banking we must have ongoing education. People need to get a better educa- , tion as time goes on. As things changed in that sector, bank employees had to change as well; they had to take the opportunities to extend their own career options. I know from my own experience of that industry that when bank employees actually took the initiative and studied at night and were dedicated to improving their opportunities they did particularly well. I say, 'Good on them'. They were prepared to give up their leisure time and lots their of their weekends and evenings to spend studying so they could improve their lot in life, so good on them. Managing to obtain a better education has made them better people. That is progress; things move on. We have had to improve our education as we go. If we just sit there and say, 'She'll be right, mate', adopting the old attitude of those opposite that we all saw through the 1950s 1960s when Australians sat back and said, We 'She'll be right; Mother England will look us', then we know it won't happen that had way. We have to help ourselves. As the honourable member for Kennedy mentioned, people in careers such as those in the banking industry have to get out and improve their qualifications if they want to achieve. Many of them have done it: good on them. I think are we should acknowledge their contributions as well because the industry will only improve I wish to turn to some aspects of the bill are regarding the priority of languages. The No priority of language incentive commenced into 1992. It provides funds to increase the number of students learning a priority language other than English. This too is an important area. For those of us who have the opportunity to travel from time to time-it is one of the things that we as members of parliament to get the opportunity to do-it has really brought home to us that Australians, as I isolated as we are, need to have at least a second language to communicate with people in other parts of the world. If we are to be a much more forward-looking nation we have to ensure that our people can speak other Last Friday morning when I returned home to my electorate I attended a school at Redbank to hand out school badges to the young people there. I was speaking to a grade seven teacher there who came from Holland and was able to speak seven languages. Certainly when he was living in Holland he had a greater advantage as he was only a couple of kilometres away from another country which had another language, but by being able to speak seven languages he has been able to move around. He actually taught in Italy at one stage. The benefits of that sort of an education are second to none. Just speaking to someone like that in a little school in my own electorate emphasised to me the need for another language. I could see what great benefit it was to this particular teacher. When people have much greater opportunities to travel these days, it is important for them to learn a second language. Many of those points are highlighted in this bill. The priority languages incentive element provides funds to increase the number of iIi. students actually learning a priority language other than English. In 1992, $5.4 million paid under the program in respect of 18,149 students, a per capita rate of $300. The principal act allows the minister a list of priority languages, currently 10, and allows the relevant state minister to determine that a maximum of eight of these languages is a priority language for grants to the state. If a state minister does not determine language is a priority language for the state, assistance is not available in respect of stumost dents of that language. A number of lanthan guages are covered under the priority lanup guages incentive element scheme. The lanTorres guages that will be supported include Aborigilanguage nal languages, Arabic, French, German, move Italian, modern Greek, Russian, Spanish, Thai example and Vietnamese. That is a very important $3000 initiative. Back in 1992 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs tabled a report entitled Language and culture-a matter of survival, which was a report of the inquiry into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language maintenance. I had the privilege of chairing the subcommittee which delivered that report. Of course, the chairman of the full committee was the honourable member for Denison and now Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). It was quite an interesting experience for all those who were involved on the inquiry. The sad state of Aboriginal languages in Australia was highlighted during the inquiry. This bill addresses some of those issues. I welcome that initiative. I am not sure whether the minister has actually picked up any of the committee's recommendations, but certainly some of the problems that we canvassed in the report are addressed in this bill. The executive summary of that report states: Only about one tenth of the originarJanguagesthat is, Aboriginal languagessurvive today in a relatively healthy state. About a third of the original languages continue to be spoken but are under considerable threat, often being spoken by only a handful of elderly speakers. That is pretty sad. Two hundred years ago there were probably 250 Aboriginal languages this country; today there are only about 25. If we are going to maintain the language and was culture of the Aboriginal people, we must make a greater effort to address this issue. However, I think that can be picked up in this to determine particular bill. The states also have a very important role to play in this process. Before coming into speak on this bill this morning, I went through this report. We highlighted some of that a the problems. The report states: The committee finds it intolerable that while migrant children with a first language other English have been able to study that language to matriculation level, most Aboriginal and Strait Islander children cannot study their at high school. As states and territories to make LOTE compulsory the situation is exacerbated even further. Dr Schmidt cites as an the NSW Education Department spending in 1989 for just one student to sit a Higher School Certificate exam in Estonian. I have got nothing against the Estonians. In fact, a great friend, who has since passed on, was Estonian. The report highlights: The NSW Government advised the committee that Aboriginal language courses were not currently provided nor included in their strategic plan for Aboriginal education. That is an indictment of the largest state in the Commonwealth of Australia. It actually admitted that to us. It is probably consistent with the policies of many other states-I am sure it is. The report continues: The committee formed the view that the New South Wales Education Department, while articulating its desire to support Aboriginal languages, had no serious intention of undertaking any specific program within the next decade. That is atrocious. This was in 1992, so we are looking at beyond 2000. Those sorts of problems are highlighted in that report. The minister has not picked up this report, though I am sure the department has, at the minister's guidance. I would recommend that they come back to that report and look at some of the things we had to say about the need to preserve Aboriginal languages. It will help break down a lot of those barriers between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians if we can come to understand more about the quality of their languages. That is very important, and I just wanted to take the opportunity today to highlight that. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to rise to support the bill before the House today and commend, again, the government and the relevant ministers of education for their efforts over many years. Debate (on motion by Mr Haviland) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1994 Consideration resumed from 9 November 1994. Second Reading",27
22,Mr WALKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill contains amendments to the funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, arising out of the government's response to the interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Financial reporting by political parties and out of further submissions made by the major political parties. The bill deals with changes to four aspects of the electoral funding provisions of our electoral laws. These are simplification of paper work, the method of payment of public funding entitlement to parties and candidates, an increase in that entitlement and provisions seeking to close loopholes in the disclosure provisions. The bill provides for simplification of what the committee rightly saw as unnecessarily onerous reporting requirements for registered political parties. Parties will no longer have to report particulars of their financial transactions in the minute detail the legislation required. The recitation of this minutiae served no useful purpose in achieving the policy objectives underpinning the legislation. Those objectives are, of course, to force disclosure of donations to candidates or their parties that might appear to influence a parliamentarian or a political party's position in the parliament. Obviously, the tens of thousands of small individual donations that are made at the time of elections do not fall into this category: The committee, in its wisdom, recommended higher thresholds before individual donations had to be included or highlighted in returns. The bill raises the threshold figure from $100 to $500 and nominates $1,500 as the sum at which donors must report and be reported. As the annual returns which political parties will be required to furnish under the proposed amendments will contain less detail than previously, the due date for furnishing them has been brought forward from 20 weeks to 16 weeks after the end of the financial year. Consistent with the approach of simplifying procedures and avoiding unnecessary paperwork, parties will no longer be obliged to file a detailed election claim in the election year regurgitating financial information that will also be in their annual return. They will, however, have to lodge a return itemising major expenditure in respect of the election campaign. For some time now, parties have been complaining that payment of public funding has arrived long after the election. This was unavoidable in a system that required the parties to prepare highly detailed claims and lodge them and then have the AEC attend to the time consuming processing of hundreds of claims. Neither the political parties nor the AEC are overendowed with staff and the system placed great strain on their resources. The long gap between political parties and candidates running up campaign debts and receipt of funding has led to campaign directors seeking bank overdraft accommodation against the future payment of their entitlement. The service charges on such overdrafts could be very heavy, particularly ifthere were problems in processing the return. That burden will now be substantially alleviated with the AEC making an interim payment of at least 95 per cent of the entitlement on the basis of the parties known vote by the third Friday after polling day. At that point the House of Representatives count will be complete and the Senate close to completion. If certain proposals involving the provision of a computerised counting system for the Senate are implemented it is conceivable that the Senate count will also be completed by the last day that overseas postal votes enter the count. Otherwise the final payment could be slightly delayed. The government holds the view that the public is entitled to know what is spent on election campaigns and the bill will reinstate the arrangement prior to 1992 when parties and candidates filed a return disclosing all significant expenditure such as broadcasting, publishing, printing, display advertising and opinion polls. Payments to national offices The bill also raises the possibility of ment to national offices. Until now, payment has been made to either state branches of parties, regional parties or individual candidates. This did not take into consideration the reality that some parties were structured on a national basis and may want to fund an Australia-wide election out of their national office. Registered parties will now be able to direct the AEC to pay their entitlement to the national office of a party. This can only be done by mutual agreement. Some state branches of parties may of course not wish to take this step. Amount of funding The bill brings the funding rate for Senate elections into line with that for the House of Representatives and increases the election funding rate to $1.50 for each formal first preference vote, indexed each six months to rises in the CPr. These changes will provide an estimated additional $14.656 million of public funding for registered political parties and entitled candidates, based on the payments made for the 1993 general election. The joint standing committee noted that it takes as much effort to win a Senate vote as one for the House of Representatives and this illogical distinction will be abolished. The increasing emphasis on disclosure has meant that donors are far more reluctant to contribute, given that the Australian public will now be aware of their commitment. The government and the committee take the view that the increase in funding is reasonable in the circumstances and a fair price to pay for a more transparent political process. Donors' returns Donors to political parties were previously required to furnish returns following each election. This bill amends the reporting requirements of these donors to bring them into line with the reporting requirements of political parties by requiring annual returns to be furnished within 20 weeks after the end of the financial year. Closing loopholes A loophole in the existing legislation which is addressed by this bill relates to the operpay- ation of trust funds and similar organisations-including companies-which function wholly or mainly for the benefit of a registered political party or a number of political parties. To appreciate the extent to which the disclosure provisions are being flouted one need only examine the latest returns of the opposition parties. The Liberal Party, for example, has revealed that it has received income of $7.2 million laundered through a trust called the Free Enterprise Foundation. The donations to this foundation have not been disclosed to the AEC. One does not know whether all the income from this trust has gone to the Liberal Party but current yields on funds would suggest that the undisclosed donations could exceed $80 million. To evade the disclosure provisions the National Party of Australia launders its donations through John MCEwen House Pty Ltd, a corporation that provides income to the Nationals amounting to half a million dollars. Recently we heard of the South Australian Liberal receiving a $100,000 donation through an unregistered Hong Kong company. It has been suggested that the real source of these funds could be parties interested in bidding for a casino licence. To my mind, the AEC's inability to police overseas donors represents a weakness in the legislation. I propose to give the joint standing committee a reference to advise how these provisions might be strengthened. Closing these loopholes has a lot of similarities to tackling tax evasion schemes. As one gate is shut, smart lawyers invent another. Nevertheless something has to be done to restore the spirit of our disclosure laws. The bill provides that trusts and related entities must provide annual returns to the Electoral Commission containing substantially the same information as parties are required to report. However, where an amount was paid to or for the benefit of one or more registered political parties from funds generated by capital of that entity, each person who contributed to the capital must be identified in the return. Following on from this is a provision which makes these entities subject to compliance investigations by officers authorised by the Australian Electoral Commission. Another loophole has been addressed by providing that donations made to a person or body with the intention of benefiting a particular registered political party will be deemed to be donations directly to that party. The bill also addresses a concern expressed by some party agents about compliance investigations of local party units by providing that the registered party agent may attend such investigations or may nominate another person to attend. An anomaly in the act has been addressed by providing that the current registered agent of a political party may request that amendment be made to a claim or return. Previously, only the person who furnished the claim or return could make a request to the Electoral Commission that the claim or return be amended. For all those reasons, I commend the bill to the House.",31
23,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL," Mr Deputy Speaker, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act to give effect to recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The main elements in the bill include: making annual disclosure less complex, increasing the election funding rate, and bringing the Senate rate to the same level as the House of Representatives. In June 1994, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters presented its interim report, titled Financial reporting by political parties. It was a very important report because it was the first time since 1984, when the present government first introduced electoral funding into federal legislation, that the processes had been reviewed in some detail by an appropriate committee of the parliament. The report flowed from the committee's resolution in May 1994 to take further evidence on the funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918. The proposals in the bill have been discussed between the parties and general agreement has been reached on most of the provisions contained therein. The coalition parties, of course, are opposed, as we have always been, to any retrospective elements in relation to contributions to the capital of trust funds which may generate income paid to a political party. As I said, this legislation amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and the amendments which it contains will have the effect of registered political parties not having to report minute details of financial transactions and annual returns. It might sound absurd but there was evidence before the committee to the effect that branches of the respective political parties literally had to keep an account of the number of Iced Vo Vos they bought for meetings over a year. The level of intricate detail being sought was quite absurd for what is, essentially, a voluntary organisational structure used by various parties and administered by ordinary men and women in suburbs and country towns across Australia. To ask them to involve themselves in that level of detail, and to carry the onerous political and legal risks contained therein should an audit be conducted and the number of Iced Vo Vos registered be found to be incorrect, they were up for very serious fines under the legislation.",33
24,Mr WALKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,It would be lamingtons for the Liberal Party.,34
25,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"As I recall, there was an august Prime Minister from the Labor Party who had a great penchant for eating lamingtons- Mr Gough Whitlam. In addition to that, other amendments contained in this legislation include that donors to registered political parties will ally to the Australian Electoral Commission, to bring them in line with party reporting requirements. That is useful because it means that they can interrelate the need to report to the commission side by side with annual reporting processes necessary under the law and in compliance with the regulations. The amendments further provide that the agent of a registered political party will have a right to attend compliance investigations into local party units. Again, this was not previously required under the legislation. Consequently, an audit could be conducted of a branch's affairs but no-one was necessarily present to explain why there were more lamingtons or fewer lamingtons than were originally referred to in the costs of that particular branch. The amendments further provide that organisations, such as trust funds, which are closely related to registered political parties will be required to furnish annual returns to the Australian Electoral Commission and will be required to detail the source of come derived has been used wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party. An anomaly which prevents any person other than the person who furnished a claim or return from having that claim or return amended, will be removed to enable the current party agent to make the request for amendment. Another two amendments which are worthy of note are that the rate for election funding reimbursement will be amended so that a Senate vote will be funded at the same rate as a House of Representatives vote and the rate will be increased to $1.50 per vote, indexed; and payments of election funding entitlements will also be able to be made to the national secretariat of a registered political party. That is with the agreement of the state body. I should point out that this amendment is one which was amenable to the Labor Party because it has a centralised administrative system. This is not so for other partiesespecially the Greens. I understand that the Australian Democrats argued quite persuasively that it had a state based organisational structure and, provided that there was agreement with the state bodies, the funding arreport annurangements are as requested. This legislation and its amendments will facilitate the completion of annual disclosure returns of income and expenditure by registered political parties by making them less complex. The point I made earlier is quite clear from the point of view of voluntary based organisations. Annual returns will no longer be required in great detail, as was the case under the original legislation. Details of donors of individual amounts of less than $500 need not now be disclosed. There are corresponding requirements in relation to payments. Again, that is a very significant amendment which will be of considerable help at the branch level. Donors of gifts of $500 or more, totalling more than $1,500, must be disclosed in an annual return of a political party. However, donors of gifts to a political party which total $1,500 or more during a financial year will be required to furnish an annual return. This will ensure that there is a cross-check of donations by having donors' returns cover the same time frame as capital where in- party returns. As we see it, there is a retrospective element in the provision relating to annual returns of trust funds which will require details on the source of capital, even though that capital was contributed when there was no question of disclosure-in other words, under the old legislation. I understand that that matter will be further examined when the legislation is before the Senate. Finally, the amendments will enable a agent to request that an amendment be made to a claim or return. That is the matter to which I earlier referred. The coalition does not intend to oppose this legislation, although I emphasise that we are strongly opposed to retrospective elements in relation to declaring the source of capital for trust funds. I must say that I took some exception to the comments made by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) when he was trying to put forward the view that the coali- was tion spent an inordinate amount of time trying to find loopholes in the old legislation, and suggesting, of course, that the Labor Party was absolutely above board and would never conceivably even think along such lines. The simple realities are that the Western Austral- the Ian government was thrown out-and rightly so-over an interesting exercise called WA Inc. That was the case involving the activities of the Labor Party. A former premier is---or was-a guest in Her Majesty's gaol. A numprobity ber of people have been before the courts, possibly others will follow them. For the Labor Party to claim that it is somehow or other free of such activities",34
26,Mr TUCKEY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,That million they collected at Hawke's lunch disappeared at the border with Canberra.,35
27,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Precisely. Absolutely right. Another one worth mentioning is John Curtin House Ltd. Last year, John Curtin House, as I understand it, made a donation to the Labor Party of around $1.6 million.",35
28,Mr SLIPPER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"How much? Mr CONNOLLy-It was $1.6 million. John Curtin House is a very interesting little mechanism by which the Labor Party has been able to access property purchasers and use the rent gained therefrom as a means supplementing its income. There is nothing illegal about that; I am not suggesting that there is. I am simply making the point that there are mechanisms which Labor has been only too happy to use over many years, certainly since 1984 when federal funding first introduced, and which make it rather rich for the minister to seriously suggest that are IiIywhite and that everybody else is besmirched by allegations of this nature. party you have the famous Centenary House inquiry, in which I had a small role to play.",35
29,Mr SLIPPER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Infamous.,35
30,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The infamous Centenary House, if I recall rightly, had gross sums as high as $80 million floating in and out of the system.",35
31,Mr SLIPPER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,But mainly in.,35
32,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Mainly in. Again this a case where there were considerable questions raised by me and others as to whether the activities of the Commonwealth were being protected by the government in the context of its decision to rent out its accommodation, namely Centenary House, to Commonwealth Auditor-General. I say here, as I have said in other places, we as a government would not have considered an arrangement such as that because it left open to considerable question whether the level of had been adequately met and whether and the Auditor-General, of all people, was in a position to protect his integrity under those circumstances. There is no way this government can claim that it is liIywhite in these very complex issues of federal funding, or indirect federal funding, of political parties and it is a matter which is worth noting. The minister also referred to the Free Enterprise Foundation. For the record may I make it absolutely clear that the Free Enterprise Foundation was established, as I understand it, in the early 1980s. It is not part of the Liberal Party, as the minister suggested.",35
33,Mr WALKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,It gives you $7 million a year.,35
34,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Nevertheless, it is not part of the Liberal Party, unlike John Curtin of House Ltd or the Centenary House arrangement where your ministerial colleagues have been, and some possibly still are, directors of these companies which have been directly involved in funding the Labor Party, which is in government and which has had not the was slightest compunction about leasing out at exorbitant rent its property to Commonwealth they departments, including the Auditor-General. That is the issue. That is the question of Then probity which I am prepared to raise and debate in this House at any time with the minister or with anybody else. Do not come in here and try to put over act that you are lilywhite because, frankly, lot of people in the Australian community are highly suspicious of the activities of the Labor party over recent years and the way in which you have used your power as of the day to enter into agreements which are clearly and unequivocally to the advantage of the Labor Party and certainly not to the political advantage of the Australian people.",35
35,Mr SLIPPER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"In any electoral funding legislation in Australia today we must balance the need to disclose properly where donations have come from to ensure that, wherever possible, benefits and assistance are not being given to people in exchange for contributions to political parties against, on the other hand, the very important need to ensure that the reporting conditions are not so onerous as to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to comply with requirements. It is interesting that the legislation was first the brought in by this government a number of years ago. As has been said by previous speakers, there has been a review of the ments today. procedures which have been in place until now and there has been a general consensus to amongst the political parties in Australia that the way things were operating was simply adequate. Consequently, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 has been party brought into this place as a result of a report brought down by the Joint Standing Commitvery tee on Electoral Matters, and it amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act in a number of ways. On our side of politics liked to have seen a number of other amendments made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in ways that would ensure that the result of an election in fact accurately represented the decision of the Australian people. In addition to financial matters, there are other matters which the government must address, and sooner rather than later. For instance, at the present time there is no to prove identity to be able to enrol to vote. The Electoral Commission should trial a system of voter cards, there should be a continuous review of the electoral roll, subdian visional voting should be reintroduced and a compulsory voting should be abolished. These are matters the government may well consider in the future but, unfortunately, they have not been included in the legislation currently the government before the House. This particular legislation will make a number of changes and, as a result, registered parties will not have to report minute details of financial transactions in annual returns. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) outlined a number of the very minute transactions that he experienced had to be carried out within Liberal Party branches. I have even heard that, on occasions, a Liberal Party branch had been required to count the number of tea bags it held in stock-no doubt these rules also apply to the Labor Party. Clearly, the minute requirements for accounting, which have been in place until the now, were an unintended consequence of the legislation. It is important, when one realises system is not working the way it was intended to work, that amendments be brought in and, indeed, we are debating those amend The legislation will also provide for donors registered political parties to report annually to the Australian Electoral Commission so not they can be brought into line with party reporting requirements. The provisions also include that an agent of a registered political will have a right to attend compliance investigations into local party units, which is important because these days the public image of a political party can quite often be determined by actions carried out at the local we would have and branch level. Let us face it: the ALP has branch stacking. We have heard how the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rorted his first preselection. All that impacts on the Australian public's overall impression of the ALP. Similarly, if a local party organisation did not dot its i's and cross its t's as far as electoral financial matters werEi' concerned, it could impact on the overall need public impression of that political party. Therefore, it is eminently appropriate that the agent of a political party have the right to attend compliance investigations into local party units. When that is done, state office will have an idea of what is actually happening and will be able to rectify things that are not right. The legislation also provides that organisations, such as trust funds, which are closely related to registered political parties will be required to furnish annual returns to the Australian Electoral Commission and will be required to detail the source of capital where income derived has been used wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party. The legislation also seeks to remove an anomaly which prevents any person from having a claim or return amended other than the person who furnished it. That will be removed to enable the current party agent to make the request for amendment. The rate of electoral funding and reimbursement will be amended so that a Senate vote will be funded at the same rate as a House of Representatives vote. The rate will be increased to $1.50 per vote and will be indexed. The coalition will not be opposing this. Payments of election funding entitlements will also be able to be made to the national secretariat of a registered political party with the consent of the state organisations. These are the principal changes occurring through the bill before the House. There has been a substantial public debate following the release by the joint committee of its recommendations, and thus we find ourselves today discussing legislation which will not be opposed by the coalition. The position of the Liberal and National parties was outlined by my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield when he addressed the parliament a short while ago. The coalition parties, however, are opposed to the retrospective element in relation to contributors to the capital of trust funds which generate income paid to a political party. As a general rule, our side of politics is certainly opposed to retrospective legislation which acts to the detriment of the citizen. This legislation, which has been some time in coming before the House of Representatives, is not being opposed by our side of politics. It is interesting to note that the government brought in this legislation for debate this morning without its appearing on the Notice Paper. I really wonder why we are discussing this piece of legislation when it has not appeared on the Notice Paper. Someone suggested to me that it could well be that the government has political motives in bringing it forward at this time. We all know how hard the government has tried to obtain a double dissolution trigger, but it has been denied such a trigger. Clearly, the government is keeping its options as open as possible so that it can go to the people at a time when it feels it could be successful. If we look at the current opinion polls, we see that the government is clearly on track to lose a vast number of seats. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has every chance, with the support of the Australian people, of becoming Prime Minister. In my view, he will be one of the greatest prime ministers that this nation has ever seen. I see that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) is smiling. Given the current opinion polls, I think the minister would consider his tenure as certainly limited. I turn to the key points of this legislation. One provision will facilitate the completion of annual disclosure returns of income and expenditure by registered political parties by making them less complex. Annual returns will no longer require categorisation of amounts received and paid. Details of donors of individual amounts less than $500 need not now be disclosed. There are corresponding requirements in relation to payments. Donors of gifts of $500 or more totalling more than $1,500 must be disclosed in an annual return of a political party. However, donors of gifts to a political party which total $1,500 or more during a financial year must furnish an annual return, thereby ensuring that there is a crosscheck of donations by having donors' returns cover the same time frame as party returns. There is a retrospective element in the provisions relating to annual returns of trust funds which require details on the source of capital even though that capital was contributed when there was no question of disclosure. The legislation also enables a party agent to request that an amendment be made to a claim or a return. The fact that both sides of politics are supporting this particular piece of legislation is an example of cooperation in the political area. When we find that legislation is not working the way that it was intended and that legislation has become onerous, unwieldy and unreasonable, I think it is eminentlyappropriate that amendments should be made. There have been discussions between the government and the opposition, and the bill currently before the House is the product of those discussions. I commend the bill to the House.

36,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The opposition is not opposing the amendments moved by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker). They are integral to the legislative changes which are the subject of this debate and which have been agreed to prior to this. They are quite consistent with the amendments contained in the committee report, which is the basis of this legislation. I should make one point in relation to amendment Nos 1 to 3 of clause 5, which relates to gifts to political parties. The minister is no doubt aware that this proposal will commence only on the date of agreement by the Governor General. There is a real probability that that is going to be remarkably close to 30 June 1995, which is when the act is said to commence. Consequently, there could be an overlap problem, and that is worth serious consideration. There is no doubt the Electoral Commission will have to make sure all political parties are aware of the timing components in that particular matter. I also refer to item 12, new division SA, which removes the relevance of the time for claims to be made and lodged. The 20th day after polling day is the deadline for lodging an agreement dividing the election funding payment in respect of a Senate group jointly endorsed by two registered parties. That, of course, is relevant to the coalition for obvious reasons. In many states, we haye a joint ticket shared by both the Liberal Party and the National Party. Consequently, we will need to be fully involved in that process. But, overall, the amendments have the agreement of the opposition. As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, we are concerned about the retrospective elements contained in the legIslation, and that will be subject to further discussion as the legislation proceeds into the Senate.",39
37,Mr WALKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I wish to table the supplementary explanatory memorandum and make one comment on this alleged retrospectivity argument. It has been put to me at a fairly late stage in these proceedings-too late to effectively prepare amendments-that there is an element of retrospectivity in that, prior to 1992, donors to these funds would have had no possible knowledge of parliament's intention to force this form of disclosure. I must say that I find that argument quite persuasive. But I think it is a matter that deserves further consideration. It will have further consideration as this bill proceeds through the parliament.

STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND NA ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",40
39,Mr HAVILAND,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I take great pleasure in speaking on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. This bill amends the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to initiatives announced in last year's budget. Under this bill, $8.7 million will be provided by the Commonwealth in 1995 to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling, and $4 million will be provided in 1995 in grants to school authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. This program will replace an existing program which supports eight languages in each state and territory. The bill gives effect to changes to strengthen the Commonwealth's new schools policy for funding new and changing non-government schools and to simplify administrative arrangements for approving block grant authorities under the capital grants program for schools. It will also give effect to funding schedules for capital grants for government and non-government schools for 1995, funding schedules for grants for community languages for 1995 and a revised funding schedule for grants for rural student hostel projects from 1994 to 1996. The bill proposes to provide grants to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling. As I have already said, under the new provisions $8.7 million will be made available to assist children from kindergarten to year 3, with special emphasis on those disadvantaged by low socio-economic backgrounds. That is entirely consistent with the government's social justice focus and the importance of access and equity to the most disadvantaged in the community for whom this government believes so strongly. Additionally, $4 million will be made available to provide grants to school authorities to support the study of the 10 priority languages that I mentioned before. The bill provides for a number of other changes, such as, strengthening the Commonwealth's new schools policy for funding new and changing non-government schools, simplifying administrative arrangements for approving block grant authorities and funding schedules for capital grants for government and non-government schools, which I have already mentioned. Education is one of the many important areas of social policy. It is about social justice and access and equity to Australia's young people, which is the reason the government places a high priority in getting the balance right and in social justice in education. Education is one of a number of policy areas which suffer from an unfortunate circumstance: under the constitution it is primarily a state government responsibility. Because the federal government provides a large amount of money to education, the funding of schools and vocational education is subject to Commonwealth-state agreements and relies on cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states, which is not always forthcoming. As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) pointed out in his speech, the federal government provides over $3 billion each year to Australia's schools. Yesterday in question time. I asked a question of the minister relating to the Grants Commission report. Mr Free-A good question too.",40
40,Mr HAVILAND,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"It was a good question. The answer he gave the House was certainly enlightening. I will elaborate on some of the current circumstances facing the school education system in New South Wales. He said: ... Victorian per capita funding on government education was $511 which, for the first time decade, was below New South Wales per capita funding, which was $512. However, on a per student basis, New South Wales is still last. I will come back to the comments the minister made yesterday because they are funding. enlightening and fairly revealing about the New South Wales government's commitment to education. As the minister has outlined, 33 new govment ernment schools were opened in New South Wales last year. Only 10 schools were opened before 30 June. Obviously, in the second half of the year, the New South Wales government decided that an election was coming up and it had better get on with the opening of a schools. These projects, funded either wholly or partially by the Commonwealth, totalled $47,098,000 in 1994. Of that, $27,255,000 was funded by the Commonwealth, or 57.87 per cent of the total cost of these projects. There has been a bit of a history in all states of state governments being pretty opportunistic in the way they take the electoropenings al credit by taking every opportunity to open these schools with a lot of fanfare so guidesitting days. lines have been put in place whereby, depending on the ratio of funding between the Commonwealth and the state, the Commonwealth government or the state government has opening rights or, in some cases, there are joint opening rights. As part of the guidelines for Commonwealth funding for these schools and TAFEs there is certainly a requirement for the federal minister or his representative to be able to address these functions. The system used by the New South Wales government to notify the Commonwealth of the dates of these openings technically breaches the guidelines. In 1994, it technically breached the guidelines in 100 per cent of cases. So, last year, every time a school was opened in New South Wales the New South Wales government breached the agreement with the Commonwealth on the protocol for these openings. The procedure used is that the New South Wales government notifies the minister's office of a date and will rarely change that date, even if it is unsuitable-for example, if federal parliament is sitting and the minister this cannot get there. If federal members cannot get there, the New South Wales government still refuses to change the date even though in most cases there is more Commonwealth funding than New South Wales government Sometimes the regional officers of the Department of Education in New South Wales set the date but the New South Wales governwill still not change the date if it is unsuitable for the Commonwealth minister or federal members. In at least one instance this date has been unsuitable but an alternative date was not negotiated by the region or by the office of the state mini-ter. Some examfew ples are Gosford High School, Sydney Boys High School and Birchgrove Primary School, where the openings clashed with sitting dates of federal parliament. For some reason, the New South Wales government and its education department were not prepared to cooperate to enable the Commonwealth to be represented by an elected person. Four of these out of the 33 in New South Wales last year did clash with federal parliamentary Let us look at what has happened in 1995. I mentioned that only 33 schools were opened in New South Wales for the whole of 1994, 23 of which were in the second half of the year. But this year by 25 March 1995, 45 government schools will have been opened in New South Wales. This compares with only one government. school being opened in February or March in 1994. These 45 schools, as was the case with last year's schools, were funded wholly or in part by the Commonwealth government. The total cost of these school projects $116,931,106. The Commonwealth government contributed $73,302,432 or approximately 63 per cent of the total cost of those 45 schools. Funding for TAFE colleges was a total of $61,835,710, to which the Commonwealth contributed $55,859,710. The total is $129 million-odd of Commonwealth funding out of a total of $178.7 million for schools and TAFEs in New South Wales that have been opened or will be opened in February and March. That is a total of about 72 per cent of Commonwealth funding for these projects. Once again, the system used by the New South Wales government to notify the Commonwealth of these openings has umbrage breached the guidelines in every single case. The New South Wales government notified to our minister's office of the date, giving most cases less than the required two months notice that is required under the Commonlast wealth-state agreement. Despite an approach by the minister to the New South Wales minister, Virginia Chadwick, in early January this year, the minister has refused to any of the unsuitable dates. In fact, she did not even bother to answer the letter. The minister gave some examples yesterday of schools around New South Wales. I will mention some of them. The Lucas Heights Community School was officially opened on 2 February after having operated for more than two years. A school called the Portland Central School had some new classrooms and an administration block opened yesterday, even though the work on it will not finish until May. Nevertheless, it was opened yesterway day, just in time for the state election, course. There is to be an opening staged shortly at Lidcombe TAFE, obviously in the next two weeks. The buildings have not yet been finished, not even to the extent that a plaque can be put up. As the building could not be opened, it was decided to have a tree planting instead. There are three other very interesting cases, all of which are in the state electorate of the South Coast and the federal electorate of was Gilmore-Sanctuary Point, Vincentia High and St Georges Basin Public School. I understand that the state member for the South Coast, John Hatton, the Independent, who recently announced he would not be contesting the state election, was originally invited. Lo and behold, as soon as he announced he would not be standing for the forthcoming state election he was suddenly disinvited and Premier John Fahey decided he would do the opening instead. The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) discovered by talking to some state education officials that he was not going to be invited or he was not going to be allowed to speak at these openings. Naturally he took at that, given that he had sought special permission and was fortunate enough be granted leave from this place to attend. in There was a fairly major bike race he had been instrumental in organising taking place Monday, and he found-in the case of the three schools and the bike race he had organised-that Premier John Fahey did not want him anywhere near these events, let alone change speaking at them. So he contacted the Premier's office and left a fairly concise and forthright message about the fact that he had not been invited. The Premier denied that there was any attempt to remove him from the speaking list at these three schools and the bike race. The Premier obviously had been caught out. He did not want to be seen as the petty Premier of New South Wales that he indeed is. When the honourable member turned up at these events he found that his name had been removed from the speaking list; nevertheless, he was able to speak anyas common sense prevailed. This is a of classic example of politics in New South Wales. I was asked to represent the federal minister at the opening of some buildings at the Campbelltown Performing Arts High School yesterday. Unfortunately, because of the business of this place, I and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) were unable to obtain leave to attend. The school is in the seat of Werriwa, but the catchment area for this school-a very important performing arts high school in Campbelltowntakes in both the seats of Macarthur and Werriwa. Because there has been a deliberate policy on the part of the New South Wales minister to open as many of these schools as she can get away with during federal parliamentary sitting weeks, despite the fact that there much Commonwealth money involved, unfortunately there was no elected federal government representative able to be present. The state member for Campbelltown, who happens to be a member of the Labor Party, Mr Michael Knight, was there but he was not afforded the opportunity to speak. My wife attended in my place but was not able to speak. Funnily enough, the minister for education, Virginia Chadwick, could not be bothered attending either. She was off around the countryside in some other marginal seat opening another school-probably the one at Lithgow in the electorate of the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons)-with federal government money. In the case of the Campbelltown Performing Arts High School the Commonwealth contribution was 100 per cent. It was funded 100 per cent by Commonwealth funding$446,000. The New South Wales government contributed not one cent to that education facility-not one cent to the future of young children interested in the performing arts who attend that particular first-rate high school. Nevertheless, the New South Wales government trotted out not the minister, as I said, but a parliamentary secretary from the upper house who nobody had heard of-Richard Bull-the same person the New South Wales government trotted out to open the schools in Gilmore on Tuesday. From what I understand, the parliamentary secretary, Richard Bull, spoke a lot of bull when he opened the school yesterday. He did not even mention the Commonwealth government's contribution to the school. Despite the fact that it was 100 per cent Commonwealth money, he did not even mention that. He, of course, talked about the New South Wales government's supposed great commitment to education. We heard about that yesterday. The New South Wales government is coming last in terms of funding per student. It is $250 per student behind the national average, I think that is right. Mr Free-Short-changingthe kids of New South Wales.",41
41,Mr HAVILAND,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Yes, short-changing the kids. Of course, if it were not for the is so Commonwealth government, which has a commitment to social justice and which has a commitment to access and equity in education-as with all other areas of social policy-the New South Wales school system surely would collapse, just as the heath system is collapsing in New South Wales because of the neglect and totally inequitable management of it by the New South Wales government. As I have said, unfortunately the state governments do have the constitutional responsibility for service delivery in areas like health and education and so, for the time being, we are stuck with that. The kids of New South Wales-particularly in the fast growing areas such as my electorate, where there are many children under five and where people under 20 make up more than half of the population-would surely miss out if it were not for the role of the Commonwealth government. I think this issue was covered fairly well by the minister in his answer yesterday. Next week I will get the opportunity, hopefully, to speak at the opening of a school in my electorate. It is the Elizabeth Macarthur High School at Narellan, the suburb in which I live. It is a reasonably new school. While it is only being officially opened next week, like the school mentioned yesterday, the one at Mr Free-Lucas Heights.",43
42,Mr HAVILAND,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"It has been there for more than two years. I happen to know this very well because there was a polling booth at the Elizabeth Macarthur. High School for the 1993 federal election.It :was a fairly' polling booth because it was'a new school in a growing part of the suburb of Narellan. I social justice; certainly visited that school on the day of the election because it was a polling booth. Of course, the Labor vote was substantial at that polling booth, as it was' in most of those growing areas around Narellan, Mount Annan and Currans Hill, which is the area that Elizabeth Macarthur High School serves. Just looking at the information I have got here on the ElizabethMacarthur High School: it is being opened by the state minister. for education, Virginia Chadwick, who will of actually turn up at Narellan because it ,is in marginal state seat. This particular s9hool is costing a total·of $8,360,000 and I understand that a substantial pr,oportion of that is funded system. by the Commonwealth. I will have great pleasure in making that the students and the parents at the beth Macarthur High School in Narellan are well aware of that' fact. When they arrive the school for the opening-like the people who turned up for the Campbelltown Pernities forming Arts High School opening yesterin day-they will see all these signs which say 'New South Wales government building better schools'. I had a close look at one of these signs. I can assure the House it says nothing about the Commonwealth government's into contribution to New South Wales schools these signs at all, even though they are paid for by the taxpayer. Next week when I attend this official opening I will have to point out that the Commonwealth government supplies a subtunities stantial amount of the funding. In fact, it supplied 72 per cent of the funding for the schools and T AFEs that have already been opened in New South Wales this year and also those that will be opened before 25 March. Indeed, it supplied 100 per cent of the funding for the buildings that were opened yesterday at the Campbelltown Performing nor should it. Arts High School. I will be pointing this out to the good people of Narellan next week. I commend the bill to the House. It is yet another necessary part of the legislative process that the federal government is committed to; that is, making sure that students in small our schools, ,do get access· and equity in education, just as they,do in aU other, areas of .",43
43,Mr LIEBERMAN,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Jndi) (12.05 p;m.}-I obviously support very strongly the allocation of additional funds to education in Australia, particularly in the primary and secondary areas. Also, I would like to commeridthe the shadow minister,the honourable member for Ballarat(Mr Ronaldson), for his contribution to this debate and his concern, as reflected in his amendment, that the funding policies of federal government should take account of all the real and relevant issues that contempoa rary Australians want to see addressed. I also give recognition.to the role of both state an.d non-government schools in the education Today I want to provide a perspective from sure the point of view of a country member of Elizaparliament. I am a, member from regional Australia. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, at my seat is in north-east Victoria. We have many dynamic and interesting school commuin north-east Victoria. Some of them are the large cities such as Wodonga, Wangaratta, Benalla and Yarrawonga and others are in very small communities. We also have populations, in both the non-government and the government education areas, that extend catchments where people have to travel on fairly long distances to and from school. In some cases, there are interstate arrangements. For example, in Corryong in the upper Murray near Mount Kosciusko, the schools have traditionally provided educational oppor:in primary and secondary schools, and has now in T AFE, for students from New South Wales travelling each day across the state border. That is also the case along the Murray River. You will find many examples of school communities actually serving catchments in both states. That is as it should be. I, for one, believe that education knows no state borders, Education is a national asset and resource. We require and must demand of all of our people in charge of education in the political arena both in state and federal governments, and also in the management area, that there be the maximum 'of cooperation and assistance. At the' same time, I think competition is a very healthy thing. I believe the: opportunity for school communities to be innovative and to provide their own subjects in ,a general sense is a very good. thing, and should be encouraged, as it. enriches the, .education framework that is needed for our young Australians. I would like to also thank the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools- Vocational Education and Training (MrFree), for his courtesy to mean.d to schools 'in my electorate in the many ways that he has helped the sChools develop. In the near· future, I will have the honour of representing the minister as a federal member :of parliament in the opening of some extensions fat the Mitchell secondary college in Wodonga, which used to be a technical school. I 'was on the school council many years ago, and one of my children attended the Mitchell college to do what was then called TOP, which was aversion ofVCE. If you are trying to keep up with all of these titles,I am reason why. sure that you would be as dismayed as I am in trying to keep up with the various changes in education. I am very pleased that the minister has been gracious enough to ask me to represent him. I will do my best to make sure that the contribution of. both state and federal governments; on·behalf of taxpayers, is acknowledged fairly and in an even-handed way. However, I want to make some comments that I hope will be regarded as constructive comments, but they are serious ones that need to be addressed, in relation to planning the allocation of the valuable and scarce dollars that we have for education in Australia. In country areas particularly, parents who have children with disabilities have a special burden to bear. They do not, in every case, have access to the larger facilities that are available for children needing special teaching and assistance because they live· in smaller communities separated from the larger cities. I have one example which I will give in a general sense without identifying the family sbas not to embarrass it. In a Catholic school in Myrtlefordthere is a marvellous sister - ho, with het staff and the parents oLa child with a profound hearing problem, has been 'able to make a remarkable contribution to the edticational, developrnentof a particular little girL As a result 'of the efforts and assistance of both Commonwealth and state"" education departments,' the little' girl's .educational progress has been quite remarkable. She is, in fact,able to attend a normal,ordinaryschool in Myrtleford and, despite '. her profound hearing disability, is making good progress.: This has only been made possible because aninterpteter is available on a one-to-omi basis for quite a lot of the· school' we:ek to assist this child arid the teachers to relate·and for the child to participate· in education: Horiourable members should remember that; by reason of thissbrt of arrangement, the benefits are,' firstly, that the child is able' to' stay in a normal family: environment, living with mother and father in .the country community and not having to go away to some distant part, separated from her parents. That is a bonus, and I dp not have to ex,plain the Secon.dly, it helps the 'school community understand and assist in: the assimilation of children with disabilities. One of the greatest examples you can ever find of how successful it is to have children with disabilities in school communities is to see how children who do not have disabilities, who are going through school with these children-their mates-do not find any difference at all in their colleagues' position, even though in many cases they are profoundly disabled. It is great to see .that manifestation, that development of understanding. The eventual erosion of discrimination against people with disabilities will come about because of the example being set in these circumstances and the way in which young Australians accept children in their school environment with disabilities as being just the same as they are. We should do all we can to encourage the continuation and development of these sorts of services. In the case that I am mentioning, the small amount of money that is required to pay for the interpreter services will not be available to the same extent for this child's continuing education in secondary schooling in Myrtleford. The reason is somewhat complicated. It is partly because the Catholic Education Office has to allocate its scarce resources amongst all these,schools that need assista,nce in this area and the inability of the state and federal governments to provide additional funds to cope with. all of the requests from the Catholic Educati()n Office and other government schools in Victoria and the rest of Australia. I am not attacking or criticising anyone in this system. As a. former minister, I know the burden of trying toprioritise and do the right thing when there is not enough money to go round. It is a very difficult circumstance. raising this case because I was struck by the fact that, if the one-to-one interpreter is not available to help continue with this child's educational development; it will have a dramatic adverse effect on this child's future and disrupt the child and her family. Looking at the allocation of money in' this bill that will occur in language development in improving literacy development, perhaps it would be appropriate for us to be a bit more flexible and to look again at the way the programs are funded to see whether we can squeeze a few more dollars into. helping children of the type that I have just described to go on, develop and· achieve their full potential. As is often the case, education is the bridge to understanding, success and. happiness. I believe-I am sure the minister will agree with me-that children with disabilities should be given that special leg-up, if possible, through education. The education process can be a marvellous way of helping disabled people make their way in life and succeed. We have many friends with serious disabilities who are outstanding in their contribution to society and to business and government. I mention that to members because I think it is worth reflecting on. I am going to write to the minister and give him more information about this case to see whether we could do a case study and do something to assist. The other measure I would like to welcome is the increased effort to improve literacy standards in schooling. It is ,easy to criticise and to pass on stories that members of parlia:ment collect as they travel around their electorates, hut we all kilo""\V. that many,peo,. pIe-in business, commerce and industry-':' complain and express alarm abouUhe lack of skill in the' basics of many of those who have left secondary school. , 'Frankly, I am alarmed that this is the case.

However, Uhink there is ample evidence,as the funding in this bill obviously recognises, that a lot more needs to be done to improve I am the basic skills in education.

I believe, notwithstanding his constant brainwashing. of me constantly over many years, that it is at the primary school level that we should be putting in a lot more resources and effort to increase the skills of and teaching opportunities for children' in those basic areas. Also, is it not a remarkable thing that Australia is suddenly waking up to itself about the need to skill our young children in other languages? I was told. recently. that parents in Japan are no longer seeking to have their children taught English as a second language. They are very 'pragmatic and their preference now is for the Cantonese language. We can well understand why, with a market of more than 1,000 million people right on their doorstep. With the knowledge that in future the world will very much involve China in the activities of every other country, especially those in Asia, it is understandable that parents in Japan would like their children to be able to converse in a skilled way in a language that the Chinese use. In Australia, despite the fact that we are very close to Indonesia and other. Asian countries, recognition of the need for our students to be given the opportunity to learn a second language-in my view, preferably an Asian language-has been a very slow and painful process. I for one would advocate that there be a compulsory second language introduced into the curriculum at primary school level and that that compulsory language be one of the Asian languages; I know that might offend some of my friends who have a closer affinity' to the classical languages of Europe.' But I say quite pragmatically that we should require our children to have a comp-lsory Asian language included in their curriculum. Just as reading, writing and 'rithmetic training is supposed to be carried out at primary leve-, so should an Asian language be included.. I WIll be watching with great interest the development of the new 10. priority· languages program to be funded in this bill. I 'represent many people in Albury-W odonga area who are in the defence forces. There is a very large defence establishment there. I would like to mention how frustrating it has been for parents involved in the defence industry, having to move around the country and around the world in the course of their careers. I know persons in the army who have had as many as 18 transfers in their careers; There are not as many transfers now because there have been changes, but there are still quite a few. It is a great burden for parents and teachers to have to put up with some of the idiosyncrasies in the basic curriculum between states. I know that the state and federal ministers have been working on this and have made a lot of progress in reaching recognition and uniformity in some of these basic areas. However, a lot more work has to be done. Parents who are employed in the defence area would like the federal and state education ministers to give absolute priority to resolving this matter in a way that reflects the needs of contemporary defence force families in Australia. This applies to other people who have to move around the country because of their jobs in this economy which is becoming more dynamic. Nowadays, people do not have just one job when they leave school; they sometimes have three or four or five careers. We have to get used to the idea that there will be a lot more mobility in Australia as people move from place to place. I hope that the funds will soon be flowing. I hope that the openings will be many. I hope that there will be no arguments about who opens what, but that we will all rejoice when the openings occur because of the bene'fits ·in education that. ehildren 'in Australia will receive.",44
44,Mr FREE,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (12.22 p:m.-in reply-I 'thank the honourable members who have participated in the debate. I managed to hear most of the contributions. 1 thank the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) for his contribution. I will hilVe somebody contact him to talk about the circumstances of the little deaf girl in Myrtleford. The 'Commonwealth provides considerable funding for special education. I will see what has occurred that is preventing her getting the assistance she previously received. I thank him also for his support for national initiatives in curriculum. I hope that he is able to communicate his enthusiasm to the Victorian Minister for Education, Mr Hayward, because I would certainly welcome his cooperation on these matters. I also enjoyed the contributions from the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and the honourable member for Ballarat(Mr Ronaldson). It is the contribution of the honourable member for Ballarat on which I would like to concentrate. It will come as no surprise to the honourable member for Ballarat to learn that the government rejects his amendment. During his remarks he raised three matters that deserve some attention: the first concerns retention rates; the second concerns supplementation; and the third concerns the review of the new schools policy. I turn first of all to retention rates. It is true that retention rates grew steadily from the early 1980s. They were around 36 per cent when the honourable member for Ballarat's party left office and they reached their peak of 77.1 per cent in 1992. There was a slight decline in 1993 to 76.6 per cent and a sharper decline last year to 74.6 per cent. With the large number of alternative routes to employment now available to young people, year 12 retention rates do not provide a complete picture of where our young people are gaining relevant education and training. Certainly there is an improvement in the labour market. I imagine that the figures for February, which will be released at about this time, will show· continuing growth in'QPportunities for young people---'-as they,have in recent 'months. That· is: resulting in more young people taking up apprenticeships and other employment options. That trend is confirmed in figures showing apprenticeship commencements increasing. from 26,800 in 1993 to 33,000 la!'it year and a corresponding drop in the 15- to 19->,ear oldl-nemployment r-e. ' It is also true that fewer· ybung people appear to be repeating year 12, responding to advice from the government, repeated by me on a number of occasions; that repeating year 12 is unlikely to produce the kind of improvement in results that some year 12 repeaters seem to be expecting. Fewer young people are repeating year 12; instead, they are taking up opportunities in T AFE .and employment,as the government has been encouraging them to do. This has also had an effe-t on sch<;lol retention. A technical factor which would be 'of interest to the honourable member for Ballarat is that more young people these days are choosing to study year 12 on apart-time rather than a full-time basis and those students are not counted by the ABS for retention purposes if they are studying part time. The patterns are interesting on a state by state basis. In Victoria, for example, between 1992 and 1994 retention fell by 3.8 per cent as opposed to a national fall of 2.5 per cent. As I mentioned yesterday, New South Wales has the lowest retention rate of any mainland state. This is a reasonable illustration of Liberal policy in action. This is a reasonable illustration of what would happen were the policies advanced by the honourable member for Ballarat put in action. As a result, in those two Liberal states you see that very poor performance. In his own state, his colleagues in state government having closed 271 government schools and sacked over 8,000 teachers, it is not surprising that one should see falls of the kind I have mentioned in school retention. It is reasonably difficult to expect young people to continue on at school if at the same time you are ;closing their schools.: . i , ,. J i , , .. : On the matter 'of supplementation, which is the honOurable member' raised,it true that the government considered this matter very carefully, as it' well 'might, given that the index ofave'rage governmentschbol recurrent cost rose by 5.1 'per cent ih the most recent period. That required a considerable amount of money to supplement school funding, some $133 million thisy,ear. The government did consider its' position very carefully. because the origioal intent jon ,of the policy to. index $chools funding by average government school recurrent cost was intended .to . link quality improvemepts from the government sector. to the flow of funds, to schools in general and to· the non-government sector in particular. . A figure of 5.1 pet cent at a time when inflation was very low at 1:7 per centobviously provided food for thought for - the government, particularly given that the most significant contributing factor to the ,5.1 per cent increase in costs was a blow-out' in Victoria. That was the year in which the Victorian government sacked those teachers and paid out around $180 million in redundancy payments. The Commonwealth found it fairly difficult to accept that an increase in expenditure that involved sacking teachers could be. linked to a quality index, which was the point of the origina,I policy. The Commonwealth took. time to consider. its position and it decided that the original undertaking would stand and, as a result, many schools in all sectors will this year get the benefit of that additional $133 million in supplementation. . The honourable member for Ballarat spent some time on the government's decision to undertake a review of the new schools policy in the non-government sector. This review signals, first of all, a continuing commitment by this government to the orderly development of viable non-government schools. It also provides .us with the opportunity for a comprehensive review of a policy which is almost 10 years old. It is very rare-the honourable member for Ballarat may not be aware of this-for- ·a policy to be in place for that long and not be subject to a review, particularly a program of this size that has been operating for almost 10 years and involving expenditure of well over $1 - billion in the non-government sector. While the policy has undergone some changes over that period, it has certainly not been subject to any in-depth examination of its operation. The review is certainly timely because the last 10 years have seen major changes in the school education environment. I have mentioned that year 12 retention rates have more than doubled, so the school population in the post-compulsory years is very different in 1995 from the position a decade ago. Schools these days are increasingly becoming providers of vocational education, information technology is also having its impact, and other interesting structural developments are appearing. For example, there are developments which promote links between the various sectors. In Coffs Harbour an education precinct was recently opened which involves the co-location of a campus of the Southern Cross University, aTAFE college and a government high school, sharing facilities and promoting movement between the sectors. A similar kind of development is planned for the site of the former HMAS Nirimba in Sydney, which again will involve a campus of a university, a large TAFE presence, a government secondary school and a Catholic secondary school, to allow for the opportunity to share resources and generally an enriched educational environment. As well, there are examples around the country of links between the systems. For example, at Golden Grove in South Australia we have co-located a government high school, a Catholic high school and a Uniting Church high school, which are sharing some specialist facilities. It is not unreasonable to say that we ought to look at the new schools policy and see whether it promotes these kinds of developments as well as it might and see whether changes are needed. There certainly has been a high level of interest in the review amongst stakeholders from a variety of quarters. It provide stakeholders with an opportunity to discuss issues concerning new schools which they have raised from time to time-for example, whether the minimum enrolment requirement ought to take into account where a school is located and whether the same minimum enrolment requirements should apply in rur/il and remote areas as apply in the capital cities. The review could provide a view on whether the policy is flexible enough to take into account the benefits that can flow from a whole range of developments that people really were not thinking about 10 years ago. It is in that spirit-and, frankly, underpinned by my basic belief that the new schools policy has served the country well but that now is the time to look at ways in which we might be able to make it work better-that the review will proceed. I notice from his press release of Tuesday that the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Ballarat, wants to scrap the new schools policy altogether. The opposition believes in providing funding for every new non-government school which opens, regardless of its prospects for future viability and regardless of its impact on existing schools in the region. One really has to question whether the position adopted by the opposition is a sensible use of education dollars, given that they are the same people who have accused this government from time to time of waste and duplication. I can say to the honourable member for Ballarat that I have found no significant stakeholders in the education area who agree with the position he has adopted. Why should they? They would be faced with a position where non-government schools would come and go in the free market world of coalition education policy. One could then reasonably ask, 'What happens to the students attending a school which does not offer a sufficient range of subjects, becomes non-viable and then closes?' It is an interesting approach by the opposition. The opposition has frequently been accused of lacking policy-that side being a policy free zone. On a number of will occasions I have criticised the honourable member for Ballarat and his predecessors for their lack of policy. On this occasion, J have to admit that I am wrong. They have a policy in this area. Their policy is that they will have a policy. They want to abolish the new schools policy altogether. I hope the honourable member for Ballarat will make a submission to the inquiry if he feels so moved. Perhaps opposition members are finding it a little too hard. Perhaps they are finding that the challenges presented by the changing educational environment which I have described are too demanding to be able to frame a coherent approach aimed at providing quality education for all Australian students. The honourable member for Ballarat accused the government of strangling growth in the non-government sector. I think he ought to be aware that in this year, in 1995, there are around 2,500 non-government schools in this country and that over the decade the share of total enrolments in the non-government sector has increased from 25.8 per cent in 1985 to 28.5 per cent in 1994. This growth in enrolments is hardly indicative of a policy which is strangling growth. The honourable member for Ballarat is terribly interested about the timing of the review. I can tell him that the review will have sufficient time to do its job properly and to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to make submissions and be consulted in the progress of the review. I will certainly not be instructing the review to hasten its work. It is an important review of a policy which has been in place for almost 10 years. If the member for Ballarat thinks that he can dictate the review timetable and rush its work, he will be sadly mistaken. In closing I should say something about literacy, because the honourable member for Ballarat did. It is true that the government through this bill is devoting additional resources to early literacy and that it has been very pro-active in the field over the years with a great deal of success. I would be the first to admit that the work we have done in literacy has not been completely successful. It is impossible to ever say that. Certainly in the case of the honourable member for Ballarat it has been less than a complete success. I note that his press release of Tuesday still has punctuation errors, although there are not fewer than in early releases. He· should· be very careful of where he puts the apostrophe in the word 'its'. . Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Ronaldson's amendment) stand part of the question.

45,Mr RONALDSON,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"These amendments relate to grants to the states. I need to bring the attention of the House to a matter that occurred yesterday and which should be of enormous concern to this House. It is in relation to a response from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) to a question by the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland). I will be interested to hear the minister's comments on what I am about to say. I assume he will follow with an apology to this House and to the Victorian government. In answer to the member for Macarthur's question yesterday about state funding in Victoria, the minister stated that Victoria's spending was well below the per student Australian average. The minister is obviously unaware of the difference between per capita and per student. To malign the Victorian government in the way he has done in relation to its spending was a total misrepresentation of the facts. The $538 that the minister referred to was indeed the standardised averfigures age, the per capita average, for Australia. bore no relation to per student spending and therefore the minister's allegation that the Victorian government had reduced its per document. student funding to schools and was now at the bottom of the pile is totally incorrect and a gross misrepresentation of the true position. Let us look at the true situation in relation to per capita funding and use the minister's figure of $538. He was using it per student but it is a per capita figure. If we look at true standardised figures we will see that Victoria is spending well above its standardure. ised per capita amount, according to the Grants Commission. This matter was raised in the Victorian state parliament yesterday. I will read briefly from the speech, which states: Essentially what the commission does is to establish a standardised expenditure for education for various states. In doing that the commission takes into consideration a number of factors. So far Victoria is concerned it takes into consideration, example, that it is geographically densely populated than other states and has fewer problems with remoteness and isolation, its established infrastructure and the age distribution of its population. On that basis the commission's report shows that Victoria's actual spending per capita $511.18 and the commission's standardised expenditure for Victoria is $476.86. That is· a clear indication that, according to the Grants Commission, the Victorian government is spending more on education than the commission believes it should be. The minister misrepresented the position in this House yesterday. I hope he will apologise. Mr Chynoweth-What about the voluntary fees?",68
46,Mr RONALDSON,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"It is unrelated to this. You should listen because you were nodding your head in agreement and you are basically wrong. Do not show your ignorance by agreeing with what was said. It is per capita standardised expenditure which is unrelated to per student expenditure. Either the minister was unaware of the difference between per capita and per student---c-in that case he has been badly advised-or he did it deliberately. I will not say he did it deliberately, because I am sure that is not the situation, but there is an apology due. The graph representing these shows that Victoria spends 7.3 per It cent more on education, according to the Grants Commission, than it should be spending on education. I seek leave to table the Leave granted.",68
47,Mr RONALDSON,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I thank the minister. This oversight yesterday-I will put it at its best-was used as a deliberate ploy to denigrate the education system in Victoria. It was clearly wrong and bore no relevance to the the per student expenditure in Victoria which, at the end of the day, is the only relevant measI can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that per student spending in Victoria, and I quote the minister's words, 'is still significantly ahead and is above the Australian average on expenditure per pupil.' I invite the minister to the apologise for what he said yesterday, I invite as the minister to apologise to the House, and I for invite the minister to apologise to the Victorismaller and more an government.",68
48,Mr FREE,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (12.55 p.m.)-I will just make a quick response. No is apology is forthcoming because none is required. I used the figures from the Commonwealth Grants Commission report and they were correctly presented in the Hansard version of my response. I .find it fascinating that the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) has taken on the herculean task of defending the. education policies of the Kennett government. I think he really has a job ahead of him.",68
49,Mr RONALDSON,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I am actually defending the integrity of this House. I am sure the minister will be advised by his department, but yesterday he said: Five years ago, Victoria was ranked second in student spending on education and was above the Australian average. In 1993-94, Victoria was last and well below the Australian average of $538. ltis totally unrelated to per student spending. It is per capita spending-not per student. The minister does not know the difference between per capita and per student. He has quite falsely used that $538 figure as per student spending. It is patently wrong. It is a standardised per capita figure, not a per student figure. I suggest the minister should go back and get briefed by these people sitting in the advisers' box who will tell him that it is per capita and not per student and that his use of that $538 is wrong-wrong, wrong, wrong. The minister does owe an apology because that was the basis for his attack on the education system and on spending in Victoria yesterday. It is clearly wrong. It is not per student, as he said; it is per capita. It is the standardised figure. If he looks at what the Grants Commission said about the Victorian standardised figure, $418 is the appropriate figure--$476.86-whereas actual spending on a standardised basis is $511.18, well above what the Grants Commission believed was appropriate education spending in Victoria. So there is no point in the minister shaking his head; he is wrong. He does not know the difference between per capita and per student. He should go back and look at his answer. I see that he has highlighted it there. I will it again: Five years ago, Victoria was ranked second in student spending on education and was above the Australian .average.

FffiSTCORPORATELAW SIMPLIFICATION BILL 1994 Second· Reading Debate resumed from 8 February, on appropriate. motion by Mr Lavarch: That the bill be now read a second time.",69
53,Mr LAVARCH,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"in reply-This occasignificance sion marks the closure of the second reading debate on the First Corporate Law Simplificafinancial tion Bill 1994, and it follows the referral the bill to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on 8 February of this year. The government thanks the members of the committee for producing a priate report on the bill in such a timely fashion. Together with the committee, the government acknowledges the efforts of all those who provided submissions to the committee or appeared before it. The committee report deals with a number of concerns about specifed ic provisions which have been raised in the parliamentary debate on the bill or in submisand sions to the committee. I now table the government's response to the committee registers. report. In these brief remarks, I will just mention two of the main issues arising from the report: the distinction between small and large proprietary companies, and the question access to debenture registers. One of the reforms in the bill is to reduce the financial reporting requirements of small proprietary companies. The bill makes the distinction access between small and large companies for this purpose by using a three-part objective test which looks at assets, revenue and employees. The committee concluded that, on balance, it preferred the small and large test,as a basis for distinguishing· between proprietary companies, to the reporting entity concept advanced by the accounting bodies. The committee recommended that serious consideration be given to two options: namely, that the employees criteria remain, or that the employees test be deleted from the bill and the test for a small or large proprietary be on the proposed assets and turnover criteria alone. The current test in the bill is designed to achieve an approxirpate measure of the company's economic significance. It provides a measure of flexibility which enables the test to be targeted in a manner which seems to the government to be If the bill were to be amended to rely on two criteria alone, it would become a less test of a company's economic and, accordingly, a less appropriate touchstone for the application of corporate reporting requirements. Having said of that, I advise that the government has noted carefully the committee's comments on these criteria and will keep them under review. If the employees criteria proves to be inapproin practice, the government will certainly be prepared to re-examine the issue. The bill contains important new safeguards to protect the privacy of debenture holders and of other securities holders whose details are shown in registers. The committee provida full opportunity for both the representatives of the Australian Finance Conference members of the simplification task force to discuss the rules in the bill on debenture The committee has not proposed any change to the new protections included in the bill. However, it has recommended that an additional provision should be inserted to give the of ASC the same power of exemption as it key presently has. The government acknowledges that there are points to be made-both for and against-providing additional restrictions on to debenture registers, but it has decided to accept the committee's view that the ASC should be able to provide such restrictions as it might consider necessary. I thank all members who contributed to this debate. The debate was actually conducted some weeks ago in the House, and the matter was then referred to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities; The committee report was a useful addition to the debate. I thank everyone involved. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill is important legislation. The government will be moving some amendments during the consideration in detail stage. .

The first two proposed am-ndQ1ents c.oncern schedule 6 of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1994, which provides for the introduction of the concept·of penalty units into the Corporations Law.

It is proposed to amend the commencement provisions of schedule 6 by amending subsection 2(2) of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1994. Schedule 6 will now commence on the day on which the First omit Corporate Law Simplification Bill· receives royal assent. Because the bill contains a number of penalties which are expressed in terms of penalty units, the government conit necessary to amend the Corporations Amendment Legislation Act in this way. The. third proposed amendment to the bill arises because of a changed section reference in the law. The Corporations Legislation on Amendment Act 1994 has amended a section reference in the Corporations Law. For this reason, one of the references in the simplification bill is now incorrect.

I also present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to those amendments. .",71
55,Mr RUDDOCK,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Berowra) (1.09 p.m.)As we are considering alI the amendments of together, let me say that, in relation to the work that was undertaken by the Joint Com(mittee on Corporations and Securities on the Corporate Law Simplification'Bill,the oppo:"" sition believes that the: work that has been done ,and the amendments that have resulted demonstrate the virtue of having, the' opportunity to examine important bills of this character; Matters of very real concern were raised by a number of members on this side of the House who have spoken on'the bill. As I have said on a number of occasions, it is important to recognise that it is the Sen;:tte that has undoubtedly pioneered work in relation to deliberating on legislation. I think that there are more occasions on which the committees of the House ought to be used for such purposes. The government ought to facilitate and accommodate the reference of matters to committees of this House. It not only enhances the outcome but also ensures that there does not develop a view that the only people around this place who are able to add useful comments to and improve bills are senators. I think it is in interests of members of the. House of Representatives to be able to make those contributions. In this case, of course, it is the work of a joint committee, involving both senators and members of the House of Representatives. I think the value of it can be seen in the fact that the government has accepted a number of the amendments suggested by that committee, in addition to a number of its technical amendments. To go to the matter that we are discussing-the matter of the reporting entity test versus the test proposed in the bill-the distinction between small and large proprietary companies which will replace the current distinction between exempt and nonexempt companies was the subject of some public comment while the bill was being considered. The Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society ofCPAs came out strongly in favour of the reporting entity test. On balance, the committee concluded that the test proposed in the bill should be adopted, as the reporting entity test does not provide a test of sufficient certainty. The committee was further advised that the distinction made by the bill reflects overseas practice and experienceThere was a question as to whether the criteria proposedin the bill for distinguishing between small and large companies should be adopted in whole or in part. The test proposes that a company move from a sman company to large company when it meets two .of the following three criteria: more than 50 employees;gross operating revenue of more than $10 m-llion; or assyts of more than $5. million. The committee considered thaftestsof assets and turnover were more important than tests in relation to number of employees. While the committee was riot able to reach an unqualified view on the test, and believes the Attorney-General e Mr Lavarch), should give serious consideration to whether the 50 employees criteriii should be kept or should be deleted, leaving only the tests on assets and turnover, the government, in its response, indicated that it saw ,the present proposal as the being sufficiently flexible to ensure that the test was targeted in a manner which, to the government, seemed to be appropriate. But the government made it quite clear, in the Attorney-General's report: Having' said that, the Government has noted' carefully the committee's comments on these criteria and. will keep them under review. If the employees criteria proves to be inappropriate in practice, the Government will certainly be prepared to re-examine the issue. We welcome that commitment. I have mentioned it because we see it as a genuine comm.tment on the government's part and, if that further examination were required, we would expect that to occur. In relation to the other matters, the only important issue that I would like to advert to is the issue of having the register of debenture holders made public. It was a matter that caused some controversy and debate. Privacy is important. Various companies argued that the provisions could give an unfair advantage to banks, .n particular, as such information, in their hands, is not publicly available. (Time expired)",71

57,Mrs MOYLAN,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I share some concerns that my colleague the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) expressed when he spoke on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994. My concerns relate to schedule 4, division SA, subsection (2). This is one of the· aspects of this bill that has received only general support. In fact, the committee's report says on page 17 at 2.37: The committee has been unable to reach an qualified view on the testthis is to do with the test for large and small companiesand believes that the Attorney-General should serious consideration to two options, namely the 50 employees criteria remain, or that the test more than 50 employees be deleted from the and the test for a small/large proprietary company be on the proposed assets and turnover criteria. I am disappointed and concerned that this section has not had greater consideration. The committee was advised by the corporate law simplification task force that, on the basis statistics provided by the ASC, 98 per cent proprietary companies would fall within the their business. small category and that it would be only two per cent of Australian companies that might get caught out having to report when it is necessary and having to do a full audit report at a high cost of somewhere between $10,000 to $30,000, according to the accounting which profession. So this subclause which addresses the distinction between small and large proprirequirements. etary companies callously disregards the one to two per cent of small and medium sized enterprises which will be disadvantaged by the introduction of this bill in the House today. I am disappointed about that. It is very ject. easy for us to throw figures around like one and two per cent, but when we consider that there are almost 800,000 small businesses in this country that means that 10,000 to 15,000 businesses stand to be disadvantaged by the measure in this bill. That is not good enough. As far as I am concerned, it is a fairly lier approach. There is no reason for this become a problem. There are other ways to deal with this issue. I think it does away with the whole spirit of what this bill is all that is, simplifying the Corporations Law. reason we want to see simplification of corporation law and other laws in relation to small business is to reduce the cost for small business of doing business and improve the profitability of small busine-s, and this simply does not address that issue. The committee stated in its findings, conclusions and recommendations, on page 33, paragraph 4.3, that the committee has been unable to reach an unqualified view. The unmembers were not able to totally agree. I do not think that the committee fully appreciated or understood the impact that this might have and the fact that that one to two per cent give translates into a very large number of small that businesses and affects quite a number of of people. One has to ask: who is responsible for bill law making in this country-the elected representatives of this place or the bureaucrats? While I appreciate that the bureaucrats make a powerful and very important contribution to the work of this House, ultimately we are the people's representatives and we are of out there understanding day to day the diffiof culties that people confront as they go about The flow-on effect of these tests will be to not increase the complexity of the law for this group of people; to increase the amount of paperwork and financial reporting required, no-one is going to be interested in; and to increase the cost to small businesses involved through the cost of unnecessary audit As I said, it could cost anything from $10,000 to $30,000. This will have the potential to needlessly increase small business costs by millions of dollars. That is not the aim of the corporate law simplification proI have had a letter this morning from one of the accounting bodies making the comment that the adverse implications that would flow from the implementation of the size test are that some small companies will escape their reporting obligations; some large companies cavawill be required to needlessly prepare acto counts; additional costs will be needed to identify business size; the overturning of the accounting standard for the reporting entity aboutthat was developed by the Australian AcThe counting Standards Board over a period of five years through a rigorous process more complex than the simplification process; it conflicts with the Corporations Law; and simplification simply has not been achieved.",74
58,Mr RUDDOCK,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I will just pick up where I left off. I should have perhaps asked for the matters to be considered separately and then I would not have been interrupted in quite this way. If I can conclude the comments I was making on particularly the debenture matter, we are of the view that, the government having accepted that the ASC should be able to provide restrictions on access to venture registers and an amendment having been moved, it was worthy of support and it will have our support, as I indicated earlier. One of the other matters that I wanted to advert to briefly, which was picked up by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), was that of the single member companies as proposed under the bill. It would eliminate the silent director who is often the spouse and is often jointly responsible for company failure, even though they may not have been fully involved. That title 'sexually transmitted debt' was something that we had noted as well. In relation to auditors of proprietary companies, while less stringent requirement for appointment of auditors was of concern to the accounting bodies consulted, the committee accepted that that did not require amendment to the bill; rather, that the problem would be addressed by the accounting working party set up under the simplification process. As the government has given a guarantee that the working party will give full consideration to that issue, we welcome that undertaking. I understand that the government has accepted the recommendation from the committee that the inclusion of a small business guide should be reviewed by the Attorney-General after it has been in operation for a reasonable time. In relation to preparation of final financial reports and the recommendation that the ASC should prepare quarterly reports to the Attorney-General stating its reason for requiring small proprietary companies to prepare accounts, the government has indicated it will raise that matter with the chairman. That is a response that we have noted as well. There were other minor amendments, as outlined by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), and they do not present any difficult to us.",75
59,Mr LAVARCH,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I thank all members for their contribution. I think the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and what it attempts to do is pretty strongly supported by both sides of the parliament. The honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) is a fairly harsh taskmaster when it comes to her particular criticisms. Obviornly, when we move from a system which is in place to a new system of distinguishing between large and small companies and the sorts of requirements we put on both, some companies which are now enjoying the status of being an exempt proprietary company will be picked up and deemed to be large. But the test does very much target companies in terms of their economic significance. If a company has two of the three requirements-50 employees, an annual turnover of $10 million, and assets of $5 million-it is a relatively large and important commercial concern. I do not know whether it is unreasonable for the community to expect a somewhat more stringent level of disclosure in terms of the financial position and activities of those companies than for the vast majority which will get very great benefit out of this bill. The figures have been put at 98 per cent to two per cent, so it is the vast majority who are getting a much greater benefit. That is why the bill has been very warmly received by the small business community, at least as far as the views that have been expressed to me are concerned. There will be a small number affected. I do not know whether it is the 15,000 figure. That would be 15,000 companies which probably have more than 50 employees, but they would have to have 50 employees plus meet one of the other two tests as well. So I think it would actually be a figure somewhat less than that. The other matter which the honourable member for Pearce raised was the reporting entity concept which the accounting bodies are very attached to and have been for some years and which they promote very strongly. In fairness, one has to say that the vast balance of views of people in this areaparticularly the lawyers, in terms of the Law Council of Australia, and other advisers concerned with how these things can be made to work in a practical sense-is that the reporting entity concept is not a practical one to put into operation. If we are not now talking about a program, like it or not, the three criteria are at least fairly straightforward and simple and companies willlrnow whether they fall within it or not. The reporting entity concept is a far vaguer concept and, though it has some attractions, in my view and, indeed, in the view of the committee, the proposed tests are the way to go. These are new changes. It is a new area of law and we are trying some innovative things. As I have indicated, the government will review these changes very closely; We want to try to benefit, and get cost reductions for, business. We want innovative reforms that actually work. Therefore, we will watch this legislation very closely. If it is not working, if there are problems, if the thresholds are impacting on much larger numbers of companies in an adverse way, or if it is not in the public interest for the information to come out, we will change it. We are really trying to do a positive thing here. Mrs Moylan-How many years has it taken to get this bill up?",75
60,Mr LAV ARCH,AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Two years, I suppose, since I have been Attorney-General. This was one of my major projects in terms of the simplification of the Corporations Law and it is relatively well advanced. The second stage will come out in a second bill in July. It will mean that, within probably another 18 months or so, the core provisions of the entire Corporations Law would have been rewritten. Quite honestly, I do not know if that is a bad achievement, given the complexity of what we were starting with. I thank members for their contributions and support. This is a good bill, and I commend the amendments to the House. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Lavarch)-by leave-read a third time. NA (TRANSMITTER LICENCE TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Cognate bills: NA (RECEIVER LICENCE TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 NA NA 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 March, on motion by Mr Elliott: That the bill be now read a second time.",76
61,Mr LEO MCLEAY,COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL,"Watson) (1.33 p.m.)I am very pleased to support the amendments that are before the House and I commend the government for them. I must say at the outset that I was surprised at the rather mean spirited remarks of the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), when he was responding on behalf of the opposition to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott). The member for Goldstein seemed to think that there was something terrible in the fact that the government and the SMA had reconsidered the licensing fee that they were going to charge amateur radio operators. I will come back to that later in my contribution, but it is worthwhile putting on the record that the remarks were mean spirited. As members of parliament, rather than attacking the government for responding to people who make representations, we shoulp be commending the government and the government agency, instead of telling them that we are starting to keep a closer eye on them for doing this. These amendments will make it easier for apparatus licensees to pay their licence fees. They will now be able to make those payments annually for an apparatus licence, in instalments if they wish, and licences can be issued for a period of up to five years. That puts a little bit more certainty into these things for the licensees. Licensees will be able to have the choice of paying the total fee for the full period or paying by annual instalwhich ments. Formerly, a default in the payment of a licence fee-which was usually an up-front fee-would have resulted in the suspension cancellation of a licence. There was no scope to allow a licensee a period of grace in the payment of the fees. Often, people who needed these licences as an integral and ongoing part of their business could have been deprived of them through falling on hard times and suffering cash flow problems. These amendments make it a lot easier business. There are amendments which will introduce a system whereby people who default on an annual instalment will only lose their licences as a last resort. Licensees will now be able pay by instalment, paying interest on the late payment of fees and, if still in the balance of the licence fee for the entire period. As I said, the licence would only suspended or cancelled as a last resort. Those amendments to the bills are the result of a long and detailed public inquiry by Spectrum Management Agency. In 1993, in response to a report by the House of RepreThe sentatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), the government directed the Spectrum Management Agency to inquire into the restructuring of licence fees for cost recovery. The Spectrum Management Agency released a public discussion paper, held extensive public seminars and consulted the Wireless Institute of Australia and Radiocommunications Consultative Council. Over 4,000 submissions were received, and the amendments before us today are among the many key recommendations to emerge from that inquiry. The SMA plans to begin issuing five-year licences from April this year in line with the commencement of the radcom licensing computer system. It should be emphasised that these bills are intended to give apparatus licensees a choice, and give them flexibility in the way that they obtain their licences. They do not relate at all to the restructuring of the apparatus licence regime fee structure has caused some concern amongst sections of the community. As the chairman of the caucus committee on transport and communications I have or received representations expressing concern about some aspects of the SMA's draft proposal for the change to the fee structure, With a number of other government members--'-and also, I understand, some members of the opposition-I have made approaches to the government to have the proposed fee schedule re-examined. Rather than the mean spirited for way in which the member for Goldstein addressed this, I would like to commend the Spectrum Management Agency and the parliamentary secretary, because I am pleased to see that the SMA has further considered to the level of fees to be applied to amateurs in the light of the public benefit that amateurs default, pay provide to the community. A lower overall fee is now proposed by the be SMA in view of the training and the experience in communications technology that amateurs provide to young people, and the the role that amateurs provide in maintaining communication links in times of emergency. SMA has quite rightly decided to reduce the tax component of the licence fee to the minimum level. This will reduce the fee from the proposed $71 to $51 per annum. The fee would be applied to all amateur licences. While $51 represents a small increase on fees paid for many years by amateurs, the new fee is based on the administration and maintenance services provided to this group by the with SMA and includes the cost of issuing the the licences, managing interference to their services, issuing and registering call signs, accrediting examinations, and representing amateurs' interests in the international negotiations that the government carries on from time to time. It also represents a reduction of $20 from the draft fee which was proposed prior to the most recent round of consultations. While there are social benefits of amateur radio, the fee set at $51 represents more than fair value for their access to and ongoing use of large amounts of radio frequency spectrum. The important thing is that this reduction in the fee has not been shifted onto others, J because the change in the level of amateur fees will not be offset by an increase in the fees paid by other radiocommunications licensees. I think the parliamentary secretary and the SMA should be commended for· taking into account the work that amateurs do, both in times of national emergencies and in providing a very useful network that the community as a whole can take advantage of. People might recall that, during the bushfires in Sydney last year, people in the amateur radio area were involved in helping the State Emergency Service people. I think it was proper and reasonable for the government to take cognisance of the representations that were made, and it was proper and reasonable for the SMA to reflect that element in the fees that it charged. The changes to the fees for amateur radio operators are part of the broader change to apparatus licences. The fee structure proposal is just one of the results of the inquiry that the SMA conducted for all users of the radio frequency spectrum, not just amateur radio users. The government's objective is to establish an efficient and equitable means of managing this vital national resource. It is a resource that all Australians ought to share in, through the licensing of the spectrum. The changes to apparatus licences are designed to reduce the number of categories of licences, and to provide for a more equitable distribution of the charges that are already made for the use of the spectrum. The proposals put forward by the Spectrum Management Agency suggest fees based on a combination of the costs of administration and the value of the part of the spectrum being used. This method of charging is in line with the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, in which both the government and the opposition participated. Up until now, as honourable members would know, fees and categories of licensed radiocommunication equipment have developed in an ad hoc fashion, over time, with little relationship between the fees charged the spectrum used and the value of that spectrum. The cost to the Commonwealth of the administration and use of the public resource of the radio frequency spectrum should be reflected clearly in the pricing structure. That was one of the key findings of the public inquiry. Using this method, fees for some categories may rise, while some fees will fall. However, it should be stressed that no overall variation in revenue is being proposed. Fee concessions will be available to non-profit voluntary apparatus licensees who are primarily providing safety or human life services, such as rural firefighting and sea rescue. In broad terms, local governments and state governments could expect to benefit from the restructuring of the fees. Small businesses, such as taxi services and paging services, are also likely to see fee reductions. The government is fully aware of the concern-a concern, I might add, which has been preyed on by some opposition members, such as Senator Alston-that the proposed restructuring might result in higher fees being charged for amateur operators. They will be higher, but they will not be as high as was proposed, for the reasons that I outlined before. It is unfortunate that some people have been misleading the public by comparing the suggested fees for amateurs with the fees for CB radio operators, who are now covered by a class licence. It is a very unfair proposition, which is being put forward by some people in the community, to say that CB operators will have a very low one-off fee but amateur radio operators will have a higher fee. It should be made clear that CB and amateur operators are utilising quite different services, which both the government and international organisations provide. The CB users occupy very limited amounts of the spectrum, and they do not require any sort of frequency coordination. They can cut across each other and no-one can complain. There is no responsibility carried by the Spectrum Management Agency for interference investigation within the two bands subject to CB licences. The Spectrum Management for Agency's activities with regard to CB licences are confined to resolving interference by CB operators to other services, and investigating complaints of abusive or offensive language. On the other hand, amateur licensees generally occupy a part of the radio frequency spectrum that is highly sought after byalternative users. In Australia, they have access to 44 blocks of spectrum in 23 different bands. That is well above that available in most other countries, and very dramatically different from the amount of spectrum available to CB operators. Amateurs receive other services from the SMA, such as regular consultations with the Wireless Institute on variations and additions to spectrum availability. The SMA also represents amateurs' interests at international councils. If amateur operators were required to negotiate on their own behalf, they would have to bear a very heavy expense, and it would certainly cost a lot more than the extra $20 by which the licence fee has been increased. Amateur operators should remember that the SMA recently negotiated international licensing requirements on behalf of Australian amateur operators at no additional direct cost to them, other than the increase in their licence fee. The SMA also arranges and accredits examinations conducted by the Wireless Institute and provides comprehensive interference investigation for operators. That is an entirely different level of service from that provided to the gabble on the two CB bands. As I said earlier, amateur licensees sometimes assist in emergencies and provide their service as a public benefit. The government has recognised that by reducing some of the costs to amateur operators. However, there are many other radiocommunications users who also provide these services in emergencies, while continuing to pay very significant fees. However, the amendments today will facilitate a degree of flexibility in the radiocommunications licensing area that was not there before. That will be good for small business operators, it will be good for state and local authorities, and the reduction will be good for amateur radio operators. I commend the bill to the House and, in doing so, commend the parliamentary secretary for his responsiveness to calls from members on this side of the House and others for a sympathetic response to the plight of amateur operators. Many amateur operators are retired people. Others are disabled people who have taken this on as a way of communicating with the rest of the world, while housebound by their disability. Thus the government has helped business, local authorities and the amateur operators who put a lot of hard work in for the community.  specified by· the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) in his second reading speech, the main purpose of these amendments is to assist the implementation of a new apparatus licensing system, which has resulted from a public inquiry by the Spectrum Management Agency. It is important that, prior to making changes to the scheme that has governed radiocommunications in this country, we consider very carefully the role played by amateur radio operators in the industry and, more importantly, in the wider community, and how this bill may impact on them. Some 20,000 amateur radio operators in Australia provide a free community service, particularly in time of national disaster and emergency. After Cyclone Tracy, all communications with Darwin were provided by amateur radio networks. The Wireless Institute's civil emergency network, which is provided by amateur operators, is used during bushfires, floods and other disasters in New South Wales. The United States of America and many other countries recognise the value of amateur radio operators by issuing free licences, while Australian operators must pay one of the highest fees in the world. The Spectrum Management Agency planned to impose a tax on the radio spectrum used by amateurs by more than doubling the fee charged from $35 to $71. I am pleased to hear that the government has now backed away from that, and the in fees fee is now to increase to $51. The argument used by the SMA was that amateurs should be taxed according to the amount of spectrum they use. That argument does not hold water. The spectrum is fixed by international treaty, and the SMA has little say over the matter. It could not reallocate most of the amateur frequencies to commercial interests even if it wanted to. My understanding, after taking the time to talk to amateur operators in my electorate, is that the world is divided basically into three broad divisions for the purpose of management of the amateur radio spectrum as agreed by international treaty. It is in the Oceania division that Australia sits for the purpose of management. And it is management that we are talking about here today. What has been introduced is a new scheme of management for the spectrum, a scheme of fees categorised by either a spectrum maintenance charge or a spectrum access tax. The interesting point to note here is that the spectrum access tax is more of a spectrum denial fee. Primary spectrum users deny spectrum to other users and thus the charge of this fee or tax. This is okay if there is an alternative user for the spectrum, but in the spectrum allocated to amateur users the Spectrum Management Agency has no say on its use other than for amateur radio. The use of the spectrum for amateur radio is fixed by international treaty and thus is binding on Australia. I could, of course, go on to make comment on this government's almost blind adherence to every treaty that has ever come into existence, but I will refrain from that. What I do find hard to swallow is the tale that the government should be trying to tax the use of amateur spectrum on the basis of exclusion when it has no mandate or authority in any manner to allow any use for that particular spectrum other than amateur use. As to these spectrums, many are fixed as exclusively amateur worldwide and are of no commercial value to Canberra. Most of the others are already assigned to commercial or government primary users and to amateurs as secondary. Once again, the SMA cannot vary the amateur usage because that is covered by international treaty. On another point, there are some 300,000 CB radio operators in Australia. They do not have to pass an examination, yet the amateur radio operators have to pass three exams at a 70 per cent pass level in order to gain. a certificate. Some CB operator- use their stations and repeaters for business, while amateur radio operators are forbidden to do so by law. The licence fee for CB operators has been abolished. The question has to be asked: why should amateur radio operators have to pay when CB users do not? The distinct role and position of the amateur radio operator as a competent professional and a controlled operator is very clear. I recently visited amateur radio operators VK6 VX, VK6 VHI and VK6 XX in Albany in Western Australia and I was impressed with the lise that is now being made of computers linked into amateur radio networks, in particular the ability of these amateurs to operate programs which not only show the track of satellites, including the one that I observed of a Russian space station passing over Albany at the time, but also are able to communicate with those stations. Both NASA and the Russian authorities have recognised the value of the amateur radio network by incorporating those links into the space station and shuttle programs. On a more important note, I was able to see the message traffic that was generated out of the Kobe earthquake disaster, straight after that terrible earthquake struck that city. The residents of that city would no doubt have been thankful that the amateur radio network was in place to pass their cries for help worldwide. We have a situation under this scheme where one of the ongoing effects will be to double the user fee for our amateur radio operators. Coming from an electorate of over 28,000 square kilometres, I recognise the true value of the amateur radiocommunication network. The government should reconsider its position on amateur radio operators and recognise the immense value of their work in the community and not impose this increase to this particular area. Indeed, as I mentioned, the government really should look at the huge value of the amateur radio operators to the community.",76
62,Mr FORREST,COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL,"Here we 'have another example of this government's propensity to tax the community of Australia with absolutely no mandate whatsoever. We have these bills before us today, with titles which all include the word 'taxes'; the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill, the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill, and the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill. It seems that this government has an unbelievable preoccupation with tax, trying to satisfy an insatiable thirst for revenue. There is a suggestion that everything that moves, and sometimes even everything that dies, amendment to that. should be taxed; and not only taxed here, but taxed at a whole variety of different points. I have spent 20 months in this parliament, Mr Deputy Speaker; and given what I remember of the March 1993 election, I would say that if this government has any mandate whatsoand ever it is not to increase taxes. But here have another example of its preoccupation. The government is so preoccupied with taxing that it wants to tax hobbies. I have noted that the government has responded to what has been a fairly massive degree of representation, and I have noted most members have received letters from been persons within their own electorates who are amateur and ham radio operators. think the government can take too much credit for reducing a proposed increase in its tax on amateur radio operators. All it has done is to reduce it by $20. It is still an increase in a tax on a hobby. I can appreciate that there are other ments, and that the purpose of this legislation is to enable some flexibility in the payment annual licence instalments. There may be some merit in that, and to that extent the coalition is not opposing these bills. However, my namesake, the honourable member for find  government to reconsider its intent to tax group of Australians who make a contribution exercise. to our community. I would like to take the opportunity later to demonstrate that it valuable contribution. The government ought to consider what it might cost a government to provide the sorts of resources in terms public safety and contribution to public events that are provided by ham and amateur radio operators. Indeed, when it is considered that the annual revenue from licence renewals is something around $100 million per year, it is clear that it is already a significant source of revenue for the government, so I was particularly annoyed to see the Spectrum Management Agency proposing initially to double licence fees. I was at least somewhat relieved to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott), when he introduced these bills, say that there has been some The Spectrum Management Agency currently supervises about 250,000 radio licences. The fees for these have in the past varied from $18 a year for smaller marine licences for CB and VHF operators to some huge we amounts for multiple public mobile telecommunication services, fees for which often amount to several hundreds of dollars--even $700,000 per year on big installations. I want to address the assistance that is provided by amateur radio operators, particularly in emergency situations. The support that they provide to community organisations has a consistent part of their ethos, and has been promoted by radio operators as part of I do not that ethos for decades. One of the other valuable contributions-I have a notable number of international radio operators in my own electorate-is the contribution they make to the worldwide promotion of goodwill because of their community and eleinternational communications. I have been informed by some of them that, when they of have made comments about this increase to some of their international corresponders via the radio spectrum, other amateur operators in other countries are completely surprised to that this country wants to introduce such a dramatic increase in fees. I think it ought to a be labelled as a cynical revenue raising I note that the previous speaker, the memis a ber for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), called us cynical and mean spirited in the contributions that we have already made to this debate. The of only mean spirited people that the community of Australia ought to be alerted to are those who occupy the government benches. It is unbelievably mean spirited of them to tax community and amateur operators out there who, as I have said, provide such a valuable contribution to this community. The Radiocommunications Act 1992 made provision for people such as community amateur radio operators because it included 'adequate provision for use by public or community services'. The act also requires' a responsive and flexible approach to meeting the needs of users'. The substantial increase in licence fees causes me great concern because of its inconsistency with existing provisions of the act. From that I formed my own conclusion about what a cynical tax raising exercise this is turning out to be. None of my corresponders are encouraged by the government's recent announcements that the amount of the increase is to be reduced. They still maintain that, as amateur radio operators who provide a valuable communication facility to train personnel in what is an important area of communications, their role should be recognised. As the member for Forrest said, I would urge this government to reconsider that particular part of the legislation because it is completely unfair. I see no justification whatsoever in taxing this particular narrow group of people who are confined by the fact that they are a captive audience because they have fixed locations which are easy to find and, therefore, easily sourced for taxation revenue increases.  is VK 3PM, was one of my corresponders. I would like to quote parts of his letter to me in order to make his complaint part of the public record. He introduces his letter by referring to the proposed changes by the Spectrum Management Agency. He then says: Amateur radio is a recreational and educational ""hobby"" pursued by a wide range of people in our community. Amateur Radio is of immense benefit to the community. There are many instances where it has played crucial and important part in providing emergency communications where civil and military systems have been unable to perform. He then provides examples of communications with respect to Cyclone Tracy in Darwin, recent bushfires in many of our states and past earthquakes in New South Wales. He goes on: It is a hobby that produces effective selftraining in technology. Many young people graduate to a career in electronics having had their ambitions developed through such an interest. The Scouts and Guides movements of Australia have many stations used in training of their youth. There is immense social value in a recreational hobby particularly suited to handicapped persons and also senior citizens. I continue to quote from Mr Milne's letter. He states: The Amateur Radio Service provides a ready pool of trained personnel available for service to the country ... I would emphasise just how important the contribution of amateur radio operators is in rural areas, especially in an area like mine which is 70,000 square kilometres, one-quarter of the north-west of Victoria. The letter c()ntinues: Australian Amateur radio operators are among the world leaders in development of new technology and have recently made significant contributions to research in areas such as satellite technology and radio propagation studies. The hobby provides a valuable service in development of international relations. There are many more positive aspects that could be mentioned. He sought my support to have the proposed fee increases rescinded. He has that support, and he has the support of all of us on this side of the House. It is quite clear that in terms of amateur radio the government ought to have made more appropriate allowances. Mr Milne's letter refers to some of the community benefits of amateur radio, but there are many others which are impossible to measure in dollar terms. You could not measure in dollar terms the benefit of amateur community radio. Therefore, I find it unbelievable that the government would let its insatiable thirst for revenue override such a benefits and that it would propose a cost to services when it has not even considered what it would cost the government to provide such services. I would like to draw attention to a particuincrease lar, huge community event that occurs in my electorate. It is the Murray River marathon. The marathon starts as far upstream the Murray River as Albury and ends in Swan Hill, which is the city in which I reside. The role that amateur radio and the communication networks play that ensures the community and public safety of that event is just one example of which I am already aware of the benefit of amateur radio operators. If we get back to the more particular focus of this legislation, like many other pieces legislation brought to this House, it is .all about tax-for goodness sake, tax it; tax it it moves! Fuel tax is an unbelievable impost that affects everything we do, particularly those in rural Australia. I am reminded government's obfuscation during its last election campaign when it had those TV advertisements with cash registers popping at the sight of a tube of toothpaste showing extra 15 per cent tax. That was a complete obfuscation of the truth, and it completely overlooked the fact that the government's policy was to remove seven taxes and have only one fair and balanced tax. So, if government has any mandate, it is not to increase taxes. Tax it if it dies! Every year in pre-budget deliberations, we hear about death duties inheritance tax. Tax it if it burns! We recently heard intonations from the government that it wanted to introduce a carbon tax. Thankfully considered. that was knocked on the head. It would have imposed more on-costs to business in this country. Tax it if you sell it-wholesale sales tax! Tax it again if you buy it! The dramatic increases we have seen in the last 20-odd months in wholesale sales tax completely surpass anything we had originally proposed or intended with the goods and services tax. Tax it if it gains value-a capital gains tax! Now we hear suggestions that if it sleeps it will be taxed-a bed tax. What an imposition that is going to be on the valuable industry of this nation. When it comes to amateur radio, I think it is outrageous and completely unfair. The government ought to reconsider. It has given some reconsideration, but I think it ought not at all this particular component of amateur radio. My understanding of taxation is that tax ought to be levied on a profit or a likely profit. I remind the government that licence by regulation would prohibit amateur radio operators having a profit. So how could taxing it be right? Tax on the use of radio spectrum, which is already set aside by international convention for amateur radio, does not occur in any other country. So it is completely unfair, unjust and flies in the face of of practice in other countries. From what I hear, we are already something of a laughing if stock in the international communities in which amateur radio communicates. No other country in the world levies such a tax on their of the amateur radio operators. Is the government really aware of the size of the group it wants to antagonise by the up introduction of this tax and the powerful an communication facility they have available to communicate a message about the lack of mandate this government has to tax them? last Currently, there are about 18,000 amateur radio operators and, internationally, their this numbers are measured in miIIions-a huge communication network. They have powerful radiocommunications at their disposal-they talk a lot. As I said, already international and reaction is not favourable on this government's intent to tax them. This particular aspect of this legislation has been grossly iIIAgain, because amateur radio operators are a registered minority, they are an easy target. I refer again to Mr Milne's letter where he asks for my support to see what I can do about ensuring that these increases are not imposed. In his letter he says: I require your support towards action to have the proposed fees rescinded and another more suitable approach taken. We would consider it an excellent result if we were granted licences free of charges as is the case in the United States where the community, education and recreational value of tourist Amateur Radio is highly valued. I assure Mr Milne that I do oppose this unjust form of tax. The government ought not hide behind its statement that this legislation is all about a positive gesture of allowing greater flexibility in the payment of radio licence charges. I recognise and support professional and large radio licence operators having their fees reduced by taking up payment options. My particular objection is that I consider amateur radio operators an important group of Australians who have a function to fulfil. The package was developed as a result public inquiry which was initiated as far back as December 1993 at the direction of the government. This package aims to respond to industry requirements resulting from that inquiry into that more flexible arrangement, so I support that aspect. The options introduced by the package coincide with a whole new licensing computing system and will therefore provide a much clearer and easier administration. At least that part to meet some of the aspirations of the indusSMA try. But nowhere in the legislation or in reading the background information do I find any justification for the 'punitive' attitudes towards amateur radio operators. I do not think they ought be used to subsidise some the gains that might be achieved for other licensed operators. I remind the government that we will every opportunity to remind them that it has no mandate to increase taxes on Australians. We bitterly oppose these arrangements and certainly take offence at a bill like this which seeks to call increases in tax revenue through licence fees 'revenue gaining exercises'. are simply taxes and they cost Australians, and we are opposed to that.",80
63,Ms HENZELL,COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL,"Capricornia) (2.14 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to contridebating-the bute to this debate on the Radiocommuniment cations (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendtus ment Bill 1994 and cognate bills. I was disappointed to hear the comments of the radio member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) who, I know, is concerned about all issues that may impact on his constituents. I believe he is not pretions. senting the full facts. I dare say that the criticism in relation to this bill goes back 18 January when the shadow minister for the communications and the arts, Senator Alston, took hlp this issue in a press release. He It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that amateur operators have the misfortune to be a disciplined, individually licensed service and, therefore, an easy target for revenue raising . . . And it goes on and on. While we all recognise the contribution made to the community by amateur radio hams, the opposition spokesperson failed to indicate that he had any idea of of what was in the report of the Spectrum ManagementAgency. He said that it indicated that there had been no consultation. The facts are at variance with that statement. Indeed, if the member for Mallee had cared to look at the information, he would have been able to new payment clarify the situation. On 8 December 1993 the then communications minister, the present Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), instituted the inquiry. seems Throughout January and February 1994, the distributed over 4,000 copies of the discussion paper to interested parties, advertised widely and then proceeded to conduct 14 public seminars attended by over 900 people. It received 422 submissions and reported its of findings to the then Minister for Communications and the Arts, the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator take Collins), at the end of May 1994. At every stage of the proceedings there was close consultation with the Institute of Wireless Operators. Indeed, it was very involved when this issue was being looked at. There is hardly a case for saying that there has been They no consultation. There has actually been widespread consultation. The general line being presented is that the whole basis of the legislation we are now report of the Spectrum ManageAgency, titled Inquiry into the apparalicence system: a new outlook---came very about because we have a down on amateur operators in this country. In fact, as is quite clear from the report, the reforms go to the whole management of radio communicaYesterday, when the Parliamentary Secreto tary to the Minister for Communications and Arts (Mr Elliott) introduced these bills, he made it clear that the licence for amateurs said: would be a flat rate of $51; the original proposal for $71 had been just that, only a proposal. The reforms are widespread and very pertinent to the handling of this area of operation. The report includes a number of recommendations. In relation to citizens band licences, there was a recommendation, adopted in October 1994, for class licences. Other recommendations include: the simplification of apparatus licence categories; arrangement for licence terms up to five years with very flexible payment arrangements---one of the key factors in the bills we are debating; the possibility of transferring apparatus licences between parties; and, very importantly, licence fee .concessions for volunteer non-profit emergency organisations, such as rural firefighters, search and rescue organisations, coastguards, surf lifesavers and ambulance services in remote areas. Then there was a definite decision to charge for a range of services provided. by the Spectrum Management Agency. Those charges are to be introduced on an equitable and transparent basis so that people can understand what the charges are for and why they are paying them. What irks me is that the opposition parties continually bleat about government charges and cutting government expenditure. But the minute there is a specific option for user pays principles, .for making sure that services are provided and that the government is accountable, they are bleating about how shocking it is that we are raising another tax. I believe this is very unfair. I am sure all other honourable members have made representations on behalf of amateur radio operators. I take the time and trouble to find out the facts. Unfortunately, it seems that some of my colleagues in the opposition-and particularly the shadow minister-have decided that it is easier to score a cheap political point than to go and make a proper investigation. The shadow minister is the person who would like to be running this area of the government. This is a wide ranging report which has a number of very positive reforms for the use of the spectrum. All the shadow minister can talk about is this one small point. No-one in this country wants to pay taxes but everybody wants services. Local amateur radio operators in my area felt this was an impost. I am sure they will be delighted with the very sensible decision made by the government. It is not about not charging them. Our amateur radio operators have done all the good things that my colleague the honourable member for Mallee suggested. I have no argument with all those good things. While the amateurs were paying limited fees for the services they received, other essential services were paying much greater charges. One of the key. benefits in these reforms is that a lot of these essential services will have a decrease in charges. That is a very sensible rationalisation. I refer to the editorial by Jim Rowe in the March 1995 edition of Electronics Australia. Mr Rowe indicated that he had lots of representations from amateur radio operators. He has taken a very responsible position. He says: Amateur licence fees haven't risen for about 10 years, even though the cost of most other goods and services have risen quite significantly in that time. Some sort of rise was probably inevitable. He goes on to say that there will be increasingly fierce competition for space in the electromagnetic spectrum. He says: In many ways this is a finite resource, and historically amateurs have accumulated quite a lot of spectrum 'real estate'. In fact I understand that in Australia, amateurs are second only to the Department of Defence in terms of their total allocation of spectrum space. He goes on further: The SMA has sought to base them clearly on the real costs of issuing and renewing licences, and also on managing each licensee's activities-together with a 'spectrum access cost' or tax, based on the perceived value of the spectrum segment(s) being used on an exclusive basis. On the whole this seems reasonable, and is in factthe kind of changes taking place in many other countries as well. This is rather interesting: The problem for amateurs is that because quite a lot of spectrum is allocated to them, applying this rationale strictly 'across the board' would result in amateur licence fees rising to well over $500 per year. If we really wanted to put in place a user pays principle, that is the sort of charge that would be allocated because, as Jim Rowe says, a significant amount of spectrum is allocated to amateur operators. The other issue that has to be taken into consideration is that, if you are going to get into this hobby, which has lots of positive spin-offs, including emergency availability when there is an accident or a major disaster-and I commend the comments of my colleague the member for Mallee in this matter-the equipment will cost you at least $2,000. It is a considerable investment for people who choose to become involved or interested in this area or hobby. Therefore, a charge of $51, or even $70, would not seem to me to be a major impost. One of the concerns brought to me that I responded to was about what appeared to be a sudden jump. Jim Rowe-and I assume he knows a great deal more about this area than I do-finishes his article by saying: It might well be prudent for amateurs to swallow hard and accept this fee rise, without much fuss. Attracting a lot of interest might cause renewed demands for some of that precious spectrum space, by potential users willing to pay a lot more privilege. That has not really been taken into consideration by some of our operators, for very wellarea, intentioned reasons, but it has also not been taken into consideration for what I would consider fairly cheap political reasons by some members of the opposition, particularly by the person who would like to be making the decisions in this area-Senator Alston. If we look at the suggested reforms licensing types, we see very clearly that this report has done a very good job. It has a very good job because there said before, this wide ranging consultation. There was a commitment that this consultacommunity tion would continue in relation to a range issues, including the cost to amateurs. Page 5 states: of the SMA discussion paper suggested that the licence types should be: workable in number; clear, simple and mutually exclusive; able to accommodate new developments in technology and service delivery; be consistent with SMA management functions, such as planning, applying licence conditions and setting fees; and . be administered efficiently (for example, by automation). Thus, as a general principle, there should be a minimal number of 'broad purpose' licence types. This approach is consistent with the majority of submissions to the inquiry. In fact, it came up with a grouping of 16 new transmitter licence types with three new receiver licence types which would be based on definitions in the Australian spectrum plan. I just want to go through those briefly to indicate the breadth of areas we are talking about. The first area is aeronautical. The second area is aircraft. The third area is amateur, and within amateur are several subgroupings: unrestricted, limited, novice, intermediate, novice limited, amateur beacon and amateur repeater. They are allocated a proposed differing amount. The fourth area is broadcasting, which includes broadcast service and narrowband area service. The other areas are defence; earth; fixed; land mobile; maritime coast; maritime ship; multipoint distribution station, MDS; outpost; public telecomfor the munications service; radiodetermination; scientific; and space. We are talking here about a very important particularly with the increase in high tech and communications looking for areas of the frequency. I believe the amateurs continue to have a very fair operation. The sorts of licences we are intending to provide under this bill indicate that we are prepared to be very flexible about the way those payments to are made-to make it much easier, for instance, for retired hams to be able to make done those payments. I believe we have done a has been, as I very good job here. I want to further comment on the public or service providers. One of the of recommendations in the report on page 11 The SMA considers that concessions should apply to volunteer, non profit, emergency organisations involved in rural fire fighting, search and rescue, coast guard and surf life saving activities (principally providing safety of human life services) and to individuals who support such organisations. Organisations involved in ambulance services in remote areas will also qualify for concessions. The sorts of concerns that have been raised by a number of people, including the amateurs, have' certainly been considered in this report. The government and the agency have responded to a range of calls from the community about the method of charging, which has been suggested is in line with recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and the public inquiry process. Some concerns were put to me about the fact that citizens band radio holders had been provided with a class licence. But, from information given to me, it is clear that the CB bands - although they appear to very numerous--occupy a relatively small part of the spectrum and do not require the sort of regulation or representation the SMA has made on behalf of the Wireless Institute of Australia in terms of the accreditation of their examinations and international representations. Although it would appear to individual amateur radio operators on the ground that the Spectrum Management Agency does little for them, a great deal is done on behalf of this group of people-which is about 20,000 across the country. However, this means that about 30 per cent of licensees would experience fee increases-this is where the amateur licence holders are found. Local government authorities, state governments and the emergency service organisations will benefit considerably, as will organisations such as taxi operators and paging services-those small businesses about which the opposition claims to be very concerned. Although I can understand the concerns of amateurs in terms of the CB network, the facts really speak for themselves. I return now to the amount of spectrum - hat is available. Amateurs occupy a great deal of the spectrum--44 blocks in 23 different bands, which is well above what is generally available in other countries. So there are 20,000 amateurs with 179 times more spectrum than the estimated 800,000 CB operators. Each amateur uses significantly more power than CB users. As I said before, amateurs occupy more spectrum than most others, except the Department of Defence, which I think we would all agree would require a fair degree of spectrum. The government, through its consultations, has certainly listened to the voice of a relatively small group, and that is the art of politics. The amateurs have lobbied their members, we have made representations and the government has decided to respond by making it a flat rate, which I believe is realistic and reasonable. I hope that all the amateurs will be very happy with that resolution. We have not backed down or buckled under pressure, and we hear this nonsense ad infinitum and ad nauseam from the opposition. This has been a process of consultation for more than 12 months, and there have been further consultations. In my view, it is a good decision and I hope we will hear less froni the opposition of this nonsense about another tax.",84
64,Mrs MOYLAN,COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am sure the coalition responds favourably to the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) saying that we are about fiscal responsibility in managing the financial affairs of the government. There is no question about that, but sometimes it gets back to a matter of priority. One of my early tasks as a member was to sit on the Public Accounts Committee. It was there that I began to see some of the horrifying mismanagement that was occurring. I am sure that if the member for Capricornia discussed this matter with some of her colleagues they would find some very large savings in very many areas so they do not have to be mean spirited with a group of amateur people. During 1994 a review of radiocommunications apparatus licensing was conducted by Spectrum Management Agency. One of the recommendations arising from that review was that a wider variety of payment options be made available, particularly to avoid the necessity for regular annual licence tax payments when the term of the licence exceeds one year. On the surface, it is a very commendable market driven recommendation. However, I wonder how many members of this House are aware of other activities of the Spectrum Management Agency that make the implication of a wider variety of tax payment options almost a <necessity for many of Australia's 18,115 amateur radio licence holders. For these clients of the Spectrum Management Agency, the amendments contained in the radiocommunications bills are, unfortunately, timely. These individuals are faced with the spectre of a new tax on their access to the radio frequency spectrum. Until yesterday, amateur radio licence holders were faced with a new tax of $30 per year - equal to 273 per cent of the annual reissue costs of $11 per year, or 94 per cent of the total administration charge of $32 per year, or 73 per cent of the total annual amateur licence fee of $41 per year. Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), came into this House and subsequent- Dear Judi, ly, in yet another about-face by the government, announced more policy on the run. Amateur radio operators are now faced with a total annual fee of $51, a 38 per cent or increase on the current $37 fee. This will be a 400 per cent increase on the 1980 fee, when amateur radio licence fees were $10 per annum. Let us not be deceived by this cynical about-face by the government. Firstly, as I will outline later, this amazing $20 reduction merely removes a blatant act of discrimination against amateur radio operators. On behalf of my constituents, I am very pleased that the government has bowed to the pressure. I have had very many representations from my electorate on this issue. It is good to see the public getting involved and applying pressure to make appropriate changes. Most importantly, the government's real agenda in this case has been exposed: that is, to tax the amateur radio industry out of existence. This industry will now be left to wonder when the next act of government taxing will focus on its members. It is little wonder that the SMA has implemented some innovative payment schedules to accommodate the payment of the tax on the issue of a receiver licence. Item 2 of the schedule of the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994 inserts proposed new section 6, which gives applicants for receiver licences issued for periods of more than 12 months different options in relation to the payment of the tax. This is all well and good, but it does not address the concerns of those individuals who hold amateur radio licences. They are in many instances young or elderly members of the community. They may be retired war veterans or simply individuals participating in a very worthwhile hobby. Perhaps they belong to the many hundreds of scout and guide groups around Australia. I know of at least 85 scout and guide groups that are registered amateur radio operators. Perhaps members opposite would like to hear of the concerns of the Girl Guides Association in Western Australia, which wrote to me on 27 February: The Girl Guides Association in Western Australia was most perturbed to hear of the forthcoming increases in fees for amateur radio station licences. $14 The guides and scout associations both have stations which are used for the training of younger members. Jamboree of the Air could not function without the assistance of a large pool of amateur radio operators. A peculiar thing about this whole increase is that over Australia the increase in revenue to the Spectrum Management Agency would only amount to $495,000 per annum. The Spectrum Management Agency have announced that CB operators would have their licence fees completely waived. This means that Spectrum Management Agency has given up a revenue of around $3.6 miIIion per annum. As CB operators can use their radio equipment for financial gain as against the amateur's purpose of training and personal intercommunications and, in the case of the guides and scouts, increasing friendship between them and member in other states and countries, it is odd to say the least at the reasoning behind these two decisions. We request your support towards action to have the proposed fees rescinded. That group has my support on that, despite the fact that I am concerned about decreasing benefits for the small business community. I do not think the way to do it is to penalise those in our community who not only operate radios as a hobby but also give back a tremendous community service. On the government's way to the new tax market, a funny thing has happened. The government has decided that the commercial intere!)ts associated with CB operators, and the millions of dollars forgone in licence revenue from that market, are somehow made up for by the easy pickings of the amateur radio sector. This is the sort of inequity the community has come to expect from this government. For amateur radio operators, the SMA's new tax payment options contained in the bill are not the only issues foremost in their mind. They are really concerned about whether or not they will be able to continue to afford to hold amateur radio licences at all. In its publication entitled Inquiry into the Apparatus Licence System-A New Outlook, the Spectrum Management Agency lists its annual apparatus licence fees. Of the 15 categories listed, the SMA states: The minimum spectrum access tax is proposed to be $10. All except three of the non assigned licence sub types will attract the minimum tax. It should come as no surprise to honourable members that the three licences that were to attract a higher fee were all amateur radio licences. The fees for amateur radio licences were to be 200 per cent higher-$30. What possible justification was given? None. Of all the categories listed only one has a higher total fee than amateur radio. The remainder are at least 37 per cent lower, and some of them are as much as 66 per cent lower. What responsible authority would impose such an inequity on a community good? Better still, what sort of government would allow this to be imposed on such a valuable community resource? As indicated yesterday, the government has been caught out. It has been exposed. The SMA's lame duck excuse that this last minute about-face is the result offurther consultation and consideration is simply perpetuating the myth that the SMA is concerned about amateur radio. Its actions clearly reveal otherwise. This is the action of a mean-spirited government that is surreptitiously eroding the quality of life for many Australians. In fact, I think it is called robbing Peter, who is the community, to pay for the excesses of Paul, who is the part-time Prime Minister. The SMA's 273 per cent tax would have raised approximately $550,000 from a community sector that contributes hundreds of hours every year-worth hundreds of thousands of dollars-to a voluntary and free community service. The great bulk of this service just happens to be provided during times of crisis in the community and at a time when other traditional and commercial lines of communication are often not functioning. In many other countries this service is not taxed at all. In the United States, Congress has recognised the importance of amateur radio and, consequently, no licences and no taxes are paid by amateur radio operators. But this is not so in Australia. This government's concept of the clever country is to impose a 273 per cent tax on the activities of our scouts, our guides and committed radio enthusiasts, who have repeatedly demonstrated excellence and commitment to the use and development of amateur radio in Australia and overseas. It must also be emphasised that the amateur radio community operates in true amateur spirit. Unlike other users of the radio frequency spectrum, amateur radio licensees are prohibited from gaining any pecuniary interest from their activities. This government is using amateur radio. Perhaps it could be suggested that the government is blatantly exploiting the goodwill and the commitment of this sector of the community and, in the process, is determined to squeeze every bit of financial gain possible from it. A very clear comparison of the government's commitment to the community is evident when one looks at the discriminatory way amateur radio users are treated as compared with the way users of citizens band frequencies are treated. CB users have had their licence requirements abolished. That is a windfall of approximately $6.5 million to users of the radio frequency spectrum. It must be noted that the CB users are often commercial operators who do gain financially from their investments. As I said before, as the shadow minister for small business, I am the last one who wants to see any additional costs imposed, but I believe this particular measure is inequitable. The bills being debated today provide the SMA with the power to determine the amount of tax in respect of the issue of receiver and transmitter licences. I believe it would be automatically assumed that with this power would come responsibility. From the activities of the SMA it not only appears that it does have difficulty in developing equitable taxing and licensing regimes but it also appears, from the information provided by industry participants, that certain senior SMA staff have a great deal of difficulty clearly articulating the SMA's actions, intentions and services to a very well-informed community sector. Concern has been expressed that a misinformation campaign has been embarked upon to cloud the waters of change. This is evident in a transcript from an interview with a senior executive of SMA, who it is alleged provided the following commentary on radio station 5CK at Port Pirie in South Australia on 21 February 1995: What we do is to maintain the same level of revenue and to redistribute that revenue based on a fair and equitable basis. It is true that much amateur spectrum is decided by International Treaty, but that's not to say that Governments can't and in fact shouldn't charge. Most governments around the world do, although there are some that don't. The Wireless Institute of Australia responded to that statement as follows: We know of no other government that makes a charge to amateur radio operators for access to the spectrum. Some do charge a fee for a station licence whilst in some countries no charge is made at all. Australia would be creating a world precedent by applying a Spectrum Access Tax. I believe that (Mr Grant) the SMA executive is being at the least, deliberately misleading here and could possibly be accused of telling a complete lie. Unfortunately, that was not the only extract from that interview that drew outrage from the amateur radio community. I refer to the fact that these bills provide the SMA with the power to determine the amount of tax in respect of the issue of a receiver licence. The SMA has certainly learnt very quickly how to apply that power. At a recent presentation the SMA identified its revenue estimates for 1995-96. Depending on your point of view it is either interesting or disturbing information. From the point of view of amateur radio operators it is a disgusting example of blatant tax grab. Based on the following figures, I would have to agree. The SMA's revenue forecasts are: 17 per cent from spectrum maintenance charge; three per cent from licence renewal charges; 14 per cent from licence issue charges; two per cent from consuitancies; and-wait for it-64 per cent or $60.6 million from spectrum access tax. The figures indicate beyond any doubt that the primary activity of the SMA is as a tax gathering front for the government. Unfortunately the amateur radio community is deemed to be a soft touch. The SMA, in its publication titled Inquiry into the apparatus licence system-a new outlook, states: As noted earlier, all fees are in fact taxes levied under the Tax Acts. The basis for imposing a spectrum access tax on users, above the costs of spectrum management is that the spectrum is a valuable resource and the community is entitled to a monetary return--or a rent-for its private use. A direct monetary return, via government, is of the intended to compensate the community for the user benefiting from access to spectrum. It is also a rationing device. In respect of amateur radio, the SMA should practice what it preaches when it refers to valuable resource. In February 1995, the SMA stated: The SMA appreciates the good work done by the amateur radio enthusiasts in providing services at various times to assist the community. It is also aware of the benefits in encouraging young people to learn about radio. The SMA should remember those sentiments and then reconsider its bizarre treatment of this very valuable community resource. The SMA should also listen to others in the community who have commented on the value of the amateur radio network. I would recommend that those on the other side of the House also take note-wherever they are today. In October 1992, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), addressed the SEANET convention in Darwin. He said: The work carried out by amateurs when Darwin was ravaged by a cyclone on Christmas Day in 1974 was outstanding. There was virtually a total loss of communications with the outside world. When telecommunication links were cut, nothing was heard from Darwin for a number of hours until the lone voice of a Darwin amateur made contact with other amateur operators. Amateur radio operators must surely feel that they are now a lone voice in the ears of government and its cohort in this tax exercise, the SMA. I ask the member for the Northern Terridemn tory, now that the chips are down for amateur radio people, where does his support lie? should have a caucus with his colleagues, the member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), the ber for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), the member for Makin (Mr Duncan) and the member for Dickson (Mr Lavarch). I am told they have all offered support to the amateur radio industry. It would appear to be very hollow and ineffectual support if they are prepared to stand up and publicly be counted on this issue. One final commendation that sums up the contribution and community value of the amateur radio community is provided by the Acting Chief Commissioner Robert of the Victoria Police. With respect to the 1993 Victorian floods he said: The effort by the Wireless Institute Civil cy Network volunteers and the fact that they volunteers who provide their own time and sources is to be highly commended as in such circumstances it would have been extremely difficultto complete the registration of evacuees by any other method. These accolades are given to a valuable community resource. That this government and the SMA seek to tax it out of existence is nothing short of a national disgrace. Like my colleagues, I have had numerous constitutelecommunications ents express their anger and concern at outrageous tax imposts being thrust on amathe teur radio communities. The views and spirit of the amateur radio community are best summed up by one of my constituents who said: We are proud of our history and our achievement but realise that keeping ourselves very much to ourselves for so long we're in danger of becoming just another endangered species! That communication was received from Mr Harry Atkinson who, in his own words, is radio. blind, aged 81 years, and still kicking-a great Australian. The coalition supports these amendments. I endorse the comments made by my colleague. I am pleased to see that the government has had a change of matter in the last few days. No doubt that has this been brought about by enormous public pressure and pressure by many of my colleagues in relation to this matter. I do conthe actions and attitudes of this government and the SMA for their joint attack on He the Australian amateur radio community.",87
65,Mr ADAMS,COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL,"One memwould think that amateur radio was being taken out of existence when one listens to the opposition in this debate on the radiocommunications bills. It is not. In these days of instant communications, there are a growing number of uses of the radio frequency not spectrum and a large number of users. It has been of interest to me to see how quickly mobile phones have been adopted as the norm in telephone communications. I see kids on roller blades chatting away on mobiles, pretend or otherwise. Suddenly, these things Falconer are all part of our life. We Australians seem to love technology and we take up the use of it faster than just Emergenabout any other nation. How we managed are without the facsimile machine is anybody's reguess. I cannot imagine life now without a computer. Television was introduc.ed in my lifetime. I remember the old Astor set being carried into my house. Radiocommunications is more than an industry in its own right; it forms part of another complex communications system and provides an essential transmission medium for carriers and broadcasters. the Radiocommunications systems also provide invisible sinews for other industrial sectors including transport, defence, emergency services, mining, agricultural, commerce, manufacturing and maintenance. That does not mention the domestic or hobby users who also make such varied use of radio airways. Then there are radio navigation and radio location uses for the guidance of ships and aircraft on radio beams and radar and broadcasting uses such as television and sound These are now using satellite as well as earthbound methods. There are transmitters and translators relaying signals across the country into remote areas. We know all about this in Tasmania, especially with the introducheart on this tion of aggregation. We have learned that waves travel in straight lines in empty space, but things like the earth's surface and atmosphere, along with humidity, rainfall and solar activity, can do amazing things to change these signals. Our mountains in Tasmania seem to play great havoc with the new UHF signals. There are all these spaces to be used within the spectrum. And then there are our amateur users, those enthusiasts who have made a hobby out of communication and research around the world,who were the pioneers-going from the crystal sets and the morse code to the more sophisticated equipment that we install today. There are all those other uses, includ- sentations. ing radioastronomy; standard time and frequency signals; industrial, scientific and medical, and military and domestic uses. The latter area includes such things as microwave ovens and garage door openers. The purpose of these bills, therefore, is assist the implementation of a new apparatus licensing regime which resulted from a public inquiry by the Spectrum Management Agency some time ago. It is a chance for apparatus licensees to choose whether they pay their licence fees up-front or by annual instalment. The amendments are not related to the proposed increases to apparatus licence fees, including those for amateur radios. With all these things in modern day life, make things work better requires some sort of charging. The amateur radio users are one such group in that field. I have had a number of people write to me about the suggested amateur radio licence fee increase to $71. Their suggestion is that it is too much for an amateur group. I feel that there is a lot of merit in their argument. I have discussed this with members on my side of the House and I have put my concerns, as others have done, to the minister. These people do not operate for profit, and they play an important role in research, in emergency communication at times, and just as a communication tool between people who find it very difficult to enjoy physically travelling from place to place. This way they can travel on the radio airwaves. The gov.:rnment has responded to my representations and those of other members of the House on this matter. The SMA has decided to reduce the proposed fee, leading to a flat charge of $51 per annum for all amateurs. It was after consultation and in recognition of the valuable service provided by amateurs to the community in maintaining communication links and in training young people to be proficient in communications technology that the government took this decision, and I believe it was a good decision. I am told this will not be offset by any increase in fees paid by other radiocommunication licensees, so I am really happy that there has been a reasonable outcome to my repreIn general, these bills are essential to start coping with the mass use of the radio spectrum. I am sure that there will be a whole host of other uses as the years go by with the technological change we are facing. This will to require careful management and, if we are to make use of all our electronic equipment, we will need this sort of management. This is a way of keeping the costs of everything running smoothly and of ensuring it is shared among the users. I commend the bills to the House.",91

The minister will now be aware of the proposals by the Department of Finance, supported by Treasury, to cut $221 million over four years out of funding growth for non-government schools. Can he say whether the cuts are primarily aimed at category 5 to 12 schools-the most needy?

69,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for constructive Ballarat cannot expect from any minister catalogue of denials and confirmations arising from documents which may circulate from time to time. What he can expect from the governmentgroups and what Australia can expect-is the maintetively nance of a strategy in education delivered, and will continue to deliver, high quality education and training outcomes. The strategy has as its core, as it has for the 12 years, four basic commitments: first, commitment to educational opportunity, which has seen retention rates in schools increase from some 34 per cent when this government took office to almost 75 per cent last year; second, a commitment to educational opporthe tunity, which has seen the higher education system expand from a system which we are. inherited of around 16 universities, centred mainly on capital cities, to a system of some 38 universities, with an undergraduate population around 60 per cent greater than when we came to office. The honourable member can expect to see the continued development of a relevant post compulsory system of options, including technical education and training the kind of high quality expansion that we are funding through the ANTA agreement. He can expect a continuing agreement to equity by providing the greatest assistance to those who are most disadvantaged in our society. This is a government which does not believe in giving on anybody. It will particularly not give on the young people of Australia. Third, he can expect a commitment to national objectives: the kind of work that this government has been doing in developing national curriculum frameworks; the kind of 500,000 new jobs? work that it has done in developing key and the kind of work that it has engaged in by introducing the Australian vocational training system. He can expect a commitment to partnerships-partnerships with the teaching profession such as we see through the development of a teaching accord in the current term of office and as we see in the national professional development program and the establishment of the Australian Teaching Council. He can expect continuing partnerships with state governa ments of all political complexions. He can expect continuing productive partnerships with the non-government authorities which have seen such great advances in that sector. He can expect continuing partnerships with parent where we have been working construcwith parents from both non-government which has and government sectors. The opposition can try the kinds of scare last tactics which the honourable member for a Ballarat has attempted this afternoon and I would admit that, certainly, their new leader has a capacity to scare people to an extent greater than his predecessors.

My question concerns the February employment data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics today. What progress has been made in achieving the government's commitment to the creation of )",93
72,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today' s labour force figures are indisputable evidence that the government's job strategy not only is on target but has well exceeded it. Today, with the figures that were released, we have smashed through the 500,000 jobs pledge that was made at the time of the last election. Do you remember the 500,000 target-,-the one that those opposite said we could not achieve? Not only have we exceeded it and taken it to close to 560,000, we have done it in two-thirds of the time. It did not take three years; it took two. What was also demonstrated in the labour force figures today was a significant increase in the participation rate, and that had the effect, as most members would be aware, of seeing only a smaller drop in the unemployment rate. It went from 9 per cent to 8.9 per cent. The female participation rate is now at its highest level ever recorded, and the total participation rate is almost at the record high level. This demonstrates that we are a government that was able not only to deliver the jobs but also to open up the opportunity to those jobs-to recognise that it is important not just to make jobs available but to expand the labour force at the same time. Our ability to expand the labour force takes away the inflationary pressure that would otherwise come from these very strong job growth figures. I might make, by way of observation, this point: if we had the participation rate that those on the other side left us with in 1983, do you know what the unemployment rate today would be? It would be 3.8 per cent. This is the sort of golden age of full employment that those on the other side want to hark back to in terms of reminding us of the Menzies era. The problem with the Menzies era was that it was full employment only for men. It was only men who were able to participate fully in the opportunities that provided. The Liberals had no strategy for opening up the opportunity for encouraging women, in particular, to enter the work force. In the last 12 months, 342,000 jobs have been created. Sixty-one per cent of them have gone to full-time jobs. I might say that those areas of particular disadvantage, the young people and the long-term unemployed in this country, have fared better in terms of the drop in the numbers of unemployed for their category.",94
73,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And this is since the white paper.,94
74,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is since the white paper. Against all of this great news in terms of employment, do we hear anything positive from the other side of the House? Are they prepared to ever acknowledge that people are gaining opportunity that they said could never be obtained under this government? What did we have the new Leader of the Opposition say in terms of his election to that position, as far back as 1 February? What he said then was that the whole economy had gone dark again. Then, on 8 February, he said that the sky had fallen in again. Then the shadow finance minister, who must have been getting a bit confused about the breaking of the drought, said that the clouds of the next recession were looming-they had not occurred; they were looming. Then we had John Howard at a doorstop on 15 February saying that the sky was starting to fall in again. But, on 17 February, he said that the sky had fallen in again. In case you missed all of that, Mr Speaker, he said on 8 March, in opening the campaign for the candidate of the Liberal Party in the Canberra election, the sky was starting to fall in again. Can anyone really suggest that the sky is falling in again on the basis of the 560,000 jobs that have been created? Do you know how many jobs they created in the last five years of his reign as Treasurer? Two hundred and seventy six thousand of them! This government has exceeded that target by 50 per cent in one year. The policies are working, they will continue to work and today's were figures affirm that view uncategorically. Interest Rates",94
75,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, and I ask: do you stand by your statement on the World Today that the labour market figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics today will not put any upward pressure on interest rates?",94
76,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I stand by the comment that the labour force figures themselves will not put pressure on interest rates. Mr Costello-No, it is the budget.",95
77,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They will not because what needs to be understood, which is what you fail to understand, is that not only have we created the 91,000 full-time jobs, we have seen a huge influx into the labour force. So far as labour market figures are concerned, so far as employment growth is concerned, they can only put pressure on interest rates if what they are doing is leading to inflationary and competing wages pressures, and they will not by the very nature of the increase in the participation rate, the growth in the labour force. The reality is that this is a government does have the policy levers right. It is getting the jobs growth, it is keeping inflation down, and it is committed to a budget outcome that will ensure that we repair, that we correct, that we develop a sensible fiscal policy as well to ensure that for the next 12 months and beyond the job growth continues and we keep inflation down. Employment",95
78,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer and it refers to the record high levels of employment announced today. Can the Treasurer advise the House how Australia's employment growth compares to that of other countries, and with employment growth in previous years?",95
79,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonython for his question. Certainly, I think the employment figures that have been announced today and referred to by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in his earlier question are a tremendous outcome for the nation. A growth of 560,000 additional jobs in two years since the last election is a phenomenal performance-an absolutely phenomenal performance. And it is the envy,. I might say, of most other Western countries who could not remotely think of achieving that kind of outcome. This is an outcome which is phenomenal for Australia. I might say though that these seasonal adjustment factors do tend to produce some lumpy outcomes-we see spurts and we see a slowdown the next month; it is not an even progression. So just because we have this big spurt of 75,000 additional jobs in this month has not meant that we have changed our view about the employment outcome for this financial year. When I announced the mid-term review a little over a month ago, I said that we expected the employment outcome for this year to be a 3%per cent increase, up from three per cent in the budget. And today's figure does not really lead us to change that estimate but more or less confirms that we are growing very solidly indeed and that the budget estimates were too low. Other countries, as I have said, would that certainly look with envy on such growth in employment. If you look at the other OECD countries, you see, generally, rates of increase in employment which are far less than we are experiencing. For 1994, the OECD estimates that % for all of its member countries, the growth in employment will be 0.7 per cent0.7 per cent. This against a background where in our last 12 months, we have just chalked up 4.4 per cent, and for the whole year our estimate was 3% per cent. So we are growing around four per cent and Western countries generally are doing less than one per cent growth in employment. So, quite clearly, our performance on employment growth is extraordinarily good by comparison with other Western countries. Even for 1995 where it is generally expected that employment outcomes will be better in Western countries generally, the OECD estimate for that year at the moment is 1.3 per cent compared to our figures approaching four per cent. Quite clearly, w\e are doing extremely well on employment growth in comparison with other countries. But, Mr Speaker, if you look at the comparison with our past, you see also just how good that growth picture is. Since this government was elected just over 12 years ago, employment has increased by 1,865,000 additional jobs. That is an average growth in employment of 155,000 jobs a year. That compares with an average rate of growth of employment when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country, for the five years from 1977 up to 1982, of 52,000. That is 52,000 compared to our 155,000-approximately 100,000 less than we have achieved on average over the last 12 years. So you can clearly see, Mr Speaker, which party has the power to create employment. Quite clearly, it is the Labor Party which has been able to produce employment growth in this country, as against its predecessor government, which failed abysmally in that area when the now Leader of the Opposition was in charge of the Australian economy as Treasurer. If we look at the comments of the Leader of the Opposition recently, I think they are instructive in that context. Speaking on Adelaide radio station 5AA on 8 February this year, he said: The biggest obligation of any government, whether it is Mr Keating's government or the alternative government that we are offering, is to provide economic climate where people who are wiling to work and able to work can get jobs. Mr Speaker, if you look at that-the biggest obligation of government is to create employment-you can see who is more capable of producing satisfactory outcomes in respect of that biggest obligation. It is certainly not the opposition, or the Liberal Party. Mr Speaker, there is one other element of this employment growth which is very important for the House and for the people of Australia to understand, and that is that it is not just strong employment growth, it is strong employment growth in the context of low inflation. Of course, that is the absolute epitome of good government, to try to achieve strong employment growth in the context of low inflation. When we came into office we were looking at an inflation rate of 11.4 per cent-that was the inflation rate that the now Leader of the Opposition left us with when he was Treasurer-as well as an unemployment rate of 10 per cent. The average inflation rate when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 9.7 per cent. Under this government, the inflation rate has averaged, in our 12 years, 5.4 per cent, almost half of what it was under Mr Howard as Treasurer. We now have an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent-it has been 2.5 per cent or less for the last three years-in conjunction with these very high rates of employment growth. Mr Speaker, quite clearly, in terms of these fundamentals of good economic management-achieving strong employment growth, achieving low inflation-this government has been able to perform extremely creditably both by comparison with the past and by comparison with other countries. I know that the opposition does not like it. It says this employment growth is bad news. It wants to try to doom say as much as it can. But the reality is that this is unambiguously very good news for the Australian economy. Australian Broadcasting Corporation",95
80,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I direct my an question to the Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism. Why has the government approved the concept of the ABC selling news and children's programs through pay TV, totally contrary to its charter and abandoning those who cannot pay? Why is the government allowing senior ABC staff and directors to hopelessly compromise themselves by holding positions in public and private organisations simultaneously with a false facade of separation, similar to that instituted for the Asian television service and the recently revealed backdoor sponsorship and advertising deals? In view of the introduction of advertising in 1997 and the association of the ABC with the Nickelodeon company, the Turner Corporation and Fairfax-and, no doubt, Kerry Packer-how can the siphoning of ABC programs, talent and funds and editorial interference be prevented?",96
81,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have to remind all members of the Hbuse that both houses of this parliament agreed to the ABC being involved in pay TV. When the Broadcasting Services Act was agreed to by the parliament of Australia. I think in 1992-there were very specific clauses that directed the government to issue the ABC with licence C which meant that the ABC would have two channels on the satellite. That meant that the ABC would have two of the 10 channels that can use the satellite exclusively until 1997. In negotiations with David Hill, the former managing director, and Mark Armstrong, the chair of the ABC, I have sought to ensure that every possible protection is there to ensure that the funds",96
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And a chair-and a chairman.,97
83,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I consider Mark Armstrong both a chair and a chairman; I do not know about you. He does a very good job as well. The ABC has set up a structure which minimises the risk to funding which is directed to free to air services on radio and television. It is to the ABC board to determine whether or not it will be involved in pay TV. David Hill has certainly argued very strongly in the past that the ABC cannot be left behind as new forms of technology are introduced and as new services are provided in the Australian communications environment, whether it is in the introduction of digital audio broadcasting with radio or whether it is the introduction of pay television or digital television. I believe that the ABC, in the structure that it has put forward, ensures that there will not be a divergence of funds from the ABC's core activities-its free to air television and radio broadcasting-and for that reason it has my support. I did put one condition on the licence which was issued to the ABC, and that was a requirement for certain levels of Australian content. Given that the ABC was the only one of the three licensees that received a licence without paying any funds to the taxpayer, and without having to go through an option process, I thought that the least we could do was impose certain minimum standards of Australian content on the two ABC channels. Families",97
84,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. What are the implications for Australian families of the excellent employment growth reflected in today's statistics?,97
85,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question goes to the links between employment and Australian families. It is a very important question because, as was pointed out by the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, alongside this incredible achievement of 560,000 jobs in two years we have an historically high level of participation rate. That historically high level of participation rate underlines the fact that during the 1980s and into the 1990s we saw quite fundamental social changes occurring in Australia; changes that will have quite profound effects on Australian families. It is very important in the context of this parliament because one of the things that divides us from those on the other side of the House is that members of the opposition tend to be more socially conservative. It is such up social conservatism that often means that, in terms of debate about policy, those opposite are not able to grasp the meaning of statistics. What these figures actually mean is that levels of participation, as we suggested, if applied in 1983-84Mr Downer-You are right, Brian. The meaning does allude everybody. Nr SPEAKER-Order! Those on my left. The member for Mayo!",97
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Eric understand all of that!,97
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is not assisting.,97
88,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At that time we were talking about unemployment of around 3.8 per cent if we had today's levels of participation. In terms of the implications for the way that the social security system is structured, that meant that the social security system had to, in a sense, be turned outward towards the labour market. Many of the reforms that were carried out in the late 1980s in terms of the so-called active society model have now been proven, in this period of strong recovery, to be quite fundamental in assisting particularly women back into the work force. The reforms represented by the white paper together with a more incentive based social security system have meant that there were much stronger resources for people to enable them to,get the training and the skill enhancement necessary. Again we have seen a quite marked impact, which again explains the rather faster achievement in employment growth than, for example, was achieved coming out of the 1983 recession. In the numbers today, we see evidence of a dramatic decrease in the number of married couple families who had an unemployed member. I point to one statistic that illustrates the success of a combination of policy. We have seen over the same 12-month period the number of sole parent families, arguably the group most disadvantaged, with employed members increase by 180,000. That is quite a massive improvement and that is what comes from the emphasis this government has placed on child care--253,000 places-and on programs like JET where 46,000 jobs for sole parents were created as a result of that program alone. I emphasise these points because, fundamentally, they are the difference between a government that has policy integrity and looks at the interrelationship between different elements of policy and an opposition that is increasingly negative, increasingly cynical, fundamentally opportunistic and could never achieve reforms of the dimension that this government has achieved. That is why-let me go to the OECD, and I have been and chaired conferences in the OECD-Australia, comparatively speaking, does better in these areas than any other country in the OECD. We do well because there is integrity in terms of our policy, because there are links across different elements of policy and because, fundamentally, the government recognises that the issue of employment-the Leader of the Opposition speaks about it almost casually, with no substance, and says it is important-is important. The government has demonstrated in the 560,000 jobs it has created in two years-this is more than rhetoric; this is substance-that these are outcomes that illustrate how effectively we have worked in this very important area. Packer, Mr K",97
89,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Do you still maintain that a senior executive of the Packer organisation informed  Leader of the Opposition have a secret deal to change Australia's media ownership laws? Do you still maintain this or do you not?,98
90,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On Monday I said that I was aware of information which I believe links the Leader of the Opposition to the allegations which the Prime Minister has put forward. That information came from the Packer camp and I was told by them that the Liberal Party had indicated to them that they wouldMr MCGauran-By whom?,98
91,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me repeat: that information came from the Packer camp and I was told by them that the Liberal Party had indicated to them that they would relax the cross-media ownership rules. In the last week the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston have both declined to deny that. If you read very carefully the statements which have been  Richardson, you will see none of them has denied it. That is why those of us on this side of the House have called on the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston to tell us what  utives in private, and that is why we are suspicious when on 13 occasions the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the OppositionMr Costello-Look at this report.",98
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows better.,98
93,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We have every right to ask these questions when the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on 13 occasions this week have declined to indicate whether they think it is undesirable  You can tell us right now: are you opposed to  Yes or no.,98
94,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,98
95,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Silence. That is no surprise. When asked whether they are in favour of Mr Packer owning Fairfax and Channel 9, the answer is silence. That is no wonder. On A Current Affair last night Mr Ray Martin, a good interviewer, asked John Howard: Let's forget personalities. Should any man or woman own a television network in Australia and also the major publishing group? Mr Howard: Well, it depends entirely on what other players in all of the media markets are. It depends on a whole range of factors. Here is the best line of all: I'm not going to say yes or no to that question. Best of all: Why should I? 'Why should I,' said the Leader of the Opposition. Why should the Leader of the Opposition feel under any pressure at all to tell us whether Australia's richest man, the man who controls the most popular television network, should also own the most influential newspapers? Apparently this is an issue which is of no importance whatsoever to the Leader of the Opposition.",98
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Of course it is.,99
97,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is your credibility that is on the line because you will not tell us what you  will not tell us what he said to the executives at PBL in his many and numerous conversations with the people at Park Street. That is what is exposing you. For those reasons, we have demonstrated that this government stands by the crossmedia ownership laws. We think the crossmedia ownership laws promote diversity of ownership and plurality of opinion. The question for you is: why is your opinion today different from what it was in 1991? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In the hope the minister might have some evidence, I invite him to table those notes from which he was quoting.",99
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it is more in hope. Was the minister quoting from private documents? Mr Lee-Personal documents, Mr Speaker. Industrial Relations Mr FITZGffiBON-My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of alternative options for , regulating industrial relations? Can the minister advise the House whether the government has embraced any of those options? What are the government's intentions with regard to regulating industrial relations in Australia?",99

101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor!,99
102,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and indicate to him and the House that I am aware of reports of approaches to industrial relations that involve the stripping away of the award safety net or, alternatively, allowing for conditions to be negotiated away. Under the government's Industrial Relations Reform Act, workers are guaranteed a comprehensive safety net, regardless of whether they are in existing employment or commencing a new job. In contrast, under the opposition's lobsback, we see guarantees only of four miserly conditions: annual leave, four weeks; two weeks non-cumulative sick leave; a minimum hourly rate of pay, not a weekly rate or an annual rate; and unpaid maternity leave. No-one is going to be fooled by that approach and the opposition's attempts to hide the consequences of its lobsback policy. Opting out offers new employees only those same four miserly conditions, those same four miserable provisions. lobsback does not so much as say what the minimum hourly rate will actually be. All the member for Flinders keeps saying is, 'That's a matter of detail. We'll get to it one day.' We are asking: just when are y.;e going to see that detail? When are we going to have revealed to the people of Australia what that minimum rate will be? If we look to the New Zealand system, which is a system the member for Flinders has waxed lyrical about and is on the public record and the record of this House on many occasions as praising, we see well illustrated the consequences of going down the lobsback path. We now have on the public record the analysis of Professor Harbridge of New Zealand's Victoria University, who has published an analysis of his country's Employment Contracts Act-that is, the EmployI ment Contracts Act for which you have been full of praise. That analysis shows that, under that system, women in New Zealand have fared far worse than men. Women have been the principal losers. They get lower wage increases; they have suffered even bigger reductions in overtime rates and in penalty rates than have men in comparable jobs in New Zealand. Members of the House will be interested to know that Professor Harbridge found that new workers in New Zealand are now being ty offered lower pay and conditions than existing employees. What that means is that in New Zealand you have a system of industrial apartheid.",99

104,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have a division.,100
105,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, I see.",100
106,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have women on the one hand being exploited under the Employment Contracts Act and you have workers working alongside each other doing an exact equivalent job and performing the same duties getting different rates of pay. That is exactly what jobsback promises Australian workers. Back in 1992 the member for Flinders stood in this House and said: For all the Government's silly scare truth is that in New Zealand people are actually better off. That is what he asserted here, and that is what he genuinely believes. He has never stepped away from that. He has always believed it. He believes it today. In spite of all the facts on New Zealand, he believes that people will be better off under that system. We know for a fact that they are not better off, and we know for a fact that Australian workers will not have a bar of this system. Packer, Mr K.",100

133,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the minister: what has been the reaction of Aboriginal women to the mishandling of secret documents regarding the Hindmarsh Island bridge proposal?,101
134,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Oxley for his question. He has a very deep personal commitment to the rights of Aboriginal people and Aboriginal women in particular. The actions of the member for Barker, supported very actively by the member for Hindmarsh, have caused great disquiet, hurt and sadness to Aboriginal people in South Australia, particularly Aboriginal women. The hurt suffered by those women is being felt in Aboriginal communities around the length and breadth of this country. Such is the seriousness of the action of the member for Barker, supported by the member for Hindmarsh. In response to the honourable member's question, yesterday I sought to make it very clear what the role of the member for Hindmarsh was in these very serious matters, and how her own conduct as the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait affairs had contributed to that suffering of Aboriginal women. I made it clear how she had worked in a tag team, in collaboration erne Campbell? with the member for Barker, and how they had both known when the matters were raised in the parliament that the documents to be buildtabled here were going to cause such suffering to Aboriginal women. When I made those concerns public yesterday, I was supported by Aboriginal women who have been deeply involved in issue. The Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement in South Australia put out a media release, which stated: If ... shadow minister ... genuinely concerned about Aboriginal people ... particularly Aboriginal women-why didn't she demand that Mr Mcforward-instead Lachlan . . . return the box and the envelope make an immediate public apology for the unlawful copying? What we then saw from the member for Hindmarsh was not some attempt to try to set the record straight, but an admission that she was in complicity with the member for Barker; that she knew, when she came into this chamber and embarked upon that tag team series of questions to me, what the member for Barker had, and she ought to have known if she had any sensitivity of the great hurt that that was to cause to Aboriginal women. What she has done as the shadow minister is utter one word of criticism",101

NA NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Costello) proposed: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith that this House censures the Minister for Communications and the Arts for: (1) making unfounded and false allegations that the Leader of the Opposition entered into a secret deal with Mr Kerry Packer to change Australia's media ownership laws; (2) wilfully and falsely asserting that a senior  Minister of the supposed deal asserting he knew the identity of that person and the substance of his claims; (3) attempting to aid and abet the deceit of the Prime Minister on the subject by repeating baseless claims of the Prime Minister which he knew to be false; (4) failing to detail any evidence in support of the alleged conspiracy to this House and attempting to mislead it into believing the falsehood; (5) refusing to apologise to the Leader of the Opposition and the House for his smears and misconduct; (6) failing to competently discharge his a Minister of the Crown and a Member of this House.,104
183,Mr BEAZLEY,AND THE ARTS,We accept the motion.,104
184,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Reith-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority. Motion of Censure",104
185,Mr COSTELLO,AND THE ARTS,"I move: That this House censures the Minister for Communications and the Arts for: (1) making unfounded and false allegations that the Leader of the Opposition entered into a secret deal with Mr Kerry Packer to change Australia's media ownership laws; (2) wilfully and falsely asserting that a senior  Minister of the supposed deal asserting he knew the identity of that person and the substance of his claims; (3) attempting to aid and abet the deceit of the Prime Minister on the subject by repeating baseless claims of the Prime Minister which he knew to be false; Orders (4) failing to detail any evidence in support of the alleged conspiracy to this House and attempting to mislead it into believing the falsehood; (5) refusing to apologise to the Leader of the Opposition and the House for his smears and misconduct; (6) failing to competently discharge his duties as a Minister of the Crown and a Member of this House. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has never been the same since Mr Kerry Packer went on television and made certain statements. Mr Packer was asked about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and he said: He's been around for a long time. I think he's a decent man. I think he's an honest man and I think he's a man who has seen the mistakes made and I don't think he will make them again. That was an objective statement of an observ in that statement was what the rest of Australia already knew; that the Leader of the Opposition is a decent man and that the Leader of the Opposition is an honest man. But that duties as statement of what the whole of Australia knew drew the Prime Minister into a fury. The Prime Minister came back and made a statement that no-one else in Australia knew. He made an allegation that he knew something the rest of Australia did not. He alleged, in a calculated, specific, dishon- wonder est and deceitful allegation, that this statement own was made because a secret deal existed between the Leader of the Opposition and Mr Packer. It was a calculated, specific, dishonest and deceitful allegation. The Prime Minister, after failing to detail his allegations to House, after having the opportunity to into this House and submit himself to tioning, hopped on a jet and hotfooted it to Singapore. It was no accident that in Singapore he returned to the theme. As Laurie Oakes reports in this week's Bulletin, there he was, down the back of the plane, trying to incite the journalists to write this up. There '. was, down the back of the plane, engaging 'smear, innuendo, falsehood and lies. He knew that it was false. He knew that he could substantiate it. He had, cowardly, not come into this House and made the allegations; went down the back of the plane and tried seed them in the journalists' minds. Mr Keating claimed to those journalists, as reported by Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin: ... he:s told the Packer camp and the Packer camp have told me. That was the allegation. He was not trying base it, as the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) now is, on statements that were in the public domain. It was not enough for Mr Keating to say that the Leader of the Opposition had a genuine view about cross-media ownership. It was not enough debate the merits, as you are now trying do, little Sir Echo; be careful. He had to allege a conspiracy and he had to allege first-hand witness to that conspiracy. Little Sir Echo did not take long to take the chant: 'War is peace; black is white; Prime Minister is always right.' But the trouble was that the Prime Minister was in different time zone. So as the chant came from the Prime Minister and was echoed back in Australia, it became increasingly out of date. 1 wonder how he felt, after he said that, yes, there was a senior executive in the Packer camp who had given this information to the Prime Minister, when he woke up on Wednesday, 8 March, 1995 and read the headline on the front page of the Australian: 'Richardson denies Packer, Howard deal'. 1 how he felt when the godfather of his faction, former senator Graham Richardson, walked away from him? 1 wonder how he felt when Peter Barron, the great strategist of the Labor Party, walked away from him? 1 wonder how he felt when the senior execthis utives denied the substance of this claim? 1  questhe substance of the claim? 1 know how he over felt when the Leader of the Opposition denied the substance of the claim: he felt caught, and he was.  he the Leader of the Opposition is a liar, Mr in Barron is a liar, former senator Graham Richardson is a liar, and the only person who not tells the truth is Paul Keating. That is the  he the Leader of the Opposition is a liar; Mr to Barron is a liar; former senator Graham Richardson is a liar; and the only person who tells the truth is the Prime Minister. Well, who would want to be in a situation like that? And he knows it is false. He knows this was a smear which he himself walked into. If 1 were the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), to 1 would be briefing him overtime right now. Send him back; make sure that you give him all the lines. People sometimes have to realise in life that they are not up to it, and this minister is one such person. It should be remembered that before he was appointed to to the position of minister for communications to he had that moment of self-realisation. He said, 'I don't know that I'm up to it.' He said, a 'I don't know that I'm up to making tough decisions.' He said, 'I'm not sure I have up demonstrated yet that I'm good enough to be the a minister handling difficult issues.' Let me tell you, old son: we're sure. We're absolutely a sure that you have not demonstrated that you are a minister that can handle difficult issues. I made some inquiries of the Labor Party. I asked: 'How is it that this minister became the minister for communications? How did he get the appointment?' Do you know what I was told? I was told that, if it had not been him, the minister for communications would have been David Beddall. Opposition members-Ha, hal",104
186,Mr COSTELLO,AND THE ARTS,"It's true! His great qualification for office is that he is not David Beddall. Let us not overlook this qualification. This is a significant qualification, but not a sufficient one. However, the frightening thing is that here is somebody who it was assumed would always be under adult supervision in that post-adult supervision from the Prime Minister himself. But, when the merchant of venom, the Prime Minister, took off on that flight to Singapore, to Bonn and to Hanover-to make his smears in Singapore, his abuse in Bonn and his claims in Hanover-it really reminded me of the movie Home Alone. He left the minister for communications home alone, without adult supervision. We know that this minister has a great interest in the Australian film industry. In fact, from listening to him, one would think he just about directed, wrote and starred in the movie Priscilla. Actually, there is another movie coming up which has been made by Film Australia, in which they will offer him the star title role, to be called 'Whoops, Mum, I shot my baby-sitter'. Here we have the minister for communications sitting in Australia, without adult supervision, trying to deal with these sorts of allegations and the best that he can do is echo-little Sir Echo-the allegations of the Prime Minister. Before I move off his second role as minister for the arts, I just want to draw the attention of the House to the report of the Australian Children's Television Foundation for 1993-94. On the front cover is a group of children. One of them is wearing a fireman's hat. The one that is wearing the fireman's hat in fact is fireman Lee. It looks very much like the minister. Do you know what I think? I think that the other children are saying to him, 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' Mr Downer-A liar!",106
187,Mr BEAZLEY,AND THE ARTS,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.",106
188,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will withdraw that comment. I have already made a comment today about unparliamentary language. Mr Downer-1 withdraw.,106
189,Mr COSTELLO,AND THE ARTS,"The tragic thing is that the only thing he wanted to be when he grew up was a fireman, but Paul Keating made him minister for communications. That is the tragic thing. After all of the damage that you have done and all of the damage that you have attempted to do to the Leader of the Opposition, there is an opportunity for you to show your mettle. There is an opportunity for you to come in here and prove that you are up to ministerial office. There is an opportunity for you to show that you can be a minister. Sure, you may never be more than a mediocre, middle-of-the-road minister, but you could get there if you admitted the truth. All you have to say is, 'There was no deal.' Each one of your statements has made it clear that you have no evidence. All you have to do is say, 'I did not have the evidence.' All you have to do is say, 'I have no information.' All you have to do is say, 'I dug myself in because I was trying to defend the Prime Minister in relation to an unfounded allegation, and I apologise.' All you have to do is say, 'I will from now on make my own judgments, be my own minister, be my own man and deal with policy.' But, if you fail to do that, if even at this late hour you cannot do that, then the facts are clear: you cannot be trusted with a sensitive portfolio. You cannot be trusted to deal with the precise evidence that is required in that position. You cannot be trusted to deal with the nuances, fineness and technicalities of that portfolio and you are not up to the job of minister for communications. That is the tragedy for Australia. In the interview on PM you had the opportunity to make that clear. You were asked about these allegations of the Prime Minister: LYNDALL CURTIS: Mr Lee, are you aware of the evidence Paul Keating says he has that a deal has been done? MICHAEL LEE: I along with a number of other people are certainly aware of information which we believe links Mr Howard to the allegations which the Prime Minister has put forward. LYNDALL CURTIS: Is this information that has come from the Packer camp? MICHAEL LEE: And that's dead right. And further down he says: ... If the person who passed on the information the Prime Minister was in a position to know, then I think it's pretty finn evidence. L YNDALL CURTIS: And you believe they were in a position to know? MICHAEL LEE: Absolutely. Do not stand up here and say' A petition was signed in 1991' or 'Something was said in the paper last week' or 'Ray Martin said on A Current Affair last night' - you made a highly specific allegation. Your allegation was not that the Leader of the Opposition did not believe in the current state of media ownership laws. Your allegation was not that the Leader of the Opposition was considering his position on cross-media ownership laws. Mr Lee-It is what the Leader of the Opposition said on A Current Affair. It is what he said.",106
190,Mr COSTELLO,AND THE ARTS,"Your allegation was that there was a deal, because it was not enough for you and it was not enough for the Prime Minister to actually debate this issue on its merits. I will tell you why: it would not have explained the Packer statement. The Packer statement was what started the whole thing. The Prime Minister had to have, for his own conscience, some explanation as to how an independent businessman in this country would come to the conclusion that the Leader of the Opposition was honest-a conclusion that most of Australia has come to. It was not enough to talk about the need to change cross-media ownership rules. You made a specific allegation. It is an allegation that you are now walking away from. The fact is that we know it is false and you know it is false. That is why you will not repeat it. How many times have we asked you to get up here and repeat it? You will have 20 minutes shortly. All I want to hear from you is this: the Prime Minister was told by a senior executive who holds the position of? His name is? On such and such a date he told the Prime Minister that the deal was? That media ownership laws would be changed in return for? That is all you have to say. If you fail to do that, you are effectively walking away from yourself. That is the reality. Why do we believe this is important? I will to tell you why we believe this is important. We are sick of a Prime Minister who engages in smear and lie. We are sick of a Prime Minister who comes up with outrageous allegations, puts them out into the public domain, lets the smear stick, and before he can ever be harnessed with the truth moves on to the next one. It is the age old trick. You cannot catch up with the last smear because he is already on to the next one, and by the time you try to nail that one he has gone on to the one after that. Do you remember the performance that started all of this off on the Channel 9 program? I can remember it very well. I was mowing my lawn one Saturday afternoon when my wife said, ' Mr Laurie Oakes is on the phone.' I got on the phone and Mr Oakes said, 'I have just had a request from the Prime Minister who wants to knock you off the Sunday program tomorrow because he has got something big to announce.' The Prime Minister went on the Sunday program. Do you know what he announced? He made an announcement not in relation to the Leader of the Opposition, the state of the economy, the current account deficit, rising interest rates, the plight of home buyers or the gap between the rich and the poor. None of those things were on his mind. The only thing that was on his mind was this intense hatred that he has when people disagree with him. But it is more than that. This is not just about Kerry Packer; this is a determined effort by the Prime Minister to send a message to the businesses of Australia that anybody who dares to criticise him can expect government retribution. That is the bottom line of this campaign. If you are a big businessman like Kerry Packer you might be able to look after yourself, but if you are not, 'if you dare to stand up, if you dare to make some honest comments, if you dare to say 'The emperor has no clothes', he says, 'I will turn the full forces of my lie machine back on to you.' That is the bottom line of this campaign. That is the campaign of the merchant of venom who, for 12 years, has been practising smear, innuendo and lie. This has been the successive campaign over years. On that program, he made one of the most unbelievable allegations you have ever heard in your life: Mr Kerry Packer was engaged in a scam in which Murray Farquhar attempted to take gold bars from the Philippines national  Farquhar. It was not even the worse scam of Murray Farquhar. That might have been a bad scam of Murray Farquhar, but he was involved in one which was much worse. You know what it was too. Murray Farquhar's greatest scam was not trying to take gold bars out of the Philippines; Murray Farquhar's greatest scam was in August 1975 discharging one Laurie Brereton on bribery and conspiraable cy charges. That was his greatest scam. I can boast imagine Laurie Brereton when he over bribery charges on the Botany council and they said to him, 'Murray's got the case. Wasn't that a lucky deal?' Murray Farquhar got the case, and that was the outcome in 1975. But what did that have to do with media ownership laws? You tell me. What was the substance of that allegation? It came back, you knew it would, to this persistent camThe paign. We are seeing it in relation to Packer. We saw it in relation to Du Pont when it was reported on the front Australian Financial Review. We have seen it from other employer groups. We saw it in relation to the HIA. We saw it in relationto the ACC!. This is a concerted blacken the name of anybody who dares stand up to the Prime Minister and his pretencations sions. The tragedy for you is that you have been caught up in the wake of this, little Echo. The tragedy for you is that you have become part of this web of deceit. The tragyou edy for you is that, without adult supervision, you have been pulled in. As I said in the House the other day, is it that the Prime Minister always accuses others of conspiring against him? Why is it that there is always a deal going on? I will tell you why: because this Prime Minister always accuses others of the standard of behaviour that he has himself. He could not conceive of the possibility that anybody could ever say a nice thing about a politician without having some quid pro quo. Why is that? Because nobody could say anything nice about the Prime Minister without some kind of quid pro quo. If we are talking about cross-media laws, you might actually deal with the allegations that are made in the Shawcross book. It was the Prime Minister who made the cross-media laws. It was the Prime Minister who just happened to deliver laws that created the same situation as Alan Ramsey reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 8 March 1995. Alan Ramsey states: And nobody was more single-minded in never offending either media baron than was the HonourMember for Blaxland. Keating would often in private it was he who ""made Kerry his first billion"" by his architecture of Labor's cross-media came. up rules in the mid-1980s ... Now we find that these cross-media rules are somehow designed to make sure that you do not get too much wealth or power or money. The fact was that they were orchestrated for the reverse. The fact was that the Prime Minister was the architect. The fact is that the Prime Minister made unfounded allegations. as The fact is that you were caught up in them. fact is that you are part of them. The fact Mr is that you ought to be censured by this House for your disgraceful smear and unpage of the founded allegations.",107
191,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Reith-I second the motion and reserve campaign to my right to speak.,108
192,Mr LEE,AND THE ARTS,"Do bell-Minister for Communiand the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (4.14 p.m.)-It is a pity the Leader of Sir the Opposition (Mr Howard) does not take this opportunity to speak in this debate. Have noticed the Leader of the Opposition has squibbed the debate? He is not prepared to come forward to speak because he was exwhy posed today at question time. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""this House censures the Leader of the Opposition for his rever-al of his media policy against media concentration and his refusal to state his policy towards the current threats to the cross-media ownership rules. The House further notes that the Opposition confusion on this matter comes against a background of the Government's success in achieving record job growth and the Opposition. Leader's own dereliction in dealing with front bench colleagues who steal documents related to court cases. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I invite you to address the content of that amendment .and the fact that, firstly, it deals with two subJects and, secondly, the last part of the amendment, as read to the House by the minister, reflected on the member for Barker in a way which, if he wishes to proceed down that path, he ought do by separate substantive motion. As such, I believe the amendment should be ruled out of order..",108
193,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"Whilst the deputy leader was speaking in this debate this afternoon, took the opportunity to refer to Houseo! Representatives Practice. I draw the attention of the Leader of the National Party to page 363. Reading that, I think that the proposal put forward by the minister is in order; but will be listening closely to the comments, particularly in relation to that last part of motion. Mr Lieberman- Mr Speaker, on a point order: the standing orders provide that amendperson ments are only dealt with by the House they are admissible. They have to deal with the subject matter, and in this case you have a very serious motion against the Minister for Communications and the Arts. You have a direct opposite now: you have an attempt by the government to move a censure motion sion-section 46! against the Leader of the Opposition. Sir, the standing orders are quite clear that that sort amendment is not admissible understanding orders. I ask you, Sir, to reflect on your ruling.",109
194,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"There is no point of The order. I have ruled on that but I would also say to the honourable member for Indi, Business because I think he is genuinely concerned MTIA ... about this, that there are precedents There was one, I think, in September last year when the same particular motion was then introduced, and there are other precedents. that basis, I am allowing it.",109
195,Mr LEE,AND THE ARTS,"Mr Speaker, the opposition's motion was moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the· honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the man who was hbist on his own petard on Tuesday when he went on the ABC. The honourable member for Higgins went on the program AM and, when he was. asked whether he would allow Mr Packer to own both Fairfax and Channel 9, he made the following comment:. Look, what we've always said is that we want strong anti-monopolistic laws run by the Trll.de Practices Commi-sion. And we're opposed; to market monopolisation always, always. The problem for the member for Higgins is that was a deliberate misleading of all of the people who were listening to AM that morning because the honourable member for Higgins, as the shadow attorney-general in I 1992, led the opposition campaign to stop Michael Duffy, the then Attorney-General, from tightening the merger provision. You were the person who was running as around arguing that the Business Council was I opposed to the tougher merger test. You were the person who was running around saying the that the MTIA and other big business organisations were opposed to a tougher merger test of in the Trade Practices Act. You were the who was leading the opposition's case when in opposing a tightening of the mergerMr Costello-The mergers provision!",109
196,Mr LEE,AND THE ARTS,The mergers provision sectionthat's the one. Mr Costello-Not the monopolies provi,109
197,Mr LEE,AND THE ARTS,"Let me quote from the speech of you made. Let me make it clearer from the speech you made in the Trade Practices Legislation (Amendment) Bill in 1992. This is what you said: proposal which is put by this Government in this Bill is a bad proposal. It is opposed by the Council, the Chamber of Commerce, the for this. You finish by saying: It is, of course, opposed by the Coalition. Yet he goes on the AM program on Tuesday On saying, 'We've always said that we want strong anti-monopolistic laws always, always, always'. He is the man who was trying to ensure that the Trade Practices Commission would have no role whatsoever in. mergers and takeovers such as this. He is not alone in that because when the current Leader of the Opposition was Malcolm Fraser's Minister for Business and ownership laws. Consumer Affairs,he was the person responsible for watering down the Trade Practices Act. He was the person responsible for lowerSenator ing the test from a substantial lessening competition to dominance. And this is pair, the Leader of the. Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who did all they could to make sure that we had weak anti-monopolistic laws for the Trade Practices Commission. Yet he had the hide to go on the AM program and claim that this was the public feather that he would use to protect himself  attempts to purchase the Fairfax newspapers. But what did Professor Allan Fels, the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, have to say about the opposition's claims we could rely on the Trade Practices Act to  AAP release which came from the Trade Practices Commission yesterday. It is under the heading, 'TPC could not stop Packer on Fairfax', and I quote: A spokesman for the Trade Practices Commission said today that if the cross-media laws were removed, trade practices rules would not prevent  sion interests in the same city. So the proposal which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposiownership tion are putting forward-that we can repeal the cross-media ownership laws and rely on the Trade Practices Act, is a signal to Packer, saying that the opposition believes  Fairfax newspapers as well. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition claims that there were very highly specific allegations made by me. I would like to to remind the House of what I actually said Monday. I said that I was aware of informaFairfax papers. tion that I believed linked the Leader of the Opposition to the allegations which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has put forward. At question time. I said that that information came from the Packer camp and that I was told by them-that is, the Packer camp-that the Liberal Party had indicated that it would be preparedtb support them and, if elected to government, would remove the cross-media That is why the government has been asking the Leader of the Opposition and Alston to tell us what they have been  the there at Park Street. The golden rule in politics is: there is no such thing as a secret. If the Leader of the Opposition and Senator  telling them they would be prepared to support a relaxation of the rules, we think the of Australia have a right to know that. Is it any wonder we get suspicious when on eight occasions the Leader of the Opposition has been asked to tell us whether he will rule  because he now owns the Nine Network? On that all of those occasions the Leader of the Opposition has refused to tell us whether he This is an thinks it is undesirable. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on five occasions yesterday, also declined to say whether he thought it was undesirable for that to take place. So it is very clear that all the signals are there that the Leader of the Oppo that they think it is okay for him to own televiChannel 9 and the Fairfax newspapers. We on this side of the House think that is not a good thing. We think that cross-media rules are there to promote diversity of ownership. We are not alone in thinking only that. On Monday someone who was either Mr impersonating the Leader of the Opposition or who looked a lot like him said, 'I am strongly in favour of diversity'. That is what he said in his doorstop on Monday. Yet on 13 occasions the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have refused tell us whether they think it is undesirable  We now come to looking at whether the Leader of the Opposition's claims have been consistent. In his contribution here today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition claimed that the views of the Leader of the Opposition have been genuinely held. They were genuinely held in 1987 when he told us that he thought the rules were unworkable; they were genuinely held when he said today that he thinks the cross-media ownership rules should be abolished. But we do not understand the doughnut in the middle-:-the petition he signed in 1991, where he said he was in  Fairfax. That is the thing we find difficult understand.",109
198,Mr WILLIS,AND THE ARTS,But he was not responsible then.,111
199,Mr LEE,AND THE ARTS,"As the Treasurer reminds me, his excuse is that he was not then the Leader of the Opposition or the spokesman on communications, as if that in some way absolves someone from having to justify the inconsistency of their opinions. This is a man who goes around the country as honest John, who never deliberately misleads people. Yet on Monday he put out a press release that deliberately tried to mislead everyone concerned into thinking that his view had not changed since 1987. I think we should all concentrate on what the Leader of the Opposition said on A Current Affair last night. He was asked on three occasions whether he would rule out support papers. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that appearance this morning under the heading 'Cross-media rules: Howard may let Packer have it all'. Our view is that Mr  rules: Howard will let Packer have it all.' That is our view. It can be ruled out simply by the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston telling us what they have said to Mr Packer and his executives. Why will you not tell us whether or not you  reason to think that an incoming Howard government would in some way water down the cross-media ownership rules? Ray Martin questioned Mr Howard and asked him, 'Should any man or woman own a television network in Australia and also the main publishing group?' That was a fair enough question from Ray Martin. Mr Howard answered, 'Well, it depends on what the other players in all of the media markets are. It depends on a whole range of factors'. Here is the killer: 'I am not going to say yes or no to that question. Why should I?' Mr Elliott-Honest John!",111
200,Mr LEE,AND THE ARTS,"That is honest John, as the honourable member for Parramatta said. Mr Howard said, 'I am not going to answer that to question. Why should I?' That is a question that goes to the integrity of media coverage in Australia; a question that goes to whether or not the riChest man in Australia-the man who owns the National Nine network, the most popular network-should also own one of the most influential newspapers in the country. On this side of the House we make it clear that we think the cross-media ownership rules carry out a very essential role in broadcasting policy. Given Senator Alston's stream of consciousness, it is not hard 'to find one or two press releases and comments from him saying that he supports a tightening of the rules, abolishing the rules, and a review of the rules. In fact, Senator Alston has put out so many press releases and given so many interviews on this issue that it is not hard to find him supporting every possible position that has been advocated. For that reason we think that the opposition has a few questions to answer. The Leader of the Opposition has come into the House. I draw his attention to the comment he made on A Current Affair last night. It looks as if the Leader of the Opposition is going to enter this debate. I welcome that, because it might give him a chance to answer a few questions. He might be able to tell us  Leader of the Opposition might be able to tell  and his executives. Have Mr Howard and Senator Alston given the Packer camp any reason to think that a Howard government would support a relaxation of the cross-media ownership rules? That is the question the Leader of the Opposition has to answer when he gets up to respond. That is what he can tell us. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition tries to tell us that in some way the government's  because he went on A Current Affair. r will tell him what started this whole fracas- It started in November when this side of the  against the opposition proposal. This  Party, the party that has introduced competia tion in aviation and telecommunications, will not introduce new monopoly rights in cable'. That is a principle and a consistent position which the Labor Party has advocated. More competition is good for our economy. Who is the only figure in public life in  mands for monopoly rights in cable? AnswerMr Latham-Alston!",111
201,Mr LEE,AND THE ARTS,"Senator Richard Alston, as the honourable member for Werriwa said. Senator Richard Alston is the man who said, 'Well, franchises have worked well in America and Britain and I think Australia should give greater consideration to them'. That is the date from which this blue started. The Leader of the Opposition can certainly make it clear today. He can clear up the whole matter by  those telephone conversations and what Senator Alston has said in his conversations with the executives of Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd. Has Mr Howard or Senator  executives any reason to think that a Howardintegrity led coalition government would support a weakening of the cross-media ownership rules? Why have you refused on eight occasions to tell us whether you would oppose Mr Packer purchasing the Fairfax newspapers? They are the questions for you to answer. It is time you gave us some answers.",112
202,Mr HOWARD,AND THE ARTS,"If before today I had entertained any doubt at all that I am really getting under the skin of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and that I am really getting under the skin of all those failures who sit on the government front bench, it has been confirmed today by the very interesting and salient fact that twice in the space of a week the government has been so worried about me that it has taken the unprecedented step of moving a censure motion. If you think that th-t is an intimidating, clever, sophisticated parliamentary tactic, can I tell you. that I side of wear it like a badge of honour, I look forward to the day when you' move censure motion' against me every day that this parliament sits because that will remind me and it will remind the mainstream of the Australian community that the person youand that man you serve like an acolyte, the Prime Minister-are really concerned about in Australian politicians is me. Long may you go on doing that, because I have got some news for you and all your mates on the front bench: I am going to bug you on the political stage of Australia until you are driven from office at the next election for the miserable failures you are. Do you think that in' some way I am really sort of overwhelmed or intimidated by this little tawdry performance? You are the person who for three days this week did not have the guts to come into this parliament and defend yourself against attack. But, with the first attack that you made on me, I had the guts to get up and defend myself. But not you, you little Sir Echo; you hide behind the factional skirts of your patron, the Prime Minister. Can I just remind you that this debate is about one very simple thing; it is about the of the Prime Minister of Australia. He put his integrity on the line. He asked the Australian people to believe him and to disbelieve me. He lied to the Australian people-I repeat that he lied to the Australian people-as he has done on so many occasions, about",112

204,Mr HOWARD,AND THE ARTS,"Sit down, you mug. Mr Beazley interjecting",112
205,Mr HOWARD,AND THE ARTS,Exactly.,112
206,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,Order! I might just again caution both sides about parliamentary language. I invite the Leader of the OppositionMr Tuckey interjecting,112
207,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"No, not even in censure motions.",113
208,Mr HOWARD,AND THE ARTS,"If the Leader of the House thinks those sorts of bellicose interjections are going to put anybody off their game on this side of the House, he is completely mistaken. This debate is about one very simple thing-that is, whether the government can substantiate the false, lying claim that I made a secret deal with Mr Kerry Packer. It is about nothing else. It is not a question of whether the government's media policy is good or our media policy is bad or ought to be changed. It has absolutely nothing at all do with that. This started by the Prime Minister lying through his teeth by saying that I had made  to provide evidence. Evidence is, as you know, material which supports the allegation. The allegation was that I had made a secret deal. Yet, for all the words that have been uttered, for all the huffing and puffing that has occurred today, you have produced not one skerrick of evidence. Michael, you know deep down in your heart that you have been caught out on this. You have been serving the Prime Minister. You have been slavishly backing up the Prime Minister like the faithful little boy Sir Echo you really are to the Prime Minister. You know deep down that you have not made one skerrick of a case against me. You can talk about media policy and you can, as you inevitably will, use your weight of numbers to pass this motion today. The more you do that, the more you will underline your sensitivity towards me-and the more I welcome it. I hope you pass a censure motion on me every day. The more censure motions you pass, the more I recognise the political threat that I pose to your leader. I keep picking up the paper of a morning and seeing stories written out of Singapore and Germany saying, 'Really it's a long-term strategy.' It is so clever. You start off by making a false allegation, you go quiet for a week, then you go overseas and you revive the allegation. You hijack a press conference with the Prime Minister of Singapore, insulting one of our Asian neighbours by doing so, then you go off to Germany and say, 'This is terrible. This should be talked about back in Australia.' What is the explanation for this? You go down to the back of the plane and say, 'Really it is a long-term strategy to ensnare Howard.' It is so subtle, it is so sophisticated. But instead of it ensnaring Howard, it has ensnared Lee, because was he was not told that the script had changed. It is so secret, sophisticated and convoluted that the only people who really understand it are the Prime Minister and his minders who put it together. It passes strange that we in this House to should have lectures about media policy from people who speak on behalf of the Prime Minister. If media policy in Australia is an unmitigated mess in 1995, it is the fault of one person more than anybody else: the Prime Minister of Australia. The Prime Minister of Australia is the proud author of the policy known as 'You have to be either queen of the screen or prince of print'. The real code language is not that you have to be one thing or the other but that when the policy was devised it was devised with one sole objective in mind: to undermine, even destroy, the old Fairfax media empire and the Herald and Weekly Times empire. No person bears a greater responsibility for the high level of foreign ownership of the Australian media, and any existing levels of concentration of Australian media, than Paul Keating. Paul Keating has done more to hand the media of this country over to foreigners and has done more to concentrate media ownership than any politician left standing in Australia. The last person who ought to have the nerve to raise media policy in this parliament is somebody who seeks to speak on behalf of the Prime Minister of Australia. It was the Prime Minister of Australia who told the former editorial manager, Max Suich, of the Fairfax media empire in the late 1980s how much he hated the Fairfax newspapers and how much he was bent on destroying them. We all remember that very accurate report of a cabinet meeting in the mid-1980s when the then Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, supported by the now Prime Minister, Paul Keating, was trying to get the media laws of this country changed. Nobody could quite understand what their end game was because there seemed to be no rhyme or reason or logic in what they were trying to do. In the middle of it, with that great capaciclaim. ty for spotting humbug and isolating what somebody was up to, John Button said, 'Hey, Bob, will you tell us which of your media mates you are trying to help so we'll know what you want us to do?' That was very well documented. The only two people on the government side who emerged with any merit or credit from that were John Button and the soon to be retiring member for Holt, Michael Duffy. At least they showed a little bit of intestinal fortitude, integrity and honesty. Both of them were appalled at the tawdry actions of your former Prime Minister and your current Prime Minister - the man you desire to serve on all occasions. Mr Elliott interjecting",113
209,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,Order!,114
210,Mr HOWARD,AND THE ARTS,"Mr Speaker, I do not need any protection from that little boy. They were the two men who were the architects of the high level of foreign ownership of the Australian media. Those opposite can interject all they like. They can belly-ache as much as they like. I will be very interested if the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is given free reign to take part in this debate. Watch him go. Got him in one. There sits another honest Labor man. Mr Costello-He knows what happened.",114
211,Mr HOWARD,AND THE ARTS,"He knows what happened and he knows what a shambles the present media policy of this country is. He knows what a disgrace it is for the current Prime Minister of Australia to talk about integrity and consistency when it comes to media policy. The only thing that is at issue in this debate, and the only person who is on trial in this debate, is the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). The simple question I ask again, as people all around Australia have been asking over the last week: where is your evidence to support the allegations? To use that great Australian expression, why don't you put up or shut up? You have been invited time and time again to put up or shut up but you have not had the intestinal fortitude, the guts or the plain Australian courage to actually backup your The reason you have not done that, the reason you have conjured up this alternative censure motion and paid me the compliment that it represents, the reason you are feigning this infected indignation about alternative policies is that you do not have any evidence to back your claim. You have been blown out of the water. One thing surprised me about the Prime Minister; that is, I never thought he would blink. When it actually came to making an allegation, 1 never thought he would walk away from it. 1 was really amazed to get a long distance blink from the Prime Minister. I do not think I could bear a short distance blink from the Prime Minister, but I got a long distance blink when he was in Hanover.",114
212,Unknown,AND THE ARTS,Government members interjecting,114
213,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,Order! Those on my right!,114
214,Mr HOWARD,AND THE ARTS,"I knew 1 got the long distance blink when I heard the Prime Minister say to the media in Hanover, 'I think we should start talking about the republic.' This is the man who can talk to President Suharto about the republic. He can talk to the press of Japan about the republic. He can talk to the Prime Minister of Britain about the republic. He can talk to the President of the United States about the republic. The only people he cannot talk to about the republic are the people of Australia. He does not want the Australian people to be taken into his confidence. One of my colleagues said to me the other day, 'It is a 1995 version of the cultural cringe.' Australians years ago used to seek the artistic endorsement of foreigners. Then they sought the professional endorsement of foreigners. Then they sought the business endorsement of foreigners. I thought we had put all of that behind us. 1 thought we had reached a stage in Australia's history where we could proudlyGovernment members-You haven't.",114
215,Mr HOWARD,AND THE ARTS,"Who is seeking the endorsement of foreigners in the media debate? You are. You are the people who produced the high level offoreign ownership. I thought we had put all of that cultural cringe behind us. I thought we were a nation that could proudly make decisions about the things that affected the future of this country unhindered by the sanction or unconcerned by the opprobrium of foreigners. However, I find that, when it comes to the constitutional future of this country, the Prime Minister of Australia seeks not the approval of the Australian people; he craves the blessing of foreign leaders. I find that demeaning in every extreme. I find it a 1995 version of the great Australian cultural cringe. Through all of this, the government has failed to substantiate the allegation of the week. It has failed to support the lie of the week-which will now be the lie of the year-by the Prime Minister of Australia that I entered into a secret deal with Mr Kerry Packer. The Prime Minister made that allegation. He had no evidence to support it. He has been demonstrated to be wrong. His integrity has been destroyed, as has that of the minister for communications. The very fact that this censure motion has been moved against me today, which pleases me no end, is the final proof of the ignominious failure of this deceitful, lying smear tactic of the Prime Minister.",115
216,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"Before I call the Leader of the House, I think the right honourable member for New England wants to raise an issue with me in reference to the motion.",115
217,Mr SINCLAIR,AND THE ARTS,"Mr Speaker, this motion has only just been circulated to members. In examining it and in relating it to standing orders 75 to 78, I suggest that the words concluding the motion are totally against our standing orders. I recommend to you that the words 'who steal documents related to court documents' be deleted.",115
218,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"I have been looking at the motion since I have had it, and I have to say that the question before the House is essentially in relation to media policy. The question of integrity certainly was raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I would be much happier if those last few words were deleted.",115
219,Mr BEAZLEY,AND THE ARTS,"Certainly. I will be happy to do it. The amendment now reads: That all words after ""That"" be deleted and the following words be inserted: ""This House censures the Leader of the Opposition for his reversal of his media policy against media concentration and its refusal to state its po licy towards the current threats to the cross-media ownership rules. The House further notes that the Opposition confusion on this matter comes against a background of the Government's success in achieving record job growth. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) rorts the issue in any way, and that gives me the opportunity to do that. Mr Costello-- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Before the Leader of the House commences, should he not indicate to you which of the words have been struck out and where the amendment will end?",115
220,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"The amendment will now end at 'the colleagues' and the other words will come out. Mr BEAZLEy-It will actually end at 'job growth'. I am delighted because the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition actually provideMr Williams- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The amendment has been circulated but the original motion has not. I ask that the original motion be circulated as well.",115
221,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,That will be done.,115
222,Mr BEAZLEY,AND THE ARTS,"I am glad the Leader of the Opposition spoke in this debate because he originally decided that he would not do so. After actually hearing his contribution, you can understand why he arrived at that earlier conclusion. He subsequently decided to come in here and participate in the debate. Fortunately, in his remarks-because he referred to an earlier censure motion this week-he provides us with the opportunity to make reference to that debate as well. It is no longer necessary for us to put that in our proposition. The first thing to note about the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition is that he is not being censured for the second time this week. He referred to the motion of censure at the beginning of the week, but that was not moved upon the Leader of the Opposition. It shows you how much attention he pays in this place. The motion of censure was moved on the honourable member for Barker.",115
223,Mr HOWARD,AND THE ARTS,Is that your killer point?,116

226,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"Order! Those on my left! The Leader of the House might resume his seat for a moment. Mr Nehl- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the fact that, throughout the speech of the Leader of the Opposition and again throughout the speech of this minister, the honourable members for Dunkley, Werriwa, Parramatta and Lilley have continually interjected while not being in their places. I think you should remind them of the standing orders.",116
227,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"I remind all members of them, but I also remind those of my left that it is not in order to stand at the dispatch or wherever else and interject while the minister has the call. I call the minister.",116
228,Mr BEAZLEY,AND THE ARTS,"When the Leader of the Opposition spoke in this debate, he discussed cross-media ownership rules, foreign ownership rules and media policy generally. Throughout his speech, he failed to refer to not only current opposition policies but past opposition policies. After hearing the Leader of the Opposition debate the issues that surrounded the decisions last decade--changes to the ownership rules to separate ownership of the electronic media from ownership of the print media-a reasonable person would think that his remarks indicate that the opposition stood in diametrical opposition to us on those particular propositions. They supported us. They supported us on changes we put in place at the time. They merely said that they had some vague concerns about them, but their concerns did not go to the opportunity to establish a network in television-which was the basic element of the electronic media one, apart from the cross-media ownership rules at the time. They did not oppose that proposition. In so far as they had any difficulties with it at all, they had difficulties with whether or not you could move from owning one or two stations in major metropolitan centres around the country to owning any number of them. Then they had doubts as to whether you ought to be excluded from the print media in those centres at the same time. That was the area of their doubt. So, if you listened to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, you would think that he stood here as a devotee of diversity. You would think that the government had somehow failed in its task to ensure diversity, and that that was the reason the governmentamong others-should be censured for its long standing media policies in this area. That happens not to be true. The only thing consistent about the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to these matters is his vagueness. He has been vague when he was taken to task by the press on what his policies now happen to be. He was vague then. The media release he re-released earlier this week is such a typical box opposition presentation on media policy that it is worth recounting. The style of presentation has not changed over the years. The basic thrust is, 'For God's sake, do not force us to commit ourselves in any detailed fashion on anything related to media policy. Please let us stand around the place, shouting out that the government's policy is a mess but, for God's sake, do not tie us down.' The Leader of the Opposition said: The opposition sees merit in the Government's proposal to removing the existing two-station rule. At this stage, we are disposed to support the Government's proposal and that any television network should have the right to reach 75 per cent of the viewing audience. However we should be looking carefully at the report of the Senate Select Committee, established at the initiative of the Opposition, as we are particularly keen to ensure that the introduction of the 75 per cent rule does not unfairly disadvantage regional television stations. The Opposition also believes that as part and parcel of the removal of the two-station rule and the introduction of the 75 per cent principle there should be a removal of the existing barriers to entry into both television and radio. This is those opposite supporting the ability to set up a television network in this country. But where did they have a problem with it? They came to a problem on this point: On the question of cross-media ownership we are not convinced that the prohibitions proposed by the Government are either necessary or can be justified. So the official position of the opposition was at that stage: you could have a network and you could own newspapers in all· the areas where you had that network. He hates a reference to history when it is a reference to history that deals with himself. He loves a reference to history when he thinks it makes a point about the Prime Minister (Mr point K,eating) .. That is the first point that you would make about the Leader of the Opposition. Then he said: The Government's policies encourage foreign ownership. There is an interesting fact in the 1991 document-which I will get to a bit later-about a petition he signed adopting a policy that he said he had never espoused. That petition, even though it was a matter of debate at time, contains no reference to foreign ownership. There is a specific reason why it contains no mention of foreign ownership. That was that whilst there was a substantial amount of bipartisan unity, I have to say, having been on the receiving end of a lobbying about it as a minister in the portfolio at the time, on further. defending the cross-media ownership rules that they previously opposed, there was no bipartisanship on the subject of foreign ownership. Why was there no bipartisanship on the subject offoreign ownership? For this reason: the government was supportive of putting limitations on it; the opposition was not. Whatever level of foreign ownership has been achieved, and whether or not you regard that level of foreign ownership as suitable or contrary to the national interest, if the opposilogic tion had had policy control at that point in time, it would have been greater. This is the style of argument of the person who wants to be regarded as a man of great integrity in this place, the Leader of the flopped. Opposition. You make an accusation about government, you attack it from both the left and· the right and you hope to God nobody reviews your history. If he does review your history, you get up around the gallery and inform them of what it is that you think that they are up to, trying to obfuscate the defence of themselves or whatever by the propositions they put. He is being very free in this debate and out in the public forum with his accusations of lying. He has, nevertheless, produced a statement at the beginning of this week which was an out and out lie. That was actually picked up, funnily enoughMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a of order. You, Mr Speaker, have previously ruled in this area where the accusation . of lie and lying has been made. I submit to you on balance that this one falls on the other side of the ledger and should be dealt with accordingly.",116
229,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,Order! I also said during the debate today that I would hope that both sides in this debate would reflect upon what is unparliamentary language. But I do recall the on a number of occasions the Leader of the Opposition using that terminology in the way which it has been used.,117
230,Mr BEAZLEY,AND THE ARTS,"I will not use it again, Mr Speaker, which was not a requirement placed upon the Leader of the Opposition. I just use it that once and now illustrate the point It was a very interesting interview the other night on Ray Martin's show. In the same way as he should not have entered this debate, he ought not to have gone on Ray Martin's show last night, because Ray Martin, who is a good interviewer, had the integrity to go through with him his 1991 position as opposed to his 1987 position, which was about as vague as you could have put it but did actually emerge at the end of the day as being one of opposition to cross-media ownership rules. So we will give him what he said as back in 1987, even though by very tortuous he finally arrived at opposition to the ownership rules. Nevertheless, in 1991 he was absolutely clear cut. The transcript states: Martin: Now what about the suggestion today in Parliament by Kim Beazley that you've flipThat in fact you were a party to a petition the in 1991 that called for tougher rules? Howard: Well, that was the Opposition's policy at that particular timeeven though he had said privately and publicly that he had been devoted to a looser crossmedia ownership ruleMartin: But you signed that petition? Howard: Well, I wasn't the Leader of the Opposition then, and I wasn't the spokesman on communications and I went along as a team player, I went along with the Opposition's situation. It is all right to sling around accusations about the Prime Minister, that he is a man without integrity and tells lies. But we now know the criteria by which John Howard is prepared to mislead the public as to his point of view. He will be prepared to mislead the public as to his point of view when he is not the spokesman on communications; when he is not the Leader of the Opposition; when he is a team player; and when he goes along with the opposition situation. We now know the price tag that is placed by the Leader of the Opposition on his personal integrity as far as that is concerned. I would say it is a pretty diverse caveat on the requirement for him to tell the truth. One thing that is consistent about the opposition position is the slipping and the sliding. There has been a slipping and a sliding on this. The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Oh, no, I do not have any particular deal in this situation. I go along and have a couple of chats. In the course of those couple of chats I reveal that I have informed Mr Packer that my position privately and publicly is that which it was back in 1987.' Smarm, smarm. He says, 'It is no problem as far as I am concerned. I don't agree with the prince of print and the queen of screen and all the rest of it. I never have, except when he bid last time as part of the Tourang consortium in 1991 for Fairfax. Then I was opposed to it. So I do have something to explain. I just want to give you my assurance, Sir, that that little dereliction on my part was due to the fact that I wasn't Leader of the Opposition at the time; I was not the spokesman on communications. I went along as a team player. I went along with the opposition's situation. So please ignore that, Sir, and remember that back in 1987 I would have given you the lot. But please don't support me. Please don't get out there on your channels and say anything nice about me. No, please don't do that; just be absolutely clear that I have crawfished away from that terrible position that I took on the Tourang bid. I beg your forgiveness. We don't have any conspiracy going, do we? There is no special pleading here.' What a gutless, snivelling, crawling performance that is. Then he has a little difficulty because somebody wants to ask him to sharpen up in his policy area and to say something a bit straightforward about all this. So he is finally brought down. When asked, 'Tell us what you would do. You sort of said you were with him back in 1987,' he said: I am very strongly in favour of diversity and it's worth saying that the man who's done more to concentrate foreign ownership and single proprietor ownership, of the Australian media is Paul Keating. Another question: But do you think it is undesirable? Mr Howard replied: I think it's undesirable to have too heavier concentration in anything, whether it's newspapers, television or the lot, but I don't think it's desirable to personalise it, I think you have to have rules and principles. He was then asked: But do you think there should be a rule, do you agree that there should be some sort of rule to avoid the ownership of a major newspaper in a city and one of the major television networks? He replied: I think there should be a rule to prevent too much concentration of ownership and the question of whether you best do it by a specific rule or whether you do it in some other way was the essence of what I said back in 1987. Absolute bulldust! He was asked: But what I'm trying to get at, is to which Mr Howard said: I know what you're trying to get at, and I've given you my answer. He was asked: ... undesirable circumstance? The answer was: I think it is desirable to have as much diversity as possible. In answer to another question, he stated: WelI'it would depend on the size of the market and how you define the market. Well, fair dinkum: you are a very lucky man. The press has let you lot off the hook on this one during this week. When it comes to a particular policy debate, you have been jumping up and down on both sides of this issue, desperately trying to arrive at a conclusion, but with one underlying theme: 'We shall bow at the altar of whoever it is who might provide us with a useful level of political support. If those folk are around, we will apologise for past attitudes that we have taken on this matter which may have had cause to give grievous offence. And if those past attitudes are pointed out to us in a way that makes us look like we are a pack of liars, without integrity, as we slither into our hollows on this one, we will explain it by the fact that we had no official responsibilities at the time and we were just going along with the mob.' The Leader of the Opposition, at the end of the day, never learns. He has spent a lifetime going along with the mob and he does not deserve the attention of this parliament on this matter. (Time expired)",117
231,Mr REITH,AND THE ARTS,"Whilst the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has developed a well known routine in his presentation, it was one of the most pathetic presentations I have heard from him for a long time, because the challenge for him was a very simple challenge, and that was to produce some evidence to back up the claim. He started by making a point about how many times they had censured the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), which was pathetic in itself. That was his opening point. He then got the amendment wrong and had to change tack on that. He then ran out of time. He filled his 15 minutes with nothing but bluster. It really demonstrates the case which is the censure motion against the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). I say to the Minister for Communications and the Arts: if we look at his ashen faced complexion, you know, and we know that you know, there was no deal. The minister and I were sworn in together in this place in early 1985. I have been watching him for some time. I suppose it is fair to say that his the Labor Party has been largely uninterrupted. The Labor Party has been in office and he has been able to ride in on the coat-tails of others to assume now the high office of minister for communications. In the last 10 years I think there are a couple of lessons that he ought to have learnt about politics. The first thing is that a lot of people think that politics is a game. It is true that politics has many of the characteristics of a game. It has the rough and tumble of a game. It has the theatre of a game. From time to time you have the professional free kick taken by one side, whilst breaking the rules, to still give their side a benefit. That is accepted when you are playing a game. But the fact is that this is not a game. Yes, it has the characteristics of a game but politics is no game. I think that when we look into your face, minister, you realise that simple fact. When you set out deliberately, maliciously and without justification to smear, when you set out to conspire with othersand, in particular, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-to attack the reputation of another and impugn the integrity of a member of this House, doing so in a baseless and malicious way, you damage your own reputation. The Leader of the Opposition is not damaged by this; you are the one who is damaged by this. Sure, you are going to use your numbers and knock off our censure motion. You will put through your silly amendment. But the reality is, minister, that this damage is damage that you will incur. . I understand why. You owe your place in political life to the Prime Minister. He is your promoter. Just as he knelt at the knee of Jack Lang and learned the tricks of the trade of the New South Wales Right, you sit on the knee of the Prime Minister and learn the lessons of politics from him. As you consider your political career, you think that you owe him; but I would say to you, minister-and this is the second lesson for you-that you are a young bloke compared with the Prime Minister. In fact, the Prime Minister has been here a long time. I do not think he will·be here that much longer. You are 37 years old, you are a very young fellow-in fact, you are rise in very young by your actions as well. The reality is that your reputation will ultimately be built not on the fact that you have been able to hang onto the skirts of the Prime Minister but on the basis of your actions in this place. You might think that your reputation is one that is built only on what your colleagues think of you, but you are wrong. Ultimately, if you are going to have a reputation in this place, it will be a reputation that rests on the opinions of everybody in this House--even people on our side of this House. We will not forget this malicious, nasty, little smear campaign that you have been running and, ultimately, your reputation will be based on what sort of person you are. I heard the Prime Minister say the other day-and it is a classic Keating quote-'If I were Howard, I'd have had a plan that would drive me mad.' The way the Prime Minister is going on, we do not need a plan because he is pretty mad already-absolutely mad. He will not be here much longer, minister. So you will have to stand on your own two feet and build your own reputation. You work on the basis of the philosophy you have learnt from the New South Wales Right, which is: say anything and do anything. It is a sort of 'whatever it takes' philosophy. The reality is that, if you do not do the right thing-if you do not stand up today as you have been provided the opportunity to do-and admit the error of your ways, then this reputation about you will stick. I suppose that, in your imagination, you may think that you are the next Paul Keating, and Richo told you that you had those prospects. But I have got news for you. You are not the next Paul Keating, mate; you are the next Ros Kelly, the whiteboard lady. They say you are the rising star. The last we had around this place was the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths). What we found out about the member for Maribyrnong was that he could not even run a sandwich shop. That is your destiny, if this is the standard which you are going to set. I just say, by way of an aside, that we have not seen the Codd report on the member for Maribyrnong. It is about time it was produced. Before I set out the case against you, which is an open and shut case if ever I saw one, let me just deal very briefly-it will not take long to deal with because not much was said by you people-with the basis of yourresponse. Your response simply is one based on an argument about coalition policy. You build your case, not on secret deals, but on all our public statements. It is bizarre in that you guys start with a proposition that there is a secret deal but, when we put the heat on you for the evidence, your evidence consists of the public commentS of the Leader of the Opposition. I will come back to the comments you made on Monday night in a minute. It was interesting to hear that your defence today was based on the Leader of the Opposition's remarks last night on television. Perhaps it is a good tryon your part, but the reality is that the charge against you is that you set out maliciously to smear the Leader of the Opposition. That is the charge you have got to answer, and you have dismally failed to do so. If it were simply a matter of a disagreement about coalition policy, then I would remind you that, on that basis, we would be mounting a similar argument against Mr Keating. Mr Keating himself has said that really he questions the ongoing relevance of the cross-media ownership because of the way in which technology is changing. I reckon that allegation would have a hell of a lot more credit if it came from us. Do you know why? Because if anybody has ever done deals in this country, it is you blokes, not us. It is amazing. You go all the way back to 1987 and get stuck into John Howard, but the fact is that, if you go back to what John Howard said in 1987 on the public record, Kerry Packer was backing you guys, not us-and rising star that said so pUblicly. We come to this with clean hands. This whole thing started off with one simple statement - with Kerry Packer expressing the views that most Australians have-that is, that John Howard is a pretty decent, honest bloke and he is not a bad alternative Prime Minister. Sure, in your eyes this is a political crime of absolutely huge dimensions. The thought that this is an idea that is going to sweep the country absolutely sends shivers up your spine. ",119
232,Mr REITH,AND THE ARTS,"It does. It drives them mad. It drives them troppo, as Senator Alston said. But that is the reality of it, and that is where this whole thing started. Let me just go to what you said so we can come to the charge that we have against you. What you said on Monday night, Minister, was a pretty clear statement. This is what you said: I along with a number of other people are certainly aware of information which we believe links Howard to the allegations which the Prime Minister has put forward. You furthermore said: Ah, well, I think that the claim that the evidence only circumstantial is based on a claimed ledge as to who might have passed on the tion to the Prime Minister. If the person who passed on the information to the Prime Minister was in a position to know, then I think it's pretty firm evidence. Then Lyndall Curtis asked: And you believe they were in a position to know? Your answer: Absolutely. That is a pretty clear statement. That is clear statement that you had evidence as to whom, as to when and as to the detail. The reality is that you have not. The whole week, Minister, we have provided you with opportions. tunities. We have asked you the what of this allegation; we have asked you the when of this allegation; and we have asked you the do so. who of this allegation-who was it that provided the information? At every opportunisured. ty, you have walked away from the question. You did not even have the guts to front up to question time yesterday. You were up there watching Sesame Street and having afternoon tea. We had a division after question time and, 10 and behold, here you were. You have failed to respond to this charge on every occasion it has been brought up. Let us put the whole thing in context. What do we have here? We have nothing whatsoever other than a political campaign Minister, you have been brought up in a school of politics which thinks it is smart to run a smear campaign. You think that this the way in which good public policy is Minister's conducted. The reality is that it ain't. It serious allegation. You work on the basis that mud sticks. Well, this is mud that ain't going to stick, Minister. This is a campaign we intend to and do repel. You, of course, act in conjunction with the Prime Minister, and he is a master of the smear campaign. You think that you can profit by it, but if you look at it you will see that what we have is a situation where the Prime Minister attempts to hold on to his Mr office by the use of a smear campaign. In doing so, he demeans the office of Prime Minister. It is no wonder that there is a cynicism about Australian politics that has is developed in the last 10 years when people knowlike you and the Prime Minister act in the informaway you do---in a malevolent way. Minister, you have two simple choices. Your first choice is to substantiate your claim. We have given you repeated opportunities to do so. Instead, you and Mr Keating have repeated the claim. Your second choice is to salvage some credibility for what you have had to say. That would be to stand here and to admit that you have no evidence and to a very apologise, not only to the Leader of the Opposition but to the House generally, for the fact that you have waged a campaign for a week now on baseless, unsubstantiated allegaMinister, I say to you that a glimpse of decency, a whiff of honesty, might give you that chance to salvage. I do not expect you to The reality is that you deserve to be cenWhy do you deserve to be censured? You deserve to be censured because you lied. It is as simple as that. You have lied to this House, and you have lied to the Australian people. I think you also deserve to be censured because you have slavishly repeated the lies of others, and you have done so knowingly. There has never been any doubt in your mind, has there, Minister? Let us face it. There has never been any doubt in your mind that this whole thing was a malion your part. cious smear campaign. Lastly, Minister, you deserve censure not just for the fact that you lied, not just for the is fact that you slavishly repeated the Prime lies but for your political incompeis a tence in putting your own reputation in the hands of somebody like Keating. That is what you have done: you have put your own reputation in the hands of someone like Keating. And, I tell you, he won't be grateful, Minister. The fact is, he is off on one of his Europeanjaunts. He is off there in Berlin about to enjoy the sights. I think as we rise and go home to our electorates, it is 11 a.m. and an early start for the Prime Minister, who will off doing the sights of Berlin with the Mayor of Berlin, offering and pressing home his own ideas for improvements to the Berlin streetscape. That is a pretty busy day for him because then after that he will have 4Y2 hours of rest in which to prepare himself for. the gruelling main event of the day, dinner at the Schloss Charlottenberg hosted by the same unfortunate mayor who can look forward to his lecturing on Berlin streetscapes during the day. Whilst he is doing that, Minister, you will be reading the comment pieces that state that basically, you are a liar; you do not tell the truth; you are justa little Sir Echo in a malicious, grubby campaign to impugn the reputation of someone who has worked hard and, with justification, has a good reputation in this place. You deserve censure. (Time expired)",121
233,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,AND THE ARTS,"There was one simple way for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to resolve this matter. He had 20 minutes to do it. All he had to do was deny the allegation  he failed and refused to do so. We know why-because he has done the deal. We did not need his silence today. The case was proved conclusively yesterday and today by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and again today by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). If we did not need his silence today then we certainly got it last night on A Current Affair, Kerry's program on Kerry's station. It is very pertinent to read the transcript back into the record. Let us see what the Leader of the Opposition had to say last night in his interview with Ray Martin: MARTIN: How many times would you have   briefly on the phone, a couple of weeks after I became Leader of the Opposition, and I had one meeting with him subsequently to that, and the question of the Opposition's media policy was not raised at that discussion. No talk, of course, about how many conversations he mayor may not have had with him before he became Leader of the Opposition; be but I will leave that to one side-we know what Senator Alston said in respect of that matter. Mr Martin goes on with a subsequent question: Now what about the suggestion today in Parliament by Kim Beazley that you flip-flopped. That in fact you were a party to a petition in 1991 that called for tougher rules? HOWARD: Well that was the Opposition's policy at that particular time. MARTIN: But you signed that petition? HOWARD: Well, I wasn't the Leader of the Opposition then, and I wasn't the spokesman on communications and I went along as a team player, I went along with the Opposition's situation. MARTIN: But that's a petition again-October24, 1991. And this very revealing interview goes on: MARTIN: Well, let's shoot straight it would have been nice if we had had a straight answer last night from the Leader of the Opposition. And he could have solved all this today by giving a straight answer in the course of this debateShould Kerry Packer be allowed to own Channel 9 and the Fairfax group? HOWARD: Well, I don't think you should deal with these things-no pun intended-on the basis of personalities. We know why he does not want to deal with it on the basis of personalities. We know why he does not want to deal with it on the basis of the cross-media ownership rules. We know why he does not want to deal with it on the basis of the policies. Because we know he has done a deal with the personality-that is why. Mr Martin goes on to say: Should any man then? Let's forget personalities. Any man or woman should they own a television network in Australia and also the major publishing group? This is a very perceptive question from Mr Martin-it goes right to the heart of the policy. It continues: HOWARD: Well, it depends entirely on what the other players in all of the media markets are. It depends on a whole range offactors. I'm not going to say yes or no to that question. Why should I? That is the precise question to which he should say yes or no because that goes right to the heart of media policy. And he won't say yes or no because we know he has not put his mind to the policy-he has done a deal with the personality. All the Leader of the Opposition had to do today was to come into this House and say, 'We've all had allegations made against us before. I deny it. It's not true.' He did not say it, he would not say it, he cannot say it because he has done a deal-a deal that bears no relationship to policy, a deal that bears no relationship to public interest, a deal that bears no relationship to the best way of managing media policy in this country.",122
234,Mr TUCKEY,AND THE ARTS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to the relevance of this debate. An allegation has just been made about a deal. The member for Perth has another 10 minutes in which to identify the people with whom the deal was done or he insults them as well.",123
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The member for O'Connor was cautioned earlier today.,123
236,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,AND THE ARTS,"As I said at the outset: in any event, the case was proved conclusively yesterday and today by the Minister for Communications and the Arts and by the Leader of the House. And it was proved by the words of the Leader of the Opposition on the Ray Martin show last night. What do you have to do in this place to get a debate on the economy? When will those opposite come into this House and debate the economy? Today, as a result of the good graces of the Speaker, I got an MPI on the economy, on the employment figures. Those opposite ran away from that. They had to come up with this stunt. Last week I also put in an MPI on the economy and they put in one on sport. We then saw the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) parading as a sportsman for the first time in his life. What do you have to do? I was very pleased to see the amendment moved by the Leader of the House, such that we are now also deliberating this motion: That the House further notes the opposition's confusion on this matter comes against a background of the government's success in achieving record job growth. That is what those opposite do not want to talk about. They do not want to talk about the government's success in achieving record job growth. They do not want to talk about it because they hate it. In the 1980s, their leader said, 'The times will suit me.' He wanted the times to suit him. He wanted to have political success over the hardship of the Australian public. The times did not suit him then and they will not suit him now. Today, with the release of the February figures, we have seen record high levels of employment. More Australians are in employment today than ever before-over 560,000 new jobs since April 1993. After two years, the government has more than met the commitment it made in March 1993 for 500,000 new jobs in the course of this term. I remind the House what the previous opposition speaker, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith}-the then shadow Treasurer-had to say about that election promise. I quote from The Australian of 22 February 1993: The Opposition spokesman on Treasury matters,  Labor would be treading water on employment. 'It's a major embarrassment for the Government which shows that after three years of Labor the unemployment statistics could be worse. We have had seven years of the accord. Here's another accord and the situation will be worse in three years time,' he said. So that was the formal view of the opposition at the time we made our commitment. That target has now been bettered, and in two years rather than three. . What are some of the key characteristics of the figures released today? As I said, total employment growth since April 1993 is now 560,000. Over the last month, 91,000 full time jobs were created. More Australians have a job today than ever before. In the last 12 months alone, 210,000 new full-time jobs have been created. That goes with a rising participation rate of 63.3 to 63.7 per cent. In my own state, the participation rate is now as high as 66.7 per cent. These are the statistics and the analysis that those opposite do not wish to discuss because they know it does them no good politically and they hate it. They hate to come into this place and talk about jobs. They hate to come into this place and talk about economic growth. They like to come into this place and sit there, as the Leader of the Opposition did, not rising to his feet, not saying a simple word-as he could have said last night on the Ray Martin show-yes or no to the key question. He did not say it last night; he did not say it today.",123
237,Mr TUCKEY,AND THE ARTS,It is none of your business. It's none of Ray Martin's business. Mr Lee--He said it's none of Ray Martin's business.,124
238,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,AND THE ARTS,"It is only Ray Martin's business because he is asking the questions. They are the questions that the Leader of the Opposition refuses to answer. In his contribution, I was very pleased to hear him make the point that the Leader of the Opposition only likes history when it refers to someone else. I like the history that refers to the Leader of the Opposition. Some of the economic history that refers to him is the following: when John Howard was Treasurer the average rate of economic growth was 2.1 per cent; the rate of inflation when John Howard left office was 11.4 per cent; the average rate of inflation under John Howard was 9.7 per cent; the average number of jobs created by John Howard per year was 52,000. Mr Tuckey interjecting",124
239,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,Order! The member for O'Connor!,124
240,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,AND THE ARTS,"The average number of jobs per year for Labor has been over 150,000. Mr Beazley interjecting Mr Tuckey interjecting",124
241,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,I warn the member for O'Connor about interjecting across the table.,124
242,Mr TUCKEY,AND THE ARTS,He insulted me.,124
243,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,You are not in your right place and you are interjecting. Relax.,124
244,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,AND THE ARTS,"The Leader of the Opposition does not like history lessons that apply to him. As I have previously mentioned in the House-much to the dislike of the honourable member for O'Connorwhat is relevant to the past is often relevant to the future. I was very intrigued to see an extract from the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 September 1985. It was a most pertinent cartoon on John Howard. Little Johnny Howard is doing a doorstop and in the Petty cartoon he is quoted as saying, 'I would be less than loyal, honest, open and frank if I didn't admit my policies favour the rich, big, merciless and devious.' All Mr Howard had to do on the Ray Martin show last night was say yes or no. All he had to do in the House today was say yes or no. He failed or refused to do either. He is convicted by his own silence; he is convicted by the words from his own mouth on Ray Martin's show. I was also intrigued that at a time when the honourable member for Bennelong was making his silent and secret push to again become Leader of the Opposition there was an article in the Weekend Australian of 12-13 November under the heading 'New push for Howard falls short of a second coming'. It is by the Australian's national affairs editor Mike Steketee. It reads as follows: To adapt a comment made about one of the Liberals' election slogans: if the answer is John Howard, it must be a hell of a question. And so it is! Mr Steketee goes on to outline the attitude that a former colleague of Mr Howard had about the honourable member for Bennelong: The Liberal's, Peter Shack, the former .Liberal frontbencher, said of Howard ""... he was hopeless in the shadow cabinet because, as chairman, he wanted to do most of the talking"". We.: wish he would adopt the same approach in the House. We wish he would come into the House and say yes or no. We wish he would adopt the. same style that he. has in chairing shadow cabinet and come into the House or go onto the Ray Martin show and resolve this matter once and for all-yes or no. The reason he will not do it is that he has done a grubby deal. Mr Steketee concludes his article with the following: . . . a second Howard leadership simply would endorse the point made by the first: that he better out of the leadership that in it. He has been convicted by his own silence. He ought to come into this House and deny what he knows he cannot deny, because he knows, as a member of this House for over 20 years, that the one thing you cannot do in this House is mislead it. He knows that he cannot come into this House and deny that he has done a grubby secret deal which rides roughshod ()ver the media laws of this country and over decent policy so far as communications are concerned. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",124
245,Mr TIM FISCHER,AND THE ARTS,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (5.28 p.m.}-For the benefit of honourable members, I am very happy to speak in support of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and reject the amending censure aspect from the government. In so doing, I indicate that I will do so for some five minutes, followed by one member from the government side, and then we will vote on this matter. Let it be a vote on conscience. On that basis honest John Howard would win because the government talks about evidence, but what evidence has it produced? We have had the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) relying on Ray Martin's transcript. We have had the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) relying on Ray Martin's transcript. We have had the Minister for Finance and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) relying on Ray Martin's transcript. Every question the government would want to put up was there in Ray Martin's transcript. Ray Martin's transcript could have been written by a member of the government, but he is too professional for that. Who does Ray Martin work for? He works for Channel 9. Who owns Channel 9? Kerry Packer. The government wants us to believe that Kerry Packer has done a deal to give John Howard an easy time. What nonsense! What humbug! Indeed, so much humbug that it cannot even get its amendment right on the censure. In all my days as a member of this House I have never before seen the Leader of the House come in here with all his bravado, looks put down a huge draft amendment, which was then moved by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, and suddenly have the Speaker knock 30 per cent of the amendment out of order. Gone. Thirty per cent of the case mounted by the government has been literally torn up by none other than the Speaker. I am very pleased about that. The accusations are flying thick and fast. However, as the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) correctly pointed out, there is one central core issue. It is: where is the evidence? If there is no evidence, there is no deal. Where are the actual documents supporting the matter? Where are the telephone transcripts? Where are the statutory declarations? If this case was worth one iota of serious consideration, surely, they would have been able to produce one statutory declaration from someone in the Packer camp. But they have been unable to do so. It is hard to believe that, because they have been unable to do so, they have actually defamed their former senatorial colleague Graham Richardson, they have actually defamed the former Labor Hawke operator Peter Barron and, in a sense, they have  I have no particular desire to support or defend any particular media owner or operator in this country. I have met most of them over the years and they are big enough to defend themselves. The truth is, and we come right back to the nub point, that if there is no evidence, there is no deal. That is where this case rests at the end of this parliamentary sitting week, with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gone mad in Germany, Singapore and in just about every other port-he even managed to get excited at a refuelling stop in Dubai-and a government unable to back up the case and the Minister for Communications and the Arts taking the wrong line in the process. There is one other question I, being a person of fair and good humour, thought could have been asked of the Minister for Communications and the Arts today in all the circumstances. Given the minister's detailed knowledge of conspiracy theories, including the so-.called secret deal between Mr .Kerry Packer and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), can the minister also reveal Harold Holt's current Chinese address? Can he also reveal who killed President Kennedy? And, for the sake of Triple J, can the minister us where Elvis Presley is currently located? That is how extraordinary your conspiracy theories are. They are a load of nonsense. We know they are a load of nonsense and the people of Australia know they are a load of nonsense. In the last 18 hours I have been to two big functions in Sydney. This morning I went to Cobar for an important local government conference, to Bourke for a land protection board conference and",125
246,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AND THE ARTS,What are the Aboriginal people saying about the member for Barker?,126
247,Mr TIM FISCHER,AND THE ARTS,"I will tell you what the people are saying out there. They are saying: if there was any deal, why would the government not have produced any evidence--one bit of paper or one statutory declaration-to back up the matter? The truth is: no evidence; no deal. On that score, this minister stands absolutely condemned for his total failure to produce one shred of evidence to back up his inSUlting accusations of an honest Leader of the Opposition, honest John Howard.",126
248,Mr SWAN,AND THE ARTS,"This debate today, and statements from members of the opposition over the past four months, prove that they will say anything, do anything, think anything and do any deal to slime their way back into power. There is no doubt that this has been a Goebbels type campaign by the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and members of the front bench over there to turn themselves from hard Right ideologues into soft, furry, fuzzy, kind social democrats. But nobody believes you. You came into this House today and asked, 'Where's your evidence?' We are guilty because we do not have the evidence that you have done a deal with Kerry Packer! What sort of logic is that? You have done the deal. On the Ray Martin show last night your leader, the member for Bennelong, said that he was prepared to change the cross-media ownership rules. That is the evidence. Let us look at the deals you have done in recent times. Let us look at the backflips that have taken place in recent times. It took the memtell ber for Bennelong seven years to apologise for his remarks on Asian immigration. Who can believe him? It is not what you say; it is what you think. The next election is going to be some sort of mind-reading exercise when it comes to the opposition. No-one is going to believe what you say about Asian immigration. No-one is going to believe what you say about public spending. Nobody is going to believe what you say about the social security safety net. Nobody is going to believe what you say about industrial relations. They all know that Fightback is what you believe in-it is your bible. Every time we ask you what your current policy is you say, 'Fightback doesn't count any more, but we're not going to tell you what our policy is now.' The Leader of the Opposition said to Ray Martin last night, 'Ray, I'm not going to tell you. Let's not get into personalities.' I agree. Let us not get into personalities, let us get into a debate about the cross-media ownership rules and where the Liberal Party stands. It is very clear where you stand: you are going to water them down. It is very clear where you stand. You have  to junk the cross-media ownership rules, and you are going to do or say anything in a very grubby attempt to win votes at the next election. It will not work. You are not going to skate through the next election campaign pretending that you do not have any policies because we will take it up with you time and time again. The member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) is over there. Today he said that the employment figures were disappointing. He thinks that having created 560,000 jobs in the past two years is disappointing. Dr Kemp-I didn't say that.",126
249,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,"Order! The honourable member for Goldstein, don't be provoked. There is a form of the House that you can use later.",127
250,Mr SWAN,AND THE ARTS,"Why don't you come clean and admit that you don't care about the unemployed? You have no programs whatsoever. We have a program, and it is called Working Nation. Today there are 560,000 Australians working because of Working Nation. It is putting wealth back into the community and giving people a future. Mr Forrest- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not know whether you are listening very carefully to the member, to the things he is actually accusing you of in his continual reference to 'you'. I think you should ask him to address his remarks through the chair.",127
251,Mr SPEAKER,AND THE ARTS,I am very appreciative of the honourable member for Mallee for bringing that to my attention. I remind all members of this place to speak through the chair.,127
252,Mr SWAN,AND THE ARTS,"We know that those on the other side are experts at deal making. We know so from the Financial Review. We know how the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), went down. There was a meeting at the Chateau Hotel in December. Who was there? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) and the puppeteer of the Liberal Party, the person who pulls the strings on the opposition front bench, Mr Ron Walker, the person who funds the Liberal Party, the person who pays the piper, the person who gives $30 million a year to the Liberal Party, the person who is probably setting up offshore funding for the Liberal Party in South Australia and the person who is behind your attempts to avoid the disclosure legislation. Those opposite are experts at dirty deals behind the scenes. You know all about it. Members of the opposition are experts at doing deals. You were experts at doing deals when you junked the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, and when you junked the previous Leader of the Opposition. You know all about it. You will do anything, which is why you are prepared to engage in  why you will not come clean and admit that you have made that private commitment to junk the cross-media ownership rules. It is absolutely incredible that the only charge you make against this side of the House is that we do not have any evidence. We have the evidence of your policy. Otherwise, those opposite would come forward and admit that they support the current crossmedia ownership rules. Your failure to do so condemns you as deal makers extraordinaire. You will do anything and say anything in a sleazy attempt to mislead the Australian electorate. I can assure you that you will not get there.

Note The above table does not include staff housing accommodation at the Environmental Research SBS Transmissions (Question No. 1833) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 5 December 1994: (l) Will the Government fund SBS transmission to the Albury-Wodonga, Southern Riverina and North-East Victoria regions; if so, when. (2) Is he able to indicate the size of the potential SBS viewing population in the regions and the estimated cost of extending SBS transmission to the regions. (3) Which regions of Australia do not receive SBS television or have not been allocated funding for its transmission. (4) Is he able to indicate the size of the potential SBS viewing population in each region referred to in part (3) and the estimated cost of extending SBS transmission to each region. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The issue of extensions of the SBS transmissions will be considered in the context of future budgets with the views and needs of residents of the Albury-Wodonga, Southern Riverina and NorthEast Victoria regions, and the claims of other areas in Australia, being taken into account. (2) Albury/Wodonga, the Southern Riverina and North-East Victoria are within the Upper Murray coverage area served by the transmission facility at Mt Baranduda. On the basis of the 1991 Census, the population of the potential SBS viewing population within the Upper Murray coverage area is approximately 154,000. An indicative estimate of the cost of providing such a service is $2.2m capital and $0.3m per annum for operation and maintenance. (3) Over 75% of Australians are able to receive SBS television via Government provided terrestrial facilities. The areas which are covered are listed below: disposal of the property by AEM range of sporting facilities in the States in the sports the AIS pays for the use of facilities at the office space for coaches anq administrative staff. of office space in Sydney (55m2) and Brisbane owned by the Bureau of Meteorology or staff Institute of the Supervising Scientist. Canberra Newcastle Sydney Wollongong Darwin Brisbane Gold Coast Cairns Darling Downs Townsville Adelaide Spencer Gulf North Hobart North East Tasmania Ballarat Bendigo Latrobe Valley Melbourne Perth In addition, the Wide Bay and Richmond/Tweed areas are scheduled to receive the service in 1995/96. Some communities outside the above areas have set up their own facilities to access SBS television via satellite. (4) Issues such as population size and coverage are re-examined prior to each Budget. The population of coverage areas can vary over time quite significantly. Costs vary considerably depending on topography, geographic size of the area to be covered, signal strength required and infrastructure costs to accommodate the new facilities. Indicative costs are the estimates for extending the service to RichmondlTweed of $1.82m for capital and $0.29m for operation and maintenance and Wide Bay of $3.03m for capital and $0.60m for operation and maintenance. Papua New Guinea: Aid (Question No. 1943)",163
271,Mr CAMERON,AUSTRADE,"the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, upon notice, on 2 February 1995: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1808 (Hansard,31 January 1995, page 147), does the Government's refusal to investigate claims concerning the moving of funds from Papua New Guinea before the kina was floated indicate a willingness to ignore how Australian aid to other countries is used. (2) Does the Government require countries to whom aid is given to account for its use; if not, why not; if so, how is the accountability specified. (3) Will he provide evidence of how all monetary assistance provided by Australia to Papua New Guinea has been spent; if not, why not. (4) Will he ensure that all aid given to all countries in future is fully accounted for. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. It simply reflects the fact that, in this situation, and as indicated in my reply to Question 1808 of 5 December 1994, the investigation of such claims or allegations is a matter for the appropriate Papua New Guinea (pNG) authorities. Should those authorities approach the Australian Government, the Government would cooperate with any duly authorised investigation. (2) Most of Australia's aid is provided in the form of Australian goods and services for specific, rigorously designed projects and programs. In this way, the aid we provide can be managed and monitored from port of dispatch to project site. We aim for stringent accountability in all our arrangements with contractors, consultants, international organisations and other governments. Further, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), undertakes its own regular and intensive monitoring and evaluation of aid projects and programs through its network of aid posts in developing countries and Canberra-based personnel. These procedures, combined with effective monitoring and review mechanisms, make it extremely difficult for aid funds to be redirected to alternative uses by recipient countries and ensure that the aid program is well directed. PNG is the only country to which we provide significant assistance in monetary form as untied budget support. However, both the Australian and PNG Governments have agreed that budget support will be phased out by the end of the decade. It is planned that there will be, commencing in FY 1994/95, a seven year straight line reduction of budget support to zero in FY 2000/01, and a corresponding increase in sector program aid. This will be consistent with the approach we take with other countries receiving Australian aid. (3) Yes. In FY 1994/5 $213.4 million will be provided in the form of budget support, $77.3 million will be provided in the form of jointly programmed aid and $16 million will be provided in the form of retirement benefits and termination payments to officers of pre Independence administrations. Budget support payments are paid directly to the PNG Government and are disbursed as part of the annual budget appropriations made by the PNG Parliament. As such, these funds are disbursed through the normal processes of the PNG Government as reflected in the annual national budget. Program aid is provided to support a wide range of development activities in six priority sectors (infrastructure, health, education, law and order, renewable resources and the private sector). The sector programs include provision of technical assistance, accountable grants for infrastructure, grants to community groups, scholarships, equipment and supplies to support sector programs and projects. Funds disbursed through program activities are expended in line with Commonwealth financial regulations for expenditure of public monies. As well as the above, minor aid flows to PNG are also provided through a range of other program mechanisms. These include Development Training courses, Regional and Multi Country Programs, Emergency and Humanitarian Relief, support for Non-Government Organisation, Direct Aid Program projects through the Head of Mission Discretionary Aid Fund and Australian Development Cooperation Scholarships. In FY 1993/4 monetary assistance through these channels totalled approximately $22.75 million. As with program aid, accountability for expenditure is in accord with Commonwealth procedures. I refer Mr Cameron to the AIDAB statistical manual Australian Overseas Development Cooperation 1989/90 to 1993/94: Official Expenditure by country, Region and Sector for detailed descriptions of monetary assistance to PNG over the past five years and to Budget Related Paper No.2, Australia's Development Cooperation Program 1994-5 for estimates of FY 1994/5 assistance. (4) As described in the answer provided for question 2, Australia's aid program has effective mechanisms in place to ensure that official development assistance reaches intended recipients, is used efficiently, and is directed at meeting development and humanitarian concerns. Government Schools: Recurrent Costs (Question No. 1948) Mr Andrews asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice,on 2 February 1995: (1) Has he or the Department of Employment, Education and Training considered the report of the consultancy to investigate elements of government school recurrent costs dated 8 February 1994. (2) Did the report conclude that, for the average government school recurrent cost to be a materially accurate reflection of the average costs of educating a student in a government school, issues relating to superannuation, inconsistencies between accounting practices, privately raised funds and accrual accounting need to be addressed; if so, does he endorse the conclusion. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The report reached those conclusions. As implementation of the recommendations would be dependent on the States and Territories agreeing to change some elements of the National Schools Statistics Collection, I am not in a position to endorse the report's conclusion. The report was provided to the Taskforce on School Statistics of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs for its consideration. The varying accounting and reporting procedures in the States and Territories mean that implementation of some recommendations, if accepted, may take some years. SES Vacancies (Question No. 1977) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 7 February 1995: (1) Were the prescribed procedures for filling SES vacancies followed in the appointment of Mr Phillip Toyne to a position in the Minister's Department. (2) Was the position advertised in newspapers; if so, (a) in which newspapers and (b) over what period. (3) Was Mr Toyne interviewed for selection; if so, who were the members of the interviewing panel. (4) Did the (a) Minister or (b) Secretary of the Department confirm the appointment; if not, who did. (5) If the Minister confirmed the appointment, is it usual practice for ministerial involvement in this type of activity. (6) How many applications were received for the position. (7) How did the successful applicant distinguish himself in the selection process from the unsuccessful applicants. (8) Do nOl,1llal Australian Public Service (APS) conditions apply to the appointment of Mr Toyne. (9) Is the appointment (a) permanent or (b) under contract. (10) If the appointment is under contract, do any special provisions apply to the appointment in addition to normal APS conditions; if so, what are they.",168
272,Mr BRERETON,AUSTRADE,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (a) The Canberra Times and The Weekend Australian. (b) The advertisements appeared on 6 August 1994 and potential applicants were advised that applications closed on 19 August 1994. (3) Yes. Mr Stuart Hamilton, Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mr Greg Taylor, Secretary of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (representing the Public Service Commission) and Mr Barry Carbon, Executive Director Environment Protection Agency comprised the Selection Advisory Panel. (4) (a) No. (b) As with all Australian Public Service Senior Executive Service appointments the recommendation of the Selection Advisory Panel that Mr Toyne be appointed was transmitted by the Secretary of the Department with his supporting recommendation to the Public Service Commissioner for decision. (5) Not applicable (6) Twenty-three. (7) By convincing the Selection Advisory Panel through his written application, interview performance and referee comments that he could best do the job. (8) Yes. (9) A term appointment. (10) No. (Question No. 2039) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 8 February 1995: (1) According to the most recent data, what percentage of persons who participated in the Jobstart program are in unsubsidised employment at the conclusion of their participation in the program. (2) Does the data referred to in part (1) cover only the three months immediately after the conclusion of the Jobstart subsidies. (3) What is known about the proportion of Jobstart participants who are in unsubsidised employment more than three months after the termination of subsidies and after payment of any relevant bonus. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The most recent available data are for the months ending December 1994. These data show that some 59% offormer Jobstartparticipantswere in unsubsidised employment around 3 months after participation in the program. Jobstart (2) Yes. (3) There is evidence that J obstart outcomes are, in general, sustained over the longer term. Information on the longer term outcomes of former participants was gathered between March and September 1992 as part of the evaluation of Jobstart. The evaluation found that around 53% of former participants were in employment 6 to 8 months after termination of subsidy payments. This outcomes level is comparable to the post program monitoring estimate for the year to end March 1992 which indicated that 55% of clients were in employment 3 months after program participation. Further information on longer term Jobstart outcomes was gathered between August 1994 and January 1995 as part of the development of extended post program monitoring. Estimates based on pilot surveys indicate that longer term outcomes levels are comparable to those at 3 months after program participation. While the data are subject to seasonal influences and require confirmation through further surveys, unsubsidised employment 12 outcomes 6 and 12 months after program participation were found to be around 60%. Reliable data on unsubsidisedemployment levels following payment of bonuses to employers will not become available until 1997.",169
