2,Mr RUDDOCK,FUNDING OF ETHNIC PROGRAMS,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the report in today's Age that the Government deAffairs cided to top up the funds of certain ethnic programs by $5m in the lead-up to the March election. Is it true th-t a significant amount of these extra funds were awarded on 16 February 1990, the day on which the election was called? Is it true that Prime Minister himself specifically quested that all these extra funding proterest posals be considered by Cabinet and that these funding decisions were not anto nounced publicly prior to the election being concluded? Further, I ask the Prime Minister whether these decisions reversed a previous Cabinet decision, specifically Cabinet Minute No. 12,103, to accord higher priority funding to new arrivals? Finally, is it true that some of the extra funds were granted to a particular ethnic organisation to bus voters to the polls?",9
3,Mr HAWKE,FUNDING OF ETHNIC PROGRAMS,"It is true that the Government approved additional settlement funding, primarily in response to inusually creased migration and specifically to dress the priority needs of more recently arrived migrants while maintaining a sonable level of assistance for the needs of longer term residents, to address probthe lems faced by migrants in accessing genuntil eral services, and to enable people from non-English speaking backgrounds to obnot tain training and career opportunities in the television industry. It is not true to suggest that this ing was provided as some cheap political exercise just before the last election. was directed towards meeting long term needs with a substantial amount of the funds being spread over several years. Decisions on a number of the items menform tioned in the Age article were taken before December 1989. The decision on initial funding of $250,000 for the pilot income tax. equity and access program, for example, was taken early in 1989. Additional funding was allocated to provide opportunities for English learning for longer term residents, particularly women and elderly migrants. The decision on additional funding for ethnic schools to increase per capita funding by 10 per cent was announced as part of the national agenda for a multicultural Australia on 26 July 1989. It is true that the Office of Multicultural provided briefing in the course of the development of the projects. It did that because that is precisely its role and responsibility. Contrary to suggestions in the Age, however, the submission. considered by Cabinet was an initiative by the the then Minister for Immigration, Local reGovernment and Ethnic Affairs. The inof the Office of Multicultural Affairs was, quite rightly, as it should have been, see a balance in services between new arrivals and longer term residents, consistent with its responsibilities for access and equity across all Commonwealth Government departments. However, the Office of Multicultural Affairs does not have any involvement with the decisions on grants administered by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. There was nothing clandestine about these decisions. Cabinet decisions are announced at a time that the Minadister judges appropriate. A press release was in fact put out in January. As is often reathe case, as the honourable gentleman would know, the decisions taken· towards end of a year are often not put out January because decisions put out in the immediate pre-Christmas period do attract the attention that they intrinsically deserve,' As to that last part of the honourable gentleman's question about fundproviding funds for busing people to the elections, I dismiss that with the conIt tempt that it deserves.

4,Mr MARTIN,CONSUMPTION TAX,"Could the Treasurer in the House whether it is possible to even compensate people for the impact of a consumption tax by introducing a flat rate Mr Nugent- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. On 7 November, I raised a point of order pointing out that Government backbenchers on nine occasions had asked the Treasurer this same question in this House during this Parliament. I would suggest that the fact that it comes from a different honourable member makes it still the same question and the fact that it is not Government policy-",9
5,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,"Order! Could the honourable member get to his point of order. Mr Nugent-It is our policy; we have not changed our position on this. Therefore,the situation has not changed, so I ask that understanding order 146 you rule the question out of order.",10
6,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! The question is in order.,10
7,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"I am glad the honourable member confirmed it is Opposition policy. Mr Speaker, it is not possible to introduce a consumption tax and to spend the proceeds by introducing a flat rate income tax without largely distributive effects, but we had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say in the course of the last few days: And I was asked a simple question, 'Was a rate tax on the table?' and the answer was simply yes. And he went on to say that it was 'a real possibility'. This is how the Liberals will propose spending the proceeds of the consumption tax they are committed to introducing. This is at least a slither of frankness we have not seen before from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The fact of the matter is that he has made it very clear he has absolutely no intention of compensating the vast majority of Australians for the price effect of his consumption tax. Rather, the consumption tax is no more than a device by which he would hope to deliver very substantial tax cuts to the well off. He has no intention, as he said. When asked on the Walsh Report on 19 August 1990 whether he could give a guarantee that pensioners and those on low incomes would not be disadvantaged, he responded, 'No'. Now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has not yet indicated what level he would wish his flat tax rate to be, although I noticed, Mr Speaker, that the National Party in its policy says: Progressively flatten the personal income tax rate scales so that taxpayers pay no more than 25c in the dollar. And the Liberal Party has not dissociated itself from that proposal. But the introduction of such a flat rate tax, in conjunction with the consumption tax, would be absolutely devastating for the majority o Australians. It would provide, however, an enormous benefit to higher income people. The cheapest way in which a 25 per cent flat rate income tax could be introduced without actually increasing the income tax which anyone has to pay would be to set the zero tax threshold at $7,848, with a 25 per cent rate tax applying above that level of income. This would have a cost to revenue of $12.4 billion if introduced this year-that is, if all the rates were cut to 25 per cent at that threshold. To make up that revenue after also abolishing the present wholesale sales tax and compensating pensioners, the Opposition would have to impose a consumption tax at the rate of 18 per cent. An 18 per cent flat consumption tax would increase the consumer price index by 9 percentage points. The inequities in this policy of an 18 per cent consumption tax and a 25 per cent flat rate income tax are demonstrated in the following calculations. Somebody on an income of $18,000 a year would get an income tax cut of $2.05 a week but, because of a 9 per cent increase in prices, would suffer a reduction in real disposable income of $22.43 a week. Somebody on average earnings of $28,000 a year would get an income tax cut of $18.20 a week, but would be $18.16 a week worse off once account is taken of the higher prices he would have to pay because of the consumption tax. Even someone on an income of $35,000 would be worse off under this tax policy, suffering a loss of real disposable income of $9.03 a week. But, of course, there would be winners, and these would be at the higher end of the income scale, as intended by the Liberal Party. A person with an income of $45,000 would get an increase in real disposable income, even after taking account of the price effect of the consumption tax, and· that increase would be $17.85 a week. Someone on an income of $75,000 would be better off to the tune of $107.82 a week. Someone on an income of $100,000 would be $183.62 a week better off. Someone with an income of $125,000 would be a massive $259 a week better off. This is tax equity Liberal style. People on $125,000 would end up $259 a week better off, but those on $18,000 would end up with a substantial loss of income of $22.43 a week. Mr Tim Fischer-Exporters benefit; small business benefits.",10
8,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"The honourable member is making a case for it, I know. As I said earlier, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, when asked recently whether a flat rate tax is on the table, said that consumption tax is a,real possibility, that the Opposition has a consumption tax and a flat rate tax on the table. The only way anyone could introduce such a scale without actually increasing the income tax of all taxpayers would be to set the threshold at the figure I gave, $7,848, which means no-one would pay any more tax. Then the 25 per, cent rate would be cut in aft,er that. These are the huge redistributive income effects from the introduction of a consumption tax: there ,would be a 9 percentage point bash to the inflation rate. I notice the honourable member for Bennelong grinning. This is similar to the kind of grin he gave for national television as he came in the door today when he was asked about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's flat rate tax proposal.",11
9,Mr HOWARD,CONSUMPTION TAX,I am a happy fellow.,11
10,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"Yes, I know, he is a happy fellow. He will probably be happier when he sees this one struck down. The Leader of the Opposition said recently to the press, 'Well, see, the difficulty I have in the way you people play this game is that I will then be advocating policy where I am not. I am happy to raise issues, and as such raised issues the Government will obviously run on them as though they were policy even though they are not policy'. Is this policy or is it not policy? A moment ago the Leader of the National Party confirmed it was policy. Earlier the honourable member who raised a point of order said it is policy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says yes, he will put one on the table. The answer was simply yes. Let us put the definition on these policies. If you stand for vastly redistributive policies-",11
11,Dr HEWSON,CONSUMPTION TAX,Be honest about it.,11
12,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"I am going to make you be honest and say what you stand for. If the Opposition stands for these vastly redistributive things, I will make it own up to the policy and the impacts of the policy that it would not otherwise own up to. If the Leader of the Opposition believes that he can have a $22 reduction at $18,000 and give $259 a week to someone on $125,000, add 9 percenta age points to the price system and not blow our society to pieces, he is more naive than I thought he was. As for his Deputy Leader-frankly, he would not know. Where there is no sense there is no feeling. The Leader of the Opposition is supposed to know; he is, the leader of the Party. If he believes he can put his name to this kind of redistributive muck, it is about time he told the rest of us how. NA ,RELATIONS COMMISSION: JUDGES' SALARIES",11
13,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL,"I ask the Prime Minister whether reports in the press this morning to the effect that the Govern- . ment is supporting a 6 per cent increase, to take effect fairly immediately, for certain members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are true; if so, what is the basis of that support being given by the Government in the current climate of widespread calls for wage restraint by many sections of the community on both sides of politics.",11
14,Mr HAWKE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL,"Let me preface my response to the honourable gentleman's question by saying that the Government welcomes, as I think he would, the 0.7 per cent increase in the consumer price index for the September quarter of this year, which has lowered the annual inflation rate to 6 per cent. We believe that that figure, which is associated with the lowest underlying rate of inflation, as measured by the Treasury, since 1971, offers Australia a great opportunity to break the inflation. cycle and to put us . onto a more competitive trading basis. We are in a situation now in which we have the fifth successive quarter of a reduction in the inflation rate, and that is contrasting with generally a rising inflation rate in other parts of the world, so the gap between Australia and the rest of our trading partners, which has been a cause of concern, is narrowing. As a consequence of these developments, we are looking very closely at the effect on the accord and wages policy of that September quarter CPI. Let me say to the honourable member that it is in the context of those considerations that the issue of any increase in the salaries members of the Industrial Relations Commission will be considered. We are not going to allow consideration to deI velop which wil put at jeopardy the very significant achievements that are reflected in the figure for the September quarter. We had some discussions with the Australian Councii of Trade Unions at the regular meeting of the Australian Labor Advisory Council which occurred last Thursday night. We are aware of the understandable concerns of the trade union m,ovement o,n this issue and, - s Is-y, we - lll be lookmg at t-e - hole Issue m the bght o- our determmatIOn to make sure "" that t-IS ,country does not squander the very slglllficant benefits that we as tion are now reaping in this consistently lowering inflation rate. NA",11
15,Mr ELLIOTT,URUGUAY ROUND,"I direct my question to the Minister for Trade Negotiations, Can he inform the House on the outcome of his meetings last week with European Ministers? Did the Cairns Group delegation of Ministers ascertain from these meetings whether the European Community has given its negotiators any flexibilproposals ity to negotiate on its Uruguay Round agricultural offer?",12
16,Dr BLEWETT,URUGUAY ROUND,"In responding to the honourable member's question, let me just put on record the achievements of the Cairns Group of nations in the multilateral trade negotiations. First, agriculture is on the agenda for reform as it has never been on the agenda before, and that is an achievement of the Cairns Group. Secondly, there is a clear recognition that the Uruguay Round cannot succeed without the agriculture issue being addressed. That, again, is an achievement of the Cairns Group. Thirdly, it is also clear that never again will it be possible to liberalise world trade without also liberalising trade in agriculture. Having said that, I do not want to pretend that the situation is. not pretty grim, because the facts I have just mentioned have not been recognised by one leading participant in the Round, that is, the Euof ropean Community, and particularly, as is evidenced in Europe, by France and Germany, which continue to show inflexibility about and indifference to the threat to the whole Uruguay Round posed by the impasse now on agriculture. Our negotiators have had a chance to look at what the Europeans put on the table last week. It is the view of all members of the Cairns Group, shared with the United States, that the proposals made by the European Community would be totally unacceptable as a final outcome to the agricultural negotiations. The offer from the European Community is clearly inadequate. As I said in Europe, one would need a microscope to find evidence of any liberalisation in the a na- proposal. I think we expected that the offer would be disappointing, but the offer is worse than most of us had imagined. Indeed, it has been calculated that it would fail to provide any substantial overall reduction in levels of support and protection, despite the numbers that are cited, Worse, the Community has clearly not addressed at all the issue of export subsidies in agriculture, which are the most trade distorting feature of its programs, and has so qualified the market access that we douqt whether there would be anything to gain for countries which are efficient free traders in agriculnot ture, such as Australia. If there is to be no movement in the area of export subsidies and no effective movement in market access, which for us are the crux of the deal, the European Community offer will only lead to a deadend in the agricultural negotiations. I have to say regrettably that the visit of the Cairns Group to the difficult European capitals, to Bonn, Paris and then to Brussels and Rome last week, offered very little hope that the European Community will improve its offer between now and 3 December when the Round is scheduled to conclude in Brussels. During our meetings with European Ministers and officials in liach of those cities it became clear that the European Commission negotiators have very little flexibility to move on the offer that has been put on the table. I have had that confirmed by reports from Geneva this morning. There have been meetings throughout the weekend to try, to solve the agricultural impasse. It is clear that they are now obviously on the brink of crisis. Time is running out so fast tural negotiations and therefore for the Round as a whole that certain crunch decisions will have to be made this week. I expect not only the Cairns Group but also the United States and other participants will be reassessing the situation in the next few days. The United States agricultural secretary, Clayton Yeutter, has already said there is almost no chance of finishing the negotiations in the December time-frame. Unless some miraculous conversion takes place in the European Community, decisions will have to be taken about the future of the Brussels meeting, the format of that meeting and about possible new timetables for concluding the negotiations. I conclude by assuring the House that Australia and the Cairns Group will maintain their resolve that the Round cannot finish in part or in whole without a substantial advance in agriculture. Secondly, the Cairns Group with other allies will make it quite clear that the threat, just to the Uruguay Round but to the whole world multilateral trading system developed since the Second World War, comes from the richest collectivity of nations, amongst the greatest beneficiaries of that trading system, the European Community. NA RELATIONS COMMISSION: JUDGES'SALARIES",12
17,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and is supplementary to my last question to him. I remind the honourable gentleman that his answer addressed the generality of the issue that I raised. I ask him again specifically: Has the Government made a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal that the President and Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission receive as an interim a 6 per cent increase in January? Has the Government pleaded the delay in the establishment of the inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr Gerry Gleeson, the former head of the Premier's Department in New South Wales, as the reason for the interim increase of 6 per cent to take for agricul- effect in January?",13
18,Mr HAWKE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL,"The delay in establishing the committee of inquiry headed by Mr Gleeson has been a complicating factor in what the Minister had hoped would have enabled a satisfactory resolution of this matter earlier. I do not intend to go into the details of the negotiations that the Minister is having at the moment. I want to assure the honourable gentleman that we are concerned that in the current climate and context an increase of the sort that has been referred to by the honourable gentleman could be totally destabilising of the wage fixing procedures. We are attempting, through the Minister and the discussions that he will be having not only with the Australian Council of Trade Unions but also with representatives of the Commission, to avoid that outcome which we believe would emerge if the sorts of increases that have been talked about were to go ahead.",13
19,Mr TUCKEY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL,Do you commend it?,13
20,Mr HAWKE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL,It would be totally consistent with the position of the Opposition if it were in any way to give aid or comfort to some development which would undermine the orderly wage fixing processes of the community. In -989 the Opposition was associated by Its total support with the attempt by the pilots to smash the wage fixing system. We resisted that; and we are now about in this situation avoiding an outcome in regard to salaries of the members of the Industrial Relations Commission which would have the same result. We are steadfast in our commitment to the orderly wage fixing system under the accord and we are not lightly going to allow a situation to emerge which would put that in jeopardy.

25,Mr SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Order! Could the honourable member for Chifley repeat his question?  the House of the timetable for the introduction of competition in the telecommunications sector? That has got nothing to do with Question No. 355.,14
26,Mr SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"If the honourable member for Chifley is asking for a timetable, it is not precisely the way No. 355 is put.",14
27,Unknown,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Opposition members interjecting,14
28,Mr SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Order! If honourable members on my left will not interject and read No. 355, they will see that what I am saying is correct.",14
29,Mr NA BROWN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"On the point of order could I draw your attention, Mr Spdaker-I am sure you have not read it yet-to part (5) which says: What arrangements will be made for the selection of the proposed competitor for Telecom and when the word 'when' is used; that is the equivalent of the timetablewill the competitor be chosen. On any fair and reasonable readin- of that and the other parts of the questIOn, it clearly covers the same ground, and the question is, for that reason, out of order.",14
30,Mr SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Order! Question No. 355 has asked a number of particular matters. The honourable member for Chifley has asked a question about a specific matter. The question is in order.,14
31,Mr TUCKEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"On a further point of order, Mr Speaker, standing order 144 clearly states: The following general rules shall apply to questions . . . One of those rules states: Questions should not ask Ministers . . . to announce government policy. If a timetable is not policy, what is it?",14
32,Mr SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"In that case, I guess that the honourable member for O'Connor is saying that the question on n?ti-e of the honourable member for MenZIes IS out of order, and I do not think that is so either. There is no point of order.",14
33,Mr TUCKEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"In response to your remark, that is the exact difference, which you should know, Mr Speaker, between questions without notice and questions on notice. You put questions on notice to get policy; you are not allowed to. put them without notice, because some WIser people than those present today once decided that you should not abuse Question Time with policy statements.",14
34,Mr SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. There is no substance at all to his point of order.,14
35,Mr BEAZLEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I am not surprised that there is a bit of smarting at the Bar this particular issue with the Opposition. I have been the subject of endless press releases from the Opposition. spokesman over the last six months or so since I had this job asking me when I am going to do this and that. There has been a total and noticeable silence from the Opposisecond tion since the Prime Minister's announceprocesses ment of policy as opposed to timetable, which is implementation of policy, during the course of last week. Basically, the answer to the honourable gentleman's question is this: in the gram announced by the Government, in those areas which involve a change to Telecom's reserved services-and those to the establishment of competition in the cordless telephone area, the establishment of additional cellular mobile licences and the provisions which enable the effective establishment of a second carrier-all those items will be subject to legislation during the next autumn sitting of Parliaand ment. Of course, as the honourable gentleman would be aware, another element of the proposition to establish the second carrier is entailed in legislation already before House in the privatisation of Aussat Ltd. In addition, of course, the mere pascause, sage of legislation is not sufficient of to establish the capacity for competition. There will be required of Austel a series of reports to the Government between December and, effectively, May dealing with aspects of licensing provision standonly ards and ensuring generally that those standards, when established, do in fact encourage competition, do permit a situtions ation in which a second carrier can effecpermitting tively develop-particularly important the area of resale of private networks. As I said, all of those reports will be in by the time the Government is in a posiTelecom. tion legislatively to enable competition occur. In regard to the development of a sechonourable ond carrier, clearly there are a number additional steps that are necessary. We will go through a process over. the next six months, first, of request for expresications sions of interest and, next, of proposals. We expect to get from that on process a capacity to refine further the sort of material that we ought to put into tender documents. We would expect also to get from that an understanding of what have Australian companies and foreign companies would be interested in being part of a consortium effectively to establish the carrier. Hopefully, all of these will conclude about the middle of next year and that will put the Government in a position to go to tender for that second carrier. I might say that the reception given to prothe Government's propositions that have been worked on now for some considerable time, independent of any particular go advice given us by the Opposition, which has had absolutely no idea of what it has been handling in this area since we came into office for our fourth term, indicates that public commentary since the announcement of the Prime Minister is that, at the end of the day in this processit is a pretty abbreviated processAustralia will have, effectively, the most competitive telecommunications system in the world. That will be important for Australian industry; it will be important for the the communications industry itself; it will Pty be important for Telecom Australia beagain, in this process Telecom and itself OTe Ltd will be being merged and we will have for the first time, I think, a single, whole, effective Australian telecommunications company capable not of delivering services to the Australian people but also of providing a focus for attracting international communicabusiness here, and a solid base for Australia to effectively comin pete in the Asian region. This is a set of programs, a process not place about destroying Telecom or hampering It is a process which will make to Telecom much more effective-and I know that that is a subject dear to the gentleman's heart-and, at the· of same time, introduce competition, which will suit business interests and the general consumer in a way that our telecommunsystem has never been able to request for accommodate in the past.

When I went to the Second World Cliplaya leading role. mate Conference in Geneva I was able to take with me a very good domestic policy. In passing, I thank the members of the Opposition and the members of State governments for their support in the sition that the Australian Government has taken in relat,ion to greenhouse gases. As part of our decision we also said it was not enough for our country to have a to sensible position in relation to greenhouse it was essential that our position be seen as part of a very strong stand by Ausother industrialised nations. The conference was divided basically two sections: firstly there was a meeting of about 700 scientists. Those scientists were saying very clearly that the earth definitely warming and action by nations was absolutely critical and urgent. second part of the conference was to ministerial statements, at the end of which there was the formation of a ministerial declaration. Australia was able to take not just a firm stand in our ministerial position, but also to have a very important role in the negotiation of the ministerial declaration. The good thing about the conference was that many of the industrialised nathe tions-unfortunately with the exception in of the United States-made very firm deand statements in relation to stabilisation of greenhouse gases by the year to 2000. Unfortunately the ministerial document did not reflect all those views because it was basically in a consensus form. It was important, though, as the first stage a process of working towards a convenon greenhouse gases which I hope conwill be formalised by 1992. The other significant point was that about 140 nawere signatories to the document. Obviously, this is a very complex issue. The declaration does not deal only with the issue of targets; it also deals with the issue of how we give financial assistance to developing countries, and the issue of also for the technology transfer. We have started the process. This issue will not go away as it is one of incredible significance for this globe,and it is an area in which Australia will continue to NA",16
40,Mrs SULLIVAN,ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY,"I refer the Minister for Employment, Education and Training poto the comment by the Chairman of the Industry Commission, Mr Tony Cole, on the Sunday program yesterday that the Minister's speech last week represented 'searching for easy solutions'. Does the Minister agree with Mr Cole that such 'simpler solutions don't work'?",16
41,Mr DAWKINS,ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY,"I am not going to get into a debate with the Chairman of the Industry Commission, who holds a statutory office and who is entitled to express views in the context of the advice he gives to the Government in relation to industry policy. The Chairman did not in fact say what the honourable member alleges he said. When he was asked a question about some aspects of my speech, he did say that in times like this it was not unusual for there to be a search for easy solutions. He did not say that what I was talking about was such a search for easy solutions. Indeed, it was not, because he went on to say that I, along with many other Ministers, have a very clear commitment to develop within this country a more flexible economy and an industry sector which is both larger and more efficient, and therefore more competitive in world terms. I think one would have to go a long way before one found major issues of difference between me and the Chairman of the Industry Commission. Indeed, in the draft report that the Industry Commission brought down in relation to the motor vehicle industry there is an acknowledgment of the need to support that industry, both in its domestic production and in its exports, although, of course, the level of assistance and the time-frame of that assistance are obviously something to which the Government has to give consideration. Generally speaking, I thought the Chairman of the Commission had a number of interesting points to make, particularly when he was referring to the need for us to address the obstacles for the consideration of new industries where he says there are some delays and where indeed the Government has acknowledged there are some delays. That is precisely why the Prime Minister has launched the sustainable development process-to see whether we can accelerate and streamline the way in which these matters are considered. I am sure that, when we do, that will be a matter which not only I but also the Chairman of the Industry Commission will be pleased about. NA NA NA",17

I am sorry the honourable member for Gippsland did not take the effort either to check with my office or with the CSIRO to ascertain the truth of this. In August this year, the Chief Executive of the CSIRO, Dr John Stocker, raised with me the issue of how we could better coordinate the competing requests from different departments in this Government-from Ministers, not parliamentarians. As a consequence of that, he wrote a memo to me which, .in essence, said: The Minister responsible for the CSIRO is Mr Crean. Requests for use of CSIRO's expertise be channelled through him and the CSIRO will not be involved in inter-Departmental squabbles. That was no indication or initiation from me. That was a decision taken by CSIRO and communicated to me. As a consequence of that, I wrote back to the Chief Executive of the CSIRO indicating that I agreed with the broad thrust of what he had put, but I said: In general, I agree with the broad principles and frameworks you propose. Again I state that the CSIRO ing, not this Government or me as a Minister. My letter continues: I would like to emphasise again that I wish to be the involved where CSIRO is making substantial put to government policy in order to support strengthen CSIRO's contribution rather than vet it. So I have not stunted the free flow information from the CSIRO, as the Selection Committee. honourable member for Gippsland alleged. I did not send or request to be sent to CSIRO officers documents requiring them to state all details of their contacts with parliamentarians. What I sought to do was see that I was in a position ensure that the Government made the best possible use of CSIRO's expertise in its policy formulation. To that extent I that there are serious concerns at the statements made by the honourable memcheck ber for Gippsland on an earlier occasion in this House. He did not stop there in these allegations. He went on to say that I also overrode a Public Service appointment to the Office of the Chief Scientist. Again, to the record straight, the position he spoke of in the Office of the Chief Scientist an important one relating to the cooperalegislation tive research centres. It was an initiative that has the potential to spend $100m of Government money. I would have thought that it was in the interests of everyone in this House, as well as the community at large, to take an interest in public moneys being spent. My involvement extended only to discussions concerning the job description, and the selection process always remained a matter' for the Public Service, as it should have. The honourable member for Gippsland will claimed that the position was the head of office. It was not. That was wrong as well. The position that the honourable member was talking about was a first assistant secthe retary position. He further claimed that the appointment had been publicly announced. It had not. At the time of this incident-and it did receive some media attention-the selection process had not even been finalised. Mr Downer-Find a new angle.",17
48,Mr SPEAKER,ORGANISATION,Order! The honourwas proposable member for Mayo!,18
49,Mr CREAN,ORGANISATION,"He claimed that I forced appointment of someone who would· inagree with me because he was running and this general line. I should add for the to record that the successful applicant is not known to me. I had never met her prior of to the selection by the Public Service This is just another series of incidents where the Opposition is shooting from the hip. It does not bother to check its facts and it does not seek to come and· clarify these issues with us. I extend the invitato tion to the honourable member for Gippsland that, if he wants to come in, my door is open. He just has to make the think effort to come across and we will go through it. But the Opposition should the facts because otherwise it will sink further into irrelevancy, if indeed it already has any in this place. NA",18
50,Mr COSTELLO,LIFE INSURANCE OFFICES,"My question is diset rected to the Treasurer and is supplementary to the last one I asked him, when he was said that he could not recall proposing to levy major life insurers for the lost $65m of Occidental Life and Regal Life. I remind him of an article in the Australian Financial Review by Malcolm Maiden of 16 October 1990 which read as follows: ... Treasurer Paul Keating told the insurers on Monday that if they did not fix the problem he would do it for them with an across-the-board levy. I ask the Treasurer whether that report is accurate. If it is not accurate, has he taken any steps to correct it? Also, can he categoricallystate that no legislation was ever proposed to apply to major life insurers to levy them for $65m?",18
51,Mr KEATING,LIFE INSURANCE OFFICES,"I did not say that to the life insurance industry, as far as I can reasonably recall, and I did not correct the press report because I would be correcting a couple of hundred pieces of copy a day if I had to correct everything that was wrong.",19
52,Mr TUCKEY,LIFE INSURANCE OFFICES,You have a lot of people to help you.,19
53,Mr KEATING,LIFE INSURANCE OFFICES,You would need more than I have to cover that field.,19
54,Mr SPEAKER,LIFE INSURANCE OFFICES,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor!,19
55,Mr KEATING,LIFE INSURANCE OFFICES,"It may have been that the Life Insurance Commissioner himself discussed that option, that is, an industry levy. Mr Costello-Legislation.",19
56,Mr KEATING,LIFE INSURANCE OFFICES,"Legislation for such a thing. But whether or not the indUstry said 'The only way that we could comply would be by some legislative support' or whether that was proposed in a sort of compulsory way, I do not know. But I did not agree to such a proposition and I did not put any pressure on the industry to cover its own contingencies. The fact of the matter is that the industry is very much aware of the problems that these sorts of issues can create for policyholders. That is why the industry was substantially involved in this issue, even though the companies involved had nothing to do with the issue whatsoever. They had a higher and sharper appreciation of the dangers involved than obviously does the Opposition. NA NA",19
57,Mr WRIGHT,INDUSTRY,",-I direct my question to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I refer the Minister to the historic decision by this Government to deregulate the aviation industry. I bring to his attention the concern being expressed by some people, especially those living outside the metropolitan areas, that they may be disadvantaged by reduced services. I therefore ask: Will the Minister advise the House why the decision was made and will he outline the benefits to Australia and also to individual Australians?",19
58,Mr BEAZLEY,INDUSTRY,"I note the honourable gentleman's concern about the position ,of Australians in more remote regions. I do think, though, that in his area and further north the very substantial beneficiary of these changes will be the tourism industry, which is of very direct concern to him. Unquestionably, what is quite obvious from the statements made by airlines to this point and the intentions that have been notified by airlines coming into . the competition is that there are going to be and are in fact in place now very substantial fare reductions. Firstly, this will ensure that a new market of aviation travellers is going to be created in this country amongst people for whom travel is definitely a discretionary matter and who have felt themselves excluded from the use of air travel to this point. That augurs very well for our tourism industry. What we now have, and this situation is well appreciated, particularly by those of us in Western Australia, is a fare structure which is competitive with some international fare structures, which have to this point tended to attract Australians away from holidaying in Australia to holidaying overseas. That has certainly been the case with South East Asia and the South Pacific. Now we have a set of fares which are definitely competitive with those offered by international airlines for those destinations. Whilst we try to attract as many international visitors as we can, the bulk of Australian tourism is still effectively domestic. In so far as this affects our capacity to attract international tourists, the news is all good there as well. With this new air fare structure, we now have in place the capacity to guarantee to international travellers visiting this country that they will have available to them travel opportunities at a price which they are more used to in their own countries domestically and they can look at several destinations in Australia without having to ruin themselves. That is also going to be very much to the benefit of our tourism industry. Of course, we will always be in a situation where other factors will impact on prices in the aviation area. Obviously, the current situation with oil price rises has a seriously deleterious effect on aviation, in both domestic and international sectors. We do not take a totally hands off view of all this. There are areas that continue to require detailed and serious Government attention. In the areas of aviation safety and security, our rigorous controls will continue and will be enforced. Overall, as far as Australian travellers are concerned the news about our policies in relation to deregulating the airlines is all good. In relation to the situation confronted in the regions the honourable gentleman is most concerned about, I think there will be changes in the schedules. They will continue to receive good services and, more importantly for those areas, they will have an opportunity to develop industries which are enormously important to them.

That is obviously untrue and a very long bow. I say that my position is very clear: the coalition has adopted as policy the introduction of a goods and services tax which will replace the existing wholesale sales tax system and that policy position provides us with a wide range of options in the design of the personal income tax system. In that review of those options there are many, including a single rate, a twotier system which we proposed in the last election, a three-tier and perhaps a system which gives real bias-",20

98,Mr SPEAKER,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The crisis facing rural and regional Australia and the lack of response from the Government in the form of appropriate economic policies. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",22
99,Mr TIM FISCHER,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (3.01)There is a need to call a spade a spade. I want to avoid talking up an economic crisis and recession across Australia but, equally, a need exists to avoid talking it clown. Our responsibility is to call the shots as they are and to represent to this Parliament the reality of the situation. It is in this context that I warn that many Australians face a black economic Christmas next month. For those in provincial Australia, regional Australia and rural Australia especially, the outlook is very bleak indeed-and that is quite apart from the circumstances prevailing in Melbourne and other capital cities. In saying that and in raising this matter of public importance this afternoon, I point out to the House that yesterday Westpac Banking Corporation released the leading index figures from the most recent survey done by Westpac in conjunction with the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research. Its press release said: The drop . . . jeopardises any prospect of economic recovery before mid-1991. The latest result overturns the tentative suggestion made last month of a sustained upturn in the leading index. Such an upturn usually foreshadows an economic recovery around nine months later. The leading index fell 1.1 points (0.9 per cent) in September after rising in the previous two months. On an annual basis this represents the twelfth successive month of declining annual growth. The press release continues-and I quote exactly the words of the economic research department of Westpac and the Melbourne Institute: This indicates that the downturn in business activity could be relatively prolonged. All of us on this side of the House have known for month after month that we are in deep economic recession, yet the Government has not faced up to that situation. Only in more recent weeks has the Government got around to admitting that major economic problems are facing Australia at this time. I issue a warning: not only do we face a black economic Christmas; we face the prospect cif having after this cycle-this economic downturnfewer farmers, less food, fewer exports and little economic future. One farmer at the Emerald rally summed it up another way, which is pertinent here. He said: No farmers, no food, no future. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is here today. He has sought to cover the country far better than the Treasurer (Mr Keating). He made it to the town of Emerald last Saturday and I understand his tight schedule. He went some 2,000 kilometres to Emerald to agricultural chemical meeting. Honourpened? able members need to be aware that he theri granted a 30-minute deputation delegation from the rally. I commend that, but I have to say that he was just 250 metres from the location of the Emerald economic crisis rally. He made it 2,000 kilometres to Emerald but he could not make it 250 metres around to the rally proper. Opposition members-Shame!",22
100,Mr TIM FISCHER,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"I think that it is very much a case of sl).ame. In raising these matters today, not only do I want to call a spade a spade but also I want clarify that we, for example, do not port subsidy for subsidy's sake but, equally, we support a fair go in the ernment's approach to farmers, small business operators and export industries so that the economic circumstances of all Australians can be bettered. This rural economic crisis is not. just a matter provincial Austral,is. or for small towns large cities across Australia; it is a matter for all of Australia because the impact will be on the standard of living of all Australians. That has got to be fully realised by Government, as it fails to address adeefforts quately the immediate economic circumproceedings stances, the short term solutions available, let alone the longer term solutions which we in the coalition have had tpe courage to spell out quickly in terms ot the goods and services tax package, our proposals less mismanagement. on protection and a number of other matters. I want to highlight to the House one single change that the Government made last week. I refer to the Government's alteration to its Budget proposal on the horrific and harsh assets test which it posed in the 1990 Budget and which precutting sumably was supported at the·time by the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods). It was certainly supported by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). On Budget night my colleagues and J made a statement that the impact of the assets test proposal would trip many farmers into poverty limbo. I make no apology for making that an statement; it is correct. But what hapThe Treasurer attacked me for about eight weeks on this matter. He deto a fended and supported his Budget proposal. This went on until momentum built up, until the rallies built up, until the representations built up from a range of organisations and from the National Party and the Liberal Party, and until suddenly last week a joint announcement was made.",23
101,Mr NA BROWN,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,Surrender.,23
102,Mr TIM FISCHER,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"But not by the Treasurer. The Treasurer did not even have the courage to announce the backdown from his Budget decision. We had to a surrender from the Minister for Social supSecurity (Senator Richardson) and the Minister for Primary Industries and EnGovergy in a joint statement which was not even made in this Parliament, but which was made 250 metres down the road at the National Press Club. I say to you, Mr Speaker: we welcome that surrender. It is for a surrender only by degrees. There are or enormous difficulties being faced on the family allowance, the family allowance supplement and Austudy which go to the core of giving people in this country a fair go. We note with interest the changed attitude of the Government and we quite this properly claim that as a victory for our in terms of bringing reality to the of this Government and this Budget session, notwithstanding the fact that we face a limitation of debate on some 39 Bills over the next week as a consequence of the Government's hopeOf course, the Minister and others will come back and say, 'We've got to cut back in social security . You have said we've got to but back in social security. What else were we to do in the circumstances?'. I will give the House some eximamples of areas where it might consider back in social security expenditure. I thank Senator Alston for this information. Why does the Department not try reducing its rent of properties that it does not occupy? Do honourable members know what the dead rent figure was for 1989-90? It was no less than $ 568,000. Do honourable members know how much the Department overpaid in two overpayments to a supplier of computer software in the last financial year? It was $1.7m. On a micro-scale"" what about the $20,000 for plants to adorn the central office of Social Security in Canberra alone? Look at the Department's Telecom account. It is a big department which has a work force all over Australia and it has a big responsibility. If honourable members analyse the account for telephone calls alone they will see that the figure is $11,862,302. On a worker by worker basis, the average cost for each departmental employee was $719. There are areas in social security which should be addressed by the Government. It should not cut the opportunities for farm children to have some sort of fair go and some equality of educational opportunity, which clearly they have not had under the original Budget proposal which the Government has now dropped. I am pleased that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is in the House. We now come to his great answer, the opportunity he had at the National Press Club last week to spell out an altermust native way for Australian agriculture, to spell out what the Government might be doing to help in all the circumstances and how this burden, this economic agony, this huge financial pressure on so many individuals, might be eased-whether those individuals be banana growers on the north coast, wool growers around Roma, wheat growers in the Riverina, or producers of a range of other commodities which have downturned so savagely. What did we have from the Minister last week? We had a very bland statement of the circumstances pertaining to rural and regional Australia. We had a broad, bureaucratic, economist's argument in support of the Government's macro-economic policies and we had a statement that said that, broadly speaking, things were not as bad as they were in 1982-83. I say to the Minister that he ought to take off his rose-tinted glasses. I. that he does travel around Australia, but he ought to start listening as he travels because he would then catch up with the reality of the situation. In terms of what might positively b done, there are a number of reasonab and achievable steps. These steps flo from a number of submissions. They a often raised at many of the economic ra lies, which are not artificially organise rallies. They are not dominated by eith the Liberal Party or the National Part They reflect genuine concern, genuin protest and genuine demonstration b thousands of people, be they at Dalby, Roma or Emerald, or West Wyalong, Tamworth, Coonamble, Warwick and beyond. The achievable things in the short term range from, for example, that which the Australian Wheat Board is in the process of preparing-although I understand it has not yet lodged it-that is, the granting of immediate interim compensation with regard to the delayed payments arising from the Gulf crisis. They would have to be adjusted further down the track when the ultimate situation arising from the KuwaitIraq crisis emerges. Likewise, the Rice Marketing Board should receive the same immediate interim compensation. We take into account the fact that the Rice Marketing Board was about to fill an export order to Kuwait the day after the invasion. There were lay-offs in the Echuca-Moama area as a consequence of the loss of that particular export sale. The Government could bring about a range of other immediate measures, including the Budget's proposals with regard to the export inspection charges and including a thorough review of the resources for rural counselling which the Government has mentioned but which is under a great deal of pressure arising from the very sharp downturn in the rural economy at this time. In addition, the Government has to monitor closely the beef processing industry and the vertical integration taking place in that industry. Australia needs foreign investment but these changes flowing from our economic circumstance at this time need to be very acknowledge closely monitored indeed. On the broader front and in the longer term there is a very real alternative. It is spelt out by the coalition in its policy approach. It is to address the effecti ve level of fuel taxation on primary producers on small business operators and other bu-iness operators by providing for a duction in the effective level of fuel taxaAustralia tion as a consequence of the introduction of the goods and services tax. I challenge Minister Kerin to spell out whether he personally supports-and supported remember Treasurer Keating's proposal in 1985-a goods and services consumption tax proach. It is to abolish lock, stock barrel the wholesale sales tax regime, cluding sales tax on motorbikes, oils, luwill not be here'. bricants, spare parts, transport, freight and transport equipment, again as per the Minister goods and services tax announced Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). There is now a proper, responsible, sharp alternative approach with regard policy for our export industries which will include, in terms of the abolition of sales in the bush. tax, easing the burden on our export industries by abolishing the $1 billion to $2 billion of sales tax imposed on our export industries compared with the 21 of the other Organisation for Economic Coopmatters eration and Development countries which have no indirect taxes imposed on their export industries and therefore have an this advantage over Australia. There are a range of other areas which the Government could responsibly adlatest dress now. Above all, it is the economic U-turn overall, which Austpalia is crying out for, which the Treasurer, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have conlower sistently failed to address. That U-turn of course; to move away from tight etary policy, to tighten fiscal policy, through the fundamental step of making other adjustments with regard to the labour market and privatisation, and to it is. pave the way responsibly for much lower interest rates and a much lower value the Australian dollar. It is only with economic U-turn that we will have a go for farmers, small business operators and the wealth creators of the economy who do so much to support the standard of living of all Australians.",23
103,Mr KERIN,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Werriwa-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (3.16)reNo-one can accuse the National Party of of not putting its stamp on this Parliament. I must admit, of course, that the Government did not support the National Party's postage-led recovery.

105,Mr KERIN,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"And pointing to the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr to Court ice) and saying, 'You will not be here'. What happened? We picked up seats The Opposition is reflecting on one part of the economy and ignoring the rest. 24 What it is urging in some areas concerns that we are actually acting upon, and it has given us credit for that. If we just look at the main characteristics of economy, we see that for five consecutive quarters this Government has reduced the rate of inflation, from 2.4 per cent down to 0; 7 per cent, which is the figure. We have had four years of record Budget surpluses. There has been a nil public sector borrowing requirement. Interest rates are down 5 per cent this year. The exchange rate is 29 per cent on the trade related index than it is, was in 1982-83. Of course, the moment monthat the exchange rate goes down, the to go Liberal Party of Australia says what a terrible thing it is; when it goes up, the National Party says what a terrible thing What is the Opposition proposing, apart of from a few Mickey Mouse items menthat tioned a moment ago? It is proposing a fair broad-based consumption tax-tax the parents and citizens in rural Australia. It is now muttering and mumbling about a flat tax. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) today gave the lie to that and highlighted the effect that it would have on the whole economy. The Opposition is promising to cut spending even further, which will provoke an even bigger recession, wreck domestic demand even further. Of course, the Opposition never believes in increasing wages in any way, shape or form. So that again would wreck one of the best markets for the agricultural producers. The risks of going too far too fast are quite large. The fact is that the Government's choices are quite limited. We cannot overreact; we have to continue with the hard drive and the hard slog that we are undertaking. We are prepared to accept the unpopularity because there are signs that what we are doing is working. There are strident calls that the process could be accelerated to try to get interest rates and exchange rates down further. These calls are often ill-considered. I understand the reasons why, particularly when the price of wheat drops 30 or 40 per cent overnight, but they ignore a number of dimensions for the whole economy. I find that I need to remind farmers and some members here that radically lower interest rates, if we could get them, and exchange rates are not a oneway street. We would run a very strong risk of sparking another surge in spending right across the economy. If we look at the figures, we see that every time there is a drop in interest rates, that is not sustainable and the secondround effect is even higher interest rates as there is an import surge. If we just reacted this way and that way-instant coffee economic policy, as the former member for Bruce used to call it-all the effort of the past years in reining in sive demand would have been wasted. We have got inflation down twice during the life of this Government-through 1985 when we ratcheted it down, and lost it, and through 1987 when we ratcheted it down, and lost it again with the stock market crash. We are now getting inflation down again. We have got to get inflation down in order to get interest rates down. The lower value of the dollar would mean that we would have to pay more to buy those goods and services we cannot efficiently produce ourselves. So 'for the farm sector it would mean higher costs for many inputs, including fuel. I have already noted the impact of higher oil prices arising from developments in the Gulf and in other places, and any further depreciation in the dollar will raise these prices higher. About 40 per cent of farm inputs are sourced from the traded goods sector and are, therefore, subject to the effects of exchange rate movements. A lower dollar would raise the cost of these inputs-such as machinery, chemicals and fertilisers-and it would affect the outlook for real wages growth. It would also have significant implications for maintaining adequate capital inflow. What I have to do is sell the very hard message that the world offers no country the luxury of acting out its economic fantasies. The international economic 'system of the 1960s, 1970s and the 1980s has changed profoundly. Today, financial markets around the world have been deregulated-that means greater openness, more integration and more interdependence between capital markets than ever before. The fact is that this country is too small, too poor overall, and too exposed on international commodity markets-and that is a lot of what the Government has been trying to rectify. But the going is very slow and very hard and, of course, it does not match electoral cycles. Some things in life are constant, and a constant in this place is the roostering of the worthies of the National Party when they believe there is a political opportuexcesnity-not so much here, but certainly in other places. Let me couch my discussion of the issues raised by the honourable gentleman opposite in the following way, because it is really important that we understand the cause of the collapse in farm incomes. If people do not understand that, how can we pretend to be able to devise policies which are equitable and which are effective? It is pretty easy to dance around like' a show pony, tossing one's head in the air, shaking one's mane, pawing at the ground, showing the whites of one's eyes and giving the occasional well aimed political kick. That is easy. But policies which are internally consistent-a condition for effective programs-require more than glib lines. They require more than ideas. Everyone has ideas, even the National Party--..:.even though I am told that the last one happened about 1963. The hard work which is required of all honourable members of this House is not just to float ideas, not just to whimper in a quiet voice, 'It seemed like a good thing at the time', but actually to get on top of the subject matter and develop policies that address the economic fundamentals. As I said, the Opposition is reflecting on a small part of Australia's problems which are a lot larger in an economic sense. One of the things that distresses me when. I go - round the bush listening to all that IS saId, and when I listen to the telephone calls that I get in my office is the implication of much of what is being said by farmers who are in a distressed situation at present-that we really should not have floated the dollar; that we should not have deregulated financial markets' that we really should go back to subsidies; that we should not be deregulating' that we should be anti freer trade; and that we should be back into protection. I would have thought and hoped by now that the farm sector overall realises the benefits of freer agricultural trade and realises that when the going gets tough, as it has done before, we have to contfnue to put in place consistent policies. What is the primary cause of the downturn in rural incomes? As I said the other day at the National Press Club the rural sec-or ,is n-w - oing through - omething WhICh IS tYPIcal m Australian rural industries-that is, a collapse on world markets and a reduced demand for Australian agricultural commodities. Such a collapse is not new. This collapse is perhaps worse than what happened through 1985-86 because of the great wool stockpile, but it has happened before. It happened in the early 1970s when the price of wool fell through the floor; it happened in ·the late 1960s when there were wheat marketing quotas put on; it happened in 1974, when the Japanese cancelled beef orders overnight and beef prices rolled over on their sides, the cattle herd went from 33 million head down to 21 million head. In the early 1980s the opposite occurred-wheat prices soared. But then came the 1982-83 drought and what followed on from that and the terms of trade collapse in the 1984 and 1985 calendar years. What we are seeing now are the unhappy, terrible results of reduced demand in both our premier agricultural industries: wool and. grains and in grains, of course, predommantly wheat; but there is a carryon to barley and the other grains. This is the fundamental point that has to be grasped and understood by all honourable members of this House. The difficulties facing our rural industries and the pain borne by individuals in those industries occurs because of the conditions existing in world markets. The measure of farm gate profit is the farm cash operating surplus. This is estimated to decline in this financial year from about $ 51,000 per farm to about $25,000. It is important to understand what is contributing to this decline: 58 per cent of this $26,000 decline occurs because of reduced wool revenues; $36,000 occurs because of reduction in grain revenues. Triggered on one side by prices, on the other side by costs, we have a massive decline in farm incomes, and 94 per cent of that decline is explained by the wool, wheat and grain industries alone. Most of that is because of events outside the control of any government. . - uch comment has been made by indIVIduals who believe there is a simple panace1t for these problems-individuals who believe that economic policy is something we can just turn on and turn off. They believe we can press tinsel into the shape of a star, put it onto the end of a stick, stand on a fruit box and wave that wand and say, 'Let there be no downturn in rural incomes'. The simplest of these cultists belong to the 10-80 mob who maintain that interest rates should be set at a level of 10 per cent and the exchange rate at 80c Australian per United States dollar. It is actually under 80c now. understand the honourable member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), has said the answer to our problems is 10-80 in the terms I have just descdbed-1O per cent chance of success, 80 per cent clutchdicating ing at straws in the dark, and 10 per cent missing in the top paddock. The simplest of these cultists belonging to the 10-80 mob have been some of the honourable members of this House. I noted in my comments last Thursday that there is no unique identity between exchange rate and interest rates. The Australian dollar occupies a unique position amongst traded currencies. Australia's sition as an energy rich exporter means our currency is strongly affected by events in the Middle East. We cannot control the strength of the US dollar; we cannot control what is happening in the Japanese stock market. It is Australia's political institutional stability that is also providing incentive for trading in the Australian dollar in recent months - Our very posiour tion in the international time zone also a complicating influence on trade in Austhat tralian dollars and therefore on the value of the Australian dollar. In addition, the interest rate differential exists as a strong factor, but this should not be overstated. As our inflation rate comes down, so will our nominal interest rate, and as a result the differenNational tial which exists between the Australian dollar and the yen and the Australian lar and the US dollar will diminish. We again. see signs of this happening at last-thank goodness! Honourable members of this House will know there is almost parity between the Australian rate and the United Kingdom and Canadian interest rates. We have seen since the beginning of this year a substantial easing of moneefforts tary policy-five percentage points, in fact. The 10-80 cultists would tell us the change rate will track exactly that downzone ward movement in interest rates. Instead, unfortunately, the opposite has occurred until very recently because the exchange rate is based on a market, as is the interselling; est rate, and the capacity of the Governeffort I ment to sit down around a table and . change those things instantly is nil. Recent events should continue to give us cause for caution. The latest easing of monetary policy resulted in a sharp downward movement in the exchange rate, in that sentiment in the market is the most ephemeral influence of all. What the 10-80 faddists tell us is that there is a need for a lower dollar, but their analysis is partial. As I have said, their analysis overlooks what happens on the cost side. Such an expression causes the tinsel to the fall off the end of the magic wands. More importantly, the calls for a markedly lower Australian dollar ignore the poleads and lags which exist in the demand for Australian agricultural exports. A lower Australian dollar will not increase incomes received by wool growers by one-tenth of one cent. So long as wool is traded at the floor of 700c, the price reand ceived by Australian growers, independ. ent of the level of the Australian dollar, will be 700c. The situation is different for grain and beef industries, but do not is let anyone fall for the trap of believing the lower Australian dollar is a balm. I am responsible to the people of Australia through Parliament. This means that the policy decision which I administer now cannot be solely a 1990s version of a National Party-Country Party pork barrel. The Government pulled the hoops off the Party pork barrel some years ago, and I am not of the mind-nor is the dolGovernment-to fashion those barrels In the time remaining, let me outline some of the Government's efforts in regional and rural Australia. Let us say that our efforts have not been driven just by the downturn now being experienced. Our are the result of consistent hard work over seven years. They include the family allowance supplement; increased exfunding for land care; the remote area allowance; the rebate on diesel fuel, now costing the Budget almost $400m; the Countrylink program; increased funding for rural adjustment and rural couna better targeted and more efficient in research and development; and a reduction in the effective rate of assistance to all Australian industries, estimated to benefit the rural sector by some $320m. They include, for the first time, an emphasis and effort on national transport and communications, the whole agenda of micro-economic reform. They include a proper measure of support for the wool industry. They include programs for women who live in regional and rural Australia. Mr Speaker, this is not an exhaustive list, but, as I said, time is now drawing me to a close.",25
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,Order! The honourable member's time has now expired.,29
107,Mr LLOYD,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,This is the second time in a month that the Opposition parties have raised as a matter of public importance the crisis in rural and regional Australia and the lack of any positive Government response to that crisis. It is correct and important that we do so to indicate on behalf of those people we represent-certainly nobody on the Labor side represents them-the real problems-Mr Bilney-We are the people who represent them.,29
108,Mr LLOYD,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"I am talking about real representation, because Government members do not. provide it. Every 'indicator in relation to that depression, that rural crisis, shows that it is worse than was one month ago. D'Uring that month the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is just leaving the chamber, has changed his mind several times on whether the depression in the bush is worse than it was in 1982 and whether it is the worse since the Depression of the thirties. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), who is the Chairman of the Government's Rural Task Force, does not believe there is a crisis at all. The Minister at last made a statement to the National Press Club last week and he repeated most of his speech today. In the meantime there have been more and more crisis meetings in the bush. Those involved will become more emotional as time goes on; their meetings will increase in intensity if they believe the Government is not listening. We have also had a statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the reform agenda which is supposed to provide a more level playing field with regard to costs and efficiencies in the rest of the Australian economy. . To highlight the point of how that recession, depression, is deepening, let us look at the indicators. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics is running behind the situation. That is not a criticism, because it has to tabulate things on a quarterly basis. In the June quarter, the net value of farm production was down 48 per cent on 12 months earlier; by the September quarter, it was down 57 per cent on 12 months earlier; when the Minister made his speech to the National Press Club, it was down 60 to 65 per cent on 12 months earlier. If we add to that the fact that any of those figures for this year is 20 per cent down on last year, we are now looking at the net value of farm production being more than 80 per cent less than last year. The alternative calculations which the Bureau uses are those of net farm income. At the Agricultural Outlook Conference at the beginning of the year the figure was down 20 per cent on a 12 month basis; in the September quarter, it was down 32 per cent; when the Minister made his speech last week, it was down 35 to 40 it per cent. When considering problems outside the rural areas, we must ask who else in Australia, on a total industry basis, is suffering that sort of situation. Unfortunately, the figures will continue to decline because the full impact of the increased fuel costs which will hit regional and rural Australia particularly hard-the grain industry more than any other-is still to be revealed in the figures. The wool industry is continuing to have problems and there has been another fall in the world market for wheat. October was a bad month for meat with prices sliding. In the horticulture field, in my area alone people are tipping fruit out of their cool stores because they cannot see any point in continuing to make losses on storage. The citrus industry, the potato industry, the whole range of rural industries have problems. Even the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade situation is more dismal than it was a month ago. If there is a failure in the GATT round it will be particularly hard on Australia in the grain, dairy,and, to a certain extent, the beef industries. The Minister made a curious statement to the National Press Club last week that he believed that the situation in 1982 was worse than the present one. He referred to factors of drought, inflation and a world recession. Of course, he had changed his ground. He now means the general economy in Australia and not the rural economy. There is no doubt that the rural economy is the worse since the 1930s. If one likes to look at some of the other extras that he said existed in the 1980s but are not there now, one sees that there is still a chance in this wide country for natural disasters to occur, the world certainly is moving towards a recession, and the other important point is that relative to our trading partners, the inflation rate is higher in Australia today than it was in 1982. Whatever criteria he likes to use, I hope the Minister changes his ground and comes up once again with a correct statement. I do acknowledge, as the Minister has stated, that interest rates have fallen. in his speech to the Press Club he said that they are not a significant factor in farm costs because they are only 12 to 14 per cent of the total.",29
109,Unknown,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,Opposition members interjecting,30
110,Mr LLOYD,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Opposition members all disagree, and so they should. In 1980 interest rates were only 6 per cent of farm costs, in 1985 they were 9 per cent of farm costs and now they are 13 per cent, or, as the Minister said, 12 to 14 per cent. The significant factors in all of this is that, firstly, they have increased and, ondly, as many farm costs are fixed costs, they are one of the most significant variable costs that can have that impact on profitability on the net income. I just use a quotation of my good friend the honourable member for Gwydir at that time, Mr Ralph Hunt. He referred to 1985-86 when, if there had been a one third reduction in interest rates at that time, the net average farm income for farmers around Australia would have doubled. So that indicates the impact of interest rates on their profitability. The previous speaker and my Leader, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), has indicated the link to the exchange rate and its effect on profitable and competitive agriculture. I also want to refer to the assets test because that has been one of the major bases for the criticisms against the Gov-· ernment as being callous and ignorant when it comes to the real impact in rural areas. I do acknowledge that there is an improvement in the assets tests, that people should remember with some of these categories-fOt"" example, family allowance-that until Labor imposed it, there never was an assets test on the family allowance but only an income test. Many people would argue whether that is right or wrong in principle. Secondly, the family allowance supplement was $322,000. The Government was going to bring it back to $200,000 and it is now up to $347,000. On an equity basis with the income test it would need to be double to be fair for children in needy circumstances and families in the same Also situation if they were on an income basis to an assets test basis. That is the single most important factor in targeting rural and regional families in difficult circumstances. With Austudy there is that 50 per cent withdrawal rate, so it is slightly better. But, when looking at that and acknowledging that it is better, two points emerge. Firstly, it is not equitable relative to looking at what the rates are on the income test, and, secondly, it is not uniform and there is no logic in that lack of uniformity. When the Prime Minister referred to sec- his reform agenda and doing things in other parts of the economy to make them more competitive-and remember farmers still suffer about $6,000 a year in costs through inefficiencies in some of those areas-he referred to the waterfront. Nothing has happened on the waterfront; employment has actually increased. When it comes to container cranes it is amazing that, compared with Singapore where the rate is more than twice as much, if our container cranes only carried something both ways, that would double the efficiency and the productivity. Mr Braithwaite-What about Hong Kong?",30
111,Mr LLOYD,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Yes. Because of a union ban, trans-Tasman shipping isrnade uncompetitive. At the present time, New Zealanders can buy wheat cheaper from the United States and Turkey than they can from Australia, purely on a freight basis. The Minister talks about a pork barrel. Let us hear it for these special industry plans-Kodak, Dupont, the waterfront and so on. My Leader has indicated some of the things that should have been done. Even if the Government cannot swallow its pride and go to a goods and services tax, which would reduce those export taxes, tariffs and sales taxes on input goods, particularly when they are not even made in Australia, could be reduced or removed. Dumping and packaging for fair trade needs to be accelerated. Better support for EFIC and national interest insurance in these difficult times is needed. Also export inspection charges should be deferred. Finally, the Minister gave a speech to the National Press Club entitled Was Hanrahan Right: Is He Now? That is the old 'We'll all be rooned' syndrome. I refer him to another poem,--Bush Christening: . . . on a route never crossed set by folks are lost . . . That is where the Government is. It is lost, and at the end of it there is no bush christening.",31
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,I note that the honourable member for Lyne is in the chamber. I am sure that all members join in wishing him well on the events of last Saturday.,31

When we speak to them properly and give them the facts, they do understand. They do not go off their brains and say that we will all be ruined, as this bloke said here.",31
114,Mr LLOYD,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Minister referred to that, not me.",31

We have had representations from country people and from the National Farmers Federation throughout this period.

Nonetheless, the honour-· able member is misrepresenting what has happened.",31
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,There is no point of order.,31
120,Mr HARRY WOODS,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"The Opposition is not listening to what I am saying. I am saying that in the representations that the Prime Minister's country task force has made to the Ministers, there has been no mention of National Party representations. That is what I am saying. It is quite easy to understand. If those opposite do not understand it, I suggest they ask somebody about what I am saying. Mr MCGauran-This bloke is a lightweight.",32
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland!,32
122,Mr HARRY WOODS,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"As a result of those representations last week, the Government showed that it understood the problems facing country people and that there was a drop in farm incomes. In understanding that, it increased the assets test levels for the family allowance, the family allowance supplement, Austudy and the assistance for isolated children. Contrary to the reaction from the Opposition, the people in the country are very happy about the decision. They welcomed it. I do not know how many phone calls I have had over the weekend welcoming that decision. Mr BUney-Hear, hear! And they know who did it.",32
123,Mr HARRY WOODS,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"They do know who did it. Not one of them said, 'By golly, the National Party has done a good job getting that through'. They said 'Thank you very much' to the Minister for getting that through. It is a good thing for country people. I make no apology for that. I do understand that there are problems in the country. I am a businessman. I was building a tavern at the time interest were raised, and during that time they increased from 15 per cent to about 20 per cent. That put pressure on me, and I know that the increases put pressure on other business people in the country and in the city and on house owners who have mortgages. There is no denying that high interest rates make it harder for ordinary people to survive. But there are special problems in the bush relating to exchange rates and commodity prices. By and large, those are beyond the control of the Government. Let us look first at high interest rates. We can easily overlook the underlying problem facing this Government a couple of years ago-the balance of trade deficit. Mr Bruce Scott-It has got worse since you have come to power.",32
124,Mr HARRY WOODS,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"It was the Opposition's own policies. It set tight monetary and fiscal policies. We have got tight fiscal policy-something the Opposition could never achieve. There have been four record Budget surpluses. The Opposition has never approached that, yet it criticises it all the time. Tight fiscal policy is one of the cures of the balance of trade deficit. The other is tight monetary policy, and that has produced high interest rates, but it is with the aim of reducing the balance of trade deficit. One can see the indicators showing that that result is being achieved. There is evidence for an easing of monetary policy, and that is happening now. Since January interest rates have come down by 5 per cent; there is no denying that. The benefits of that have not been passed through all the time, but interest rates have come down. We in the bush would all like to see exchange rates lower, but we cannot just wave a magic wand so that exchange rates come down. That is the 10-80 principle, but it cannot be done. One would assume that with interest rates coming down exchange rates would come down, but other things are involved that the Opposition does not recognise. One is the invasion of Kuwait, for example. The fact that Australia is a net energy exporter makes the Australian dollar very attractive to overrates seas investors when there is an energy crisis. That has kept the dollar up. We cannot control the situation in Kuwait. We are doing what we can. I do not think Opposition members oppose the ships being over there. Perhaps they do, but I do not think the ordinary country people do. They do not tell me they do. . I am sure that that situation is having an effect on exchange rates. Commodity prices are one of the major things affecting country people. It is not the first time that commodity prices have gone up and down. The last few years have seen good levels of net farm income-$4 billion or $5 billion. In 1982 the figure was half a billion. I am not saying that this figure good news: this year it will be $1.7 billion but it is nowhere near the levels of 1982. I am not saying that things are good, but they are not nearly as bad as Opposition members are making out. The medium and long term prospects for farm industries are good, and that is recognised by the National Farmers Federation as well as by myself. Opposition members do a disservice to country areas by trying to inject this crisis mentality into the situation. The world population is going up and urban sprawl is continuing. The use of chemicals and the degradation of land are reducing the ability of land to produce. In the long term, the demand will go up and the ability to produce will go down. That favours Australian production in the long term. Mr MCGauran-Ha, hal",32
125,Mr HARRY WOODS,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"The honourable member laughs, but the National Farmers Federation says that.",33
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,Order! I warn the honourable member for Gippsland.,33
127,Mr HARRY WOODS,RURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,"The matter of public importance talks about the crisis facing rural and regional Australia. Let me tell the House aboyt the rural rallies at Grafton and the shows that I have been to recently at Casino and Alstonville. Let me tell the House that there have been record numbers of cattle shown at those agricultural shows. There have been record attendances at Grafton, Casino and Alstonville. So the crisis is not everywhere. The crisis that the National Party talks about is in small sectors. I am not telling the House that there is no problem in the wool and wheat industries; there is a problem. But that problem does not extend all over rural Australia. The National Party does country people a great disservice with this crisis mentality. Members of the National Party should be doing what I have been doing-going to th;:s(. rural rallies and telling the people the truth. Recently I attended a rural crisis rally at Grafton and a bloke got up-I imagine he was a member of the National Partyis and told people there about the enormous windfall that the Government was getting out of fuel.

135,Dr HEWSON,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The Opposition totally opposes this motion. On the first day of Parliament, I made an appeal to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to do something about upholding standards of this chamber, to make a conscious effort to raise parliamentary standards, and ever since then we have had nothing but one demonstration after another of how he holds the Parliament in contempt. Today we have yet another example with the proposal to guillotine 39 pieces of legislation-jamming through this Parliament 39 pieces of legislation in a matter of three days. It is the best demonstration we have had so far of the extent to which this Government is prepared to downgrade the significance of Parliament. It should not be forgotten, of course, that in the Autumn session there were just seven days and the Government guillotined 34 Bills through that period. That was despite our offer at the time to sit longer to accommodate a more full blooded debate. Now the Government is going to guillotine 39 Bills in the space of three days. This is in a year when the Parliament is scheduled to sit for just 36 days, which is the second lowest number since Federation. The only number lower than that was in 1937 when the Parliament sat for just 27 days. This is a clear demonstration of the contempt in which the Prime Minister and his Government hold this Parliament. When one looks down the list of the 39 Bills one sees a range of very important issues; not minor issues but issues that go to the very heart of our current economic circumstances which are proving to be, without any exaggeration, the worse since the Second World War. These are matters that relate to States grants, roads, social security, education, the sale of major government assets like the pipeline, the restructuring of the Commonwealth Bank, defence service homes, veterans' affairs, transport and communications, and corporations legislation-it is unbelievable. In the present economic climate it is very important to boost our export capacity. Yet the Government is allowing 40 ininutes debate for the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Billjust 40 minutes at a time when there ought to be full scale debate. Some of the taxation Bills are very complex and will take the best part of several days simply to try to understand, yet the Government proposes to allow only 40 minutes debate for those Bills as well. On a major issue, such as the Wool Legislation Amendment Bill and the Wool Tax Bills, the Government proposes to allow a total time of two hours debate. This is in an industry that is going through its biggest shake-out in decades. This Government is prepared to treat it so lightly as to say, 'We can only afford to give it two hours' in a year when the Parliament is sitting for the second fewest number of days since Federation. Every single member of Parliamenton both sides of the House-with responsibilities for his or her electorate, should be totally outraged by the action of the Government. It is a perversion of Parliament and it is a clear demonstration of the blatant hypocrisy of the Prime Minister. He struts the stage around this Parliament and claims that he will raise parliamentary standards, yet every time there is a substantive proposal put to him or there is an opportunity to demonstrate his bona fides, he disappears and goes for the cheap alternative to bypass the true processes in this place. I make an offer here today to the Prime Minister and to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who is sitting opposite: we are quite happy to come back and to sit the extra days in order to debate this legislation. This legislation is fundamentally important to the parlous state of the economy-the state that the Government has thrust this economy into in the course of the last seven years, and these are major issues. Against that background we are quite happy to come back for extra days before Christmas in order to debate this legislation and to debate it properly. This is not the only example of the abuse of Parliament. On a daily basis we see this joke the Government describes as Question Time. I came into this place from outside with perhaps the simplistic notion that Question Time meant that honourable members could ask questions and have a reasonable expectation that the Government would try to answer them. Question Time ought to be a procedure by which information is conveyed by the Government to the Opposition and through the Opposition to the people of Australia. It ought to be a time when information is conveyed on matters of great moment in this country, and we have had matters of great moment as the subject of questions in the course of the last few months. .. All one gets are these half-baked, delibin erately diversionary responses from the Government. In most cases, the Government does not bother to try to answer our questions at all. The Government uses the questions as a basis for an attack on us. The people of Australia are sick of that sort of behaviour. They are jack of a Government that is not prepared to face its responsibilities; that is not prepared to acknowledge that it is accountable to the people through the Parliament. The Government is not prepared to get up in this place and to provide reasonable information to the people of Australia on matters of great national significance. For weeks now we have been asking, for example, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) whether the country is in a recession. We have had the most unbelievable series of diversionary answers in which they alm'ost come to the point of using the 'R' word but then stop short and back off. As every day goes by just a few more thousand small businesses go to the wall, shops close or people are added to the unemployment rolls. They do not care; they are prepared to come into this House and play games on issues of major national importance. Question Time is totally abused. Indeed, the standard game iIi Question Time-for the entertainment of the few who sit up in the gallery-is to try to make it a blood sport. Members of the Government ask themselves a series of dorothy dixers so they can get up and attempt to be smart in the answers they give, trying to score points off the Opposition. Let us think about some of the issues that are being debated in this country. Let us take one which is the subject of a daily dorothy dixer, the introduction of a broad-based goods and services tax in this country. The Treasurer himself advocated it in 1985 and got rolled by his mates in the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Ever since then, his bruised ego has seen him running around trying to divert attention from the role that that sort of policy decision can play in restructuring the Australian economy. Every day he gets up with little prepared texts that his boys Treasury and his office have put together for him-detailed explanations of impacts on fictional families and fictional circumstances. They are so detailed and complex that he stands there and reads it like a five-year-old child learning to cope with the first few difficult words of the English language. He is never prepared to debate the issue. Mr Bilney-And it is so embarrassing for you that you turn your back on him.",34
136,Dr HEWSON,URGENT LEGISLATION,"We would turn our backs, yes, because he is not prepared to debate the issues in this country. The people of Australia have a very simple expectation of their politicians: they want them to do their job. They want people on the Government benches to get up and answer questions, they want them to provide information, they want a realistic assessment of whether or not this economy is in a recession and, most importantly, they want to know that, when the Government finally faces up to the reality of the damage it has done, it has some solutions to some of these problems-not ridiculous proposals like the so-called telecommunications revolution we will see pushed through this Parliament in the course of some of the Bills that have been introduced by way of speeches in recent days. That will not do anything for the welfare of the people of Australia. The great irony is that in the same year the Government is jettisoning the two airline policy because it did not give effective competition, lower air fares or reliable service, the Government is embarking on a two-phone policy to do precisely the same thing. The Government expects us to sit back here and believe that it knows what it is doing. All we have had since the 24 March election has been a series of ad hoc decisions taken by a government that obviously did not expect to win the last election. As issues break the Government takes a decision and bounces from one ad hoc policy to the next, with no clear-cut sense of direction, no vision for Australia, no understanding of the direction in which this country has to go in the next five to 10 years-just piecemeal attempts to deal with issues as they arise. When push comes to shove and the Government has to take a decent decision what does it do? Let us take the issu- of telecommunications. The Government takes the view that the union in Telecom Australia, in particular, is too powerful for it to take on, too tough for it to actually try to get a sensible tion to the problem, even if one-third of the jobs in Telecom are featherbedded. The Government is quite happy to charge that out to the people of Australia by a promise of contin-ed. high-pri-ed, inefficient telecommUnICatIOns serVIces. That is what, the Government has been about.. It does not have to listen to me; it can come back in a couple of years and see how far down the track we are. The poor new competitor has to pick up Aussat Pty Ltd. At $400m to $500m in the hole, that is tying at least one leg behind its back, probably. two. It has to kick something into the Government's coffers to keep it happy because the Government is only interested in it from the point of view of getting more money. Then the Government will let the competitor have access to the Telecom network by letting Telecom price its access. That is tying its two hands behind its back. It will fall over. There is no way to get effective competition in telecommul1ications with such a fictional proposal, arld the Minister knows it. If he stakes his leadership run on the basis of that proposal, he will have a long way to go because of the appalling circumstances that he will leave the telecommunications industry in over the course of the next five to seven years. I have news for the Minister and the Prime Minister. The people of Australia are absolutely sick and tired of politicians who are not prepared to do their jobwho are not prepared to come into this House and raise standards and meet their expectations. The people of Australia are out there struggling. They are still facing high interest rates and high inflation and are now facing the prospect of rising unemployment and job insecurity. Many of them have lost their businesses or life savings. And those opposite come in here and play games. They belittle the parliamentary process, they make a mockery of Question Time and now here before us we have a proposal to guillotine 39 pieces of major legislation. Thirty-nine pieces of major legislation are to be dealt with in three days. Those opposite should be held totally and publicly accountable for what is a total failure of their responsibilities resoluto this Parliament. The Opposition parties are prepared to come back extra days before Christmas to debate this legislation, to make sure it gets a fair hearing, to make sure we do the right thing with some particularly difficult issues like the wool industry. The wool industry is now in crisis in the midst of what is a rural crisis, being described by the industry as the worse since the J930s-and the Government is prepared to give relevant legislation two hours. It stands totally condemned in the eyes of the Australian people by its inability to rise to what they expect from it. Let us just go back to the last election campaign and look at the overwhelming vote against both major parties. People are sick and tired of the failure of politicians in this House to live up to their responsibilities. They demand that we lift our game. The Opposition parties have spent all the time since March trying to do that-staying away from personal abuse, trying to focus the Qovernment's attention on the issues, trying to ask serious questions. We are constantly being criticised by some of the Government's mates in the gallery because we do not seem to be asking the sorts of questions they think would be nice from the point of view of their blood sport entertainment. But they are questions that the people of Australia want answered. The realistic expectation of the people of Australia is that major pieces of legislation of this sort would be subject to serious and substantive parliamentary debate; The ultimate challenge we have given the Government in order to raise its parliamentary standards has been to suggest that the proceedings of this House be televised. I think that would probably be the easiest way that we could ensure that the people of Australia could be the judge of the Government's adherence to parliamentary standards. I would like to see the Leader of the House standing up on national television and defending the posal to guillotine 39 Bills through this Parliament in three days. I would like see the Treasurer come in here and turn his mouth on on national television see how the people of Australia respond. I would like the people of Australia to be given the chance to judge whether our questions are relevant, whether the Govareas ernment has the capacity to answer them and whether it is living up to its responwere sibilities. I would say there would be overwhelming rejection of the performconnect ance of this Government, that has constatement, sistently held this House in contempt, consistently failed to live up to the tations of the average people of Australia and has consistently failed to deliver it is paid to do-which is to provide good government, consistent government, in best interests of Australia, not in the interests of the present Government's union mates, not in the best interests of, in the case of the Minister, his Telecom mates, not in the best interests of some mine it. extreme green group or, as we have seen today, some ethnic buy-outs on the eve the election. They want to see the ernment govern in the best interests Australia, and it should start by lifting standards of its own performance in this House. .",36
137,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,in reply-We have just heard a surprising contribution from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). It ucated. is the sort of new backbencher speech in this chamber that displays absolutely no comprehension of the technical issues that dominate the parliamentary program. Mr Downer-You would never say this on television.,38
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable ber for Mayo!,38
139,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The Leader of the Opposition did say one thing that convinced me that perhaps if we can arrange more time to debate the issue then we should. Mr Downer-No, you wouldn't.",38
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAK,URGENT LEGISLATION,ER Order! The with honourable member for Mayo!,38
141,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"That is in the telecompromunications area. When it comes down to planning the program for the next sitto ting week in December I will make some time available for that. Quite clearly the and Leader of the Opposition prepared his speech in advance of the Government's statement, has been unable to vary it since and clearly does not comprehend many of that Telecom package. I just go to one area, and that is his view that we setting up a situation where Telecom an Australia determines the price of interof the new competitor. That which is fundamental to the has issue of competition, clearly shows that expecthe Leader of the Opposition has not comprehended the document that has been what put before him by the Government. The arbiter of the price-and it will have abthe solute authority-will be the Australian best Telecommunications Authority (Austel). There will be an opportunity for Telecom and the other outfit to discuss the price but in the final analysis Austel will deterQuite evidently, there is a plethora of of comment now-even from characters like GovHenry Ergas who a couple of weeks ago of were bagging me rotten-saying that yes, the this is now the most competitive telecommunications package being introduced by any government anywhere in the world. the Leader of the Opposition has failed to take that on board, clearly we have to provide an opportunity for him to be edI do now accept, on the basis of the things the Leader of the Opposition has said, that in that area of government policy alone there is an absolute requirement on us in this place to get. some comprehension into his head about what is acgoing on in this country and in the memgovernance of this country. Mr Beale-What about the Aussat Bill?",38
142,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I do not imagine that Opposition members would have any problem with the Aussat Bill. The Aussat Bill is a technical Bill that, firstly, privatises it and, secondly, allows it to compete Telecom Australia. It does not set up a duopoly or anything else. If Opposition members ha,:,e problems with the Aussat Bill, they will have very real pn?btwo lems with where they happen to be gomg on that subject. Mr Smith-Why are you guillotining these Bills? .",38
143,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I am very happy to have to comprehend. hlk about the guillotine. I thought I would give the Leader of the Opposition some degree of credit in that, because he chose to raise those issues, I assumed he wanted some sort of answer to them. I think we have a problem with parliaGovernment mentary sittings which we have to think through. Opposition members can go through all the argy-bargy they like, which the back bench. they constantly do .in this place, about this being the shortest number of sittings patterns, that any government has had since year dot. Let us analyse it objectively. The fact is that we are having a normal ever pattern of sittings for thjs session-a noronce happened. mal number of sitting weeks and a normal every Thursday there number of sitting days. That was not the The combination of those case in the first half of the year had an election. Next year we will have normal number of sittings-probably a greater number of sitting days than we have had for some considerable period time, going back, indeed, well beyond period of the Fraser Government. We will have a lengthy period - of sitsitions tings, but we will also have guillotines in place. Part of the reason for that relates to the fact that we have a two weeks on, two weeks off sitting pattern. That has back into the sitting period become very important to us. It enables of the Government to put forward members of this Parliament to go into their electorates and consult with their constituents. But there is a penalty: when we had the three weeks on, one week off sitting pattern, but fewer hours of sittings in the three weeks, that was not able to occur. When we had sitting patterns of three weeks on, one week off, the governmas. ment of the day increased the number sitting hours, added the odd day here and there, and substantially expanded the number of sitting days. As a result, all medicos in this place sent letters to memsider bers of the Opposition and of the Governyear ment. Both sides of the House came to the conclusion, quite happily, that we needed a sitting pattern of two weeks on, weeks off. Everybody agreed on that. There is a cost in that: there is no flexibility to introduce additional hours and days of sitting, The flexibility that was present no longer exists. That is something which members of the Opposition Another thing they have to comprehend is this: all the processes to provide back bench time were rolled by the Government into Thursday mornings. That is now regarded as sacrosanct. We allow no or Opposition front bench material effectively to operate in this period that we regard as sacrosanct for The fact is that under the old sitting whilst time was allowed on the Thursday mornings to debate motions moved by the back bench, that hardly in four or Perhaps it would happen five times. These days, is time available. two factors has when we substantially compressed the a able for Government business. time availThere is an additional factor, that is, of the activity of the Senate. The Senate the moves at its own pace and has its own processes of deliberation. Its processes of deliberation in its new committee propoare slowing down even further its capacity that we send to consider the sort of material to it. In slowing down that pace of consideration, it pushes further the capacity legislation to it which it wants dealt with by the end of the year. The principal restraint on us is simply this: we have to make a calculation at this time of the year as to what the Senate can carry in the last six weeks before ChristIt cannot and will not carry mateof rials which we are introducing in the course of this next week. It will not carry anything that we do after that. The Senate the insists that anything it wants us to conand put in place by the end of this must be before it by this Friday. The Senate has done that now for a period. All of these matters, as the Leader of the Opposition rightly says, are essential to the good governance of this country. It is important that we arrive at the right conclusions on them. I agree with him. What he said was absolutely correct. If these important measures are going to be in place by the end of this year, they must be before the Senate by the end of the week. That is all there is to it. If honourshould able members are concerned about standards in this place, they ought to think proposition through quite seriously and take it on board. The issue of Question Time was raised. We agreed with the Opposition that not enough questions were being asked during Question Time. As a result, Question Time in this place is of unprecedented length, as we ensure that the average number of questions asked is greater than the number asked during the period of the Fraser Government. We are now achieving that. We addressed that issue of Question Time and then we went to the Opposition and said, 'Let us now take a look at Question Time and work out whether the way in which they do it in the mother of parliaments, in Britain, a better way of getting into place a better information process in this chamber'. Members on both sides of the chamber know what Question Time is about. Whether it concerns us in government or those in opposition, Question Time is not about putting the Government or the public on the mat on questions of detail; it is about arguing the issues of the day via a Question Time process. That is what happens. We offered those opposite the opportunity to take two or three Ministers, as occur- in Britain at Question Time, and gc..' lUough the detail of those Ministers' portfolios. We will not get a Question Time that goes through the detail of the telecommunications packagenot ever. It is stupid to come into this place and say that Ministers should change their habits and the Parliament should change its rules to make Ministers give shorter answers. We will not get that until the very nature of Question Time is changed tc the point where it ceases to be an occasion when the issues of the day are aired and instead gets into details of portfolios. When Opposition members want to do that-and we have offered them the opportunity to do that-they should tell us. Having rejected the opportunity we offered them to turn Question Time into a serious information gathering point, they not come in here and make second grade parliamentary speeches. If I wrote that to Canberra High School and asked the students to come into this place and have a debate about their views on the Opposition and the Government, I am quite sure that those 17-year-olds would deliver a speech exactly like that which has been delivered by the Leader of the Opposition. He portrayed absolutely no sense or comprehension about how this chamber works. I appreciate the fact that the speech was delivered by the Leader of the Opposition and not by the Manager of Opposition Business, because he would never dare to get up in this place on this sort of issue and make the sort of speech which was isn't made by the Leader of the Opposition, who chose in what ought to be a technical debate to make the same sort of speech he would make during matter of public importance debates, personal explanations or Liberal Party conferences. This is a parliament and the Leader of the Opposition is a parliamentarian. These issues go to the way in which Parliament operates. There are clearly problems in the way in which Parliament operates. The resolution of some of those problems lies in the Senate. The resolution may lie in the fact that perhaps we ought to go back and consider whether we still want to operate on the two weeks on, two weeks off basis. We should consider whether it is important to keep so much time for consideration of backbenchers' issues. I think it is important, but if Opposition members say it is important to forget about that and instead debate Government business, let us hear their views on that. The speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition was fine for a matter of public importance debate. When he makes a contribution to parliamentary matters, be should at least portray some knowledge of the parliamentary process and not come in here with this pathetic argy-bargy.",39

155,Mr FIFE,PAIRS,"The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has already outlined the Opposition's oPP9sition to what is being proposed by the Government in relation to the use of the guillotine. I reinforce what he said and indicate that the times allocated in the schedule are unrealistic and will not give sufficient time .. on for anyone of these Bills to be properly considered. I also refute the comment made by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) when he indicated that the present arrangements put in hand by the Government in relation to Question Time will allow the average number of ql.ie-tions asked this year to equal the. average number .of. tions asked dunng the Fraser penod. I remind the Leader of the House that in 1976 an average of 19 questions were· asked each day; in 1978, 16; in 1979, 16; in 1980, 16; in 1981, 15.2; and in 1982, 16.2. Those figures will not be realised in 1990 in accordance with the arrangements that are presently in hand. Indeed, the so-called 14 questions that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) indicated that he would like to see asked each day was not reached today. For example, today only 12 questions were asked and answered. The Leadet .of the House, when he referred to Question Time, also tried to compare the situation in the House of Representatives here in Australia with that which applies in Great Britain. He failed to point out, of course, that the House of Commons meets .on an average of 170 days each year. This particular year in Australia we will meet for only 36 days, unless some additional days are provided as we run up towards Christmas. The Hawke Government has progressively reduced the number of sitting days of the House of Representatives. In 1989, it was 59 days; and in 1986, it was 79 days. So there has been a further reduction there. To ensure that the House and, indeed, the people listening in other parts of Australia are fully informed, the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill has been allocated 15 minutes; the International Development .Association (Further Payment) Bill, 40 mmutes; the Law and Justice Amendment Bill, 40 minutes; a package of sales tax measures, 40 minutes; and the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bi1l1 .50 minutes. The Leader of the OppOSItIon referred to the wool package; and five separate Bills in this important area have been allocated only two hours. We oppos- not only the use of the guillotine on thIS occasion but also the timetable that has been outlined by the Leader of the House. Mr .TUCKEY (O'Col1nor) (4.37)-ln acceptmg these particular time limits, this House is voting itself irrelevant. We are telling Australia thai we do not matter. We are saying, 'Don't worry about us. The Senate is the only place where adequesquate time will be given to debate'. It was interesting to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) say that when he came to tpis place he had some preconceptiqns about Question Time. I came here with the preconception that this was the dominant House in the Parliament and that I could have some pride in that. Yet what has happened? We have sptmt weeks in this session doing very little. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) bemoans the lack of availability of time. I suggest to the Leader of the House that he go back through the weeks and have a look at speakers' lists of up to 20 honourable members, which I do not object to, but traditionally the Government has so little legislation at the beginning of the session and turns up with it all at the end. The Leader of the House tells us that the Parliament should now spend an hour and a quarter on Question Time. Having regard to the statistics quoted .by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) of up to ·19 questions being asked and answered, I remind the Leader of' the House thilt they were answered in 45. minutes in the time of the Fraser Government. I also remind him. that the Canadian Parliament has frequently answered 40 questions in 45 minutes. We do not want more time for Question Time eroding the time of the Parliament so that we have got to come back to this type of guillotine. We want questions answered briefly and concisely and the answers to be relevant to the questions. We do not want Ministers getting dorothy dixers so that they can lay down policy which they should properly do by statement. We know why Ministers do not do it by statement. It is because the convention requires that the Government get a response from the Opposition, and it does not want that, or the Government certainly demonstrates that it does not. As the Manager of Opposition Business has quoted some statistics, I have on many occasions quoted the decline in this Parliament of the number of statements made by Ministers. The ministerial statementa major factor that should apply in this House-has almost disappeared off the scene and become extinct. The ministerial statement, the issue by which the House of Representatives is supposed to deal with matters of policy development, has become extinct because Ministers do not like having to answer fof' their policy. Ministers would much rather get a dorothy dixer, use up Question Time and, of course, create a situation where they have got nothing to say. As the Manager of Opposition Business has pointed out, these are not a lot of nursery rhyme type pieces of legislation. Each and everyone of them is extremely important and, as such, it is the Government's responsibility-if it believes this House has any relevance-to give the time to have them properly debated. It is the Government which has increased the numbers in this Parliament-we have another 24 people trying to fit into less time-and now it wants to apply the guillotine as it traditionally does. But let us remember why: it is because the Government cannot put its legislative program together at the beginning of the session and spread the legislation out evenly over that time. If the Government had got to and put its legislative program up at the beginning of the session, there, are plenty of committees that would have allocated sensible amounts of time. But the Government's administration is always just so bad that it never gets one of the decent Bills up until the last couple of weeks of the session-and it wants to blame that on the Senate. The Senate just got sick and fed up with the Government's not being able to put its plans together and dumping hundreds and hundreds of Bills on it in the last fortnight. That is why the Senate will not give it that privilege any morebecause the Government cannot organise its affairs and it cannot organise the counbe try either, and that becomes obvious by the day.",44
156,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS," I want to join the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in protesting this motion. In particular, I have a concern about the inclusion of the wool tax package in the Bills. But on the general package I start off first by saying that there is absolutely no reason why the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) cannot conduct affairs in this place as do those who run the Senate. They have consultations as to which legislation they are going to put through, by which time the debate is going to be concluded and, as a result, they are able to get a rational debate on those issues that they will conclude before the House rises. . Of course it is true that this sort of motion has been in this place before, but it is not true that there have been matters of such substance, affecting significant sections of the community in the way that this package does, that have just been passed over without adequate debate. My constituents. need to understand that, as far as superfine wool is concerned, only last week in Newcastle for some classes of superfine wool there was a rise, I am told, of about 500c a kilogram and about 20 growers sold their wool-on a day when everybody else was talking about how depressed the wool market was-for 2,000c a kilogram. Quotas, which are to be applied through legislation that is to be aborted through this chamber, could reduce the production of that wool which is highly saleable. We have a problem in knowing the basis of those quotas; we have a difficulty in the application of a slaughter scheme. The Government is not going to allow any debate on these issues, neither from this side of the House nor from the other, for those who have interests and concerns in rural electorates. The repercussions of one sector of the community having its income reduced by about 61 per cent-not by these Bills, sure, but as a result of market measures, as a result of these steps and others-will that a large number of people who live in country towns and country cities and, I suggest, in other urban centres around Australia will feel the impact. None of those issues can be debated when less than two hours is allowed for that debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, 1 say to you that this package of 39 Bills is different, therefore, from many that have been put before this chamber in the past. There is a way by which the Leader of the House can ensure there is a debate. 1 suggest that he have a consultation with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) about a rational means by which these measures can be dealt with, if the Senate deadline is to continue. What about having a discussion with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button)? What about seeing whether some arrangement can be entered into so that there can be a rational debate; so that there can bea variation of the deadline? It is not a matter of coming in here and telling us, 'The Senate's going to determine what the House of Representatives does'. It is within the ability of the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister to discuss with their colleagues to get an extension of that time-and I am sure that, if they did so, they would find those of us in the Opposition would be only too prepared to agree with them, to allow some variation and to seek with our senatorial colleagues that just that variation be permitted.

157,Mr KERR,AYES NOES,"ln the time we have to consider the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill I would like to make a few points. Firstly, we have moved a long way towards a new attitude to relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and that bodes very well for future developments. I do not wish to stray from that positive view, but I do wish to turn to some matters that gave me real concern when the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was speaking-I understand on behalf of the Opposition executive-in the second reading debate. The honourable member for Curtin, who I understand holds a position of parliamentary secretary representing the Leader of the Opposition, raised a point about current Federal-State financial relations which I think should be viewed with grave concern, particularly by the smaller States and more particularly by my own State of Tasmania. At page 3486 of Hansard the honourable member for Curtin is quoted as follows: . Current Federal-State financial relations recognised as standing in the way of some microeconomic reform. The relativities determined by the Grants Commission, while designed to compensate States with relative revenue disabilities, may in fact encourage the States to maintain many of their inefficient public sector services and trading enterprises at the expense of moves towards privatisation. The question that obviously arises is this: What is that code for? What is intended on behalf of the Opposition executive? Does that mean it will resile from the compensation formula approved by the State Grants Commission? The consequence of that-if that is the Opposition policy-is plainly going to be devastating for the smaller States. For ex. . ample, in the financial year 1989-90 Tasmania received $529m of the total general purpose grant and in 1990-91, $550m. So this year in untied general grants Tasmania has received approximately $1,143 per head. If we were to apply a crude averaging process on a per capita basis, we would find that there would be a significant decline in funding to Tasmania. For example, the averaging of per capita grants under the total general purpose untied revenues is $826 per person per annum. Multiplying that by my State's population of just under half a million, a grant on an averaged basis, without any compensation factors applied, would come to $377,970,000. So there would be a shortfall of revenues to Tasmania of $172,030,000 per annum-$J 72m less to my State on that basis-or a cost to Tasmania of $375 per Tasmanian per annum. Other smaller States would suffer similar disabilities were their grants to be affected in the manner suggested by the honourable member speaking for the Opposition. For example, Queensland would be badly affected, so too would Western Australia and South Australia, and particularly savagely affected would be the Northern Territory. , It is important, I believe, given that the Opposition is. responding to the Bill in this way, for it to indicate plainly what its policy is with respect to revenue disabilities. On its face the remarks by the are also shadow parliamentary secretary would appear to commit the Liberal Party to a move away from those relativities or an abandonment of them. On behalf of Tasmania, and I am sure on behalf of my fellow Tasmanian members of the House on the Opposition side, I wish to know what is the implication for Tasmania. Certainly I am confident that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck), the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) would wish to have very prompt answers to a proposition that would appear likely to impact so savagely on the finances of our home State. I am certain, too, that the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) would be more than a little curious to understand the impact of those relativities. There would appear to be a very serious question posed here-a question the Opposition will have to answer. I ask honourable members opposite very publicly to come clean,to say what they mean by what is set forth in their response to this Bill, and to advise the House whether they seek to move away fro-. what .1 understood previously to b- .a Jomt POSItion. If there is to be a resllm- from the relativities process that prevIOusly had been an agreed position betw-en both sides of this House, I would belIeve - hat every Tasmanian's voice wo-ld be raIsed against it because our State sImply cannot stand a loss of $1 12m per annum on that basis. ' If I might turn finally to another comment of the shadow parliamentary secretary, at page 3485 of Hansard there is a reference to the fact that. the present arrangements effectively mean that there is a more or less uniform system of taxation across the country. Again I ask: What is that code for? Is there a hidden agenda? Do Opposition members wish to have competition between the States-a drive to the bottom, offering different and lower rates of tax so they can attract business across State boundaries using tax minimisation and various other devices as a fairly crude mechanism of attracting short term benefits? If that is the case, it is not in the national interest. It is not in the national interest to have short term advantages held out .which would end up driving down total revenues in the end for no national or State advantage. A drive to the bottom in terms of competition in this area has always been resisted by this House. It has been resisted by economists wherever they write about comparative economies. It would simply destroy the national infrastructure. If I could conclude, we do need to look very strongly not merely at arguments about distribution of untied grants; we need to look very significantly at increasing national capital infrastructure.",47
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,Order! The time allotted for debate on this matter has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.,49

163,Mr HAND,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (5.01)-I move: ---- the Bill be now read a second time. That Mr Speaker, the main purpose of this Bill is to remove an inequity based on gender which has existed in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948-the Act-since its commencement on 26 January 1949. I am also taking the opportunity afforded by this Bill to correct three minor administrative difficulties with the operation of the Act. Honourable members will be aware that, prior to 26 January 1949, people born or naturalised in Australia were British subjects and that the Act introduced the status of Australian citizen on that date. The transitional provisions of that Act automatically conferred Australian citizenship status on 26 January 1949 upon British subjects if they were born outside Australia and New Guinea and their fathers were born in Australia or New Guinea and acquired Australian citizenship on January 1949, and they had entered tralia and been allowed to stay permanently. The Act provided that those this persons who had not previously entered Australia became Australian citizens tomatically when they did so, providing their entry was for permanent residence. Following amendments to the Act on 6 May 1966, such persons were also required to be British subjects upon entry to Australia if they entered on or after that date. The transitional provisions were repealed on 1 May 1987. Although this provision enabled a child to acquire Australian citizenship by dean scent through the father, there was no similar provision for Australian citizenperson's ship to be acquired by descent through an Australian mother. This Bill will enable a person born side Australia and New Guinea before 26 tive delay. January 1949 to apply for and acquire Australian citizenship by descent through registration where the person's mother beAct came a citizen on 26 January 1949 proship viding .certain requirements are met. To ensure the provision corresponds with the provision. to acquire Australian citizenment ship through a father, only a person whose mother was born in Australia or New Guinea, or who had been naturalised in Australia before 26 January 1949; will eligible. The person also must have been present in Australia at some time before 1 May 1987, and apply for registration an, approved form. There will be no application fee and, upon registration being approved, eviAct dence of citizenship will be issued free the usual charge. The Bill will also allow the children these applicants to be include5i-!n the istration. No age limit will apply to these persons. This provision is based on deby scent. The concession will therefore be limited to the natural issue of the parent from whom the benefit derives. Unlike the paternal concession, ever, the proposed provision will not be limited to British subjects, the definition for which was repealed from the Act 1987 to remove discrimination. A five26 year limit will apply to the lodgement of Ausapplications under this provision. While the number of people covered by provision is thought to be small, absence of it has nonetheless caused considauerable and justifiable concern to those affected and it is clearly a discriminatory matter which needs to be .rectified. I will now move to discuss the minor administrative difficulties that the Bill seeks to remedy. The Act currently requires a person who applies for registration of citizenship by descent to be registered within 18 years after the person's birth. The Bill will ensure that where application for the registration of citizenship by descent is lodged before the eighteenth birthday. but actual registration has not been effected prior to that date, then the person will not be outdenied citizenship because of administraThe Bill will amend section lOB of the to provide that registration of citizenby descent may be effected where an application is lodged at a place of registration, usually an office of my Departor Australian mission overseas, no later than an eligible person's eighteenth birthday. This amendment will be retrospective to rectify cases where administrabe tive oversight has resulted in unlawful registration after the eighteenth birthday of persons who applied prior to that time on and who have satisfied all other requirements. The Bill also amends section 13 of the to ensure that a child who has been of included in a responsible parent's application, but whose name has been unintenof tionally omitted from the certificate of regcitizenship, and who is over 16 years of age, can nevertheless acquire citizenship amendment of the responsible parent's certificate of citizenship. Section 13 currently requires that the child has to be under 16 at the time the certificate of howcitizenship was amended. This amendment will overcome doubts associated with departmental practice of remedying this in situation by amending the responsible parent's certificate pursuant to section 47 of the Act . The final matter addressed by the Bill relates to the definition of an application for the purposes of the Act. To ensure that all applications lodged under the Act can be properly identified and the appropriate application fee- a\e p-id, the Bill provides that an applIcatIOn IS not made unless it is on an approved form, accompanied by the prescribed fee and is' received at an office of my Department or official representative of the Australian Government overseas designated for such a purpose. This provision is consistent with similar provisions in the recently amended Migration Act 1958. I present the explanatory memorandum to this ,Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA",49

I wish to record that the Opposition would have wished to divide on that legislation. NA ASSOCIATION (FURTHER PAYMENT) BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 October, on motion by Dr Blewett: That the Bill be now read a second time.",51
167,Mr RUDDOCK,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"Discussion of the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill, which we are discussing under guillotine, will of necessity be somewhat abridged. It is important legislation and the discussion therefore will be somewhat incomplete. The purpose of the Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia of some -382,500,000 towards the ninth replenIshment of the International Development Association. The International Development Association is the concessionallending arm of the World Bank and its resources are directed towards the poorest members of the Association. Australia has been a member of that Association since it was established in 1960 and it has contributed to the previous eight replenishments which have occurred. The International Development Association Act of 1960 authorised the first Australian contribution and further contributions were authorised under further payments Acts in subsequent years. The most recent contribution was authorised by this Parliament in 1987. In the explanatory memorandum and the Act, the program of payments by way of contribution that Australia might make is detailed. The fact is that in this legislation we are going to make provision for some eight to 10 years future contributions by Australia. Certainly the estimate draw-downs are given for 1990-91, 199192, 1992-93 and 1994-95 and a figure is also given for the next four to six years beyond that. It is mentioned that these might change, partly because they are dependent upon exchange rates. So those variations are pointed out in the statement that is before u-. We in the Opposition recognise that the International Development Association is a valuable contributor to development in the poorest countries. We recognise that it does provide major public infrastructure projects and that this is normally accompanied by discussion which can take place and in which we can play an influential, role as the Association can play an influential role in the policies of the countries to which these advantaged loans are being made. It is expected that this will be a great influence, particularly in Africa where there is a need for reforms. It has also been noted that in recent years it has helped Indonesia, particularly with restructuring and deregulation that has resulted in significant economic growth in that country with subsequent spin-offs for Australia. These contributions, together with food aid and the major contributions that Australia makes to the poorest developing countries, are important. The fact that we play this important role is frequently cited as an excuse for not giving more to low income countries. I know that that is not often seen by other countries that are seeking bilateral support, but that is the case. These contributions are· significant in that respect. We in the Opposition are particularly concerned that the commitments set out in this Bill have the potential to lock Australia into a pattern of grants for the next eight to 10 years. We do not have reference to forward Estimates and therefore it is difficult to be sure of the precise quantitative effects of commitments of this sort. But it does have the potential to restrict government reaction in the future as the government of the day might see appropriate. It may well be that in a situation of a change in government, a coalition government could be restricted in its ability to give effect to policies for increased emphasis on bilateral aid, increased emphasis in real terms in the form of food aid or the greater share of the aid budget in support of the activities of nongovernment agencies. These are matters that we have stressed in our own policies over time. The supporting speech of the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) gives no justification for the level selected and it does not address this question of the locking in of future contributions in this way. It is appropriate that on behalf of the Opposition I should record our disappointment at the extent to which this does lock in the aid budget payments to a point where it has been extended for eight to 10 years, thus reducing the future flexibility of governments 'of the day. I need also to make clear that the Opposition will not necessarily support further pledges at the same level. The Opposition wishes to ensure that it does have the capacity to make its own changes without restrictions imposed by this Government. For this reason I mention those limitations. I want to indicate my interest and the Opposition's interest in the question relating to the International Development Association and its emphasis upon the poorest of the poor. There have been efforts by parliamentarians across all political parties. Senator Hill, the spokesman for the Opposition on foreign affairs, and I have taken the opportunity at different times in the recent past to write to the president of the World Bank, in concert with o.ur colleagues, suggesting that there was a need for the World Bank to look at the way in which it was responding, particularly to issues in this development area. One issue that we took up was the ,role of women in development. Women produce 80 per cent of the food eaten in Africa. In other poor countries the situation is quite similar, yet too often this dominant role of women has not been recognised in the design of development projects. We saw this situation in a Food and Agriculture Organisation project in East Africa, for instance, which foundered because it almost neglected to consult the women who performed most of the farming and storage functions. When writing to the bank, members commended it to incorporate the needs and - nputs of the poor women in planning and implementation of further projects, not so much as an imperative to social justice, but be-. cause the weight of sheer economic and social pragmatism was involved in putting that view forward. In· relation to the poorest of the poor, only 25 per cent of the bank's loans in the past have been for agriculture and about 60 per cent of these were not directly poverty oriented. The World Bank projects emphasised· export agriculture so that countries might gain foreign exchange because it believed that countries should produce products in which they had comparative advantage. This course has been pursued at the expense of food production crops for domestic consumption and often leayes the ,poor no better off. In our request to Mr Barber Conable of the World Bank, we put before him the need to emphasise that export agriculture can leave Third World economies vulnerable, particularly when prices fall. We said that there was a special need to reach the poorest of the poor, those whose lives and health were threatened by not having enough money· for food. yve also reco-­ nised that there were specIal problems m reaching them. They had few assets such as land to help earn money and they may not have been able to risk trying something new. We saw that the World Bank had been quite derelict in the past for not sufficiently benefiting the poorest people in this sense and we suggested that bank activities ought to be more carefully targeted. There is the' opportunity for this emphasis to be pursued thr.ough this legislation that we are supportmg. In the area of adjustment lending, the members who wrote at that time suggested that the bank sometimes makes loans conditional upon a country adjust-. ing and changing its economic policies. These are important matters that I have mentioned before. Very often, without proper controls, this .could lead to reductions in basic health and education funding and that often had an impact upon some of the poorest' people. So we recommended to the bank that it should shift spending from expensive hospitals, for instance, to primary health care and to the design of further adjustment policies to cushion the poor and to help improve services where they were'rilbst needed. Then th-re was the question of cooperation . with indigenous non-government' agencies. Many studies had shown that project success was considerably enhanced by the involvement of indigenous groups in project planning and implementation monitoring and that non-government organisations considerably affected the success rate of projects, particularly after external subsidies disappeared. So these were matters upon which members of this Parliament, very conscious of the need for a change in approach, made recommendations for significant change; I note that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who' is in the chamber, was another one of the very active signatories to those requests. It ought to be seen that the bank has responded. Time will tell whether those responses are brought about by effective changes in policy which change the condition of the people whom we have particularly mentioned. The bank is certainly the largest development institution in the world. It is 59· times larger than United Nations Children's Fund, an organisation in which members of this House take a particular interest; 105 times larger than the International Fund for Agricultural Development, another organisation in which members of this Parliament have taken an interest; and 217 times larger than the Child Survival Fund. So we can see why the poverty focus of this organisation, when it is compared with others and is seen to be less than desirable, is so important. It· has the potential to reach further than those organisations which have so targeted their support. . Some 90 per cent of tlw funds for Wor-d Bank loans are borrowed in developed . countries such as Australia and 10 per cent come from the governments of particular countries. Invariably, World Bank loans have not been directed to the poor specifically, and that has been a matter of particular concern. Certainly I and my colleagues welcome the' way in which the Bank has responded to the requests we have made to it over time, but there ought to be a continued emphasis by Australia on ensuring that, in supporting the Wodd Bank's activities through this fund, this focus is continued. We have a special capacity to influence· those matters. As I have mentione<;l, the Opposition wants to ensure that there is a proper focus in activity by Australia. We have expressed a concern that funding' over a long period of time might destn;>y our capacity to influence that focus. That is the reason that we have made the suggestions today on the way in which our commitment over time might be couched. We want to ensure that there is this flexibility to ensure that the way in which the International Development Association and the World Bank respond is influenced by the concern we in this Parliament and, more broadly, the Australian community have that' there be a very clear focus on the poorest of the poor; women, where that has been identified; and, particularly, the need for change in the adjustment lending process.",51
168,Mr LANGMORE,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"Fraser) (5.22)Firstly, I have a few comments to make on the speech by the honourable member for"" Dundas (Mr Ruddock). I think it is very important that the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill make provision for long term forward commitments for the International Development Association (IDA). After all, we are all talking about aid for development purposes, not for charity. We are talking about support for projects which will increase the capacity of those countries to earn more income. That cannot be done by annu-l contributions. It requires projects which will take years to plan, to design and to build. For those sorts of projects, it is very important that the IDA and the countries to which it contributes have long term commitments. I think the conceptual framework for those long term commitments is absolutely sound. There would be a d-fficulty in making those forward commItments only if aid were going to be cut, but I am glad to say that the Labor Government has started to increase its real level of aid again albeit by a small amount in this Budg-t. Nevertheless, aid is risin& - n re-l terms again, whereas the OpposItIon m the election campaign announced that it was planning to reduce aid by a further $ 100m. It is in that context that any forward commitment is a problem. i know that the honourable member for Dundas would like to see his own Party increasing aid, and I am sure that there are' many others in the Opposition for whom that is also true. But the fact is that it was promising to cut aid, and it is that kind of commitment by the Opposition which would create a problem of forward commitments to the IDA. The other point that is important is that all members of the World Bank group accept the forward commitment framework for the IDA. If Australia were to break away from that, it would be the only member of the World Bank group not accepting that framework. That is simply not on. Pledges are essential. The other point I would like to make about the IDA is that it is a particularly effectively managed concessional aid ?rganisation. It is being constantly scrut,mised by member governments, and I thmk it is a very appropriate place through which Australian aid can be given in the most effective ways. I think it is very important to support this Bill, and I am glad to see that the Opposition is doing so, despite its slight reservations. The honourable member for Dundas questioned how Australia's contribution was calculated. It was the contribution we were asked to make in roughly proportional terms with previous contributions, less a little, I regret to say. Our own contribution this time is slightly reduced proportionally compared with that of the previous round. That is something to be regretted. I do not want to speak for very long because I know ,that other honourable members w-mt ,to speak, but it is important to recognise the context in which this certainly quite large contribution is being made. The total contributiqn by Australia this year to the International DeveloI?ment Association is around $ 100m. It IS a large contribution, so it, is important that people recognise why it is being given and how effectively those funds ,are being used. The reason it is being given is that there are a billion people li ving in abso-, lute poverty with very low incomes. In World Bank terms, that means that roughly a billion people are hungry eve'ry day-one-fifth of humankind. The situation for many of these people has been getting worse. People in indebted countries have experienced a reduction in their real living standards of about 10 per cent during the 1980s. The situation has been becoming worse for them both in absolute terms and' in comparative terms. It is just worth noticing that the average income in industrialised Western countries is 50 times the average in these low income countries-an extraordinary situation. I want to pick up for one moment a - point the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) made in his speech. He talked about the level of resource flows from developed to developing countries having fallen by 50 per cent in constant terms. That is true, but it does hide the fact that the net resource flows to indebted developing countries-those which have significant levels of overseas debt-has been negative for most of the eighties. Since the debt crisis began in 1983 the net financial transfers to the highly indebted countries have averaged in. the region of $US30 billion to $US40 billion a year. In 1989 there were net flows from those highly indebted countries to the rich creditor countries of $50 billion. That is an entirely perverse flow. That takes account of all financial flows-investment, loans and aid. But taking account of all that, those highly indebted developing countries are sending $50 billion more to the creditor countries than they are receiving in aid, investment or loans .. That is an entirely perverse, destructive and unjust pattern of financial flows, and the International Development Association is an important contributor to reversing that process. That is perhaps the central reason why we should support it. We those few remarks, I support the Bill and give some more time to the Opposition to comment.",54
169,Mr NUGENT,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"ln the last 30-odd years I have had the opportunity to travel extensively in different parts of the world. I have seen the lepers in the streets in Africa, the beggars of India and other places, and some pretty terrible sights in. Third World countries. Let us all be quite clear that I believe Australia must contribute foreign aid to those in need. However, I do have some concerns about where that aid goes and how it is administered. Let us first look at the need and what we are doing now. In the last financial year Australia spent $1.2 billion on overseas aid-roughly $117 for each Australian voter. I suggest that this is not a particularly large sum. In 1970 we spent 0.55 per cent of gross national product (GNP) on aid. By 1984 it was down to 0.5 per cent. This year it is only 0.33 per cent of GNP. Again, I would suggest that the trend is in the wrong direction. The Government, the Opposition and the international aid agencies such as World Vision of Australia, all say, of course, that a proper target should by 0.7 per cent, and I think that is right. The disadvantages faced by citizens of developing countries are enormous. In 1990-this year-child mortality among children under five years of age in South East Asia is more than 170 deaths per 1,000. In Australia it is fewer than 10. Primary school education is out of reach of 110 million children in developing countries. Life expectancy in subSaharan Africa is 50 years, compared with 76 years in Australia. We live more than 50 per cent longer than people there. However, we have made a lot of gains in the last four decades. A recent United Nations development program report says that in developing countries life expectancy at birth has. increased from 46 to 62 years; mortality rates for children under five years have halved; primary health care is now accessible to 61 per cent and safe water to 55 per cent of populations; and adult literacy rates have increased from 43 per cent to 60 per cent. Even though these changes have occurred, the gap in income between the developing and industrialised nations has worsened. Per capita income of developing countries .is only 6 per cent that of industrialised countries. Australia's aid goes to Papua New Guinea, $338m; the South Pacific area, $108m; South East Asia, $262m; Africa, $118m; and multilateral organisations, $194m. So the need .exists, and Australia is making a contribution, but we would all, I am sure, like to do more. Of course, we need to fix the economy first, but I am not going to talk about that today. However, what I do want to talk about is the need to look at some of the practical problems of aid distribution in order to ensure that aid really is reaching its target. In the World Bank's anhual report for 1990 it is recognised that aid to a country should foster an environment of infrastructure services and incentives to encourage efficient production and private initiative. It is also recognised that preference should be given to countries which have the ability to make effective use of resources given to them. Unfortunately, sometimes we may need to provide some of that ability because often they do not have it for themselves. All too often in the past foreign aid has been judged by its good intentions and not by its results. Programs have been perpetuated and expanded not because they have succeeded but because giving foreign aid seemed like a good idea at the time, to use that rather hackneyed phrase. In fact, in scrutinising the practical sequences of careless handouts, it could sometimes have the opposite effect of that intended. The World Bank provides aid to Third World economies to help them grow. But domestic policies are, I suggest to the House, more important for growth than just international welfare, important though that is. The International Development Association (IDA) needs to be more aware of increased bureaucratic and political control that the wrong types of governments wield over the lives of their poorest of the poor. Giving countries more money that will be badly used is perhaps worse than not giving them any at all. Empowering corrupt and inept politicians to nile over their people has nothing to do with real development. Unfortunately, some of our aid goes in that direction on occasions. What the developing countries need is the promotion of the production of wealth, the encouragement of political responsibility and the encouragement of people to help themselves. Handouts of food, money and resources do not automatically create these things. Finally, I support the coalition view ready expressed by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock): coalition policy is to favour increased priority for bilateral aid, which we believe achieves developmental benefits that are generally better targeted at specifically Australian objectives. Recent Budget cuts have favoured international institutions at the expense of bilateral programs. Over 30 per cent of our aid goes via organisations such as the IDA or to Africa. The International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill before the House will lock us into a long term direction which we may wish to change when we come to government in 1993. We may well desire to give greater support to direct food aid and to channel other support via non-government organisations in our part of the world. We will, however, as has already been said by the honourable member for Dundas, support the Bill, con- but we express our concern about being locked into a 10-year commitment and the potential lack of flexibility that this creates for a future coalition government.",55
170,Mr ROCHER,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"The International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill provides for the replenishment of Australia's contribution to the International Development Association (IDA) for the 1991-93 period, which will amount to some $382.Sm. At 30 June 1989 Australia's total contribution to the IDA over the years had amounted to $1.3 billion. As the Treasury nOtes in its 1988-89 annual report for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Act, 'Australia is a major supporter of IDA and has encouraged a generous replenishment for IDA-9'. This generosity ignores the many criticisms that have been made from a wide range of sources about the effectiveness of the development assIstance dispensed by the IDA, and other members of the World Bank group, in achieving its stated goals. IDA assistance is meant to be targeted at the poorest developing countries. This poverty is measured in terms of gross alnational product per capita, so that most IDA credits go to countries with per capita national incomes below $US6S0 in 1988 terms. This introduces an obvious bias into these calculations in that the most populous countries in the world, namely China and India, immediately become amongst the most eligible countries for IDA assistance. According to the World Bank annual report for 1990, China and India are the two largest active IDA borrowers, receiving a maximum of 30 per cent. of the funds disbursed b- !he AssociatIOn. The bulk of the remammg funds are distributed among the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. China and India are not backward countries. Although they have a large rump of rural poor, they are nonetheless economic and have military powers of considerable note. As I have noted in this place on previous occasions, it is absurd that a large part of our overseas aid program-for that is what these interest-free loans from the IDA amount to-ends up supporting two of the greatest powers in our region. I should not have to remind the House that both China and India maintain nuclear weapons programs. Indeed, it could be said that India has developed a significant military capacity of some concern to its neighbours. China, apart from maintaining an enormous military and a thoroughly corrupt ruling class, has its own foreign aid program, amounting to some $US6 billion over the years. This aid has been directed towards such unworthy causes .as supporting the Stalinist regime in Albania and the Khmer- Rouge in Cambodia. China is also a major foreign investor, with direct investment in property, manufacturing and service industries in Hong Kong, the United . States and, to a minor extent, Australia. Despite China's 1979 open door policy and its excellent credit rating, which enables it to borrow vast amounts from foreign private banks, the World Bank has allocated some $ 5 billion in all to China over the last 10 years. The assistance we provide to China and India through the lOA is particularly galling in light. of the repeated Budget cuts to our direct bilateral aid program. Direct bilateral aid is something for which we at least receive some credit from the recipient countries. In the 1990-91 Budget Papers we find that o-r bilateral aid program has suffered as a duect result of our contributions international financial institutions such as the I--. In Budget Related Paper No.4, the Mmlster for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) notes that 'the requirement for increased payments to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in 1990-91 of more than $1 OOm has placed significant pressure on the aid budget'. The 1.6 per cent real increase in the aid budget, according to the Minister, was 'not sufficient to offset the full impact of increased payments to the banks,' resulting in cuts to many of our country to country programs. IDA lending to countries with appalling human rights records continues unabated. Indeed, the bank prides itself on the fact that it lends to countries regardless of their political or economic orientation, ignoring the fact that this has a considerable beari-g on the development prospects of these countries. The dubious lending priorities of the members of the World Bank group are symptomatic of its obsession with increasing the scale of its lending activities, regardless of the implications of such lending. To quote one World Bank official: We're like a Soviet factory. The push is to maximise lending. The pressures to lend are enormous and a lot of people spend sleepless-nights wondering how they can unload. projects. Our ability to influence projects in a way that makes sense is [thus] completely undermined. IDA credits are aimed principally at poverty alleviation projects. But the IDA also supplements the IBRD's structural adjustment lending. Structural adjustment lending currently accounts for around 25 per cent of disbursed IDA credits. IDA credits have been devoted to some extremely dubious projects. Funds for the so-called 'institutional development' 6f various state sector bureaucracies and government instrumentalities in the developing world is a favourite cause of the IDA, of which Ethiopia's Ministry of Agriculture has been a major beneficiary. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs . SulIivan)-Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question is that. this Bill be to now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The question now is that the remaining stages of the Bill be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 September, on motion by Mr Duffy: . That the Bill be now read a second time.  is just ridiculous. It is worse than ridiculous; it is outrageous. The Attorney General (Mr Duffy) is coming in here now. We are dealing with the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill. We have just put funds through for the International Development Association byway of the International Development Association(Further Payment) Bill. There is half an hour for my side of the House to put views on what I assume his Department worked at great length on-and I have spent a fair amount of time on it myself. If I am to enable my colleagues to contribute, I suppose I will have about 15 minutes. So much for democracy in this country! What about shovelling a bit of aid to' this Parliament so that we might sit a little longer? In the terms of the previous Bill we might be able to have a reasonable discussion. I wish to deal with the changes that are to be made to the Racial Discrimination Ad by this Bill, the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill. These changes seem on their face to be quite straightforward. However, significant amendments contained therein deserve detailed consideration, not the cursory treatment that will be given under this guillotining proposal. We will not be opposing these changes, although, for reasons I will explain, we have some concerns. Those concerns do not relate to the policy issues involved, for we are at one with the Government on this point, but are more of a practical nature. The changes to be made to the Racial Discrimination Act are threefold. Firstly, a definition of indirect discrimination will be inserted; secondly, the existing dominant purpose test will be removed; and, thirdly, provision will be made for vicarious liability for discriminatory conduct. I gather that these changes have come about as a result of recommendations made to the Government by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I have been advised that the Commission wrote to the Government setting out its recommendation. Despite a request to be provided with that letter, it has not been forthcoming to date, but I have consulted the 1988-89 annual report of the Commission, and at page 13 the report says, with respect to legislative review: Several matters raising significant human rights issues are under consideration to de-termine whether recommendations should be made to avoid inconsistencies with, or breaches of, human rights. That is a laudable aim, one almost akin to the fundamental tenet of equal opportunity principles that like cases be treated alike. As the Attorney-General intimated in his second reading speech, the changes to be made to the Racial Discrimination Act will bring the relevant test for discrimination in line with that already contained in the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984. Turning to the proposed definition of indirect discrimination, Article 1.1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which is set out in the schedule to the Racial Discrimination Act, defines racial discrimination to mean 'any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race . . . which has the purpose or effect of nullifying ot impairing . . . ' the enjoyment of rights of equality. At present section 9 (1) of the Act contains a definition of racial discrimination which is very broad in nature· and is in identical terms to the definition set out in Article 1.1, to which I have referred. It is said that the definition is one of direct discrimination. Direct discrimination arises if a person treats another person less favourably than others would be treated in comparable circumstartces. In Australia the classic example is the decision of· the Equal Opportunity Board of Victoria in Wardley v. Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd, 1984, reported at paragraph 92-002 of the 1984 Equal Opportunity Commission Reports. In that case Ansett refused to appoint a woman. We would all recall that Deborah Wardley, who was seeking to be a· trainee pilot, was denied that opportunity because of her child bearing potential or some other absurd reason. The Equal Opportunity Board held that the conduct of Ansett was discriminatory for the purposes of section 18 (l) of the Victorian Equal Opportunity Act 1977. That case later went to the High Court on the question of the relevance of section 109 of the Constitution vis-a-vis inconsistencies between State and Federal legislation. The Bill under present consideration seeks to introduce a new subsection 9 (lA), which contains a definition of indirect discrimination. Under the amendment, in order to make out th""at certain· conduct is discriminatory, it will be necessary to demonstrate that, firstly, the discriminator required the aggrieved person to comply with the requirement or condition; secondly, the requirement or condition was unreasonable; thirdly, the aggrieved person was not able to comply with the requirement or condition; and, finally, the requirement to comply had the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing· the enjoyment of rights of equality. UJ;lder this definition of indirection discrimination, it is' the act of requiring such compliance which is to be treated as the relevant act of discrimination. In the United States jurisdiction, the classic example of indirect discrimination is the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Griggs v. Duke Power Company, 1971, reported at volume 401 of the United States Supreme Court Reports at page 424. Let me tell the Attorney-General what happened. Let me paraphrase it for him. I am obliged to elucidate for the Attorney-General. In that case an employer required the potential employees to have a high school diploma certificate for certain jobs which were previously reserved for white employees. The Supreme Court held that such a requirement had the effect of discriminating against black employees. If it were not such a serious matter I would make an aside in regard to the Attorney-General's lack of discrimination at the races on Saturday! . In Koowarta v. Bjelke-Petersen, 1982, volume 153, Commonwealth Law Reports at page 168, the High Court was called upon to consider the constitutional validity of the Racial Discrimination Act vis-a-vis the external affairs power. In that case it was common ground for the parties that seCtion 9 gave effect to the terms of the Convention. Although the matter did not have to bedecided, in passing, the then Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs, noted at page 203: Section 9 does appear faithfully to pursue the purposes of the Convention. IIi this respect, the High Court noted that, for a law to be valid under the external affairs power, it must be within the terms of the relevant international convention. I note, however, that in later cases;-such as Richardson v. Forestry Commission, 1988, reported at volume 164 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 261, the High Court has said that such legislation need not slavishly reproduce the terms of the international convention relied upon. I assume that the Government has considered the constitutional implications involved in extending the definition of discrimination. If so, perhaps the Attorney-General could advise us of his views on the matte'I., The Racial Discrimination Act is the only piece of equal opportunity legislation not to have an indirect discrimination test. At the Commonwealth level such tests can be found in sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The convention that the Act implements has a definition of sexual discrimination in terms similar to the definition of racial discrimination in the convention I referred to just a moment ago. At the State level we find that an indirect discrimination test appears in the equal opportunity legislation of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. It is obviously desirable that there be formity between various pieces of equal opportunity legislation. However, I note that the test of indirect discrimination in the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act is slightly different in terms from that proposed under these amendments. For example, paragraph 5 (2) (a) of the Sex Discrimination Act says it is necessary to demonstrate that the relevant requirement or condition was one 'with which a substantially high proportion of persons of the opposite sex to the aggrieved person comply or are able to comply'. The High Court of Australia has had two occasions on which to consider the indirect discrimination test under the Sex Discrimination Act-in Australian Iron and Steel v. Banovic, 1989, reported at volume 89 of the Australian Law Reports at page 1; and in the Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v. Styles, 1989, reported at volume 88 of the Australian Law Reports at page 621. However, it was not required in either of those cases to consider the constitutional validity of the indirect test of sex discrimination. Banovic's case provides a useful illustration of the proportionality element in the test of indirect sexual discrimination. In that case, the employer adopted a 'last on, first. off' retrenchment policy. It was found that such a retrenchment policy resulted in indirect discrimination against female workers as the effect of past discriminatory employment practices meant that a substantially higher proportion of male employees were employed earlier and, as such, would not be liable for retrenchment. Although the purpose of these changes is to achieve uniformity in equal opportunity legislation, we can see that there are subtle yet significant differences. J' would very much appreciate hearing the views of the Attorney as to what the practical effect of these differences may be. I will now consider the changes that these amendments make to the existing dominant purpose test. Under section 18 of the Racial Discrimination Act, conduct can be discriminatory where it is done for uni- two or more reasons. However, as things stand at the moment, it is necessary to demonstrate that a person's race is one of the reasons for the conduct and, as such, is the dominant reason, for the carrying out of the discriminatory conduct. Under section 8 of the Sex Discrimi-. nation Act, a person's sex, marital status or pregnancy does not have to be the dominant or substantial reason for the doing of an act for the legislation to apply. It is only necessary that it be one of the reasons for the doing of the act. The Bill seeks to repeal section 18 of the Racial Discrimip.ation Act to replace it with a test similar to that contained in the Sex Discrimination Act. Under State equal opportunity legislation, where the relevant act is done on two or more grounds, different tests apply in different States. In Victoria, it is necessary to demonstrate the person's status as a substantial ground or reason. The same test also applies, in South Australia. In New South Wales it is only necessary to show that the person's status was a significant reason or ground for the less favourable treatment. Western Australia has a test similar to that contained in the Sex Discrimination Act to which I have referred. In Ardeshirian v. Robe River Iron Associates, 1990, a decision of the President of the Human Rights and Equal OppoJ;tuni(y Cominission, Si'r Ronald Wilson,. reported at paragraph 92-299 of the 1990' Equal Opportunity Commission reports, a concern was expressed that often the dominant purpose test is difficult to satisfy. In this respect, it was said that such a test requires an evaluation of the weight given to the different reasons, behind the impugned, conduct or decision and such an evaluation can be problematic in evidentiary terms, given that one is often dealing with reasoning which is sUbjective in nature. However, perhaps the contrary argument would be that conduct should not be held to be discriminatory where the discriminatory effects may be unintended or merely incidentaL There is merit in having uniformity between the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act and ,the Discrimination Act. Ho-ever, by, extension, it would also be deslfable that there be uniformity between State and Federal legislation in the area of equal opportunity. Hopefully, this may be' a matter that the Attorney-General can look into in consultatidn with State Attbrneys or State, equal opportunity bodies. ' , Finally, as I race through this matter in order that others may speak on the legislation, having regard to the time constraints that this Government has dumped on us, as I mentioned at the outset-Mr Duffy interjecting be finished in about 120 seconds time. I am dealing with matters of great import. ' I want to leave time for the Attorney to ' answer these legitimate points that I am raising. As I mentioned at' the outset of my remarks, the, third change this Bill seeks to make is to create vicarious liability for conduct which may involve racial discrimination. The Bill will introduce a new section 18 to provide that where an employee or agent of a person 'does an act in connection with his or her duties', which is unlawful under the Act, the person or employer shall be taken to have also done that act. The drafting of this provision is identi-' cal to that found in section 106 of the Sex Discrimination Act. I find the words 'this Act applies in relation to that person as if that person had also done the act' somewhat curious. It would appear to me that the provision as drafted has the effect of creating joint liability as opposed to vicarious liability. Perhaps I, am placing too much emphasis, on the words 'had also' but, nonetheless, I would appreciate some advice as to what the exact position may be. A qualification to' the liability created under the new section is that where the employer or person took all reasonable steps to prevent the occurrence of such an act, the employer or person will not be liable. In Boyle v. Ishan Osden 1986 a decision of the Commonwealth Hurn'an Rights Commission, as it then was, reported at paragraph 92-165 of the 1986 Sex, Equal Opportunity Commission Reports, it was held that, in relation to the same qualification found in section 106 of the Sex Discrimination Act, it was necessary to show that the employer took active steps reasonably to prevent the discrimination. It was also held that an employer can be liable without having any knowledge of the relevant conduct. So it would appear that the protection afforded by way of this qualification is somewhat narrow, to put it mildly. Under the proposed section, it is only necessary to show that the employee or agent did 'an ,act in connection' with his or her duties. The words 'in connection with' are of wide import. They stand in contrast to words such as 'pursuant to' or 'by reason of. It may mean that should an employee do an act which is not specifically authorised by the employer, the employer, notwithstanding the qualification I have referred to, could be liable. Although there may be some merit in considering a narrowing of such a liability to situations where the employee is carrying out acts within the authority, both real arid apparent, of the employer, the contrary argument is that the two pieces of legislation should, of course, be uniform. , I wish to convey to the Attorney my concern with the drafting of this provision and would hope that the operation of the test under both pieces of legislation can be kept under close scrutiny. In conclusion,' I repeat the comments I made earlier that the changes that this Bill seeks to make to th€-Racial Discrimination Act are very significant. They are changes which have our support, although, for the record, I have noted some of the concerris that we have ,with them. If this Government were really intent on ensuring a plausible and reasoned debate on issues as fundamen,tal as this, it would not be guillotining it in 30 minutes.",56
171,Mr MELHAM,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"1 want to concentrate on the proposed amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. I welcome the news that the Opposition does not oppose the ,changes to the Act. Under the terms of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, various amendments are being made to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and they are to be found in the schedule to the Bill referred to in clause 49. As the honourable member for Kooyong  proposes three amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act. After subsection 9 (1) a new section is to be inserted. Section 9 provides that racial discrimination is to be unlawful. The new subsection will extend the grounds of discrimination to include indirect discrimination against persons of a particular race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. I welcome these changes. The new provision is made up of several elements as follows: . Where: (a) a person requires another person to comply with a term, condition or requirement is not reasonable having regard to cumstances of the case; and (b) the other person does not or cannot comply' with the term, condition or requirement; (c) the requirement to comply has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the ognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, by persons of the same race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin as the other person, of any human right or mental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any life; the act of requiring such compliance is to treated, for the purposes of this Part, as' an act involving a distinction based on, or an act by reason of, the other person's race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. ' The provision is being inserted to enthen sure that the Racial Discrimination Act extends to indirect discrimination as disthat tinct from direct discrimination. Indirect discrimination is often hard to define describe. The sort of thing it would clude would be a case where an employer decided that he would only employ applicertainly cants over a certain height. The application of the requirement would have the effect of disadvantaging women and persubsection sons of short races as there would be more men than women who complied with this requirement. Indirect discrimination requires that a higher proportion of persons of a different status than the aggrieved person must be able to comply with the requirement or condition than persons of the same status or group as the aggrieved person. The operation of the subsection will involve an examination of whether the imposed term 'condition or requirement' impacts disproportionately on persons of the same race, et cetera. This means that although it will not be necessary to establish that every person in that group need be affected to show a disproportionate impact, guidance in interpretation will still have to be found from existing decisions on similar provisions in Acts such as the Sex Discrimination Act. As the honourable member for Kooyong has already stated, the main case is Australian Iron and Steel v. Banovic where a majority of the High Court of Australia which found that female employees of Austrathe cirlian Iron and Steel were discriminated against indirectly when they were retrenched according to a last on, first off and retrenchment policy. The proposed provision will ensure that it is clear that the recRacial Discrimination Act is broad in its definition of racial discrimination and will cover covert discriminatory practices. This fundais clearly in accordance with the spirit and intention of the Act and is to be other field of public welcomed. Another important amendment is the be rewriting of section 18 .of the Racial Disdone crimination Act to provide that if an act is done for two or more reasons and one of the reasons relates to race, et cetera, the act is to 'be taken to be done for that reason. The section currently states the racist reason has to be the dominant reason for the racist act. This and amendment will be a major improvement inon the operation of the Act and significantly tightens its effect. It may even be wide enough to include unconscious and unexpressed racist behaviour. The third amendment relates to a new 18A which will extend the liability· of a person for acts done by agents or employees of the person in the course of employment. This brings the Act in line with other human rights and antidiscrimination legislation in the labour and employment field where m<?s- complaints arise. Of course, the provlSlon WIll not apply only to employers who take steps to ensure that discriminatory behaviour does not occur in the workplace. In view of the limited time for the debate I will not make the other points that I was going to make in relation to the amendments that are proposed by this Bill. There is one amendment that I do wish to refer to, that is, in relation to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme. Court Act 1933. It is an amendment that I welcome. It relates to the exercise of jurisdiction in relation to legal practitionis ers. Recently I was admitted to the Bar in the Australian Capital Territory. That admission took place on 17 August 1990. We have the ridiculous situation where the admission had to take place before three judges of the Supr-me Court, which saw a waste of judicial resources employed virtually for a whole day for what really is just a technical admission of risters and solicitors to the Supreme Court in the ACT. This amendment will allow the Chief Justice of the ACT Supreme Court to direct that a single judge can preside over admission of barristers and· solicitors in the Supreme Court which frees up the other two judges to deal with the lengthy court delays. It is a minor administrative amendment but it is one to be applauded and one which should be taken on board throughout other jurisdictions in Australia.",61
172,Mr COSTELLO,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"ln my speech I wish to address the substance of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill in so far as it amends the Bankruptcy Act 1966. Bankruptcy, as all members of this House would or should be aware, is a matter which is very much on the mind of the Australian community at the moment. Bankruptcy has been inc.re-sing at an alarming rate. Recent statIstIcs that were released on bankruptcies for the September quarter of 1990 showed that there had been an overall increase of 3- per cent on the number of bankruptCIes as at September 1989. In the State of Victoria the increase in the number of bankruptcies was much worse than anywhere else. Bankruptcies increased 70 per cent during the June 1990 quarter, as opposed to the June 1989 quarter. Some indication as to how recession is biting in the Australian community can be gleaned by comparing the Victorian statistics with those of New South Walesalso a victim of the Hawke Government but not a victim of a State Labor government-where bankruptcy increased only by some 22 per cent. In that context it is very important that we get the economy right so that those who are being forced into bankruptcy have some of the pressures taken off them. It very important that we get the law right. I raise with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) the question of the Australian Law Reform Commission report on insolvency, tabled in the House on 22 December 1988, to which, as I understand, the Government has not yet replied. That deals with the whole question of insolvency. I am not here today to suggest that bar- all of those recommendations be implemented. I suggest to the Attorney-General that in the current climate he have a careful look at the overall law of insolvency. In respect of this Bill we can only deal with it. in a piecemeal fashion. There are some important and good changes to the law of bankruptCy which are brought about by this Bill, in particular, the amendments to section 139D to widen the power of the court to make an order in relation to property not strictly owned but at least enjoyed by the person who is bankrupt. It often proves the case that property is made available for the use and enjoyment of a bankrupt after the date of bankruptcy but before discharge. The amendment will remedy this defect by enabling the court to make orders in respect of property made available for the use and enjoyment of the bankrupt before the end of the bankruptcy-that is, before he or she is discharged. I - elieve that there is a legitimate concern 1ll the community at the mome'11t that people who have been declared bankrupt in many cases seem to live quite well and indeed live much better than their creditors who seem to be defeated. It is a commendable amendment to the Act if that amendment will enable some of the proceeds which might otherwise have been lost to the advantage of the creditors to be brought back into the estate and divided amongst the creditors. There is a real concern in the community that in many cases the creditors suffer without any just recompense. We need to be concerned that creditors are protected as fully as possible. There is also a change in this Bill to make automatic discharge from bankruptcy universal. It has long been a policy that the laws of bankruptcy should enable somebody who has had a catastrophic run to be eventually discharged and make a new start. I believe that the amendment will go some way to assisting in that process as long as the powers of the relevant authorities are exercised against those who are perennial bankrupts. There are some who make a whole career of being bankrupt. I would like to see that the powers that are available are still exercised in those situations so that those who are perennial bankrupts and do it almost habitually do not have automatic and easy discharge. On the whole these are welcome amendments. I particularly mention the amendment relating to the interaction between creditors' petitions and debtors' petitions. They are improvements. I urge the Attorney-General to look at the question generally and look particularly at the question of what is creating bankruptcy in the first place. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The time allotted for the second reading of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",63
173,Mr DUFFY,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Before moving the amendment which has been circulated in my nameand of which the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong  ago-I present the explanatory memorandum to the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 which replaces the explanatory memorandum presented on 20 September. The reason for that is that the memorandum presented on 20 September referred to the Bill as a 1989 Bill and not 1990. I move: Clause 2, page 2, lines 5 to 7, subclause 2(4), omit the subclause. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum in relation to that amendment. The amendment relates to the commencement provisions of the Bill which were drafted in the expectation that the Act would not have commenced and, accordingly, subclause 2(4) of the Bill provides that each of clauses 41 to 48 inclusive commences immediately after the commencement of the section of the Circuit Layouts Act 1989 that it amends. It now appears that the Act will have commenced by the time the Bill is to have effect and this provision is no longer necessary, and therefore this amendment became necessary. I have not had an opportunity, because of time in respect of the second reading, to comment on any of the matters raised by the speakers in the debate, and I will do that at this stage. Firstly, we note what has been said by the Opposition in relation to the guillotining of this Bill. I think that the contributions, albeit short, by the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), and the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who is on our side of the House, have been constructive, and I thank them for those contributions. The honourable member for Banks dealt with most of the matters raised by the honourable member for Kooyong, except that I think it should be mentioned that it is the intention to make the employer . and the agent liable so that both can be called to conferences, et cetera, and the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act, which are identical, work very well. Vicarious liability does not necessarily mean sole liability, as was implied by the honourable member for Kooyong. In tort, for instance, it means joint liability and allows the plaintiff to sue the principal or the agent. I think those were the main matters raised by the honourable member for Kooyong in his comments on joint versus vicarious liability in the issue of race discrimination. If not, I will take those matters up with him later. The other matter, which was raised by the honourable member for Higgins, related to the question of multiple bankruptcies, and I just want to touch on that matter. Under the law as it stands at present a person who becomes a bankrupt while undischarged from an earlier bankruptcy is not eligible for automatic discharge but must apply to the court. However, persons who become bankrupt on more than one occasion are entitled to automatic discharge provided the bankruptcies do not coincide in time. Many multiple bankruptcies-",64
174,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Order! As the time allotted for the committee stage of the Bill has expired, the question is that the amendment be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment; report adopted. Third Reading",65
175,Mr DUFFY,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a third time. I seek your indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker, to continue my remarks in relation to the matters raised by the honour Mr Rocher-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Normally, in the spirit of cooperation, the House would readily agree to this, but the Government, not the Opposition, has put the guillotine on. It has denied the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Higgins the opportunity to make a full contribution to the debate. It has prevented the honourable member for Dundas from making any contribution to the debate, although I know he wanted to. The Minister now seeks your indulgence; I suggest that it is not appropriate. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-The Attorney-General is speaking to the motion that the Bill be now read a third time, and he has until 6.20 p.m. to do that.",65
176,Mr DUFFY,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I note the point made by the honourable member for Curtin. In many cases multiple bankruptcies involve pensioners and disadvantaged persons who do not have the resources to apply to the court for a discharge order. Consequently, there is evidence that a large number of active bankrupt estates exist which cannot be finalised. Of course, that causes administrative difficulties for the official trustee and is wasteful of resources. Moreover, the status of a large group of persons is uncertain because of the way the legislation has been amended over time and the complex application' and transitional arrangements relating to those amendments. It is an undesirable situation because of the' effect of bankruptcy on property and, in particular, on real property. This problem should now be remedied. It is proposed to amend the Act to provide that all bankrupts be entitled to automatic discharge at the expiry of three years from the date of bankruptcy unless a valid objection to discharge has been entered and that all persons who are undischarged from previous bankruptcies where the date of commencement occurred more than three years before the COlnmencement of the proposed new provisions be discharged by operation of law from the date of commencement of the amendments. That was the matter raised by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), which, I think as a result of a dis"" cuss ion earlier today, was not a matter which concerned him as much as it did at the tirrie we came in here this afternoon. 'Even though there was a guillotine and a very short time available, he did raise the matter as a matter of some concern, and I thought that it was probably advisable to clarify that - atter at this stage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA BILL (No.3) 1990 [COGNATE BILLS: NA NA BILL (No.4) 1990] Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 October, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time. Madam . DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs have Sullivan)-I understand it is the wish the House to debate the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) concurrently the. Debits Tax Termination Bill and the Taxation Laws Amendmel1.t Bill (No.4). There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",65
177,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Madam where Deputy Speaker, I did intend to comment on the Bills in the order in which they are listed on the Notice Paper, but I am afraid time might prevent me from get the ting through all the material which I wish to canvass. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1990 tackles a number of consequential matters. The coalition generally welcomes measures affecting gold mining and quarrying expenditure. The same sponse is accorded. alterations to zone bates and the additions to the list of tax deductible gifts. While we disagree with the impost itself, we will not oppose amendment to clarify the date on which the first instalment of annual company tax is to be paid. The Bill will also a minor technical amendment to subsecthird tion 36AAA (24) to allow an election for vostro accounts. a year of income to be made when contaminated li-estock is disposed of rather than when destroyed-and it has our supof port. A couple of other minor and seemingly unobjectionable amendments are inaccounts cluded. However, provisions affecting minimum equity companies and the sobe called thin capitalisation rules are worthy of special mention. The first point to note about them is that there is some retrossible, pectivity involved. However, as it presumably confer a benefit, we raise no objection in accordance with our long standing policy on the coalition benches. However, we deplore the fact that, once again, the intention to legislate was the 1990 subject of an announcement by press release, issued as long ago as 30 March 1989. Nineteen months have elapsed between the announced intention and the presentation of a Bill to the Parliament. It is just a further example of this Government's inability to get the job done expeditiously, no matter how long it might taken to take some action in the first of place. What is more, some of the provisions in the Bill are in conflict with what with was said in the press release. Generally, the amendments to these capitalisation rules will disallow as a deduction the amounts of interest paid by some on debts to related offshore entities the ratio of foreign debt to foreign equity exceeds 3: 1. However, the corresponding ratio for financial institutions is 6: 1. Exempted will be certain balances in clearing accounts of some financial institutions. These balances reside in what are called 'nostro' and 'vostro' accounts. Apparently, it is normal banking practice . for Australian financial institutions to maintain foreign currency accounts with related foreign banks in vostro accounts. reWhile there seems to be no need to disrecuss the types of transactions facilitated by nostro accounts, it is relevant to note that they are usually in surplus-1:lut the sometimes human error on the part of an operator puts them briefly in the red. An overdraft advance by the offshore entity make is then needed to ensure payment to a party. The reverse is the case for Australian dollar accounts held by foreign banks are vostro accounts in the eyes the Australian counterparts. A point of contention arises whereby, under current practice, interest is not paid on vostro in credit. The Bill rather preSumptuously anticipates that will always the case, despite advice to the Government to the contrary. Not surprisingly, being unable to grasp that progress is posan opportunity has not been taken will to accommodate such an eventuality. Also the period of 10 days allowed to clear n-stro and vostro transactions is far too restrictive. A surplus could and apparently does occur when a third party fails to claim prompt payment. Such occurrences will create problems under this legislation which could easily have been forestalled. Some bankers and financial institutions have difficulty with Bill provisions to amend section 128F. It seems that interest on certain widely held debentures is presently exempted from withholding tax by this section. An effect of the Bill's proposed changes will be an inequitable outcome in the calculation establishing the foreign equity component in the calculation of the ratio of foreign debt to foreign equity. Short term credit amounts, partly owned foreign banks and an averaging formula for foreign debt are alSo dealt with to a varying extent in the Bill. The Opposition will not oppose the Bill, although we have and will make constructive criticisms. One is that, even as we discuss these proposals to change thin capitalisation legislation enacted in 1987, more amendments are in the pipeline. We will probably be talking about amendments to these amendments before us today within 12 months. Three years experience with a particular tax would seem to be enough to put the legislation right and remove any anomalies. Sadly though, that is not the case. These amendments will not mollify our cO.ncerns about the c0p-tplexity, uncertamty and the far reachmg effects of the original legislation that, back in 1987, was regarded by many as the most difficult to understand inserted into the Income Tax Assessment Act during the then past five years. Since 1987, of course, there has been an abundance of complex, uncertain and far reaching tax law. All have taken tax law far beyond what is or was necessary to achieve the stated or apparent purposes of the Government. Nor should It be forgotten that this and other tax l-gislati0.n is only needed because of tively high rates of Australian income taxe- in general and corporate taxes in particular. The purpose of the Debits Tax Termination Bill 1990 is to facilitate future collection of bank account debits taxesaptly known as the BAD tax-by State and Territory governments. It is claimed that the transfer of this tax from the Commonwealth will confer on State and Territory governments an opportunity to rationalise taxation of financial services, as well as giving those governments an additional revenue source. Financial assistance given by· the Commonwealth to the States and Territories will be reduced accordingly to neutralise the loss of revenue by a matching reduction in spending. It is understood that the Commissioner of Taxation will continue. to collect the tax, for the .time being at least, and disburse it to the States and Territories. Although not said, the Commissioner will probably charge for the service to be provided by the Australian Taxation Office. By some queer twist of logic, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) claimed iIi his second reading speech that this proposal follows, as a matter of inevitable consequence, a speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) givenon 19 July 1990 which was rather pretentiously titled 'Towards a Closer Partnership'this, from the Prime Minister. That the speech was a belated attempt to recover lost ground after the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) took the initiative and called for more and closer cooperation with the States is probably neither here nor there. However, to pretend that the measure was the result of some grand plan announced on 19 July is blatant deceit. The truth is that the decision to transfer the bank account debits tax to the States and Territories was stitched up at the Premiers Conference a couple of months earlier. So much for a grand new world, as the Prime Minister would have had us believe on 19 July! It is just one further example of how this Government tries to attract fawping publicity from a largely misguided media by dressing up earlier reladecisions as wonderful hew initiatives. All th-t said, quest-6ns arise about whether the tax should be the prerogative of ariy government. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), when 'it, suits his purpose, reminds us of the advantages' attaching t6 his deregulation of the financial system. If we are to believe him, the wonderful economic progress he says Australia has enjoyed since deregulation of the financial system in the mid 1980s is all too awful to contemplate. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, he maintains the untenable position that, even when forced occasionally to admit' that the economic picture is not as rosy as he would normally paint it, his vision for Australia is somehow right. His defence of the current taxation system is part of the hoax. His having dictated the introduction of more new taxing measures than any Treasurer in our history, it might have been expected that the bank accounts debits tax deserved to be scrapped. Not so. ' As an impost that has the potential to become as unpopular and notorious as'the nefarious payroll tax, the escape plan is to do as was d,?ne with it and give it ,to the States. Then, picture it as potentially an additional source of revenue. That is the plot. Even better and as an afterthought, claim it as. hard 'evidence of a commitment to a new era of Commonwealth-State relations .. Never mind the adoption of major new taxes such as capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, the Mtldicare tax, superannuation fund taxes and the earlier collection of other taxes such as provisional taxes, prescribed payment taxes and company taxes. With total tax revenues up by 136 per cent over eight years, with measures such as those mentioned and the ramshackle wholesale sales tax base widened enormously, a golden opportunity to get rid of this BAD tax was there for the taking. The fact is that it should be abolished.",66
178,Unknown,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to' 8 p.m.,68
179,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The BAD. tax distorts the financial system and is a form of ulation. The addition of it' to tpe battery of taxes already levied by the States hardly wise on other grounds. Already the States impose bank charges of one kind or another, as well as land tax and stamp duty which have a heavy bearing on mercial decisions and decision taking. One production. of those State-based bank charges already in place is a financial institutions duty (FID), or similar. With both BAD and FID taxes, the States and Territories will have the equivalents o(both a tax on turnover and a tax on net incomes.' A distinguishing feature of these taxes is that they are payable by virtually all and sundry, not just by businesses. Any imposts more calculated to distort the financial system are hard to imagine. For the time being, FID and BAD taxes might be thought to raise comparatively minor amounts when compared with other taxes. Even so, last year. the Hawke Government collected $378m from the BAD tax. One could easily reckon that was matched by the FID in the States and Territories. It may ,even go far beyond that figure for the BAD. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1990 will amend the principal Act and relevant regulations to exempt from sales tax certain items of computer equipment. To qualify for exemption, each item will need to satisfy the Bill's definition of 'eligible computer equipment', or the equipment which falls within the ordinary meaning of the term 'item of computer equipment'. Fifty per cent or more of the· use of a qualifying item must fall within four broad categories. These will be for use in the engineering or technical design of goods for manufacture; production related activities such as to scheduling Of production, the purchasing of materials, the storage, handling and dispatch of certain finished goods; the finalising of text or artwork to be printed; and - combination of the above together with use as aids to manufacture. ' Aids to manufacture are defined to comprise the use of computers in engiregneering design; the use of computers in production scheduling, sequencing, moniis toring, controlling and costing of the processes of manufacture; and the use of computer equipment in printing, including finalisation of text for typewriting, artcomwork, advertisements, subediting and Broadly, four groups of manufacturers will be eligible to claim exemptions. Practitioners in certain activities who will not benefit include those involved with audio visual production; architectural-structural design; and the work of secretaries and certain authors. Interestingly and broadly speaking, marketing, sales and management accounting activities will not qualify as production related activities. It may also be useful to note that currently, computer hardware used directly and principally in manufacturing activities covered by the aids to manufacture provision generally qualifies for sales tax exemption. However, certain activities relating to manufacturing have not been recognised in these provisions, in part because the activities represent hew marlUfacturing technologies. These changes are generally welcome, because they offer some relief from a ramshackle and piecemeal sales tax regime, which has befm expanded during the terms. of this Government, to an extent that wholesale sales taxes have increased in total by more than 200 per cent to $1O,668m. . On the other hand, these measures go no way at all towards satisfying the Government's undertaking to simplify the wholesale. sales tax system. U narguably, we are being taken in the other direction t<;>wards even greater complexity, confuSlOn and costs of compliance. This Bill only gives further weight to the coalition's contention that a broad based consumption tax is needed to replace the present dog's breakfast that is the wholesale sales tax mess. It is relief on taxes on all business inputs such as is b-ing - iven - o a very short li-t of specialised Items m the Bill which is an essential feature of our goods and services tax (GST). That is only one reason that our GST is superior to either wholesale sales taxes or other types of broad-based consumpti<;>n taxes which are, in reality, gene.raitsed retail sales taxes on goods serVIces. .",68
180,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"1 enter the debate to-ight in support of the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1990 and the Debits Tax Termination Bill 1990, which are being debated cognately. I go firstly to the issue of the Debits Tax Termination Bill 1990. As stated by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr R?cher) in his contribution tonight, this BIll proposes to expand upon the closer working relationship that has developed between the States and the Commonwealth going towards a closer partnership as is being proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). What we are seeing is the transfer of the tax base to the States which in fact has the potential to rationalise the taxation of financial services and to provide the States with an additional revenue source. It is important that one recognises, as has been pointed out, the fact that these sorts of taxes are in compliance with the banks' system. It does lead to some problems, but notwithstanding that, the role of collecting the tax is going to reside.in the longer term with the States themselves. In the initial period the Commissioner of Taxation will collect the debit tax on behalf. of the States and Territories, and to that extent the role the-Commonwealth will play is simply limited to that of tax collector. The spending of the money gained will now be the prerogative of the States themselves which in itself introduces a new era of fiscal responsibility to the States. It is transferring the responsibility for collection and spending by the Commonwealth, which simply hands over a certain proportion of funds on a regular basis to the States themselves. I also take the point raised by the honourable member for Curtin regarding the number of charges levied by Australian financial institutions along the way these days. There is a myriad of charges and levies imposed for the holding of current accounts or the holding of savings accounts and term deposits, et cetera and it is no wonder that average consu'mers only are frightened and in fact completely and overwhelmed by the variety and mix of these charges which have been introduced and which apply on the types of accounts they would like to - eep .. It is also no wonc;ler, therefore, that this sort of issue will be examined as part of the banking inquiry this Parliament is to undertake shortly. I look forward to reporting back next year, including to the honourable member for Curtin-as I am sure will all members participating on that Committee, including my friend the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), who is sitting on the other side-with some degree of knowledge as to the composition of these taxes and charges levied by the banks, including what it actually means to the consumers of this country. The other piece of legislation I wish to comment upon is one I see as being of paramount importance for Australia at present as we continue to strive to become the clever country. Coming as I do from an industrial centre in Australia, the great Illawarra region, I am exposed time and time again to manufacturers and the concerns they have about the need to modernise, to put in place the most modern equipment, to use the latest techniques, so that they can develop a competitive edge. As we develop in a technological society, the way to develop that technological edge is to use computers. I have witnessed this from the largest of industries such as the steel dustry with Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, where the production facilities are now completely computerised-and '. unfortunately I would have to say at the great cost of employment opportunities in an area such as the Illawarra-right down to smaller manufacturers and indeed to printers. These days some of the larger printing firms have computer operations that simply mean that visually and graphically they can develop the style of printing, et cetera, to meet customer satisfaction. They ensure that it is done by observing it on the screen, and then by the simple press of a button it is lated into print. Those are the sorts of things that are going to be quite important as we strive to become more competitive and enter the technological race. I would say that the Government's decision to provide exemptions, therefore, under the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) for the purchase of certain computer equipment is long overdue and one which I am sure all members of this place would support. I go to the fact that to qualify for an exemption, however, the computer equipment being purchased-and, I hope, produced in this country rather than imported into it-it is necessary to satisfy the definition of 'eligible computer equipment' which is given in the Bill. That exemption will apply to mainframe computers, mini or personal computers and equipment associated with their operation"" such as terminals, keyboards, printers, plotters,disc drives, storage devices and other similar equipment, and also, I am pleased to say, to modems. It is therefore important for honourable members to recognise that the sorts of equipment which are listed within the legislation and the explanatory memorandum just about cover the basic changes and the technological advances that are presently being made in the area of computers. As I have said, I think the fact that it has widespread application is extremely important to every size of manufacturing process in this country. I mentioned in passing that the fact that Australian producers of computer equipment are right up there with the best in- in the world is something which should not be overlooked. I would certainly hope that this sort of legislation gives an impetus to Australian producers and that we will not simply continue to import computer equipment from, perhaps, our Asian neighbours. That will also give a fillip to the computer industry, to the technology that is necessary and, of course, it will meet the needs of a changing society. All the legislation dealing with the sales tax area is important. The Debits Tax Termination Bill equally is of significance, as too is the third Bill in the group which is being considered, the Taxation transLaws Amendment Bill (No.4), but time unfortunately does not permit me t<;> dwell on that. I simply conclude by commending all the legislation to the House this evening.",69
181,Mr WILSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"1 want to take part in the debate on the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3), the Debits Tax Termination Bill, and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) and would have liked to bave canvassed a number of issues but time does not permit me to do that this evening. I want to focus attention firstly on the amendments related to that aspect of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) which deals with thin capitalisation. This Bill proposes five modifications to the existing thin capitalisation rules to assist in the understanding of those rules and to help in certain areas where the complexity of this legislation created some difficulties. There is a modification to exempt from the thin capitalisation controls certain balances in financial institution clearing accounts. There is a modification to exclude from the measurement of foreign equity certain debentures that are otherwise eligible for a withholding tax exemption. There are changes in relation to short term trade credit arising from the export of goods arid services and there is a modification relating to a foreign-owned resident holding company which partly owns a resident bank. Finally, alternative measures are applicable if a company, for a very short period, has an excess of foreign debt. These proposals are said to try to remove some of the difficulties that have arisen as a consequence of the very complex legislation that was passed not so long ago. I express concern as to whether creating these special exemptions will also create the circumstances where there will be greater opportunities for abuse. This legislation is far too complex. It was introduced because there is a differential tax on interest on foreign investments in Australia, taxed under double tax agreements and otherwise at the rate of 10 per cent, as compared with the corporate rate of tax on what is, in effect, the return on equity investments of 39 per cent if it goes through a corporation as franked - ividends, or 15 or 30 per cent, dependmg on whether it is a treaty or non-treaty country, if it goes out of a company as unfranked dividends. It is obvious that where there are differers en-ial rates of tax on the profit of enterpr-s-, people will adjust their affairs to mInimise their tax burden. I quote, because I agree with it, the famous statement of Lord Clyde, Lord President of the Court of Session. It reads: No man in this country is under the smallest obligation, moral or other, so to arrange his· legal relations to his business or his property as to enable the Inland Revenue to put the largest possible shovel into his stores. The Inland Revenue is not slow-and quite rightly-to take every advantage which is open to it under the taxing statutes for the purpose of depleting the taxpayer's pocket. And the taxpayer is, in like manner, entitled to be astute to prevent, so far as he honestly can, the depletion of his means by the Inland Revenue. It is quite clear-and the courts in this country have made it clear-that the efforts of taxpayers to legitimately order their affairs so as to minimise their tax burdens is quite a proper course of action. Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) himself on 21 August 1988 said: There is all the world of difference betwecn tax minimisation through artificial devices to rcdefine income and the minimisation of tax liabilities through legitimate and proper compliance with the tax law. The thin capitalisation rules recognise that it is legitimate to have some of your business profits taxed at the enterprise or corporate rate and some taxed at the interest withholding tax rate. It is quite legitimate, therefore, to rearrange your affairs. The thin capitalisation rules are there, allegedly, to stop abuse of the system, but I question whether the gearing ratio that is implicit in the thin capitalisation legislation is fair to Australian enterprises. I still believe that foreign investors, taking advantage within the cap set by the thin capitalisation rules, are placed in a tax . favourable position as compared with Australian investors. I think that is unfair and unfortunate and I believe that there needs to be, as the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) says, a modernisation within Australia, and that must include a modernisation of our tax law. Instead of that, we are using complex, old-fashioned techniques to try to hedge . around various adjustments that taxpayhave properly made under the law that exists at the time in order to prevent what are thought to be abuses of the system. I am of the view that in the thincapitalisation area abuses are still going on. Yet we come in here tonight to legislate, to overcome some of the difficulties as they affect certain types of business entrepreneurs. I have no problem in overcoming their difficulties, but we would better overcome their difficulties if we stood back and took a totally fresh look at this whole area of the taxation of the income of foreign investors in Australia, whether that income is derived in an interest form, a dividend form, or a business enterprise profit form. It can only be fair if we stand back and put those foreign investors under a tax regime similar to that which is applicable to the regime that operates in respect bf Australian enterprises where Australian investbrs put their money into co'rporations and receive some of the return by means of dividend and some of it by means of interest.",70

NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 October, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time. Dr HARRY EDWARDS C6erowra) (S.21)-The fundamental view of the Opposition is that the debits tax ought to be abolished altogether. The same applies to the wholesale sales tax (WST) which we have been discussing. It should be abolished and replaced by a broad-based goods and services tax. It should be abolished because it is levied on a very narrow range of goods at widely variable rates. It is anomalous, often uncertain in its application, distorting, and economically inefficient. . The main point against the WST is that a large part of the sales tax is a tax on business inputs, a tax on goods used in production, so it adds to the cost of production. Such taxes on inputs raise costs, which is especially adverse for firms, for example, competing with imported products or trying to sell at export. Forty-nine per cent of the wholesale sales tax is on business inputs. Taxes on inputs represent aboutSIj2 per cent of the cost of furnishings; S per cent of transport equipment, including vehicles; 7 112 per cent of a house, and so on. We want to get rid of that. No sales tax on business inputs is the name of the game, and that is what would be achieved by a broad-based goods and services tax. What we have now is a complex, archaic sales tax pattern which has long lost touch with reality through all the variety of interpretations over the years. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3), before the House earlier in the cognate debate, attempted to straighten out, by a very complex arrangement, the application of the sales tax to computers used in business. What we had in that earlier Bill was a large number of clauses, 13 or 14 pages of them, and 50 pages of explanatory memorandum, all just to clear up the obvious inconsistency and the anomalous situation that is prevailing. The Government goes down this tortuous path because it is into a process of 1990 simplification-perhaps rationalisation would be a better word-of the very archaic, anomalous and distorting WST. What really is required is a root· and branch reform. There is only one way to do that, and that is to abolish not only the debits tax but the sales tax and replace it with a broad-based goods and services tax, as the Opposition proposes. That is the only path to total reform. The Government has locked itself into complex Bills like this one precisely because it has dug in against the goods and services tax and therefore is committed to a long and complex process of trying to make the sales tax dog's breakfast more acceptable, which is an obstinate and crazy stance. The fact that the goods and services tax does away with taxes on inputs is of great benefit for business-",72

186,Mr WILSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"1 take this opportunity to make a few more remarks in relation to the thin capitalisation amendments. A company that is working up to the limits of the thin capitalisation rules pays tax on its interest income der the withholding tax arrangements. there is an opportunity for the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) to swer, I would like to know whether, in the calculation of that withholding tax is paid on the gross interest or merely on the nominal rate of interest. It is well known that in many instances the interest rate is denoted in nominal terms but the borrower is required, in addition to the intere-t charged in nominal terms, to pay the withholding tax that would otherwise be payable by the lender of the money. would seem to me that that netting down of the - ominal interest rate is operating to the disadvantage of the Australian enue if the Australian Taxation Office not collecting the return on the gross come. I said earlier that I thought that there was need for major and radical reform the tax - re-. I repeat what I have previously said III this House. It is my view that our approach should be, firstly, that there should be a uniform system of taxtage ing companies, trusts and partnerships; secondly, that Australian residents should be taxed on income from all sources, both within Australia and around the world; thirdly, that non-residents, including the thin capitalisation companies, should be taxed on income which is sourced in Australia; fourthly, that all income, from whatever activity it is derived, be subject to the same rate of tax, whether it is the income of residents or foreigners; fifthly, that the ultimate aim should be for a flat rate of tax which is payable by all natural persons, whether resident in Australia OJ; not; and sixthly, that any variations, whether in accordance with activity or the resident status of the taxpayer from a stepped or flat rate structure, should be provided by explicit, purpose based tax Any benefits that are received by a foreign investor on paying lower rates of tax on interest should be shown as a tax expenditure as compared against the benchmark tax that is payable by Australian residents on the same income. Such an approach would reduce minimisation, inuncluding that sort of minimisation which If takes on the character of avoidance now engaged in by those who, according to their interests, interpose companies, trusts anand partnerships, whether onshore or offshore. It would also apply where compatax, nies take advantage of the thin capitalisation limits by taking their gearingratio up to the limit in circumstances that they can afford because they do it through subsidiaries within Australia. Because the Australian investor competing in the marketplace is not able to gear as highly, he is at a very substantial disadIt vantage. He is paying 39c in the dollar whereas the foreign competitor, with his investments in Australia and sourcing his revproduction in Australia, is paying only is lOc in the dollar. However, it may only inbe 10c on the nominal net interest and not on the gross interest, bearing in mind that on top of the nominal interest he has into pay the withholding tax. I think we have to recognise that those who are able to take advantage of the thin capitalisation rules are getting an advanwhich not every Australian taxpayer should get. Minimisation is fine if in reality those schemes are available to all.",73

189,Mr CHANEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"1t seems very difficult· to credit it now, but I can remember ·getting up in this place last week and complaining about what a pathetic place the House of Representatives was-to put it in a nutshell-because the Minister at the table then was unable to give me what I regarded as a sensible response to an Opposition suggestion for an amendment to the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill. We took a bit of the time of the House of Representatives trying to convince the Government that its attack on the rights of aged Australians was irrational and should be varied. That was quite unsuccessful. I realised that I was wasting my breath getting upset about abuses of the House of Representatives when I came in here tonight and found that the Government, which started this session on the basis that it wished to restore some dignity to the proceedings of this place and restore the reputation of the Parliament, had given us 40 minutes for all stages of the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill. I have been in the position of the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), of wanting to get a government's program through and in the other place I have seen minor legislation about which there was nothing contentious slip through the Senate in a matter of minutes. Most of the House of Representatives people I have met actually call the Senate the second eleven. I do raise with you very seriously indeed, Mr Speaker, the situation where the House of Representatives is considering this Bill and has allowed 40 minutes, yet it is a Bill that amends the legislation governing the Australian Heritage Commission, which is in itself a matter of great contention in the Australian community in 1990. That statement is not a matter of par1990 tisan bias. That statement reflects concerns that have been expressed by members of the present Government. I suppose that the most extreme expression of that was by Senator Cook, who just after the last election wrote to the Chairman of the Commission in terms that were highly critical. Some people attacked Senator Cook on the basis that this was just a disappointed Minister expressing his views as he moved on, but Senator Cook said this: I have become disturbed about the commission's role in our assessment of the National Estate issues . . . Substantial questions have been raised about the commission's competence and professionalism. There is a growing and very disquieting perception in government, industry and scientific circles and in all the states that the commission is behaving suspiciously like a mere client group of some sections of the conservation movement, and that its advice lacks the scientific objectivity and professional honesty that good public policy requires. There is a widespread concern that the commission has simply become an advocate in the public debate over conservation and the National Estate that its advice is tainted by that bias. I could go on, but I am told that I should speak for only 15 minutes. I find that also an affront on a matter that has been so contentious. That alone prevents me from reading more of the comments of Senator Cook. I put those comments before you, Mr Speaker, because I think they indicate that this is a serious matter on which there are strong views, not comin.g - rom a partisan Opposition but from wlt-m the. G<;lVernment itself, that there IS. a . sIg-llfi-ant problem with respect to thIS mstItutlOn. Therefore, I think - hese amendments, which we believe are madequate, warrant decent, proper and tim.ely consid-ration by this Parliament, WhICh the- will not get in the House of RepresentatIves. I address those remarks to you, Mr Speaker, not to draw you into the debate, because in our brief exchange of last week you made it clear that would be improper, and I totally agree with that-",74
190,Mr SPEAKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,I certainly would.,75
191,Mr CHANEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"But, as someone who is charged with the duty of being the Speaker of this House, I have no doubt that you have some concern about the procedures that have been laid down for dealing with 35 Bills today and for dealing with this Bill in the space of 40 minutes.",75
192,Mr SPEAKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"As the honourable member for Pearce did draw me into the debate, he is as aware, as I am, that the House made the decision today on these time limits, not me. I am bound by the decision the House has made.",75
193,Mr CHANEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Quite, Mr Speaker. That complaint of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is, of course, but part of a pattern of concern which again comes not from a partisan Opposition trying to score points but from Ministers in the Government. For example, we find that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) has talked about his concerns over the problems of making land use decisions and resource access decisions. He talks in terms of there needing to be substantial change, including even constitutional amendment. More recently, we have had reports that Senator Button is proposing that there should be some form of legislative initiative by the Commonwealth that would enable these resources issues to be determined in a way that might be more satisfactory than past determinations. The relevance of these opening comments to this debate is that there is, rightly or wrongly, a widespread disquiet about the role of the Heritage Commission and about the extent to which it has contributed to difficulties. I would like to make one thing quite clear. I do not support those people who are great critics of the Heritage Commission and its role. I think the truth is that Senator Cook, Senator Button and Minister Griffiths are making criticisms of the Commission because they are not game to make criticisms of the people who should be blamed. It is the Government itself that should be blamed. The Heritage Commission, according to its strict legal charter, does not make land use decisions. Those decisions are made by government. The sad fact of the matter is that the massive disquiet about the role of the Heritage Commission is a function of the Hawke Government's behaviour in these matters rather than the behaviour of the Heritage Commission, which I think has simply been drawn into a process that has been sadly abused. I will not go into chapter and verse and I will not repeat all of the criticisms I have already made in the past in various public forums. I simply say, very briefly, that the opportunistic and shamefully narrow decision making of this Government-narrow because it was directed only to the direct political advantage of the Australian Labor Party prior to the election-is the basic cause of the public disquiet. The fact of the matter is that if one looks at the deCision making with respect to forests and uranium, one sees a common pattern of decision making not by the Heritage Commission, of course, but by this Government and its Ministers that has ignored the broader public interest. We are now in a stage of review where the Government is changing its ways; we hope it is certainly changing its rhetoric. If the words of the Government at the time of the Premiers Conference are to be taken at face value, if the materials prepared by the Government for that conference are to be taken at face value-indeed, if the utterances of the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, are to be taken at face value-then we can assume that the Government is trying to get a more rational decision making procbeen ess in place. As part of that rational decision making process, the Opposition believes it is tirely appropriate that there should Australian Heritage Commission, that there should be a Register of the National Estate and that the values which are represented by that Register should be carefully taken into account in the course of that decision making process. Mr Speaker, we have not come to the criticisms that we have to make about this Bill on the basis of some sudden view about these matters. If one looks at the policy which was issued by the Opposition on 18 December 1988, one finds reflected there the views which I put on behalf of the Opposition in this debate and the basis of the amendments that I propose to move. I take this opportunity to now move an amendment to the second reading motion, which I hope has been circulated. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Australian Heritage Commission should: (a) be restructured so as to provide some direct representation on it from those States with their own Heritage legislation in place, and for private sector representatives; (b) develop mechanisms to allow it to consider and evaluate the economic impact of it,S decisions to enter places on the Register or Interim List of the National Estate; and (c) take steps, as a matter of urgency, to clear the backlog of outstanding nominations for the Register'. Unfortunately, given the guillotine, I will not have an opportunity to move the detailed amendments which I would have moved in committee and which will no doubt be pursued by the Opposition in the Senate. However, I understand that it is now accepted, or has in the past been accepted, in this place, for the purpose of completeness of the record and to indicate that the Opposition is following' a consistent line, that I may seek to incorporate in Hansard the amendments which I would have moved in the committee stages and which have, I understand, also circulated in this place. They are six in number and they pick up matters which I shall be addressing during the course of enthe second reading speech. I seek leave to be an incorporate them in Hansard. Leave granted. The amendments read as follows(I) Clause 3, page 2, line II, omit '(other than Australian Airlines Limited)'. (2) Clause 8, page 5, proposed subparagraph 23 (2a) (B) (II), lines 23 and 24, omit 'extended that period-within that period as so extended;', substitute 'extended that period to a maximum of 18 monthswithin that extended period;'. (3) Clause 8, page 6, lines 12 and 13,. omit 'extended that period-within that period as so extended.', substitute 'extended that period to a maximum of 18 monthswithin that extended period.'. (4) Clause 8, page 6, paragraph (h), at the end of the paragraph add 'and substituting the following subsection: (5) Any owner or owners (or the nominee of any owner or owners nominated in writing), of a place which is entered or is proposed for entry in the Register, shall have unqualified right to inspect, at no charge, all papers or documents held by the Commission relevant to the nomination, assessment, evaluation and decision that the place should be entered or proposed for entry in the Register.'. (5) Clause 9, page 6, line 37, omit '8 days', substitute '28 days'. (6) Clause 13, page 10, at the end of the clause add the following paragraph: ';(c) by adding at the end the following subsection: '(5) No action in respect of a place entered or proposed for entry in the Register may be taken by the Commonwealth, its Ministers or Authorities other than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.'. I thank the House of Representatives. What we said in our 1988 policy document demonstrates the concerns that I have raised and which were addressed so pungently by Senator Cook-although, as I have said, rather inaccurately by Senator Cook, who I suppose did not feel like addressing those pungent criticisms to his colleague Senator Richardson. What we said was that the Commission will be restructured so as to provide some direct representation on it from those States with their own heritage legislation .in place for private sector representatives. Obviously we wish to do that because in our experience we had found that the Heritage Commission and the Re-iste.r of the National Estate had begun to Impmge on land use decisions in a way which is outside the strict requirements of the statute and for that reason we sought and we do 'seek to involve the States directly in the Commission. I would in this speech like to acknowledge that in one sense the Government is going down a path which might be regarded as parallel with that, and I welcome the fact that the Commission is doing some work in concert with the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia. I understand from the Minister-and I do not think I trespass on her discussion with me-that the same sort of direct dealing is being encouraged in at least one other State. I believe that that is an appropriate acknowledgment of the fact that whatever the strict terms of the statute, it has become enmeshed in the land use planning decisions and problems about making of decisions, and therefore collaboration between the Commonwealth and the agency and the States is essential because as indeed this Government itself is acknowledging in the documents to which I have referred-the documents prepared for the Premiers Conference-the States have the primary role with respect to land use planning decisions. I should have hoped - hat this sugg-stion by the Opposition, Incorporated In the second reading amendment, would receive support from the Government. We also said in this document that administration of the National Estate grants program will be transferred to the Commission. I acknowledge that in this respect, the Government in this Bill is picking up the policy w'hich was ad'vocated by the Opposition in December 1988. We then made a series of other recommendations, which basically reflect the amendments which I have had incorporated into Hansard and we did put forward t-e general proposition that the Austrahan Heritage Commission Act should be amended to provide that the and Commission, in making its assessment of the value of the proposed property or site for entry onto the Register, should be required to take into account the economic impact on that property or site of such proposed listing, and a mechanism will be put in place to provide such economic evaluation. The Government to this point has rejected that proposed addition, and I suspect that it would, if we were able to get to a vote on it tonight, reject it again. But I do think that if the Government is not prepared to face up to the reality, that as things are operating at present, the Commission is enmeshed in the process of making these difficult decisions about land use. If the Government is not prepared to face up to that reality and make the sort of change which the Opposition is suggesting, which would add an economic element to the consideration of listing, then the Government should look very hard at what is the only honest or proper alternative, which is in some way to recast the role of the Commission and recast the public image of what it means to be on the Register of the National Estate, so that it is quite clear that the legal position is the position which is intended by the Government and intended by the Commission. It may well be that the appointment of a distinguished Australian, Mr Fitzgerald, QC, as the new chairman will provide an opportunity for some recasting of the public understanding of the role of the Commission. I commend that to the Minister for consideration. We have already seen, because of the appointment of a very high profile new chairman of the Commission, a deal of media interest in his views. I, like I am sure many other people, read with interest the interview with Mr Fitzgerald, which was reported in the Australian last weekend. I was very pleased to see that report appear. The statements by Mr Fitzgerald did not reflect, however, a real comprehension of the reason why the Heritage Commission is seen to be a difficulty by so many people and why its role in providing for listing on the Register is so widely misunderstood. I would ask the Minister to consider taking up with the chairman-as I certainly will do when I have an opportunity to talk with him-what can be done by the Commission itself to reduce the confusion which is not doing the debate any good and is certainly not doing the Commission any good. I do not wish to take up any further time. I came in here thinking why should I not take my full half hour-after all, it is not me, it is not the Opposition that has laid down this absurd timetable, nor, would I say, is it the Senate. For the Leader of the Government (Mr Beazley) to come into this place as he did and blame the Senate for laying down a timetable for consideration of the Bills, I have to say is pathetic nonsense, because looking at the program announced for these sittings by this Government at the beginning of this session, we find that all that was proposed after this week of sitting for the House of Representatives was one more week. Let there be no misunderstanding in this place and no buck passing. The sole criterion that the Senate has adopted in placing a limitation on its consideration of Bills is that there should be one or two weeks between the introduction of Bills in the Senate and their receiving consideration. In other words, the Senate imposes a cut-off so that there is time to give Bills proper examination. I think it is a perversion of the role of a house of review to deny it a week or two to consider the detail of Bills. The truth is that at the moment this Opposition is considering a welter of legislation under an impossible timetable. I was advised on Friday afternoon of the introduction of a Bill on Thursday night which will be considered this week. It is absurd to expect an Opposition to make sense of complex legislation, to consult with the community and interest groups and respond in a proper and appropriate way on that timetable. I have never enjoyed being part of charades. I have always had a contempt for form which is not underlaid by substance and I would feel very sad if, at the end of my first session in this House, I felt contempt for the procedures of this House. But I do not believe that what we are doing tonight is a real opportunity to consider a significant issue. I will be going to Perth tomorrow to talk to a major conference of the timber industry. I will make a speech in which I intend to stress the importance of biodiversity in considering forestry issues. But I know that the extent to which I will be listened to is in part a function of the fact that so much of Australian politics is absurd and meaningless, including this lack of opportunity to discuss this Bill tonight. In so far as this Bill makes mechanical improvements to the operation of the would Commission, it has our support. The extent to which we do not support it is indicated by the amendments that I have moved tonight or given notice that I would have moved had we had a proper committee debate. In the public arena there is disquiet about this process in a community which is totally committed now to preserving our national heritage and our environment. Important industry groups which, whatever the Minister at the table might have said of them, are being brought into the process by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the Minister for Resourcespeople who are being encouraged, indeed, almost begged, to do something to improve the processes which will enable this country to develop and grow in an environmentally and ecologically responsible way-are totally appalled at what they see as the perverted use of this institution, which was founded with our support and the support of all parties in this place. That we do not have an opportunity to seriously consider what is serious legislation is a lost opportunity to build some common ground that I think the Minister and the Government want to build in this area. I commend the amendment, I ask the Minister to consider adopting it in the interests of getting the greater bipartisanship that we all crave and I say very seriously that I hope the Minister will be an influence in the Government to prevent this charade being repeated next year.",75
194,Mr TUCKEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak later.,79
195,Mr JOHNS,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"The matters before us are relatively minor amendments to the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill and are not controversial. Some of them have been canvassed before in this place and that is the reason why in this particular instance Parliament does not need to take a great deal of time on this Bill. Nevertheless, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) took some 15 minutes bleating about the fact that he did not have enough time to speak about the Bill and spent about 10 minutes on the substantive issues associated with the Bill. Perhaps .the honourable member has learned his trade in the Senate where they waste a great deal of time. Mr Chaney-Occasionally they achieve results, but you wouldn't understand.",79
196,Mr JOHNS,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Here, because the business is so important, we do not waste our time; we spend most of it on the substantive issues. That is what I intend to do in the time that is allowed me. The honourable member is correct when he makes the point that people often attribute powers to the Australian Heritage Commission well beyond its own brief. That is not a fault of the Heritage Commission or of the Government, but a fault of people who are involved day-today in the resource conflict process, those who would seek to use the information that the· Australian Heritage Commission gives on a very professional basis to the Australian Government. What this Government is now doing through the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is building a more mature process for the consideration of resource conflict around the Heritage Commission. There is no suggestion that the Heritage Commission Act will be amended in order to satisfy the views of one side or another-whether they are resource users, the.for.est industry or whatever, or conserbilateral vattonIsts. There is no suggestion whatsoever that the Australian Heritage Commission would playa role other than the one it has played since 1975 or so that is, provide evidence about Australia's heritage to the Australian Government. Of course, its powers are really minute. They only come into play when the Australian Government itself is seeking to make a change to land, buildings or whatever, that might have an impact-I think the words are 'a significant impact' - on a place that is part of the Australian heritage list. The body of the Act really goes to a question of a group of people who provide information only to the Australian Government. But the information-this is the beauty-has become so powerful, if you like, that the power of the information has been used in resource conflicts. More recently, some of the proponents in the debate have chosen to take a pot shot at the Commission itself-quite unfairly. After all, we all value the information which the Heritage Commission brings. There should be no suggestion that the Commission should somehow have some powers taken from it or not play a full and proper rol- in the processes """"hich the Government is now putting into place to further manage any of the very necessary debate between those who would use our resources and those who wish to conserve them. Part of that process has been enlivened by the recent Special Premiers Conference. I want to mention the position arrived at in the communique from the Special Pr-miers Conference in Brisbane on 30 and 31 October. The question of the environment was raised and the communique endorsed the great principles of better environment protection and greater certainty of government and business decision making. Those are the two key principles under the communique. The communique goes on to be more specific about an agreement on the environment. It said that the agreement will seek: . . . the development of improved processes (including, where requested, by a State, through arrangements between State and Commonwealth Governments) for the assessment of forest resources, which would aim to provide for both the conservation of Australia's forest heritage and long term resource security, including by complementary State and Commonwealth legislation where requested by a State and agreed the Commonwealth, to facilitate investment by industry . . . It is no secret that again the resource users and the environmentalists have been jumping between the powers of Commonwealth and State governments at their own choice. When it suits them they will go to a State government and seek the right answer; when it suits them they will go to the Commonwealth Government and seek the right answer. The Heritage Commission, just to reinforce the point again, has never had great powers. It simply provides the information which often becomes ammunition in the debate. Where the Commonwealth has used powers to step into an environment debate it has often had to use powers that relate to matters like export licences and Assessment the granting of approval for foreign investment, or powers under our signing of international treaties; in other words, fairly circuitous methods to arrive at the sort of resource environment resolution that as a Commonwealth government would esses, seek. It is not the Heritage Commission that plays this role. The Commonwealth Government will use, and has used to overnight. great effect, all of the powers available it to try to resolve the conflicts between resource use and conservation of the entive vironment. In this particular instance it needs be appreciated and clarified that we have now, after many years of people going both State governments and Commonlie wealth governments to try to get the best deal out of either or both, reached turity in this process whereby the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in conjunction the State Premiers, is now setting and putting together a process whereby the State and Commonwealth governments its role. will move together to resolve any conflicts. The Australian Heritage Commisments sion will use its experience and its good people to present evidence in that respect. The honourable member for Pearce talked about the States becoming inon volved in the Commission process. He is right when he talks about the Commission Australia. moving to or sending officers to Western Australia or another State in order to proby vide and share evidence. That has been going on for some time. But I doubt whether we could take the extra step whereby State governments are somehow legislatively made part of the Heritage Commission-a kind of federation of the Heritage Commission. It does not make sense, where the Heritage Commission is understood to be the body that provides material to the Commonwealth Government, to have it work as a federation. We do not need that; we do not require it. The Commonwealth Government needs its own source of advice-and it has it through the Heritage Commission-on the question of Australian heritage, and it will seek to maintain that. CommissionWe want to build around the Heritage Commission,processes like the Resource the ecologically sustainable development process, and now the processes that are beginning to be laid down as a result of the Special Premiers we Conference communique. These procin conjunction, will build a mature process of resource conflict resolution. One does not arrive at these things It takes years of conflict, if you to like, and years of State and Federal governments working out what their respecpowers are. It takes years of having conservationists, foresters and miners to meeting on the ground over particular instances of conflict before one can even to begin to understand, metaphorically, the of the land. At this stage we understand it. Now is the time to provide these a mamore mature processes whereby most of the major conflict will be resolved by the with Commonwealth Government in conjunction with State governments, with the Australian Heritage Commission playing I support the Government's amend to the Commission legislation. I qmnot s4Pport those of the Opposition. I look forward to further work by the environment Minister and congratulate her her ability to help build this mature process for the resolution of conflict within",79
197,Mr TUCKEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"ln the five minutes remaining to me, I would like to make reference, in particular, to some of the activities of the Australian Heritage Commission, how it may have advised the Government in the past and bring to its attention where it might have gone wrong or where it might have otherwise been bullied by a government needing an electoral issue. Nobody in this Parliament knows more about the area of Shark Bay than I do. I spent 24 years of my life living on its shores. During that time. I travelled extensively around the shores of that large bay. As Shire President of the Shire of Carnarvon, I was directly involved in the development of the fishing industry. The whaling industry was active when I first arrived in the area. I know the people of what is known as Shark Bay-the town of Denham. I am very knowledgeable about the salt developments in the second bay of Useless Loop. In fact, I know a lot about it and I have got to say that when people identified that in their hit list of heritage areas, I was astounded, particularly in regard to the overall area identified. Basically, Shark Bay is a rich place. Let me say something about heritage and the responsibilities of the Heritage Commission. Heritage, to me, denotes identifying areas of history or something worthy of preservation. When we look at Shark Bay we see many thousands of square kilometres of water. When we search the history books, we find that in earlier times a couple of ships landed on Dirk Hartog Islands. Nevertheless, what else do we find in the area? It has a substantial fishery which is worthy of protection. Of course, the Western Australian State Government has one of the most competent fishery protection systems. It is certainly more advanced than that of any other State and it was implemented before any other State government gave it reasonable consideration. Immediately after the identification ora commercial fishery in Shark Bay, the State stepped in with a limited entry arrangement which has served the crayfish industry and other components of the fishing industry so well. So there was no need for political involvement from the Commonwealth. During the early years of the fishery, some wet line fishermen used to go to Monkey Mia and anchor their smaller boats. In the process of cleaning their fish, they threw a few over the side. Some of the local dolphins got to know that they were always there and they turned up regularly. It was not as though, in terms of heritage and history, these dolphins had been waiting around for the local Aboriginals to feed them at that point; it did not happen. Of course, the dolphins have continued to be fed by humans and consequently they have become a great tourist attraction. For many years the dolphins got along fine with the people without goverriment . help, but then government, of course, could not be kept out of that. The State Government employed some rangers. One of the rangers has recently resigned because the people who had been paying her wages-namely, the tourists-had been, according to the ranger, overfeeding the dolphins. Take it from me, if they are so stupid as to stop feeding the dolphins, the dolphins will all leave. The dolphins come for a feed, not particularly to talk for us or to perform as tourist attractions. They like the fish. Unfortunately, like us, they enjoy getting them as easily as possible. If humans are prepared to give fish to the dolphins, of course they will eat them. So a substantial investment in rangers and others had already been provided. There was an established saltworks in the area. Nobody is going to get rid of that, and as long as it is not expanded greatly, it will have no effect on the existing fisheries. Bernier and Dorney Islands have some unique wildlife which has been very well protected for probably longer than I have lived. As a developer in the past, I was very anxious to see on behalf of the town that we got some tourist activity. It was resisted strongly and determinedly by successive State governments. Even with all the bUllying that I could manage, as a local government person, I could not change its mind. The Commonwealth's help was not needed. It was under control for decades. We have got to the stupidity of the chap who came along and said, 'Well, there is this tourist attraction. You have just made it a heritage area and it should be something people would like to look at. I will put on a hovercraft, something that will disturb the environment to the minimum'. Because it is suddenly a heritage area the poor devil nearly went broke before he could get approval to travel over an area which had been the subject of prawn trawling and everything else. There have been other instances of protection. The very fishermen themselves fought a war at one stage with rifles to keep their competitors out of the nursery areas.",81

202,Mr ROCHER,COMMONWEALTH FUNDS,"The Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bill is designed to convert the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT) into a public company, to be wholly owned by the Commonwealth and called Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, or CFM. It also establishes the Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No.2, which will take over SFIT's trustee function in relation to the Commonwealth superannuation fund, or CSS. This will be a joint board with employee representation and replaces the Commonwealth superannuation board. CFM will have a statutory monopoly over the public sector superannuation (PSS) scheme and the Commonwealth superannuation scheme until 1 July 1995. This Bill seeks to corporatise the operations of SFIT to bring them more into line with private sector fund managers. It has the purpose of enabling SFIT to compete with the private sector superannuation schemes for the funds of government business enterprises which have recently established their own superannuation schemes, and without those funds SFIT would have difficulty in maintaining its current rate of return. The Bill also provides the fund with a Commonwealth guarantee on initial borrowings of up to $20m for working capital purposes until I July 1995. Moves to put SFIT on a more commercial footing are necessary and are welcomed by the Opposition. However, corporatisation is only a partial answer to the need for the fund to operate on a more commercial basis. Corporatisation, - s h-s been shown time and again, is an mfenor measure to full privatisation in terms of micro-economic reform. The corporatisation measures contained in this - iJl preside over some very non-commercIal provisions which betray the Government's attempt to place SFIT at arm's length from the Government. The statutory monopoly to be afforded CFM Ltd over certain funds until 1 July 1995 will give it an unfair advantage over private sector funds. So, too, will the explicit government guarantee on capital borrowings. This is in addition to the implicit guarantee that resides in any government owned entity, whereby there is an expectation that the Commonwealth will underwrite its performance or otherwise compensate those who might suffer from a poor return on their investment. While .both measures may have been thought to be necessary, they should at least have been qualified. At the very least, there should be some contingent penalty for CFM Ltd if the capital guarantee is actually called upon in order to provide the fund with the right performance incentives, even if they are of a negative type. There is also little that is commercial about the way in which the board of trustees of CFM is to be constituted and supervised by the Government. There are obviously inherent limits on the independence of the board when the Commonwealth is the only shareholder in the company. The Minister will be able to appoint and dismiss the board, according to the exercise of his own, arguably limited, judgment. The Government has made it clear that CFM will in all respects have to conform to the policies of the government of the day. The current policies of the Government may be in favour of giving the board the necessary degree of freedom to pursue the best interests of the contributors to the fund. However, the powers of the Minister will hang like a dark cloud over the operations of CFM Ltd, compromising its commercial activities at every turn. Only the full privatisation of bodies such as CFM will enable them to operate in a fully commercial manner, as is appropriate for a superannuation fund manager. There are no serious questions about the current performance of the fund. SFIT's returns to contributors have certainly been more than satisfactory to date, although this has not been without some dipping into reserves in recent times to compensate some contributors for the effects of SFlT's overexposure to the share market. Such overexposure is by no means unique to SFIT. But this only serves to highlight the fact that it is simply unnecessary for the fund to be in Commonwealth ownership. If the fund is acting in the same manner as a private sector fund manager in all respects, and delivering sound returns, then there is simply no case for it to remain in Commonwealth hands. The Government's refusal to let go of control of the fund only serves to cast doubt on the fund's future as changes in government policy occur. The SFIT annual report for 1989-90 is not yet available and, by all accounts, will not be available until at least late December. Apparently, this is due to a requirement that the report be tabled with that of the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office, which has yet to finalise its report. Until such time as this report is available, it is not possible for us to further assess the current performance of SFIT or speculate as to its likely future performance. There are also some questions about SFIT's reporting to its contributors. The coalition questions the right of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to appoint employee representatives to the board under this legislation. To the extent that there is to be employer representation on the board, it should be composed exclusively of employees and/ or union representatives directly accountable to the employee members of the fund. The ACTU obviously has barrows to push on the board of trustees which may not be in accord with the interests of fund members. This Bill comes at a time when there is increasing speculation in government circles as to how superannuation funds can be harnessed to serve the Government's policy objectives and to address the economic difficulties the Government has landed us in. The Government has floated the idea of using SFIT funds as a source of equity for Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines, for example. To inject these superannuation funds into Qantas and Australian would be to grossly betray the interests of fund members and highlights the importance of the fund being truly independent of the Government. Such government directed investments are bound to produce lower returns for contributors to the fund. If the Government becomes an indirect supplier of equity to the likes of Qantas and Australian, then there will be no market discipline on these bodies because they will know that they do not have to compete for private equity. These investments will reward the inefficient practices of these bodies and will preclude the possibility of a true market valuation of their investments. Again, only full privatisation is the solution to the equity difficulties faced by the likes of Australian and Qantas. The Government has been highly critical of the private superannuation fund managers for their lack of interest in venture capital investment. Senator Button has accused the private funds of 'economic vandalism' for their more prudent approach to venture capital investment. If the Government feels so strongly about this issue, then it is difficult to believe that CFM will not be placed under pressure to direct funds into these areas, despite the fact that the private sector has adopted a more cautious approach to venture capital. The Government's thinking in this area increasingly takes on the shades of Rex Connor and his mad schemes to underpin economic development in this country with massive public sector borrowings in shonky overseas deals. This Government seems to think that it can use the savings of Australians in a similar way, placing the burden of these risky ventures squarely on their shoulders. Superannuation funds, whether they be publicly or privately owned, should not be vulnerable to the whims of the Government in this way. The Government has also been critical of fund managers such as Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP) for putting money into overseas property and share markets. Of course, this is not an indictment of AMP, but rather an indictment of the Government's m-nagement of the Australian economy WhICh makes port.folio investment here such an u-attractIVe proposition. Were the AustralIan economy in good shape, we could expect to see different investment patterns from fund managers. We would also see investment in Australia from overseas and from overseas fund managers. The Government seemingly has no qualms about sacrificing th- s-vings of Australians on the altar of mIsgUIded government policies and harebrained theories about the sources of economic development. This Government has no commitment to freedom of choice when it comes to superannuation. Australian workers are forced into accord based productivity payments which require them to take some of their wages in the form of superannuation. While it is desirable that people be couraged to provide for their retirement, it is another thing entirely for the Government to dictate the terms of this proVISIOn. If nothing else, forced superannuation guarantees that the superannuation funds will have an assured government-sponsored inflow of cash which will remove the fund managers' incentive to produce at the highest possible level return to investors. It should be incumbent on the fund managers to make superannuation an attractive proposition for those saving for their retirement. If the Government takes it upon itself to make this decision for people, then the fund managers are freed from that responsibility.",83
203,Mr LANGMORE,COMMONWEALTH FUNDS,"1 was somewhat surprised at the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). One of the very striking things about the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT) is that it has been the most successful large scale investment manager of superannuation funds in the last three years. has one of the largest portfolios in the country with over $5.8 billion under management. It operates in all major domestic financial markets, including property and equities. During the last five years, its rates of return have been 16.5 per cent in 1985-86, 27.3 per cent in 1986-87, 13.4 per cent in 1987-88, 13.3 per cent in 198889 and 8.4 per cent in 1989-90. There have been figures released in fact for the last financial year, contrary to what the previous speaker said. The result of those figures is that during the last three years SFIT's performance has averaged 12.1 per cent per annum-higher than that of any of the large low volatile funds that participate in the major survey of superannuation funds. So this wholly publicly owned superannuation investment trust has been more successful than any private company during the last three years, which is one of the clearest pieces of evidence about the success of public enterprise. So that completely undermines the Opposition's approach to privatisation and the propos<\l that the previous speaker was suggesting for privatisation. enThose results were achieved, by the way, whilst having the lowest risk portfolio of any of those major companies. That is a remarkable achievement. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin, was concerned about the Commonwealth guarantee on initial borrowings. Commonwealth Fund Management Pty Ltd (CFM), like any comof mercial business enterprise, requires working capital to enable it to meet the day-today expenses incurred in the conduct of its business. SFIT's working capital is currently derived from the Commonwealth superannuation fund against which SFIT charges all its expenses. Therefore, SFIT only holds assets as trustee of the fund. Accordingly, unlike other government business enterprises, SFIT has no assets in its own right which the Commonwealth could transfer to the company. Without government intervention of some kind, Commonwealth Fund Management Pty Ltd would be left in a position where it would most likely be unable It even to secure a loan for working capital purposes. In view of this and to avoid outlays from the Budget, the Bill provides for the Commonwealth to provide a limited guarantee on CFM's initial borrowings. The limits placed on that guarantee are, firstly, that the borrowings cannot ceed $20m and, secondly, that it only applies to borrowings undertaken before 1995. So, on that basis, it would seem absolutely clear that it was entirely approwhole priate and responsible for the Commonwealth to make a guarantee for its borrowings. On the question of privatisation, there are a whole series of reasons why it would be irresponsible for the Commonwealth to privatise this organisation. One is clearly that, given its unique nature, CFM should be wholly owned by the Commonwealth with all shares being held by the Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth-because the Commonwealth clearly has an ongoing interest in CFM's activities, not the least because of its portance to the Commonwealth public sector superannuation arrangements. As a responsible employer, the Commonwealth should be concerned to retain an interest in the company which will manage a large portion of its employees' superannuation moneys for at least the next five years. To sell it would be to negate the Commonwealth's responsibilities to its own employees. In view of the public sector superannuation scheme being a defined benefits scheme and with any under performance by CFM representing an additional cost to the Commonwealth, it is in the Commonwealth's financial interest to maintain a significant interest in CFM because this will enable it to influence the company's ability to maximise returns on the fund thereby minimising the Commonwealth's costs. So financial prudence requires that it be kept wholly in Commonwealth ownership. I am glad to say that the Government is proposing an amendment to this Bill which will guarantee that. Another issue raised by the honourable member for Curtin was the trustee reporting requirements. The trustees will be required to report directly to the contributors to the fund. The way the current trust reports is that it sends a report to all contributors. A copy for each contributor has been delivered to over 1,400 workplace destinations in 1990. The trust issues an information statement; it exprovides newsletters; and it provides annual reports. Those reporting requirements will continue exactly as before. Therefore, without wanting to go into a lot of other important aspects of this fund, I strongly support it. I think it is the only responsible thing for the Commonwealth to do-to keep it wholly in Commonwealth ownership. I am delighted that the Government is going to guarantee that through this legislation and I strongly support the Bill.",85
204,Mr SHACK,COMMONWEALTH FUNDS,"As we heard from the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the aim of the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bill is to convert the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust into a wholly Commonimwealth owned public company which will be able to compete with the private sector in the management of superannuation funds. The Bill continues changes to Commonwealth superannuation arrangements by vesting in Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd a statutory monopoly over the public sector superannuation scheme and the Commonwealth superannuation scheme until 1 July 1995. After this time Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd-by which name the company will be known-will have to compete for funds with other fund managers. The new arrangements do not involve any additional Commonwealth spending, but the Commonwealth will be required to guarantee initial borrowings of up to $20m prior to 30 June 1995 for working capital purposes. Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd will be required to pay dividends to the Commonwealth, but will be exempt from taxes generally applicable on company formation and the transfer of assets, on the grounds that there will be no change in beneficial ownership. With the passage of this legislation the existing trustee function of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust will be transferred to a joint employer-employee board of trustees to be known as the Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No.2. The funds managed by this new body will consist of the existing and ongoing contributions of members of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and the public sector superannuation scheme, as well as the income earned from the investment of those contributions and the 3 per cent employer productivity contributions dating from 1 July 1990. In July this year the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme was reported as having 325,000 contributory members and 100,000 pensioners. This makes it far and away Australia's largest superannuation scheme, with some $5.8 billion under management. The handling of such a .large pool of money is particularly important, and it is the appropriateness of the proposed management arrangements which gives rise to some of the coalition's concerns about this Bill. As the honourable member for Curtin said, as a coalition we will not be opposing the Bill, but we do wish to make it clear that contrary to the arguments of the honourable member preceding me, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), on coming to government we would privatise Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd. If this body is to be allowed to enter into genuine competition with private sector funds, it must be allowed to operate efficiently and effectively and without the cloak of protection provided under this Bill. It must be able to get on with the job of maximising the benefits which accrue to contributory members without the threat of undue government interference. In our view there are real difficulties allowing Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd to enter into commercial competition with the private sector while it maintains advantages from its association with the Commonwealth. In particular I refer to the fact that Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd will have monopoly control over billions of dollars for a specified period of five years. It appears to us that this time frame was set arbitrarily. Behind the decision lies the Government's desire to, first of all, ensure there was no mass exodus of funds from the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust and, secondly, to give the Government some breathing space to consider its long term position. In addition to this five-year monopoly guarantee, a further matter of concern is the Commonwealth guarantee for borrowings of up to $20m. Private sector funds, which do not attract such gilt edged security, will be at a considerable disadvantage compared with funds of the new Commonwealth body-and, I might add, so much for the Government's often stated commitment to the 'level playing field'. Furthermore, not only will Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd have the security of the $20m Government guarantee, it will also benefit from the absence of a contingent penalty in the event of it having to call upon that guarantee. In presenting the Bill the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) stated there will be new planning and accountability mechanisms for Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, including the establishment of financial targets. Just as there is no penalty for calling on the $20m guarantee, nor is there any reference to what might follow from the failure-of Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd to meet its financial targets. What must be borne in mind at all times is that the sole financial objective of Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd should be the totally safe maximisation of returns to contributing employees. For these employees the paramount concern is what is done with their savings and the rates of return they will receive. in This is a perfectly legitimate concern for, after all, the moneys being handled are the property of employees held in trust to fund their retirement. In the case of Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, those responsible for the money held in trust will be a board of trustees made up of employer and employee representatives. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, the Government superannuation policy, expressed in its occupational superannuation standards, is that responsibility and control for superannuation funds should be in the hands of joint erriployer-employee boards of trustees. In the case of Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, employees will have their say in the administration of their superannuation fund through trustees nominated by-you guessed it-the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The obvious question here is: If a union was deemed to be the appropriate vehicle for achieving employee representation on the board, why was the Public Sector Union not given this privilege instead of the ACTU? Apart from this concern about the composition of the board, there is also the issue of powers of the Minister in relation to the board. The Bill proposes that the Minister be given power to appoint and dismiss the Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd board of directors. Unless such powers are exercised in a most responsible fashion, there is the danger that the Commonwealth could wield undue influence over Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd and could, if it wished, stack the membership of its board. Coupled with the concerns already raised about Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd unfair competitive advantage over the private sector, this power over the board is yet one more reason why the coalition believes that the Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd ties with the public sector should be cut. The whole climate in relation to superannuation has undergone a dramatic transformation over the last decade. Superannuation used to be the province of a comparatively small proportion of the work force, with the public sector enjoying the bulk of that privilege. However, from the beginning of the 1980s superannuation has been introduced throughout the work force on an industry basis. As a result there has been a significant increase in the number of workers covered by superannuation. Australia's superannuation savings are expected to grow at the rate of $30 billion a year over the next decade to reach around $600 billion by the year 2000. Estimates of the amount which will be held in industry superannuation funds vary from $200 billion to $400 billion, but there does seem to be consensus now that it will be in the region of $250 billion. This is an amount which is roughly equal to the present value of the entire Australian Stock Exchange. It is clear from this that, as well as playing an increasingly important role in funding retirement incomes, superannuation will represent one of the most dramatic areas of savings growth in our economy as a whole. Just how such a large pool of funds is to be managed and controlled is yet to be determined. Clearly the recent highly publicised crashes of institutions such as the Pyramid Building Society and Estate Mortgage have created widespread financial nervousness in the community. I quote the assistant general secretary of the Miscellaneous Workers Union, Brian Daley, who said: The experiences of things like WA Inc and the VEDC caused a lot of people to be doubly cautious of what they will do. We don't want a situation where there is an unlimited development fund which gets into so many scatty projects it doesn't work. Quite simply, we believe the interests of Commonwealth superannuitants and this fund would be best served by its being fully privatised. If the honourable member for Fraser does not agree with that he should have supported our opposition to the guillotine; then he would have had a chance to put forward his point of view. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The time allotted for the second reading of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In Committee The Bill.",86
205,Mr WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH FUNDS,"I move: After clause 46, page 18, insert the following new clause: Shares of Company not to be transferred ""46. A person holding shares in the Company may not transfer any of those shares to a other than: (a) the Commonwealth; or (b) a body corporate established for a purpose by a law of the Commonwealth; or (c) a Minister."". I do this to place the continued Commonwealth ownership of the shares in the company established under the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bill beyond doubt and to ensure that any proposed transfer in ownership to non-Commonwealth bodies is to be subject to proper parliamentary consideration. The existing Bill facilitates the conversion of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust to a wholly Commonwealth owned public company limited by shares. The Bill requires the shares to be issued to the Commonwealth or its nominees. However, the Bill as presently drafted would also enable any government to sell the Commonwealth's shares in the company without recourse to parliament. The Government considers continued Commonwealth ownership of this government business enterprise to be important, given that the Commonwealth and the Parliament have an ongoing interest in its activities, particularly in relation to its importance to the public sector. In this regard, I draw honourable members' attention to the fact that the company will for some time be the sole investment manager of the superannuation contributions of members of the Commonwealth's two major employee superannuation schemes. Presently the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust has $5.8 billion of Commonwealth employees' superannuation moneys under management. Therefore, it is appropriate that the Commonwealth should be concerned as a responsible employer to retain its interest in the company. Moreover, the employees themselves have an obvious interest in the continuation of the new company as a Commonwealth government business enterprise. In addition, the new Commonwealth superannuation scheme, the public sector superannuation scheme, introduced by the Government earlier this year, pays a deperson fined benefit. The Commonwealth will be responsible for the difference between that defined benefit and the sum of members' public contributions plus the interest earned thereon by the company. The Commonwealth therefore has a very direct financial interest in maintaining its position as sole shareholder of the company, enabling it to take steps to ensure that the company is able to operate commercially and attract business in order to maximise returns on Commonwealth superannuation moneys and minimise Commonwealth costs. It would not be in the Commonwealth's interests for the Bill to permit the sale of the Commonwealth's shares in the company. This is because the company is to have a monopoly over the management and investment of the funds of the two Commonwealth superannuation schemes until at least 30 June 1995, and any potential purchaser is likely to require a discount arising from the recent loss of a monopoly over the investment of the superannuation funds of Commonwealth government business enterprises. Accordingly, this Government considers that it would be in the Commonwealth interest for the question of the sale of shares in this company to non-Commonwealth bodies, given its unique nature, to be subject to proper parliamentary consideration should such a course ever be proposed by some future Government. I therefore ask that the amendment as proposed by the Government be accepted by the Committee and I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum for this amendment to the Bill.",88
206,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,COMMONWEALTH FUNDS,"The Opposition is not aware of this amendment and we reserve our right to examine it when' it gets to the Senate. Amendment agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Willis)-by leave-read a third time.

207,Mr HAWKER,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT,"The Opposition intends to move a number of amendments to the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill which we will outline in further detail later. I begin by saying that it is absolutely outrageous that the Government has guillotined this Bill,' along with over 30 other Bills this week, denying proper debate on these Bills, denying the opportunity for people to explore some of the complexities of the Bills and to talk about some of the effects: If the Government wants to be taken seriously in its approach to parliamentary democracy and the way it treats this chamber, it should allow honourable members time to speak in a proper debate and talk about these Bills. Clearly in the time that is available for this Bill there is no way that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is going to be able to respond to many of the issues that honourable members would like to raise. For that reason, the Opposition well and truly condemns the Government for the way in which it has behaved. While there are no doubt some very useful things coming in with this Billthe Opposition supports particularly an increase in funding for our transport system and, in particular, our roads-the fact is that this Bill, as it is written, the Minister an enormous amount of discretion in the way that he spends this money. I notice that the Minister is nodding his head, so he obviously agrees with that point. For that reason, the Opposition is very concerned that there should be some better definition of the way the Minister is going to spend that money. For that reason, we would like to move a , number of amendments. Those amendments, in broad terms, would mean that a share of the additional funds promised by the Government at election time and followed up with this amendment will be guaranteed to each of the three new proBILL 1990 grams. In other words, not only will it be mentioned in the second reading speech, it will also be incorporated in the Bill. The second thing is that we believe that a share of the total trust fund moneys should be guaranteed to roads. After all, the way the Bill is drafted now it is quite possible that the Minister could, if he wished, dramatically reduce the amount of money that goes into roads. We believe that is not the thrust of the Bill and therefore that the amendment should be included in this amendment to the main Bill. Thirdly, as I said earlier in my opening remarks, the amount of discretion the Minister will have in road funding, we believe, is far too wide. In fact, the discretion to direct States to submit particulars of projects for provincial cities, rural highways, the black spots and road safety programs, and urban public transport should be done by invitation to the States rather than by direction. We believe that this will give the opportunity for the Government to assume an extraordinary amount of discretion which, I might add, is quite contrary to part of the thrust of the Special Premiers Conference a couple of weeks ago. We also feel that these amendments are very necessary because they will help to stop the increased politicisation of road funding at the Federal level. It is quite clear from the events of the last few months, particularly in the lead-up to the last election, that road funding has become highly political. The Minister should, gives and the Opposition certainly does, feel that road funding is too important a subject to allow it to become a political football. The other point I raise is that the Bill, as I said, does not talk about the approach the Prime Minister has been talking about in his Special Premiers Conference, in particular that road funding for local government would be absorbed into general purpose funding. In fact, it goes in exactly the opposite direction. When we are looking at the question of road funding, obviously there is another issue, and that is who. shOl-ld be payi-g for the improvements m raIlways: Wh-le this is supposed to b- - road fundmg Bl-l, I notice that the Mmlster has moved m his amendment to change it to a land transport Bill. - u?d-nly the Governm-nt has found that It IS tlme to start spendmg more and more of the money that basically is coming from motorists, and to a limited extent from rail, on urban public transport and railways. While we support the thrust in one way, we feel that this should be a matter for a separate piece of legislation. But, in any case, we will move an amendment to restrict the amount of money that will be allocated from the trust to railways so that we cannot see something that was done that was not announced in the second reading speech. One thing the Bill has announced is that $50m is to go to the National Rail Freight Corporation. While we would support the principle of the National Rail Freight Corporation, there are a lot of unanswered questions. We should get the whole matter in perspective. The Government has made a lot of noise about the National Rail Freight Corporation and hailed it as some great modern marvel. We should remember that while improvements to interstate rail freight are long overdue and that if they can be achieved they will be certainly welcomed by all, the fact is that interstate rail freight accounts for only 15 per cent of the total freight carried by railways. The losses that are currently being made on interstate rail freight are of the order of $300m. When one considers that railways in Australia collectively are losing something like $3 billion a year, this move by the Government really has to be put in perspective. It is not the instant cure that some of the spokesmen on the other side of the House would have us believe. It is merely a small step, a step in the right direction. But there is still an awfully way to go. If we are to see real reform in rail, then clearly the massive losses that are occurring in some of the State rail authorities have to be tackled very seriously, otherwise, the Government's efforts in micro-economic reform as it applies to rail will be seen to have been a bit of a wimp. It would be worth noting in passing that we have heard a lot of noise from the Government about what it was going to do with waterfront reform and with the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. When looking at the facts, despite the fact that within the first 12 months the number of people employed on the waterfront would be reduced by several hundred, we find that no-one has actually lost his job and that 200 more have been employed. If that is any measure of micro-economic reform as it is actually put into practice by this Government rather than talked about, we have to raise some serious questions. Some questions I would like to ask the Minister about the National Rail Freight Corporation are questions that he may not be able to deal with in the very short time frame that the Government has restricted this debate to. However, I hope that he will address them. They are questions that are very pertinent t() this National Rail Freight Corporation, and if the Government does not tackle them. I feel that its commitment is less than wholesome and less likely to succeed. Those questions with respect to the National Rail Freight Corporation are: How much does it get in the way of real responsibility and commitment? In other words, the Government can talk about it, but how much commitment are we going to see? Will the National Rail Freight Corporation be able to run its own track and equipment? Will it have the capacity to manage its own operations? That may sound an obvious question, but will there be interference at either a political level or from some of the unions? Will it have the capacity to have its own markets? In other words, will it have the autonomy that is expected if it is to succeed? What will be the situation between the Corpolong ration's own people and its own capital and between those from the State systems? I have already referred to the fact that the State rail systems have problems, some more than others. Clearly, if the National Rail Freight Corporation is going to 'get off the ground, it will have to show that it can operate considerably better in this area than some of the State authorities. Another obvious question is: How many unions will be covered in the Corporation? Will it be able to be brought down to one so that, clearly, the demarcation problems that are so chronic in many of the State rail authorities can be avoided? Another question is: Will it have the right to contract out for some of its core services? All these questions should be answered by the Minister if we are serious about getting this National Rail Freight Corporation to operate commercially and successfully. Clearly, if we can see that happen, we should also be pressuring the Government into saying what it is doing about the major source of micro-economic reform in the rail area, namely, the States. I ask leave to incorporate a brief table in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA NA (excludes AN) Year $m 1969-70 . 20 1970-71 . 8 1971-72 . 6 1972-73 . 3 1973-74 . 33 1974-75 . 62 1975-76 . 34 1976-77 . 58 1977-78 . 51 Total Federal allocations 1978-79 . 42 to the States for' rail in 1979-80 . 47 the last 21 years only 1980-81 . 60 amount to 44% of one years 1981-82 . 61 Federal road funding 1982-83 . 65 1983-84 . 11 NA Year 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83* . 1983-84** 1984-85 Year $m 1984-85 . 7 1985-86 . 7 1986-87 . 5 1987-88 . 3 1988-89 . 0 1989-90 . 0 Total. . 583 Source: ""Mobility in a Clean Environment"": ARUlACF. This table shows the level of real commitment that the Government has made in its approach to rail reform. In looking at this table, one can see that it is the previous two governments, the Whitlam Government and the Fraser Government, that really put some capital allocation into railways. We find that when the Hawke Government came into power the 198283 commitment from the Fraser Government of $6Sm to rail capital expenditure was cut to $llm in 1983-84 and $7m the following year, and in 1988-89 and 1989-90 there has been no money allocated federally to rail investment in the States. The Government does not come to this debate with clean hands. It has had a sudden rush of blood after seven years to say, 'We had better do something new. What can we do? Maybe it is in the area of rail'. The chart has been incorporated in Hansard and all honourable members will find it very interesting. If we look at the question of road reform, we find a very similar story. The Government's record on road reform has been nothing short of appalling. I also seek leave to incorporate in Hansard some tables which show the Government's record on road funding and excise. Leave granted.

If we look at these figures, we see what has been constantly stated by the Opposition, which the Government continues studiously to avoid. The fact is that the Fraser Government brought in the bicentenary road development fund. This Government took it over, and by 1984 it froze the amount of money that was going into roads. In real terms the amount was declining. But at the same time the Government continued to index the excise on fuel, so that the amount of money being t-ken from the motorist was increasing in hne with inflation. At the same time the amount of money going into roads until last year was frozen in nominal terms so in real terms the amount of money g-ing Fuel excise rate Budget Actual Fuel excise cents per litre allocation expenditure revenue at end of $m $m $m financial year 1225.58 1220.17 2690.01 14.42(a) 1139.91 1145.74 4057.39 17.45(a) 1064.91 1074.72 3916.53 16.85(a) 977.27 974.44 3835.81 16.21(a) 951.68 956.93 3937.68 16.21(b) 1077.04 n.a. 4013.16 16.39(b) to CPI from 1983-84 Budget. oil and kerosene (and airline fuel). 1 1989 and 1990 respectively. into roads has fallen by something like 27 per cent since 1984. It is not a very pretty record, and it certainly does not stack up very well against some of the claims that the Government has been making. Road Roads as Because of the shortage of time, I will of excise not be able to discuss the Government's $m $m approach to roads in any great detail. 70.99 What we have really seen in the roads 74.47 area is a series of reports. We had the 69.81 May Committee report in 1984. The In63.18 ter-State Commission started' its work in 58.51 1986. It reported again in 1987. It made 45.36 28.24 another report in 1990. Even though by 27.44 then the Inter-State Commission had been 25.40 wound up, the Inter-State Commissioner, 24.30 Mr Butcher, continued to work towards 26.84 trying to get some reasonable and sensible suggestions together. Unfortunately, his time was cut short. I believe that it is one Of the great pities of the decision by the Government to cutout the Inter-State Commission that we have not seen the follow-up work done as thoroughly as we would have liked. Certainly, as I have said on a number of occasions, one of the great weaknesses of the present Inter-State Commission report is that it has not looked at the impact of some of its recommendations on regional and country Australia. Clearly there are some very real worries. As our colleague in the Northern Territory has pointed out to the Minister on a number of occasions, families in the Northern Territory could be disadvantaged by as much as $2,000 per family per year if the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission report were ever implemented. I think that that sort of claim cannot go without being properly investigated, and 1 call upon the Minister to look into that matter too. There are a lot of other things that should be raised in speaking to this Bill, but unfortunately, as time is running short, 1 will just foreshadow those amendments. As 1I have already pointed out, they seek to ensure that the discretion of the Minister will be kept in line with what has been normal in other road funding Billsin other words, that he does not assume considerably more discretion and go in the opposite direction from what the Premiers Conference has been all about and the new federalism that the Government has been talking about so much. We believe that an amendment should be moved so that when a State wishes to apply a toll on a road where there is some Federal funding, the State should be able to do that, but obviouslY on the basis that a proportional amount of that toll should be returned to the Commonwealth. As to the other area of amendment, we believe that the Government should not be allowed to use this Bill as a means of backdoor financing of some of the losses of the State rail authorities. 1 can think one State in particular where 1 know that there is considerable pressure on the Government to bailout some of the huge losses of that State and, more particularly, some of the losses of its railways. 1 think it would be a travesty if the discretion that this Bill is currently going to give Minister were allowed to be abused in such a fashion. So we will be moving amendments to that effect.",90
208,Mr OKEEFE,AND PETROL EXCISE REVENUE,"1 acknowledge the observations of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) about the time available in this debate. This topic, in particular, deserves much more consideration than we are able to give it tonight, but 1 intend to be brief. 1I have a quite different perspective from that of the honourable member for Wannon. 1 think the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill is actually a very exciting piece of legislation. 1 could spend hours talking about the developments that are incorporated in it because 1 see it as landmark legislation. 1 know that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), has put an enormous amount of work into the decisions that have been reflected in this legislation. As he said in his second reading speech, the legislation does flow on from the Australian centennial roads development legislation. There was a need to improve on that program by expanding the commitment to national roads as it relates to road funding specifically, but more importantly to pull together that integrated approach to land transport reform which is reflected in this legislation. 1 think it is also important for us to note the Minister's observations in his second reading speech about the agreement reached between the Premiers, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Chief Ministers at the Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane. 1 remember talking to the Minister about the agreement of the States to move towards the formation of a national freight corporation. We had some talks about the possibility of this some months ago. He came back from a of meeting of transport Ministers with the quite startling comment that there had been an in-principle agreement. 1 remember one of my colleagues saying to the Minister, 'Yes, but it's only an in-principle agreement, Minister. Don't get so exthe cited'. He said, 'They have been trying to get some sort of agreement on this for nearly 100 years. Whether it is an inprinciple one or a real one, it will do for now'. His enthusiasm was obviously picked up by the Prime Minister and the Premiers. 1 think it is remarkable that something that was being talked about just two or three months ago as an in-principle agreement is now on the table, agreed by the Premiers with the Federal Government, and that everybody is moving as conscientiously as possible towards that 1 July start-up date. 1 want to publicly congratulate the Minister on his efforts in that regard. I did say before that it is an integrated approach to land transport. I happen to regard what is involved in this legislation as the key area of the Government's micro-economic reform agenda. There has been lots of talk, particularly from people on the other side of the House, about the evils of the waterfront. We have had this great debate about telecommunications and a whole lot of areas where the Government is seeking to drag efficiency out of the economy. But for all the glamour and controversy of those other areas, let no one be under any illusion that this initiative is not the key area to be focused on in this economy. It has been estimated by a number of different sources, including the Bureau of Transport Economics, that the gains to be made by putting together a sensible roadrail strategy and the formation of the National Freight Corporation are in the vicinity of 3 per cent to 4 per cent of gross national product. That kind of saving could involve figures like $5 billion $6 billion per annum in efficiency savings in this economy. That far surpasses arguments about a $150m waterfront restructuring package and it far surpasses the short or medium term gains to be drawn in this economy from increased competition in the field of telecommunications. The Minister is at the centre of the action and I congratulate him for the way he is doing his job. I never cease to be amazed, though, when members of the Opposition-it does not matter whether they are in here or out on the hustings-talk about road funding and the 1984 freeze, as the honourable member for Wannon did again tonight. He said that this Government froze the funding in 1984 at its nominal level and held it at that level for some years, and that represented a real decrease in road funding. Surprise, surprise! I am here to agree with him. Yes, that did happen in 1984. What the Opposition never does is talk about 1982, the last year of the Fraser Government, when it was just a fraction more. If I remember the figure, something like $690m was the last Fraser Government contribution' to the road funding Bill. Then the Hawke Government's initial foray into the field was about $1 ,250m. I think they were the figures. We almost doubled it first up. There was almost a 100 per cent increase. . Mr Reid - And then you stopped.",94
209,Mr OKEEFE,AND PETROL EXCISE REVENUE,"Of course we put the plateau there. It could not increase exponentially by 100 per cent per annum, for God's sake. The Opposition never wants to talk about pre-1984; it never wants to talk about its last try. It always wants to talk about the Government's first try. True, we did hold road funding in nominal terms and everybody understood that that was the way it had to be, but here it is being served up again tonight. Let me make a key point: I believe the Minister has been overly persuasive. I have not said that about the Minister before, but I believe he has been overly persuasive in the Cabinet Room about the level of road funding. The Minister has done exceptionally well to get the 13 per cent real to increase in Budget terms that has been produced this year. I have often argued that there is no case for any increase in road funding while one has the absurd nonsense in this country of 2,000 trucks a night-I will not exaggerate-running up and down the Hume Highway parallel to a standard gauge railway line. The HumeHighway is a road that cost $4m a kilometre to build. While Australia is spending money on duplicating a· standard gauge railway line 100 metres across the paddock from where 1,000 trucks a night drive backwards and forwards between Adelaide and Melbourne parallel to the railway line, there is no case for any increase in road funding. That is why I commend the Minister for being so determined'in carrying through the sensible balance of road and rail as a transport strategy. The strategy is starting to be seen. Many of us believe there is a place for heavy road transport. There .is a place for trains-superfreighters carrying large trainloads of containers. They each have a place and we will find their place, but it is not running parallel to each other, and that is what this program is all about. In recent weeks I have had the very great pleasure of moving around Australia with the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow), who chairs a Government working group which is looking at this area of land transport reform. We have seen some quite exceptional examples of the way the relationship between road and rail is being sorted out. I remember particularly seeing at South Dynon in Victoria the new approach to the superfreighter use of trains. The average turnaround time at South Dynon and the Opposition always likes to talk about the railway yards-for a truck going in either to unload its container straight onto the train or to take its container straight off the train is 15 minutes. Approximately 80 per cent of the vehicles are in and out of the railway yard in 15 minutes. That is pretty impressive, and what that means is that instead of spending $100,000 on a new trailer for a truck, the freight forwarding companies are buying five containers and they are booking space on the railways. They are filling up their containers at the factory, they are sticking them straight on the train, and one train is the equivalent of about 60 trucks. That means that there are economies of scale throughout this economy and it is the Minister for Land Transport and this Government who have managed to get the Premiers to agree to a rationalisation of this national transport program. Mr Robert Brown-That is with great support from fellows like yourself and Jim Snow.",95
210,Mr OKEEFE,AND PETROL EXCISE REVENUE,"I appreciate ""that, Minister. I could not let this night go past without one other observation about the legislation, and that is my personal delight at the bringing into effect in this legislation of the election promise to troduce the provincial cities and rural highways program. That is an obvious next stage-to identify those roads of national significance that are out of the Highway One system or the national highway system. They are very important roads and I appreciate the interest that the Minister has taken in the Calder Highway in my electorate. I suppose I would have to concede that the Calder Highway probably has had a bit of a home ground advantage. I see that it has been specifically named in the legislation, and so it should be, but I will never forget the day after the Minister was elected to his position. I rang him and said, 'Look, you have roads, Bob, and the Calder Highway has to go on the list'. He came down to have a look at it; he met the Calder Highway Improvement Committee; and he has since talked these matters through with his State counterparts not only in Victoria but also in all the other States, and all those key roads will be direct beneficiaries of this program. The negotiation of the black spots program and the road safety package are measures that people in Australia are expecting of government. They expect us to have a look at the absurdity of all these trucks in the wrong places. They expect us to have a look at why people are not using rail. They expect us to do something about the accidents. They expect us to take a responsible approach towards an efficient and integrated land transport system. Anyone can see the nonsense of what has been going on in Australia-the legacy of a lack of planning and a lack of discipline. It is that discipline that those who now sit on the Opposition side of the House failed to put in place when they had the reins. Mr Hawker-You have had seven years in office.",96
211,Mr OKEEFE,AND PETROL EXCISE REVENUE,"It is all very well to say that, but the fact of the matter is that it has taken nearly 20 years for the situation to develop the way it did. It has taken that time for these habits to develop in in- the economy. For heaven's sake, why is Australia the only place in the world where it makes sense to have 2,000 trucks a night doing 800 kilometres parallel to the major railway line? It is because when the Opposition was in government it let that happen. The Opposition cannot walk away from that. During the Opposition's last year in government it allocated $690m for roads. We have been through it all. It takes time to turn the situation around and the results are now starting to be seen. It is very commendable that that support is around. It is commendable that the Government is being seen to respond to what all but those on the other side of the House see as clear and demanding attention. 1 certainly say to the Minister that he has the full support of his back bench in his attempt to work through the issue. We know, as the Prime Minister said the other day, that there will be some quite hard issues to be worked through, and already the road transport operators are making it clear that they will certainly have some views that we have to listen to. But the Minister has the support of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and his working group and others such as the Prime Minister's country task forcesupport right across the board. We are all quite determined to see this integrated land transport package in place and on deck. At the next election this will be a very big plus for the Government to put on the deck in front of the people of Australia. 1 will guarantee to the House now that by 1992, when the next election turns up, the honourable member for Wannon will not still be talking about 1984 levels of road funding. This is a very impressive story to tell. 1 support the legislation and 1 understand the honourable member's position in respect of his amendments. 1 think we will wait to see them on the deck before we worry about responding to them at this point.",96
212,Mr COWAN,AND PETROL EXCISE REVENUE,"1 do not want to talk about the past; 1 just want to talk about the future. I am sure the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) would agree that Australia has almost reached the end of the road so far as the present situation on the funding of roads, rail and shipping is concerned. We have to appreciate that Australia is a - ation on wheels. It is a nation certainly wI-h very long transport commup.ic:ttions. It IS also a nation in which, perhaps, none of us has measured up in relation to our shipping problems. That is why 1 say that we have reached the period when, for the development of Australia, we have to look to the better ways to approach our general transport system throughout the countryside. We can argue, of course, that there is not sufficient money going into roads. 1I have said that and other members on both sides of the House have argued it over a period of time. But 1 was interested to hear in the Minister's second reading speech that transport reform in Australia would mean an increase in the gross domestic product of approximately 3 per cent, which I am sure is very important for the greater efficiency of the microand macro-economy and so for the future of Australia. The public is demanding that something be done, and it is demanding it because of the high cost of freight, the damage that is caused to vehicles and the loss of life upon the roads. One thing that concerns me about the legislation has been outlined by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). The Minister has been most genuine in what he has done; he has put the pressure on and advised the Australian people about his own personal concern and the problems that he sees. 1 know that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has met with the States and there have been certain discussions but, even with the changes that are actually embraced within the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill, I am concerned whether this is the efficient way to tackle the reform of our transport system. Both the Minister and 1I have served in a State House, and when we did we believed that the State was responsible because it was at the grassroots and knew exactly what was happening at its back and front doors. The Commonwealth Minister himselfwhoever he is-upon the advice of his department, will select certain jobs to be done; cer.tain black spots or certain national arterial roads, as we used to term them. As the Minister himself mentioned, he is the person who will actually select the jobs. This concerns me greatly because I believe that State departments of main roads, or whatever they may call them, are, particularly in New South Wales and I expect in other States of Australia, pretty efficient organisations. They have their finger on the pulse as to where their bad roads are and they have a regular assessment of the needs of their particular States, whether it is transport to port works or to industries in major towns, rural areas or the capital of the State. I hope that the Minister will fully recognise-and this is not within the legislation, as has been pointed out-that he should take the advice of the people who really have their finger on the pulse. This is very important indeed. Whether we are on the government side or' not, at election times and certain other times we can easily select a certain road to spend a lot of money on. We do not want this type of thing to happen in the future. Whatever occurs has to be positive and we have to be able to select the areas of Australia that we want to see growing and assess what the States are recommending. I think there will be a proper cost-benefit assessment, because the Minister spoke about it in his second reading speech. My concern about the legislation, as I say, is whether the States will have their say. Under the legislation they will not. They will be sulted, I am sure, but we want to know that their cost-benefit assessment is taken into account. , All three transport systems-roads, rail and shipping-have to have more funds. It is shocking that today we cannot have a cheap, efficient shipping or rail service around Australia. I do not condemn in any way the formation of a national corporation between the Commonwealth and the States, with a national plan for rail. think it is a very important thing indeed. I would like to see a railway line from Alice Springs up to Darwin. From a national point of view we have to say these are the areas we want to develop. But the States have their fingers on the pulse and they are the ones we want to see consulted about it. I know that the Minister has the Pacific Highway in mind, because' a month or so ago he came up the highway-and we were very pleased to see him there. He knows the black spots there; he knows what is important. I do not know the traffic volume on any of the other roads mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech, but I doubt whether there would be any other highway of the nature of the Pacific Highway, which feeds the growing centres of Australia. Many people have died on the highway. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), spoke about 2,000 trucks a day on the Hume Highway. I am sure not many fewer than that travel on the Pacific Highway. Of a night-time people can strike eight, nine or 10 trucks behind each other, and the road is narrow and dangerous. But work is being done there. I am sorry in a way to see the arterial roads cut out. The Government will not finance the arterial roads directly any more. In the Port Stephens Shire Council area, which I mention in particular, and in the areas of the other councils within my electorate-which are well known to the Minister because he is near to themwe have arterial roads that are serving important primary producing areas and it will now be up to the State and the local councils to finance them. New South Wales has its 3 x 3 scheme. I hope the conMinister will not take too much money away from that. I always looked upon the State 3 x 3 scheme as providing a,dditional money to go into the roads of the State. We cannot forget the rural local roads or the urpan ones. They are all important to the future of Australia. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I always try to speak on road Bills. This is greater than a road Bill; it concerns road and rail, including safety aspects. Whilst II support the Bill, I am pleased we will move amendments which I am sure will improve the legislation.",97
213,Mr ROBERT BROWN,AND PETROL EXCISE REVENUE,"1 would like to express appreciation to the people who have participated in the debate on the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill and those people who, in their own party forums and elsewhere, have taken advantage of the opportunity to develop policy in these areas. As was indicated by the spokesman for the Government, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beaunderstood zley), the amendments which have proposed by the Opposition will not be accepted, not because there is anything inherently wrong with them but because they are not necessary-and the Opposiallow tion spokesman, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), knows that they (I) are not necessary. There has never been a piece of legislation brought before this Parliament which is as important and as significant in the development of an integrated land transport system as this piece of legislation. I acknowledge the efforts made by my predecessors in this area of responsibility, but we have now brought their efforts together. I appreciate the comments that were made by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan). He referred to (2) the fact that the Bill is giving attention to road and rail and also emphasised-and I appreciated this in particular-that we are bringing into that total integrated approach a level of attention to questions of safety that probably has not been given to legislation of this kind before. While I appreciate the contributions that have been made, I emphasise that, as I have said, this is the most important piece of legislation to integrate transport policy. The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) also indicated that the achievements demonstrated by this legislation represent improvements which probably have been pursued in a sense for over 100 years. We have now achieved them. When (3) we get this legislation operating we will be able to achieve some of benefits that have been indicated by the Industry Com-ission-an improvement of something like up to 3 per cent in gross domestic product. . I also want to acknowledge the contribution which has been made by officers of the Department of Transport and Communications, not only in advising me but also in putting a lot of this legislation time. together.",98

218,Mr LLOYD,STOCK CORPORATION,"ln this outrageous situation of having about 20 minutes in which to debate three separate pieces of legislation, all I can do is accept the inevitable, but I do so under protest. The Primary Industries and Energy Legof the trade itself. islation Amendment Bill is a collection of corrections of sloppy drafting by the Government with regard to nine separate pieces of legislation. It even includes final acceptance by the Government, with regard to two wheat industry Bills, of amendments we tried to move during the passage of the legislation and which rejected then, but which the Government has finally accepted now. The two more significant pieces of islation are the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Bill and the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Bill. At present time the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation has the power restrict the quantity of meat and livestock exported from Australia, to prohibit the export of meat and livestock to particular countries and administer meat quotas to a particular country where restrictions are, or in the opinion of the Corporation will be, imposed by either that country or Australia. The restriction of the export power to particular markets where it seems to be necessary has worked well in quite a number of markets. We must recognise the reality that we have limited quota access, controlled access, to quite a range of our important meat markets and, for that matter, some of the livestock markets as well. However, there has been concern that the live sheep trade to the Middle East has had some disastrous periods in its development because the Meat and Livestock Corporation has not had the power to include the live sheep trade to that part of the world within its export power umbrella. One will recall that we built up a live sheep trade to that area of up to seven million sheep, about half of which at one stage went to Saudi Arabia. By a combithe nation of circumstances, including the crisis and problems with Saudi Arabia and a number of other Gulf states, that trade had to be suspended to try to bring some order back into it after the rejection, for no logical reason that we could see at that time, of certain shiploads of sheep, with the consequent problems of the welfare of those animals and Following that suspension, the Meat and Livestock Corporation has been slowly rea building the trade. It has imposed two limitations, one of approximately one shipload a month, which will mean in the vicinity of 900,000 to one million sheep were exported to Saudi Arabia over the 12month period since the shipments were resumed, and a far tighter specification with regard to the age of the sheep and legcertain other quality requirements. Many people have said, 'That is what the the Saudi Arabians really wanted', that many years ago they declared that they to wanted young sheep and that they only wanted a certain number of sheep so that it did not put under threat the development of their own domestic industry. traders who have actually been controlling the live sheep exports may have believed that that would not be enforced-until such time as it was enforced. In the view of those people it was enforced because has been handled. we had not listened to what the Saudis really wanted. We have now been asked to protect the reconstruction of that trade. It is very important that that trade does continue to be rebuilt. I acknowledge that that very important. It appears at this stage that the new· requirements are slowly rebuild the numbers on a more controlled basis and ensure that those live sheep do meet those requirements, to the best of our understanding of what the market reket, quires. We have to acknowledge that the consuming country that has the right to determine what it will accept from Australia. At this stage some problems Does the requirement to have a better control of that reconstructed trade the Middle East need the universal extenformally sion, global extension or general extension of the export power to the Meat and Livetime, stock Corporation when, in the past, has accepted, and been quite successful with, the extension of the power as is required to. meet the particular circumwere stances of a market where some sort of control is required? Another example of the Government's inefficiency is that this Bill came into House of Representatives last Wednesday night. When the various sectors of the industry were contacted, they either said now? they knew nothing about it and were quite concerned about certain aspects of it, or that they were told bf it in passing in about two minutes of comments made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in a general meeting a couple of weeks ago. They had no idea that the legislation would be coming in this stage. During the day there has a gradual build-up of concerns by the ferent sectors of the industry about particthe ular parts of the legislation as they became aware of that legislation. They mainly came aware of the legislation because sent them copies of it or we rang them. The That shows how much communication and consultation the Government has had with the industry on this matter. I believe the Government deserves very severe criticism for the way in which this matter Having looked at what the Government is requesting, and, to a certain extent, having listened to industry, which is expressing what we believe to be legitimate concerns about aspects of it, we believe is the Government is going too far. It is giving the extension of general export to power when it really only intends to use it and needs to use it in relation to one form of export, that is, live sheep. I acknowledge that it is not just to one marbut potentially to a series of markets. it is In the past the Meat and Livestock Corporation has had those particular extensions as required and has managed them well, so why should something difdeveloped. ferent be required? As well as the extension of that export with power which would allow quotas to be put in place for live sleep, rather than the informal quotas of the present there will come the ability to sell it those quotas. Once again, that power of selling quotas is not specifically restricted to the live sheep situation for which we told it is intended. There is concern that this power is going to be granted now for the live sleep, so one might ask: What about those other export markets where the there are quotas, where that has not been enforced before and where there does not seem to be a need for it to be in place Finally, because of the way in which this legislation is being applied in general terms for a particular circumstance, and the questionable nature of selling of quotas, there should be a time limit on or a sunset clause in the legislation. It is our intention to move in committee-I notice at that there is provision in the guillotine been for the committee stage; we have five difminutes for committee after the end of general cognate debate on those Billsthree amendments which we believe meet be the requirements of the Australian Meat we and Livestock Corporation and the live sheep export industry to bring some control into that market by restricting the extended power of the Corporation to live sheep only, by restricting the ability to sell quotas, or those exports, only to the live sheep industry and by imposing a sunset provision, that is, a three-year termination, on both of those new requirements so that we ·can judge at that time whether it is a sensible and practical way of controlling this industry. There is no point in anybody saying that the Meat and Livestock Corporation does not have certain powers at present to control the trade. It can be argued that there are better ways of controlling the trade. That is why this Bill is appearing before us. It is wrong to say that it does not have any powers. It can cancel the licence of an exporter. That has happened. It is able to prohibit the export of meat and livestock to particular countries and then, by the relaxation of that, bring in a more orderly arrangement for it. The Meat and Livestock Corporation is not without a reasonable ability to control the situation. I acknowledge, however, that the Corporation would like to have that in a more specific form and in a way to formally control that rebuilding of the trade. If the Government is genuine in its desire to do that but without extending it unnecessarily in general terms for all exports and the potential to sell quotas on all exports, it would be wise to accept our amendments. If our amendments are not successful, we will be voting against the Bill.",100
219,Mr CAMPBELL,STOCK CORPORATION,"Kalgoorlie) (10.54)The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill 1990 is very much a machinery mechanism. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, the Corporation already has extensive powers. We are simply seeking the extension of those powers. I do not believe that the honourable member for Murray would reject that if put on the spot. The thing we have to look at here is what has happened in this industry. It has been said by the honourable member for Murray that the Government did not consult. The Government clearly consulted and clearly consulted at length with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC). This Bill will be very much what the AMLC is asking for. Mr Downer-What about the industry?",102
220,Mr CAMPBELL,STOCK CORPORATION,"One cannot go out and consult with the industry generally, because this industry is so fraught with shonks that to go out and talk to anyone of them would be to leave oneself very vulnerable indeed. It seems to me that quotas are a very sensible approach to this matter. I do not see why they should be limited to live sheep. Quotas are an attempt to gain some economic rent and people should realise that between the sale in Australia and the sale of a sheep for slaughter in Saudi Arabia about $100 is going somewhere. I think it is high time we had a share of that $100 because clearly it is quite exploitative. I do not see why some of these dealers should be getting those large amounts of money. We need to rebuild this market in an orderly way. What we saw was the collapse of this market. The Saudis were using some tactics which I would deplore. They were bringing into disrepute the good name of Australian live sheep with some quite spurious health claims when clearly what was at stake was the fact that our traders had ignored the Saudi desire to see an orderly establishment of its own industry. We need to rebuild that market with the confidence of the Saudis. It appears to me that the only way that can be done is through the provisions of the Bill and I would certainly support them. Once again we see primary industries reaping the whirlwind of some of those people that have set out to exploit them. To see this we need only cast our minds back to the beef substitution scandals that occurred some years ago. I might add that selling quotas seems to be a more equitable way of determining who gets the rights to some of these countries and having them dealt with on some other basis where favouritism could be contended and could even exist. In short, I support the legislation. In conclusion I would say that we need to be very cognisant of the needs of our customers. I believe one of the things we should look at is the Department of Primary Industries and Energy standards that are now required for meat exported from Australia. This is a legacy of the meat substitution scandals which today are inhibiting the sale of our mutton. I believe we could sell a lot more mutton on a bilateraJ . . we were to negotiate sales at sJandards whic we in Australia generally accept.",102
221,Mr DOWNER,STOCK CORPORATION,"1 strongly endorse the c mments of the Deputy Leader of the ational Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) a d support the amendments that he has ut forward. The legislation is clearly ai ed at the live sheep trade and not any other aspect of international trade that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) is involved in. I regard the legislation, as it is framed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), as nothing short of legislation which is unwise. In the words of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott)and I know he would want to be quoted on this-this legislation was introduced in indecent haste. There has not been proper consultation on and proper consideration of the legislation. It looks to us on this side of the House like legislation which was little more, in those well worn words, than a good idea at the time. First of all, as the Deputy Leader of the National Party has pointed out, the AMLC already has powers through its licensing authority to regulate exports of live sheep to Saudi Arabia. Secondly, the power that the AMLC has had up until now in relation to quotas relates to countries and places such as the European Community which impose quotas on the imports of Australian exports, in particular beef exports. But the fact is that Saudi Arabia is not proposing to impose quotas on exports of Australian live sheep. That is something which we in this House ought to think rather carefully about. Thirdly, as everybody knows, this Bill is effectively directed at Saudi Arabia. In terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rules, the Bill, as it is very carefully drafted, does not in a de jure sense contravene those rules, but in a de facto sense there is no doubt that the intention of its implementation is contrary to the spirit of GATT. The legislation introduces export quotas which are specifically directed at one particular market-that is, the market of Saudi Arabia-and I am absolutely certain that the Saudi Arabians will be sorry to see that the Government, off the top of its head, without proper consultation, without real consideration or discussion, has decided to introduce a Bill of that kind. Finally, as has been pointed out by a number of other people, this legislation sends quite the wrong policy signals to the rest of the world. We are in the last month, the last weeks, the last days, of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations as a country officially totally committed to the liberalisation of international trade and as a little country stuck at the bottom of the world with no. choice but to try to achieve a much freer internationally trading regime on a multilateral basis. Yet the Government,· off the top of its head, without true consideration, has decided to introduce some measure which will impose export quotas. We have pointed out privately and publicly to the Minister that the Government and the AMLC must try to rebuild personal ties with the Saudi Arabians, not rush around looking at old fashioned types of quotas, export controls and restrictions. The Government has to build up the personal relationship with the Saudi Arabians which existed during the FraserAnthony Government years ago. I do not say that as a party political comment. I will substantiate that comment with facts. In 1983 we exported 7.3 million live sheep. By 1989, that figure had plunged to 5.3 million. Of course, this year, the figure will have fallen sub.stantially below that. Interestingly enough, .the country which has been the great beneficiary of this decline in Australia's live sheep exports has been little old New Zealand across the Tasman. In the first six months of this year, New Zealand increased its live sheep exports by something like 100 per cent while ours have been declining. The reason they have been declining is through a breakdown in personal contact with the Saudi Arabians. The Government has taken the Saudi Arabian market completely for granted. There have been far too few personal contacts built up with the Saudi Arabians, and yet that is something that, in particular, Doug Anthony, when he was the Minister for Trade, spent a good deal of time doing. Markets differ; no two markets are exactly the same. One of the things we need to understand in relation to the Saudi Arabian market is that personal contact is vastly important. In the case of that market, there has been a breakdown in that personal contact. In conclusion, this legislation is simply superfluous. The Government is trying to skate around the hard decisions, the opportunities of sending emissaries to Saudi Arabia who already have long personal contacts with that country, and rebuilding the trade through that method. We have said to the Minister that we will very happily support any initiatives he might take to achieve that. We have no intention whatsoever-and we say this sincerely in the national interest-of making any party political points out of any missions that he may send to Saudi Arabia. Mr Campbell interjecting",103
222,Mr DOWNER,STOCK CORPORATION,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie should not judge us by his own standards. We will support any mission to Saudi Arabia which, for example, may include Doug Anthony, who has such a close relationship with those people, and we will regard it as nothing short of a bipartisan effort. But this kind of legislation is very disappointing, fluous and unwise.",104
223,Mr NEWELL,STOCK CORPORATION,"Richmond) (11.04)The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Bill 1990 and the facilitating the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill, before the House tonight make a number of important contributions to the meat and livestock industries. Firstly, the selling or otherwise establishment of quotas will give the industry more ability to regulate itself for the immediate good, not only of the industry but also of the whole of Australia. There is some evidence that the export market in live sheep to Saudi Arabia will benefit by a more rigorous system of marketing where numbers and quality of product can be more easily controlled. Certainly, one side effect of the introduction of quotas will be that producers will be able more easily to plan and control their own production and quality levels. The meat and livestock industry has had an important role to play in establishing export earnings for this nation. Certainly, while handing such important regulatory controls back to the industry through the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC), we will be helping to see that the industry continues to make that contribution in the future. I want to stress that the impost of charges likely to arise because of the selfregulation of the industry through the imposition of quotas will not fall heavily where the burden cannot be borne. I would like to endorse the comments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), when he addressed the Bill now before the House, that where windfall profits can be made it is only right that those who are able to obtain the quotas should pay a price commensurate with their profits and, through the open option of quotas, should return something to this industry. At the same time where the market will not stand it, the AMLC will have a discretion to allocate quotas without charge. The transfer of this power to the AMLC puts the decision making, which has commercial ramifications, back with the industry through its statutory board. This is super- to be commended. There may be some who would argue that a laissez-faire policy in regard to production and export is more satisfactory, as we have heard from Bill, Opposition members tonight. The experience in relation to the export of live sheep to Saudi Arabia has indicated that the trade may have suffered through too much quantity; that is, too many sheep on offer. The offering of quotas for sale will offer a way of dividing market shares which is both equitable and efficient. Where shares are sold as opposed to being allocated on a different basis, the Australian industry will benefit from what has been termed the economic rent which comes as a result of restricting supplies. The lifeblood of this nation will be in its exports and I believe this Government is to be commended for the way in which it is playing such a leading role in seeking to open up markets for our products overseas. At this stage I was going to say something about the attitudes of the National Party members and the political games they play in attempting to prey on the misfortune of the farming community at this time. They love to play up the crisis mentality. However, because of the lateness of the hour I will perhaps write letters to honourable members opposite instead. Question resolved in the affirmative.

"". (3) Page 3, after clause 8 add the following new clause: ""Cessation of operation of Act '9. This Act, unless sooner repealed, shall cease to be in force at the expiration of 3 years after the date of commencement of this Act.' "". Because of the shortness of time, I just refer to the amendments briefly. The first restricts the extension of the export power of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) to live sheep, because that is what they really want and we believe that that is all that is necessary. The second· amendment restricts the ability to sell the quotas imposed in relation to the live sheep trade just to the live sheep trade because, once again, we believe that that is what has been requested by the Meat and Livestock Corporation and that is all that should be necessary. The third amendment is moved because of the uncertainty in relation to the whole proposal and the quite considerable number of expressions of concern on particular aspects or implications of the Bill as it now stands in relation to certain sections of the industry. The third amendment refers to a new section 9 and to a three-year sunset clause for the extension that is in the Bill for the Meat and Livestock Corporation's export powers.",105
225,Mr TUCKEY,STOCK CORPORATION," Mr Deputy Chairman, I just wish to express my opposition both to the Bill and to the amendments. All I can see this doing is giving an individual the opportunity to be the sole buyer in - the marketplace of sheep. If the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) can explain to me that that is not so, I will change my position. I cannot see that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) in some way is going to improve the welfare of individual farmers. What I am saying is that this proposal says that, once someone has a monopoly for which he pays the AMLC, he can then go out into the saleyards and buy sheep at any old price. If that is not the situation, I would like to know how it is going to work. If the bid price at least was the price that they would pay the sheep grower, I could see a little bit of sensealthough I am not totally in favour of even that form of quota restriction. The problem with Australia at the moment is that we ket(p telling the world they cannot have our meat; they cannot have our wool. The only thing we seem to want to sell to the world is our wheatand we are not sure who is going to buy it. Unless that matter is resolved, I am not prepared to support this legislation or these amendments.",106
226,Mr KERIN,STOCK CORPORATION,"Werriwa-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (11.13)We will have to draw the three amendments out inasmuch as the Government is prepared to accept the sunset clause, which is amendment No.3. The Government is very reticent to accept the other two. Honourable members have already stated this is all about live sheep. In my second reading speech, I gave the appropriate qualifications. What this is all is adding to the armory of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) to cope with a situation that has been developing for quite some time-a situation in which it needs to have additional means of acting when the trade falls apart. In all sincerity, without any denigration of the Opposition, honourable members opposite are not fully aware of some of these matters and some of the problems that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation has found itself in. What this is really all about is protecting the AMLC from the hazard of being taken to court, because we have had that situation occur. The legislation is not directed at one particular market. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) was quite irresponsible in many of the words that he uttered. A lot of it was dangerous nonsense and overblown rhetoric. It is all right to quote the Uruguay Round, but that was stretching a pretty long bow. Saudi Arabia is not even in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, if he thinks it is all about Saudi Arabia and nothing else. As I have said, the main aim is to remove the hazard from the AMLC. As to discussion and consultation, there has actually been massive consultation with the live sheep trade to the extent that I even flew up to Sydney last Tuesday night, I think it was, and met with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the SheepI11eat Council of Australia. In terms of the points raised by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), quite frankly I have to say to the chamber that it is not professional of me to engage the honourable member on this issue because of matters that I think are really, for the sake of the live sheep trade, best not mentioned in this place. There was also mention of New Zealand increasing its share of the trade by 100 per cent. In that first ship 10,000 sheep died and the reality is that that country cannot supply the trade in the long haul. The Government must insist that we should keep the legislation as it is so worded and reject the Opposition's about amendments 1 and 2, but we will certainly accept 3.",106

I for one am not prepared' to support the legislation and I am not prepared recorded as voting if I have got to do that myself. But as far as I am concerned Opposition is not supporting this matter.

There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course",107
230,Mr ROCHER,T AXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The first thing I would like to note about these Bills is that they were introduced into the House at, or just after, 8 p.m. last Thursand day, the last sitting day last week, this the first sitting day this week. It goes without saying that neither the Opposition nor interested parties have had a chance to fully consider the provisions of either Bill. It should be equally apparent that we have not had an opportunity to with professionals and other interparties, people likely to be affected by these taxing measures, or indeed anyone with :whom we would normally make contact with a view to either representing their views where we can, or at least havto being the benefit of their advice. The other remarkable thing about these the Bills is that the Government does' not intend that debate on them in the House should be either well informed or well considered.. Nor does the Government want the advice of professionals, or those taxpayers likely to be affected, whether such advice might be helpful inmeet-ng the stated objectives of the proposals or otherwise. The simple truth is that in its blind arrogance the Government considers these measures to be already law and the deliberations of the House to be' a tedious formality. What we are seeing in effect is a joke of a government making a joke of parliament. Any doubts that the Minister for Science and Technology, (Mr Crean), who has carriage of the Bills-and I note he has not been ip the chamber for 'any of the debates on taxation today where I have led for the Opposition-might have the will and influence to restore some parliamentary relevance is well and truly dispelled. He no longer enjoys the benefit of any doubt. This relentless application of the guillotine might be in keeping with the way the Minister, as immediate past president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), is prepared to arrive, at decisions, let alone long forgotten consensus, but it is hardly the stuff of democrats, socialist or otherwise. This Taxation Laws Amendment (International Agreements) Bill 1990 deals with double taxation agreements made by Australia and each of the Governments of the People's Republic of China, Sri Lanka and Fiji. The Government'- deliberate act of effectively preventing discussion of the measures proposed might be interpreted as symbolic of the importance it attaches to both the agreements made in its name and the disdain that it has for the. three countries with which it has treated. Who can blame anyone for reaching. such a conclusion? It will certainly avoid the need for the Government to further explain its private, as distinct from its public, stance towards the Gov.ernment of Fiji. That,is probably just as well, given the inconsistent joke of a government that ours is. Given that each of the countries concemed is unlikely to approve significant investment in Australia in the foreseeable future, the benefits are more likely to weigh more heavily' in their favour than in ours, in the' sense that the People's Republic of China, Sri Lanka and Fiji will get first bite of the tax cherry. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1990 is a different proposition altogether. It contains multiple provisions to amend several principal Acts. Seventeen changes by way of amendments are contemplated, some more complex than others. It follows that in the view of the coalition some are more meritorious than others, regardless of the complexities. Briefly, the amendments embrace' the 'following changes: fringe benefits tax involving priority of access to child-care 'exemption, the financial impact of which' is said to be negligible. There is then the capital gains tax,. assets destroyed by natural disaster, in connection with which the '. financial impact is said to be small, but not quantified. '. . Changes to the capital gains tax on prin'cipal residence are also involveo, and the financial impac- is stated to be ,small but,imquantifiable. ' /, Eligible termination payments .are also affected, and the financial impact will be negligible. Concessions for personal superannuation contributions are included, the financial. impact of which will be a reduced amount paid to revenue of $J 45m next year. The introduction of a further provisional tax penalty is contemplated and the financial impact is said to be negligible, but that will not be so for all taxpayers. Certain. gifts will be included in .the list and bcc:omeexempt, the financial impact of which will be a. reduction of revenue of $17 5m in a' full year. Tax arrangements for armed forces personnel in the Gulf region are. also included, the financial impact of which will be a reduction to revenue of $850,000 per month. This provision is consistent with what has happened in times of conflict in the pa-t and one which paturally has the wholehearted support of the coalition. There are amendments relating to sex discrimination, the financial impact of which is expected to be less than $500,000 reduction in revenue for a full year. Finally, there are amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987, the financial impact of which is expected to be nil. The-hanges to capital gains tax requirements, which will give some relief to those who lose an asset acquired before 20 September 1985 due to a natural disaster, are overdue. It is a matter on which I· .have urged the Government to act for the past two to three years. It is therefore better late than never. One only hopes that it will· not reward the creative thinkallow:. ers amongst· the professional arsonists in our community. Insurance companies already suffer at the hands of those who ply that particular trade, without the revenue also making a contribution. In the event, it might be said to be all academic anyway. The Gov-rnment having driven down asset prices-property prices-to th- extent apparent these days, there are likely to be fewer capital gains than there 'will be capital losses. For all the posturing in this place on the capital gains tax and the coalition's alternative a speculative gains tax, the truth. is that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made 'darned sure that gains, capital or. otherwise, of any sort are much less likely. That is ,mQre or less confirmed by the fact that the financial impact of the amendment, we are told, will be :negligible. Another amendment remedies a ·most iniquitous provision under capital gains tax laws applicable to principal residence exemptions (PREs) .. After repeated entreaties from the Opposition over the past five years, the Treasurer has at last seen the light. It is now proposed to free principal residences from capital gains and losses provisions for an unlimited period, even if not lived in by the owner, under certain conditions. Unless a principal res': idence is used to produce income during the owner's absence, capital gains and losses will not apply upon the eventual sale of the residence. lfincome should be earned for periods in excess of six years in which the taxpayer continues to be absent, the PRE will not be available: . Another welcome change will be that it is no longer necessary for the taxpayer to reoccupy' the dwelling prior to disposal to qualify for the PRE. This suffers from the . same impediment as the previous concession for assets destroyed by natural disaster in·, that dwelling prices are so depressed that a hoped-for capital gain is nowadays more likely to be a capital loss. Amendment.s 'which deal with propose<;i changes. to elig;ble termination payments, and deemed excessive components of them,deseiv- more atttmtion than the Government's, . use of the guillotine will They will get'scant consideration in the House, as will some of the other provisions listed earlier. Changes determining superannuation. contributions by employees have to be ignored, as does the imposition of yet another penalty for provisional taxpayers. It is pertinent to note that the latter has attracted the wrath of judges because they may be caught in the net and have to pay provisional tax on their incomes for the first time. So might many members ,and senators and it serves us right. Members of the Caucus sit by of and allow the Executive to ram through legislation like this with hardly a murmur. They allowed Ministers to convert allowances into salary last year,' maximising their superaijnuation entitlements, in a trade-off for a salary increase for the back bench.",107
231,Mr SOMLYAY,T AXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,It's outrageous.,109
232,Mr ROCHER,T AXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It gets worse. That now facilitates a law, the one before us tonight, now proposed, which will see Ministers' exposure to provisional tax greatly reduced while members and senators on the back benches' bear the full burden. What is more, under self-assessment rules we may very well incur a stiff penalty if we underestimate deductions to be made by the departments Of the House in our case or the Senate in the other. As I said, it serves us jolly well right. If it is good enough for others it is good eriough for us. Only the Ministers have escaped their full share of the impost. Who are the tax avoide'rs now? We have seen what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has. managed to do with the travel allowance and his spurious claim for it amounting to some $23,000 or $24,000 per annum tax free. We know of some advantages enjoyed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) some time ago. Who are the tax avoiders? They seem to be concentrated in the Ministry. Mr Martin-What about Charlie Blunt? What has he done?",109
233,Mr ROCHER,T AXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Macarthur mentions the former Leader of the National Party-very interesting. He could also mention the amount in excess of $1 m that he and Government members along the back' bench, a whole murder of crows along the back bench, took illegally prior to the election, during the election period, and have not had the decency to offer back despite the decision of the High Court. Mr Martin-What about the 24 on 'your side?",110
234,Mr ROCHER,T AXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Well, there we go. We have only three of that murder of back bench crows in here to object and to croak and they mention a former Leader of the National Party. He is still something like three-quarters of a million dollars behind the fiddle Government members perpetrated and they should not ever forget it. I have enjoyed this. Mr Crean-That was over only two weekends.",110
235,Mr ROCHER,T AXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It does not take long if you really try. Government members probably did it in a shorter time. What is more, they spent it in advance. They got the message from the Ministry on their fiddle on postage allowances and, as I say, collectively they are still three-quarters a million dollars in front of Mr Charles Blunt. The Government has brought the chopper down again. It is tedious to be forced to come before the House on behalf of the Opposition without having been able to prepare for it. I do not think honourable members on the Government side would accuse me of not preparing; they might not always agree with, the .conclusions I reach, but they cannot say I do not prepare on these matters. The simple absence of preparation is because there has been absolutely no opportunity to consult people outside the Parliament, to obtain their views, and generally to have the benefit of the wisdom of others outside the bureaucracy. I regret that state of affairs very much, but this curtailment of debate is, as I say, symptomatic of this Government; it is symptomatic of its arrogance, it is symbolic of its tiredness, its inability to come to grips with the responsibilities of government. That is becoming more and more apparent each day. That would be, no doubt, one of the reasons why the Government has decided that this year, 1990, the Parliament will sit for the shortest number of sitting days in our history, with one exception in the 1930s.",110
236,Mr MARTIN,T AXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is with pleasure that we do a re-run on these taxation Bills with the same group of speakers on both sides of the House by the look of things. Tonight we are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment (International Agreements) Bill 1990 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1990. I will make a few comments on each Bill because I think it is very easy to gloss over some of the notions contained in the legislation and to suggest, as the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) did, that legislation is being rammed through without the opportunity for consultation and so on. I turn, firstly, to the Taxation Laws Amendment (International Agreements) Bill 1990. The purpose of this Bill is to provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and China, Australia and Sri Lanka and Ausof tralia and Fiji. In terms of consultation it is interesting to note that the agreements with China, Sri Lanka and Fiji were signed on 17 November 1988, 18 December 1989 and 15 October 1990,respectively. One would have thought that would have been enough time to consult on double taxation agreements to' get it right, and that is exactly what has happened here. It is also interesting, to look at the ramifications and the reasons behind the imposition of these sorts of treaties. Although. I do not think his choice of example was particularly appropriate, the honourable member for Curtin alluded 'to the fact that in the past there has been an opportunity for people, because of the use of countries with which Australia does not have double tax treaties, in some way to arrange their ·affairs so that tax is avoided and evaded in this country. The imposition of double tax treaties ensures that fair tax regimes apply l;>etween Australia and the country with which the tax treaties are put in place. Members of this place who have followed very carefully the revelations that have come through various committee studies on tax haven usage by parts of Australia would know a great deal about tax havens, their use and how double tax treaties are, in some way, an opportunity to overcome that. Suffice to say there is plenty of reading around on that issue. I advise those members who have an interest in this matter to refer to a couple of the committee reports of the last Parliament-we are continuing with them-because they provide some very interesting reading. As the name suggests, the double taxation agreements are designed to avoid double taxation of income flowing between Australia and the respective treaty partners and to prevent fiscal evasion of tax covered by the agreements. Under the terms of the agreements, income from real property may be taxed in full'by the country in which the property is situated; ness profits are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the recipient unless they are derived by a resident of one country through a branch or other permanent establishment in the other country; profits from the international operations of ships and aircraft are generally taxed only in the country of residence of the operator; dividends, interest and royalties may be taxed in the country of source, but there are general limits on the tax that the source country may charge on such income flowing to residents of the other country, and so on. The provisions are extensive, but go right to' the heart of the need for double tax treaties between Australia and the countries so mentioned in this legislation. It is appropriate, timely and simply the next step in the Government's negotiations of double tax treaties with quite a number of countries around the world, allowing for the Government's proposed legislation which is in the other House for debate on foreign tax source income. I understand that the measures included within this legislation are accounted for in that legislation as well. As I indicated, the second Bill makes a number of alterations under the broad banner of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1990. Suffice it to say that it gives effect to announcements made in the 1989 Budget. Again, the period for consultation has been lengthy and has certainly given the Government the opportunity to talk to those people who would be affected by the proposals contained in this legislation and indeed to get the legislation correct. It also brings into law some changes announced in June this year particularly to increase the level of tax deductions for personal superannuation contributions made by people who do not receive superannuation support from anyone else, and will introduce a new tax rebate for certain taxpayers with only small amounts of superannuation support from another person. Interestingly, on a day such as today, when we have seen two of Australia's naval vessels sailing to exercises off Jervis Bay on the south coast prior to going to busithe Middle East, we find that this Bill also exempts from tax the pay allowance of Defence Force personnel in operational service in response to the invasion of Kuwait'by Iraq. Again, the legislation is most timely and most welcome. I was pleased to see that the honourable member for Curtin indicated quite categorically and quite clearly the support by the Opposition members of this part of the legislation. There are a number of other specific provisions contained within this omnibus Bill, including amendments to the gift provisions of income tax law and in relation to the taxation of eligible termination payments and capital gains it proposed. There is' an exemption from fringe benefits tax payments made by employers to commercial child-care centres to secure priority of access for children of employees. Again 1 applaud that part of the legislation. There is one specific element that 1 would like to go to before concluding my comments tonight, and that is in respect of the capital gains tax amendments that are proposed here. We see that the Bill will modify the capital gains tax rules in two respects. Firstly, it will allow roll-over relief where an original asset is destroyed as a result of a natural disaster and give effect to the 1990 Budget announcement to extend the principal residence exemption during a taxpayer's natural absence. The reason that this is quite appropriate is that it is in response to the Newcastle earthquake. What we saw in that devastation and horrendous set of events was that escalating building costs have resulted in some difficulties for taxpayers in replacing destroyed assets within the terms of the existing limitation. I am sure that all members of this place would have seen and would recall with horror the ramifications of that earthquake-and not only in terms of the death of people in a country such as ours that generally does not suffer greatly in terms of property loss and certainly human loss. We would all think that any measures to improve the lot of people in Newcastle in rebuilding their lives should be applauded. To that extent this part of the legislation is certainly· timely. It shows compassion, which the Government demonstrates time and time again. I am pleased that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), in his capacity as Minister Assisting the Treasurer, is aware of the needs of people in circumstances such as natural disasters, as was typified in the Newcastle experience, and has made the appropriate recommendations and included within the legislation before this House appropriate measures to redress that. On the whole, 1 believe that what is included within both Bills is appropriate, is timely and goes to the heart of the Government's attempt to tidy up the tax legislation, which is in constant need of repair. As someone who has taken an interest in this, not only through the House itself but also in the. parliamentary committee system, 1I have to say that time and time again recommendations come before this place on the need to improve the tax legislation, to tidy it up, to make it simple, to reduce its complexity and to reduce it in volume. Pieces of legislation such as this again demonstrate that that is not an easy task. 1 commend the legislation to the House and look forward to . its speedy passage.",110
237,Mr WILSON,T AXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"1, too, want to take part in this debate. 1 want to touch on two aspects of the legislation now under consideration. The first 1 will deal with very briefly. As the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) pointed out, this - egislation does increase the amount which individuals can deduct for tax purposes in respect of the contributions they make to superannuation funds. That is a good thing. It enables people who are self-employed or not otherwise covered by a superannuation scheme to make a more appropriate level of retirement income provision. The concern I wish to express, however, is that the inadequacy of the long term controls and assurances and the tax revenue forgone on those savings will in fact result in people having savings to provide them either with a stream of income in retirement or the capital from which they will derive a stream of income. The superannuation arrangements that currently exist in this country are and remain wide open to double dipping. People can claim substantial tax relief for making savings. They can make their retirement earlier than the pensionable retirement age, draw down on their savings, rearrange their investments, reach the pensionable age and take a pension as well. 1 do not believe that this country can sustain the level of double dipping that currently is implicit in the arrangements that exist today. 1 hope that it will not be too long before governments and all those interested in providing people with adequate levels of income in retirement look at the implications of this double dipping and change the laws to ensure that every Australian is entitled to the same amount of public support-support either in the form of tax deductions, tax relief on their retirement income provisions or in the form of the age pension paid through the social security syst-m, but not both. I would like to develop that at greater length but time does not permit me to do so tonight. I also want to touch on the legislation that deals with our double tax agreements. This legislation enacts three double tax agreements. This country has formed a model agreement which we are re-enacting and re-enacting without in any way considering its appropriateness. Double tax agreements are designed to eliminate double taxation. But they are also designed to .ensure a fair .and proper allocation of taxes between treaty partners. They are designed to encourage trade and investment between states and to prevent international tax avoidance or evasion. There are a number of tax agreements that we could have opted for. We have chosen to opt for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) model tax agreement which was drawn up in 1977. We became a member of the OECD in 1971. We have blindly followed that model tax agreement. We let the senior members of the OECD draft the agreement. But the senior members of the OECD were and are in the main net lenders of capital, not net borrowers of capital. The agreement that the OECD uses is heavily biased in favour of net lender countries and biased against borrower countries. I quote from a book written by David R. Davies where, under the heading 'Principles of international double taxation relief, he said: Special problems arise where a double tax is concluded between developed and developing countries. In particular, the principle giving the primary right of taxation to the state of on which the DEeD model is based operates very much in favour of developed capital exporting countries and to the consequent detriment of the developing countries which are net importers of foreign investment. We might be a developed country, but we are a net importer of substantial amounts of foreign investment. We would have done better and served our people better if we had followed the United Nations model. The model agreement gives the primary but not the exclusive right to tax to the State of the source of the income. The United States has even varied its adaptation of the OECD agreement. It has done it by variations which are· as . follows: it taxes on the basis of citizenship in addition to residence; it stops tax treaty shopping by third party residents using the US to minimise their tax burden-we do not do that; and it has an arrangement which is different from ours where interest is reciprocally exempt under the US model. In all three agreements that are before us tonight, we have an upper limit on the withholding tax on interest. Why? Let us turn to the explanatory notes for the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 5 provided by the Minister and issued by the Australian Taxation Office. The article requires the country of source of interest income to generally limit its tax to 10 per cent of the gross amount of interest where a resident of the other country is the beneficial owner of the interest. We justify that on the ground that we have a domestic law which sets 10 per cent at the withholding tax. I would have thought that we would not want to lock ourselves into a 10 per cent withholding tax and we would do as a number of other count-ries already do. A country like Canada has the flexibility of setting the rate higher at, say, 15 per cent. Personally, I believe that the upper limit should be much higher. It should be closer to the corporate rate. I think that we should consider changing the law so that the withholding tax is not a final tax. treaty It should be taken out, but it might be better in the case of many payments, particularly in the case of non-treaty counresidence tries, for it to be a tax subject to assessment. Then we could determine whether it was fair to us, to our revenue and to our citizens. At the present time, we assume that everyone who receives interest income from Australia has 10 per cent withholding tax'deducted from it and will pay tax in their countries under tax regimes similar to our own. But there are many countries with whom we have no treaties where we know that there are tax regimes very different from our own. The exchequers and treasuries of many countries with which we do have treaties gain greatly from the fact that we charge only 10 per cent, but the end taxpayer is paying in the order of 35c in the dollar. If one looks at the end taxpayer who gains the benefit of the taxed credit of the withholding tax, we are getting lOc in the dollar, other tax regimes are getting 25c in the dollar and we are a net borrower country. As I mentioned earlier this evening in another debate, although the agreements specify that the tax shall be based on the gross income that is paid, I wonder how thoroughly the Tax Office is ensuring that the financial institutions which in the main pay the withholding tax on behalf investors are looking behind those agreements to ensure that there is not a sidekick arrangement under which· the borrower has to pay the Australian withholding tax. I wonder whether the Australian Taxation Office is just relying on the basis of the loan agreement, which says that the rate of interest will be 15 per moved forthwith. cent, 17 per cent of whatever it might be, then ignoring the fact that on top of that the borrower is having to pay the lender's third time. liability for the tax. If that is the case, of course, the cost of money to Australians is much higher than the nominal rates of interest would suggest. It is timely and proper that those. high rates of interest should be clearly exposed so that the Australian community can understand that we are not only payAct 1988. ing by way of interest the charges that are made for the borrowing of the money; on top of that, our borrowers are having to pay the tax which should be coming as tax from the foreign investor in this country. As I have said on other occasions, unfortunate that we go on time and time 1990: again signing these agreements without in any way reviewing the principles upon which they are based. I urge the Minister to ask his officials to look at the fundamentals and the principles of this form of agreement upon which we are legislating again. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)- Order!

' The following answers to questions were circulated: Light Horse Regiment (Question No. 199) Mr Riggall asked the Minister representing the 'Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 September 1990: (1) Is the 4119 Prince of Wales's Light Horse Regiment based in Traralgon, Sale and Bairnsdale,Victoria, being disbanded; if so, in view of the fact that the unit is about to be awarded a Presidential Unit Citation by US President Bush for its services in Vietnam, will the Minister reconsider the decision. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 4thll9th Prince of Wales's Light Horse Regiment is not being disbanded but is to have the 8thl13th Victorian Mounted Rifles combined with it. The United States award, to which the Honourable Member refers, is not a Presidential Unit Citation awarded by President Bush. It is the United States Army Meritorious Unit Commendation, which is an award approved by the Secretary of the Army. Neither the 4thl19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse Regiment as a unit, nor any of its sub-units would qualify for the award. The reason for this is that when the 1st Armoured Personnel Carrier Troop was raised in Vietnam in August 1965 it was comprised of personnel from the Regular Squadron of the 4thl19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse Regiment who were serving in Vietnam, not as part of the Regiment, or a sub-unit of the Regiment, but as a Royal Australian Armoured Corps Detachment on the establishment of the Australian Logistic Support Company. The offer of the award to Australian Army elements attached to the United States 173rd Airborne Brigade has only recently been received by Army. As is normal practice with foreign awards, the offer will be referred to the Governor General for his consideration.
