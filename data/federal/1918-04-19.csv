3,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to a statement in the Herald of the 16th A p r i l last dealing with the work of the Maitland mine. The officers of the Victorian Mines Department there point out, among other things, that, so far as the Department could say, the contract with Messrs. J . and A . Brown had not been signed. The Victorian Government, they add, is supplying, voluntary labour for the Richmond Main mine. Will the right honourable gentleman make representations to the Victorian Government, in view of the crisis through which we are passing, and the fact that a large number of miners in the district are unemployed, as to the in advisability of sending men from Victoria until work has been found for those on the spot?",20
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member may rely upon it that every consideration will be given to the trouble connected with the Newcastle mines. The voluntary labour question is only one phase of the general victimization question ; and' I hope that, as the result of the Conference now taking place elsewhere, matters will soon be cleared up in a way that will be satisfactory to all concerned.

5,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"It is now nearly PAPER. twelve months since the Customs tug Nyora was lost with all but two of her complement, but the compensation due to the dependants of those who oerished has not yet been paid. Will the Minister be good enough to take the steps necessary to have these payments made, because it is hard on widows and children to be keot waiting for money while legal technicalities are being settled ?",20
6,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The matter has been before me on two or three occasions. A part payment haa been made to the widows concerned, but there are legal technicalities of which I hope a. settlement will soon be come to. MINISTER FOR DEFENCE . STATEMENT ABOUT MR . CATTS RESIGNATON.",20
7,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to the statement made by Senator Pearce, which appears on page 3709 of the Hansard reports for this session. Referring to a speech made by me, he saidAs I have already stated, he was quoting from a pro-German journal published in America before the United States entered the war. In fairness-to me, Senator Pearce should name the publication to which he refers, and indicate the source of the quotation. I believe his remark to be a wanton misrepresentation, and if he cannot substantiate i the should withdraw it .",20

In view of the statement of Ministers here that it would be dangerous to remove from office our present Minister for Defence, I ask: Is the Empire endangered by the resignation of Lord Derby ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not know that it has been suggested from this side that it would be dangerous to remove any Minister. My own view is that, if a M in ister can be spared, he must be spared. As to the position of the British Empire, that is a matter on which Lord Derby, perhaps,-might be consulted. PRI CE OF COMMODITIES.

Is it & fact that the Australian Government is making to the dependants of the conscripted Italians the allowance of Is. 5d. per day, with 4 i d . for each child ?

39,Mr MATHEWS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Does not the Minister think that he could let us have the day for a talk about postal grievances ?,24
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,The circumstances are altogether unprecedented and peculiar in every way. I am not suggesting this in order to suit the convenience of Ministers. I am doing it because a Recruiting Conference,24

47,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Yes , and Minister was there twice, and would not stay when they wanted him to do so",24
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,That is not true. It is an infamous statement to make.,24
49,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,It is not infamous.,24
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"It is not only infamous, it is also untrue, and only one with a malicious mind would make it .",24

53,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Why did the Minister tell us of this before ?,24
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"I did not tell honourable members earlier because the matter was not decided u n t i l 6.30 o'clock last evening, and it was only then decided upon because of the insistence of the State Premiers that the Conference should come to a conclusion today. order that both Leaders of this House might be at the Conference to enable it to finish its work today that we are taking this course.

57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"The House could go on with business; but let the honourable member note the first item of business-rth e discussion of the Ministerial statement. The Leader of the Opposition is to be the first speaker, and in the natural order of things the Prime Minister would reply to him. As both these gentlemen will be absent at the Conference, honourable members will see the in convenience of proceeding with a debate of that kind .",24
58,Mr TUDOR,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"The suggestion has been made that the House should proceed to discuss private members' business. the Prime Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I would first need to have an adjournment to look at - the private members' business on the notice-paper. In order to compensate for the loss of a day's sitting, we can meet on Tuesday afternoon instead of Wednesday afternoon.",24
59,Mr MAHONY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"AV e could not get away in time to attend on Tuesday, especially seeing that we lost the opportunity of leaving for our States yesterday afternoon.",24
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"A little time ago the House met every Tuesday afternoon, and I was responsible for altering the day of meeting to Wednesday. My suggestion is that we"" should meet a day earlier for one week only.

70,Mr JH CATTS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D," sibility on that score, because I am here everv day to do the country's business, if the Government will Tjermit me, and I made no suggestion that the House should not meet on Tuesday. . The fact that the'Government have no business to with farming interests. place before us - orable members tell the farmers that A Ministerial statement has been made, with a motion that it be printed, in order to provide an opportunity for discussion; not, and it is only reasonable, seeing that xhe Leader of the Opposition is engaged elsewhere, fhat that debate should be adjourned. But we understood that I we were called together to deal with legislation. Where is the Bill of the Assistant Minister for Defence? I can only suppose that it is not ready. Where is the new Electoral Bill , or the promised industrial measure? We on this do not desire any of these measures, because we do not think they are likely to be of any good. From statements I have seen, I am quite satisfied that they are mere party measures, designed to take advantage of the country and of the soldiers in the trenches. At the same time, if there is business to do we might as well face the music. The Government is in exactly the same position as it was when it met Parsugliament' on the last occasion. ' 'The Opposition were not then prepared debate the Address-in-Reply for on end, and it was found that the Government had no business of. a n j kind to go on with . Having no business its own to advance the interests of either Australia or of the Empire as a whole, in the war, the Government refuses any body else an opportunity to do anyThe business-paper is chock full of to notices of motions by private members on both sides. There are no fewer than t h i r t y motions dealing with important subt - jects ; and when the Government have no of its own an opportunity t it should be provided for private memt o deal with proposals, many of which have been on the paper for months. The Government insists upon adjournments time after time, and because the business on the paper is not a particular kind of business the little private despots dein the Cabinet desire, every means at their disposal is taken to prevent anyI take no responthing being done. I have over and over again referred to those honourable members opposite who claim to specially represent the farmers; and I remind them that there are i mis portant motions on the paper dealing Those hononly they can adequately represent them; and yet, by agreement together, they use the tyranny of their majority to suppress. Parliament, and thus delay the consideration of much that is vital and of urgent importance to the farmers' interests. Every honourable member with a notice on the business paper who agrees to the proposed adjournment agrees to closing his own mouth. The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) has a motion dealing with the question of decimal coinage, and I ask whether he is in earnest, or whether that motion is merely there as a placard. We find him cheering the Government's proposal to adjourn for a whole day on which he could have dealt with that motion, which is the first on the paper. If he is sincere, he must have prepared information of use to the country, and presumably he has reasons which would weigh with the Government. The next notice of motion is one by myself dealing with a W a r Precautions Regulation which has stirred up sectarianism and created irritation and dissension from one end of Australia to the other. This regulation was suggested by a little handful of bigots in this country, and is certainly a fit subject for consideration by Parliament. The Prime Minister, with his strong feelings and his lack of judgment, has over and over again created discord throughout. the country; and surely there ought to be some check exercised by Parliament. Y e t honourable members opposite insist on an adjournment, and refuse to afford any opportunity for reviewing a matter of this importance. The next notice of motion deals with the conscription of certain citizens of Australia; and surely that would bear discussion? Are honourable members prepared to simply accept the ipse dixi t of one or two men? As to the liberty and freedom of Parliament, honourable members seem prepared to make themselves slaves. On the business-paper there numerous proposals to disallow or repeal War Precautions regulations. Under the law, a regulation must be laid on the table within so many days of our assembling, and within a certain period a motion may be moved to disallow it . Surely the corollary of this is that an opportunity should be given to discuss a motion to disallow any such regulation ? But the laws of the country . are being broken by this refusal to give an opportunity for the consideration of such matters. It is asserted that if there be a majority in the House of opinion that any of these matters should be discussed, there is perfect freedom to submit a motion and insist on a discussion. We know, however, that in practice this ie not so. Honourable members opposite, within the last few days, have told us that a motion submitted by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) met with their entire approval,, but because the Government treated it as one of no-confidence, they voted against it . - Mr SPEAKER - It is not in order to. discuss a vote of the House.",25
71,Mr JH CATTS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"The honourable member for Calare expressed one opinion the other day, and voted in the opposite direction. ",26
72,Mr JH CATTS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,You gave reasons galore! ',26
73,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,The main reason was self-preservation.,26
74,Mr JH CATTS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,It was cowardice.,26
75,Mr SAMPSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Is it parliamentary to say that an honourable member is guilty of cowardice?,26
76,Mr SPEAKER,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Certainl y not. If the honourable member for Cook made such a statement, I ask him to withdraw it.",26
77,Mr JH CATTS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"What I mean is that to speak in favour of a certain course, and to vote against it , because the Government crack the whip, is moral cowardice; and if that is out of order, of course I withdraw it . I have beard the honourable mem ing about the farmers as though he were invested with some kin d of divine right to plead on their behalf. This morning w heard something from e him about the supply of cornsacks-abou t the farmers having been guaranteed a are supply at a reasonable rate of 8s. or 9s. a N dozen, while they are now being charged 13s. The honourable member knows that the farmers are being robbed, and to move a motion insisting on justice being done would be in accordance with his opinion; but he would not be allowed to move one because the Government would crack the whip. It requires a l it t l e more than ordinary courage to proceed under such circumstances. Has the honourable member a motion on the notice-paper ? ",26
78,Mr JH CATTS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Then why does uot give notice of one?  without it .,27
79,Mr JH CATTS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"The honourable member makes a few weak statements of which he knows the Government will take no notice. And who would take notice of an honourable member whom a few short words will cause to sink back and hold his tongue? That sort of conduct in Parliament gains no justice for the persons who are suffering in justice. It is about time the farmers in Calare were made to understand that they are beiug fooled. The honourable member for Calare tickles the constituents with stories about the things he will do, but when he oomes to Parliaholding ment he merely asks a few questions, sends out to the farmers proof copies the replies, and they say at once, "" What a wonderful man he is."" But when give the honourable member an opporamongst tunity of firing something more than a blank cartridge, when we provide h i with a lever that will enable him to get something substantial for his constituents, he stops short.  the farmers in six months than the honorthis able member has done for them in a lifeness of the House? time.",27

82,Mr JH CATTS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Le t not the honable orable member tempt me too far , or may accept his challenge, and that would be a bad thing for him.",27
83,Mr SPEAKER,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Order ! This discussion between honourable members is out of order.,27
84,Mr JH CATTS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"The honourable he member for Calare may think that he is playing an heroic rdle when he asks me If there is a man on the Government side of the House, either the Prime Minister or anybody else, who' will resign his seat aud contest my electorate, I am prepared to challenge him at any time he chooses.",27
85,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,That challenge is pretty safe.,27

94,Mr HIGGS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Capricornia) [11.55] - I wish to bring under the notice of the House a very important matter in conhonorable nexion with the censorship. In my the censorship is used in a very unfair and unwise manner. I support the Defence Department and the Censors entirely in suppressing any information that is calculated to be of advantage to the enemy. But I think we ought to be permitted to discuss matters which cannot assist the enemy, but will lead to the better conduct of the war. Recently I wrote to notices the Censor and asked him whether I was permitted to discuss in the public press the restriction of the export of greasy and member scoured wool to Japan.",28
95,Mr BRENNAN,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,I do not think the honourable member should put himself in such a position of abject humility. It is bad that we should be subject to the Censor in that way.,28

Fortunately, we are able to speak here that which we think But within these are_ four walls only is a man free to give expression to his views. Anywhere else Australia, outside the parliamentary building, he is subject to milipri-"" tary interference, and may be brought Yesterday before the Court and fined so frequently Very few can afford to risk those prosecutions. wish to discuss the matter of the restric-' tion of the export of wool to Japan. I previously stated, and I believe it to true, that somebody, acting in the in terests of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, in - and Weaving Company, whose operations . have been under discussion recently, has prevented Japan from getting greasy and Shortly after I made a speech, in January last on this question,the censors sent to the newspapers an instruction preventingthem from publishing any reference to the restrictions on the export of greasy and scoured wool to Japan. In reply to the letter I wrote to the Censor recently, I received this cdmmunication, No. O.A. 24,116: Department of Defence, Melbourne, 18th, April, 191S. Dear Sir,-Wit h reference to your letter dated 17th April, 1918, I regret to have to inform you that publication of matter with reference to the restriction of export of wool to Japan is not permitted. Yours faithfully, G. G. MCCoix, Colonel, Japan is a great All y , and has rendered splendid assistance to the British Empire during this war. We ought to be able to speak our mind regarding any maladministration on the part of the Government which is 'detrimental to our Allies. I quite agree that we should not make any statement calculated to hurt the feelings of Japan. But if the perial Government have been induced by somebody in Australia to prevent Japan buying raw materials from this country, we ought to know the reason. that is a matter that ought to be discussed. There is in some quarters in Japan a feeling hostile to this country. of the Japanese people are of opinion that we are opposed to them on racial grounds, and they resent that very much. They will not resent our attitude if they know that our objections to their competition is on economic grounds. And some time ago, I suggested to the House that we might reasonably ask Japanese representatives to visit our factories and learn first hand the t r u th as to the hours of labour and the wages of the workers, and then ask themselves whether they were entitled to send goods to Australia, subject only to a low rate of duty. The Japanese representatives who come here would take the view that we were entitled, in view of the better conditions of our workpeople here, to ask for a high protective import duty, but this is another question, relating to the supply of our raw materials to Japan, an All y . Surely the members of the House ought to be permitted to show the public of Australia, and the people of Japan, that our Government, so far as they are reMr Higgs. sponsible for the restriction of the export of greasy and scoured wool to Japan, are misrepresenting public opinion in Australia. When we allow the British or Australian Government to prevent the Japanese from getting our raw materials, we are allowing something which is calculated to create a great deal of misunderstanding between Japan and ourselves. I am glad the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), who is a member of the Central Wool Committee, is , present, for I am sure he will see my point. We do not want to give any friendly nation a real grievance. Anything Deputy Chief Censor. any member of the House may say about Japan will have very little influence, because there are men in the Japanese Diet who attack Great Britain and Australia, but that does not make any difference to the majority of the statesmen and people of Japan, who desire to be on friendly terms with us. The Japanese are not likely to take much notice of any .'individual member, but arecertainly , likely I m - to take a great deal of notice of what amounts to an interference with their trade and industry. - I appeal to the members of the Surely Win-the-war party to use their in fluence with the Government to allow greater freedom of public discussion in the press on these matters. If the Some House permitted itself to be guided by the Prime Minister, no discussion would be allowed in the House at all. The Prime Minister said he would suppress Hansard. He has such distorted views that it is fortunate for us that the majority of'his party do not agree with him in that regard, and do not' desire to prevent any member giving expressipn to his convictions in the House so long as he does so in parliamentary language, and in accordance with the Standing Orders. Here is documentary evidence that the censors have been instructed, either by the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence, not to permit in the public press any discussion of the restriction of wool export to Japan, which is a grievous wrong, and calculated to - bring about a misunderstanding with a country with which we all desire to be friendly.",28
97,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Illawarra) [ 1 2 . 4 ] - I cannot congratulate the honourable member for Capricornia on the dignity with which he wears the mantle of the honourable member f br Parkes (Mr . Bruce Smith) as the champion of the Eastern races. Indeed, the most interesting feature of recent debates here to me has been the suddenness with which honourable members of the Opposition have changed their attitude on various matters. The honourable member for Cook ' (Mr J . H . Catts), representing the Newtown Bridge farmers, would move one to tears in the defence of high prices for wheat, when only a few years ago his main political platform was that the unhappy electors of Cook were being charged so high a price for bread that it reduced their earnings, and that the real object of the party in Parliament should be to obtain cheap food for the people. We listened, also, to remarks from the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) lately upon the low prices of the people's meat foods-rabbits . Then we had the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls) descanting upon the low price of wheat, and the necessity of raising the price of bread to the people of the cities. The party that once represented the great - mass of the people is now busily occupied in pretending to advocate the interests of those sections of the community which hitherto they have condemned, and which it was their chief object to represent this party as being formed to protect - Honourable members on this side of the House, who used to be charged with protecting the interests of squatters, farmers, meat raisers, and other producers, at the expense of the country, are now charged by the very same men with neglecting the vital interests of these people, and allowing wheat, meat, and other things to be cheap that would be made dearer if the pretended advice of these gentlemen was listened to. On this proposal for adjournment the same pretence is made of an intense desire to get on with the business of the country. When the question of recruiting comes up we have the same pretence, that honourable members on the other side are intensely interested in getting more recruits. To-day the most important gathering of public men in Australia is continuing its sittings at Government House in the endeavour to find some method to get men to the colours, and is faced with the position that its labours must be brought to an «arly conclusion. In order to help this the Government have been asked to make such arrangements of the business of this Parliament as will enable the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Government to attend the Conference today. One would expect that such a proposal would be received without opposition by every person who desires to see some good come from the Conference, but the moment it is mentioned in the House members of the Opposition attack it in the same way as they do any proposal for compulsory service in Australia. The man who does anything in any way to help recruiting seems to incur the bitter hostility of some honourable members opposite, and even the Leader of the Opposition is not able to exercise sufficient control over his followers to enable effect to be given to an arrangement which he himself has made with the Government. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) said I had the first business on the paper if private members' business was brought forward today. I should be very glad of the opportunity, but to me the most important thing pending here is what is happening at Government House. ' I have little zest for any business in this Parliament u n t i l some way can be shown to take a more effective part than we are doing in the conduct of. the war. I also feel it is an absolute waste of time, just as the last week has been wasted, to discuss these matters of internal control here if we are unable to secure such a result in the centre of war as will entitle these institutions to remain in this country at all . While our minds are turned in that direction, honourable members are not able to give to these minor matters the attention that under other conditions they would give. I have no desire to proceed with the business on the paper in the absence of the party leaders from Parliament today. The utter hollowness of this pretence is shown in the attitude of honourable members themselves. When the Leader of the Government proposed .to make up for today's inactivity by alloting another day next week, a storm of opposition came from those honourable members who, the next, moment, were condemning the Government for not getting on with the business. The men who want an opportunity to discuss. the proposals to be placed before the I m perial Conference refuse to allow the Government to have an extra day next week i h which to discuss them. I hope wiser counsels will prevail in the Cabinet, and that they will insist on taking the extra days necessary for the full discussion of these matters before the delegates leave for England. If , however, we fail to secure that opportunity, the f a u lt wil l lie at the door of those honourable members who objected to the proposal of the M in ister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) to devote an extra day next week to the business of Parliament. An extra day could easily be given by honourable members, who pretend to be so busy that they cannot come here for four days a week.",29
98,Mr FINLAYSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Brisbane) [12.11]. - The reasons given for this unexpected adjournment may be very good, and I believe they are most important. I believe the Conference, which is expected to conclude its labours today, wil l mark a very important step in the conduct of the war so far as Australia is concerned,' but the reasons given for the adjournment, while important, are entirely unsatisfactory, and one sits amazed to hear such hypocritical humbug put forward as argument as that to which the Minister for the Navy and the honourable member for Hlawarra have treated the House.",31

Then followed an interval of 104 days, and Parliament sat for seven days. This was followed again by an interval of seventy-six days, and during this part of the session we have now sat for seven days. Counting the week-ends, we have altogether sat since the elections, nearly twelve months ago, for fifty complete sitting days, and done",31
101,Mr LISTER,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Nothin g but quibble.,31
102,Mr FINLAYSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"The honourable member has taken the words out of my mouth. Honourable members on the Government side therefore corroborate my assertion that during that time the Government have done nothing to carry out the promises they made to the country, and the policy they submitted at that time. They were elected at their own request on their policy of winning the war, and we have already learned during the debates this week that the Government have done absolutely nothing towards that great and wonderful policy. If there was likely to be any difficulty in the House carrying on business today one could understand the reasons for the adjournment, but at the very most only four members-the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy, the Minister for Recruiting (Mr Orchard), and the Leader of the Opposition, need he absent. It is not suggested that any obstacle shall be put in the way of either or all of those gentlemen attending the Conference.",31
103,Mr MCWILLIAMS,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Did not the Leader of the Opposition say he could not go to the Conference unless the House adjourned ?,31
104,Mr FINLAYSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,No . Lord FORREST - I distinctly heard him say so.,31
105,Mr FINLAYSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"I also object to the suggestion of the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond), that it was owing to opposition from this side of the House that the proposal to sit on Tuesday was abandoned. The cause was the opposition from the Government side of the House, and particularly the emphatic declaration of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster). The Minister for the Navy would not accept the protest fro m three members on this side until an emphatic protest came from his own side, and then he immediately altered his motion to the regular day of sitting. The - Government have submitted Bills, many of them very important, but not one of them in charge of any of the Ministers whose attendance is required at the Recruiting Conference. There are nine measures on the Government programme, and twenty-nine motionsi standing in the names of private members. No opportunity is given us to attend to them. Time is going on, and those of us who come from the more distant States are being put under a most severe disability in carrying on our work - and attending to the wants of our constituents, because the Government seem unable to go on with business in the absence of the Prime Minister. If he chooses to be absent, that is no reason why the business of the country should be brought to a stand-still. It is not only because there is business to be done by member's of Parliament that I object to this motion. I would not like to suggest that it has been moved because the Government do not want to go on with their Bills. M i . MCDONALD - You 'have been in Parliament long enough to know that that is the case with every Government. - Mr FINLAYSON"" - I do not think it has applied so much to previous Governments, but this - Government is trying to win the waT with paper. It puts business before the country, but governs the country with tons of War Precautions Regulations.",31
106,Mr MAXWELL,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"If the honourable member will move for >an adjournment for a couple of months to enable members to go out on a recruiting campaign, I will support him.",32
107,Mr FINLAYSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,'No such motion can come from the Opposition side of the House. ' Mr LISTER - You r suggestion that that should be done would carry weight.,32
108,Mr FINLAYSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"If the honourable member can persuade the Government to move such a motion, he will have no opposition from me. But when early in 1917 the Prime Minister made' a fervent - I should say fervid, because I do mot believe that he was fervent-appea l to members to use a special recess for recruitfifteen ing, not one Minister appeared on the recruiting platform. That has been typical of their conduct right through. An adjournment today will suit me, because I have arrears of correspondence to bring up, but the moving of the adjournment by the Government shows their indifference to the welfare of the country and the winning of the war-a n indifference which is characteristic of them.",32
109,Mr HEITMANN,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Kalgoorlie) [12.18]. - I do not often address the House on the motion for the adjournment, but I rise on this occasion because of the attitude of the honourable member for Brisbaue (Mr Finlayson), and"" of a number of members on that side who continually sneer at the Government and its sup* porters when the term "" W in the war"" is mentioned. It is a simple matter to ask, ""What are you doing to win the war?"" but the question should never come from those who have done-their damnedest to prevent Australia from doing all that she could do in the war. Those who are supported by outside organizations, whose branches in many parts of Australia have passed resolutions against recruiting, have ho right to ask us, ""What are you doing to win the war?"" There are men sitting opposite who have not followed the dictates of their conscience in this matter. There are men there who sneer at the sincerity of the Ministerial party, and yet are afraid to follow the dictates of their own 'consciences. They said that we should have universal military service, but when outside bodies put pressure on them, they took the pliatfonm against conscription and their own private convictions on the subject. Only yesterday an organization supporting members on the opposite side of the chamber sent a message of congratulation to the Bolsheviks of Russiato the men who have made it possible that the democratic institutions of the world may fall at any moment. These supporters of members opposite look with pride on the efforts of the Bolsheviks.",32
110,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,ii s the honourable member aware that British forces are now fighting side by side with Bolsheviks?,32
111,Mr HEITMANN,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,I refer to the.extreme section who sold Russia.,32
112,Mr JOWETT,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,And joined Germany.,32
113,Mr HEITMANN,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"During the past or eighteen months we have read in the newspapers, not one, but scores of resolutions passed by outside organizations demanding of members that they should not support recruiting, and in one case requiring them to retire from recruiting committees. I say, too, without fear of successful contradiction, that during that time the press which supports them has been but lukewarm in the cause of the Allies. These members, who say that Australia ' could do enough under the voluntary system, declare now, when asked to do all they can to make that system a success, that unless they get this and that minor grievance remedied, they will do nothing. The grievances that they advance sink into insignificance when contrasted with the main issue. During the war I have suffered more inconvenience and injustice than most persons in Australia; but were I to say that I would do nothing to help my country until my personal wrongs had been righted, I should be in the position of honourable members opposite. Loyalty 'that is accompanied by a qualification is not of much service to the community in this period of our affairs.",32
114,Mr MCDONALD,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,I am suspicious of men who always talk of their loyalty.,32
115,Mr HEITMANN,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"And I am susthat picious of the sincerity of men who, after pleading with the Government of the to bring in conscription, learned that Trades Hall in Queensland did not be with lieve in it , and took the platform against it.",33
116,Mr FINLAYSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"The honourable memdom, ber has no proof of that statement.",33
117,Mr HEITMANN,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"It can be proved. I deny that there is callousness '- on this side in regard to the sufferings of 'sur fellow citizens. Honourable members site have never protested against the lutions against recruiting which have been put forward, perhaps by the extreme section of their following. Those who allow themselves to be told by their folwill lowers that they must not take an active part in recruiting have no right to sneer at the efforts of the Government on behalf of the cause of the Allies.",33
118,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Darling) [12.27] I protest against the proposed ment on the flimsy pretext that the House cannot do its work without the Prime Minister being present. On the average, Opposition. the Prime Minister does not attend here for five minutes on each sitting day. What is the reason for the proposed adjournis ment? The only reason I can find for i is the lack of sincerity in the protestations that their desire is to win the war by helping the Allies. If lying down and sleeping and going slow on the job would have won the war, the Government would have won it long ago. Even one of their supporters has said that nothing has been done. Something been done. Men have been placed in gaol for their efforts on behalf of their class. This is the last infamy that has been perpetrated by the Government. regulation has been issued prohibiting any persons from publishing any matter that has been censored. That is fine thing indeed. It is not a war precaufor tion; it is a political precaution, passed for political purposes. This House must do without the preHouse sence of the Prime Minister and the Minwe ister for the Navy during their visit to the Old Country, or adjourn until they return from overseas. If Ministers cancapable not carry on the business of the country, or go on with the ordinary routine of parliamentary work in the absence of Prime Minister, it is an admission incapacity on their part. It is apparent they have no desire to go ,on with business, and I venture to predict that day their programme until the end of this the Parliament will compare very favourably what they have achieved during the past twelve months, and that is nothing, unless it be tinkering with people's freedepriving them of their rights, or attempting to gaol them. I like honourable members' protestations as to their sincerity, in the matter of winning the war, contrasted with their continual laying of oppocharges against honourable members on resothis side of the House. One minute we are called pro-Germans; the next minute we are described as disloyal; after abusing us for a quarter of an hour a Minister spend the balance of his time in ask'ing us to help the Ministry; and afterwards Cabinet will meet and devise a new and infamous scheme for gaoling us. I do not believe that the House is asked to adjourn today for the reason advanced adjournby the Minister for the Navy.",33

121,Mr LAIRD SMITH,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,The Leader of the Opposition said that he would have to remain here if the House did not adjourn.,33
122,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"This is where the hypocrisy and sham of the thing come in. The Government were elected by an overhas whelming majority, but, after occupying the Treasury bench for twelve months, and own doing nothing, they have changed the venue of the conduct of affairs to GovernA ment House, and have handed over control to another body, thus acknowledging their incapacity to carry on the business a very of the country. The honourable member Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) gets up, and, with his tongue in his cheek, says that the assemblage at Government is the most important body of men have in Australia; that is to say, we are to be subservient, to this new Parliament, which has been created by an in Government, and by handing over the business of the country to this outside body, Ministers admit their incapacity. the When the Conference met, the Governof ment did not even come forward with business to put before it, but expected the Labour organizations to lay down a scheme whereby Ministers could have some of the odium that their actions have brought upon them taken away from them. After twelve months of sparring and talking, using the War Precautions Regulations to get at the other fellow and gaol political opponents, and stifling criticism, freedom of speech, and. freedom of the press, Ministers say to the various outside organizations of Australia, "" We want you to come to a Conference and determine the best method to adopt for helping to win the war."" What a lamentable admission by the Government as to their incapacity! I wish to touch upon the general demeanour of Ministers. They are not interested in questions submitted to them by honourable members, although they may give one an answer of a sort. This morning, when J asked the Honorary Minister if he was aware that farmers were being refused 'seed wheat by a State Wheat Board, he said that he was not aware of it, but that if I would put the question the notice-paper he would investigate the matter. Surely to heaven the matter was important enough for the Minister to ask me to give him further information upon it,  Mr .BLAKELEY - It is not a State matter. It is a matter for the Commonwealth Government, which controls the Wheat Pool. I have received letters from three farmers in New South Wales who have been refused seed wheat by the State Wheat Board. If farmers who have put their wheat into the Pool are refused seed wheat by the State Wheat Board, it creates a serious position. It is necessary that the whole of our agricultural land should not be devoted to grazing, and unless the Commonwealth Government give immediate instructions to the State Wheat Board in New South Wales to make the necessary seed wheat available to the farmers, so that they may sow their crops at once, the land may not be put under . wheat. It is a matter of considerable importance, because, although we have plenty of wheat on hand now, immediately shipping is available it will be sent away.",33
123,Mr SAMPSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Does the honourable member say that the State Wheat Board refused to sell seed wheat to farmers who required it?,34
124,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Yes .,34

Mr BLAKELEY.^-Yes, and, furthermore, he has wheat in the Pool, for which he has not yet been paid.",34

128,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"No . No doubt, the Honorary Minister (Mr Greene) will take the necessary steps to see that farmers who apply for seed wheat, and who are prepared to. pay for it , or are prepared to show that they hold scrip in the Wheat on Pool, are supplied with their requirements.",34
129,Mr JOWETT,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Does the honourable member know the reasons which were assigned by the State Wheat Board for refusing to supply the seed wheat?,34
130,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"My correspondent has not informed me as to what reasons were advanced by the State Wheat Board; but the main thing is that he had wheat in the Pool, and he has not yet been paid for it .",34
131,Mr SAMPSON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"That does not bear on the question. When the wheat goes into the Pool, it is all one parcel.",34
132,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"But if the Wheat Pool holds wheat for which a farmer has not yet been paid, even if he could not pay the cash straight away for the seed wheat for which he has asked, he should be entitled to be supplied with a certain quantity. However, in this instance, Mr MCKenzie was willing to pay for the seed. His land is now ready for sowing, and if he does not get the fourteen bags > f for which he has asked, he may have no crop this season.",34

Those facts should be quite sufficient for any man with ordinary intelligence. I have no desire to say anything further with regard to the matter, but I will hand the letter to the Honorary Minister and ask him to take immediate steps to get into communication with the State Wheat Board ih order to see if something cannot be done to supply these farmers with seed wheat immediately, so that the land which is ready for sowing can be put under crop.",34
135,Mr JOWETT,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,Grampians) [12.42] It is quite obvious that there must be some explanation for the alleged refusal of the State Wheat Board to provide this farmer at Narromine with seed wheat. quite certain that the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) is absolutely bond fide in bringing forward this alleged grievance; but it is to some extent an abuse of the privileges of the House for the honourable member to bring forward such a statement unless he is prepared to lay on the table the letter in which the State Wheat Board alleged its inability to provide this farmer with this particular kind of seed wheat.,35
136,Mr BLAKELEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"And , in the time, while I am waiting for that letter, the farmer will not be able to, sow his paddocks. I know this man well, and I have implicit confidence in his word.",35
137,Mr JOWETT,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"I have not the privilege of knowing the gentleman; but I cannot believe, and it is too preposterous to imagine, that a body of men intrusted with the responsibility of conducting a State Wheat Board, would, for no valid reason, refuse to supply farmers with seed wheat.

138,Mr GREENE,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"The honourable member has given the name of the correspondent, and the House can have the full facts next week.",35
139,Mr JOWETT,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"No doubt, the honourable member has been quite bond fide in the action he has taken.",35
140,Mr MAHONY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,What are you plaining about?,35
141,Mr JOWETT,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,I am complaining about the time of honourable members being wasted over an alleged offence which is unsupported by any evidence.,35
142,Mr MAHONY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,You would bring the censorship into Parliament?,35
143,Mr JOWETT,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"I thank the honourable member for that interjection, for it suggests the point to which I wish to refer.",35
144,Mr RILEY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Surely it is not wasting the time of the House to ventilate a grievance of the farmers? ' Mr SPEAKER,- I remind the honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) that it is not in order to say that the time of the House is being wasted.",35
145,Mr JOWETT,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Then I withdraw the words, and apologize. No complaint of the kind ought to be brought forward unsupported by evidence, and honourable I am members called upon to pass judgment on ex-parte statements of the kind. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs), as I understood him, said he had received a letter from the Censor to the effect that .his statements made on the floor of the House, in regard to the relations between the Imperial Governments of Japan and Great Britain, could not be allowed to appear in the press. Apparently the honourable member regards this as a continuation of his grievance against mean- the Central Wool Committee and the general administration of affairs. I am not here to champion what has been done by the Censors in Australia, but I have no doubt that they have been called upon to conduct their work under great difficulties. Although there may be reasons not apparent, at all events, to mylself, why many things should be censored, I do not know that I am called upon to either condemn or apologize for what has been done.",35
146,Mr MAHONY,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,-The Censors are acting under instruction.,35
147,Mr JOWETT,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Of course; and it is quite possible that their instructions may come not entirely from those who are immediately administering the affairs of this country. There may be greater matters at stake than some of us seem to think, and, in consequence, it may be most undesirable that certain statements should receive wide circulation. However, the Central Wool Committee is not in the remotest degree responsible for the censorcom- ship of speeches made here or anywhere .else. It is almost a pity that the statement by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), that Japan has been prevented by the Commonwealth Government from receiving our wool, should be repeated again and again. The fact must be emphasized that any interference with the export of wool from Australia to anyplace in the world is entirely in the hands of the Imperial Government, the Central Wool Committee merely carrying out the instructions of that Government in its distribution. It is, as I say, a misfortune that these allegations should be so continually made, because they have been exploded over and over again, and I trust we shall hear no more of them.",35
148,Mr FENTON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"Maribyrnong [12.50]. - I should not have risen but for the erroneous statements made by the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) in reference to the honourable member for iMacquarie (Mr Nicholls). It was most unfair of the honourable member for Illawarra to put the words he did into the mouth of the honourable member for Macquarie. The honourable member for Illawarra said that the honourable member for Macquarie was evidently an advocate of an increased price of'bread, because he was in favour of an advance in the price of wheat. I have a good recollection of what the honourable member for Macquarie did say, and his complaint was not so much concerned with the price of wheat as with the delay on the part of the Wheat Pool in paying money that has been owing to the farmers for a considerable period.",36
149,Mr LAIRD SMITH,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,The honourable member distinctly said that he desired an increase in the price of wheat.,36
150,Mr FENTON,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AN D,"The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith), since he got into bad company on the other aide, has acquired the habit of making COOKstatements not quite in accord with facts and I warn him to desist, or in the future liis word will not be taken as his bond. In the absence of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls), I say these ing. few words in his defence, for the struction placed on his remarks by the honourable member for Illawarra was disberations tinctly unfair. I am pleased to know that the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) intends proposed to present balance-sheets and reports relating to the various factories established by the Government. The Labour party, when in power, insisted that the manager of each of these undertakings should held responsible, and every year present a renort and a balance-sheet; and I that now we shall have similar informathe tion supplied regarding the Wheat Pools, the Wool Pool, Commonwealth Shipping, and the Metal Pool, if the scheme in regard to metals can be so described. All these are great business concerns under the auspices of the Commonwealth, and the House is entitled to full and complete balance-sheets. This particularly applies to the purchase and working of the Commonwealth line of steamers. It is a plank in the Labour platform that there shall be a Commonwealth line, and the party was not opposed to the purchase by the Prime Minister. But we never conceived of a Prime Minister at any time purchasing vessels and allowing them to be run as a business without presenting proper reports and balance-sheets. I trust the Government will not give rise to adverse criticism by causing , anj'""suspicion to rest upon them in regard to some of the transactions they carry out, and, therefore, proper balance-sheets should be presented at no distant date.",36

Later, I was informed that the Government had withdrawn the motion for an adjournment, and that they to proceed with the debate on the Ministerial Statement. I am placed in a worse position than any other honourable member.. Certain things which I be said in this House during die want-ofconfidence debate, and later, elsewhere, I hope cannot say today. I am a member of Conference, and I shall regard the proceedings as confidential until they are concluded. I desire to be at the Conference this afternoon. There is a paragraph in the Ministerial Statement which refers to the desirability of our presenting a united front in the face of the common danger. I shall not discuss that paragraph this afternoon, but I proceed to deal with other matters mentioned in the Statement. I think I will be entitled to ask that, when the Conference is concluded, I shall be given an opportunity to speak on the matter of restoring harmony and unity in the community. Mr ""WATT (by leave) - When I entered the House after lunch I was given to. understand by the Minister for the Navy that an arrangement had been made with the .Leader of the Opposition to continue this debate, and on that understanding I came into take charge of the House in the absence of the senior members of the Government. There is no desire on the part of the Government to embarrass the Leader of the Opposition. We realise that he, like the senior Ministers, has duties to perform at the Conference, and if he desii'es to attend the Conference' afternoon I shall take the full responsibility of adjourning this debate and proceeding with other business.",36

Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of messages from His Excellency the Governor General, transmitting Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure and Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for Additions, New Works, Buildings, &c, for the year ended 30th June, 1916, and for the year ended 30th June, 1917. In Committe of Supply: Mr WiLTT (Balaclava-Treasurer ) [2.25] - I am asking the Committee to deal with two sets of Supplementary Estimates, one for the year which closed on the 30th June, 1916, which will be the subject of a motion I shall have the honour to move shortly, and the other for the following year, ended the 30th June, 1917. Probably I shall be made the target of some critical remarks by those honourable members who believe that this Parliament has not been doi-g its financial work with strict regularity during the war period. Charged as I am with this unpleasant duty, I am not prepared to assert that our proceedings have been regular, but I take the earliest possible opportunity of asking Parliament to bring the accounts into order in the manner suggested by the Auditor-General, and I hope, with the assistance of honourable members and the concurrence of my colleagues, to make our financial business more regular in future. That is my explanation and apology, and I am prepared to share whatever responsibility there is in this matter. I have always held that in strict finance there is no politics.  has been too much politics in the past.",37
155,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I think I heard a colorable imitation of politics fall from the lips of the honourable member recently. However, there are no' politics in my finance. I do not desire to mete out any blame for past proceedings. Possibly the this extraordinary pressure and incidence of public life during the last couple of years have been mainly responsible for the irregularities that have occurred. I am the fourth Treasurer to hold office during the last fifteen months, and this instability probably explains why the, matters which, are now under consideration were not attended to-earlier. An opportunity is now before me to ask the Committee to validate these things, and I do so with the following explanation. I shall deal first with the year 1915-1916. Honourable members will, perhaps, not require me to traverse all the items in this list of Supplementary Estimates, but I do propose to explain the chief increases. The expenditure may be divided into two classes, that, which is consequent on the war, and ordinary departmental expenditure outside of war services. In the first class the principal increases were-In the War Pensions Office, which is naturally a growing Department in consequence of the heavy and regrettable liability which we have assumed, £6,189; premiums on life assurance policies of Commonwealth Publio Servants, who are members of the Expeditionary Forces, £2,591; grant to State War Councils for recruiting purposes, £5,000; expenditure in connection with interned enemy subjects, £45,336; remittance of moneys belonging to members of the Australian Imperial Force abroad, of which has been already recovered, £63,822; moneys received from the sale of Garrison Institute goods on transport, £40,623, which has since been wholly recovered; grant to Administration at Rabaul to meet revenue deficiency, to be recovered, £34,570; grant to Administration at Rabaul to provide for advancesto traders, £41,971, the whole of which has since been recovered; supply of wire netting to the Government of the United Kingdom, to be recovered, £ 1 3 , 8 7 9; pay of Naval Reserves called up for duty in consequence of the war, £ 5 , 4 8 5 ; for the purchase of foodstuffs for the Governments of India and South A f r i c a , £69,626, which has now been recovered.* A vast number of transactions relating to the purchase of foodstuffs for the Governments of the Empire, and in some cases Allied Governments, have been a constant duty thrown on the Administration since the war broke out. It has developed into a regular business; and is a matter of Treasury liability until adjustments are made between the Governments concerned. The total increase consequent upon the war in that financial year was £329,092. Lord FORREST - How much of that is to be recovered ?",37
156,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The bulk of it has already been recovered. The expenditure for services other than war was as f o l lows:-Dockin g and overhauling the Aurora, £ 3 , 9 3 9 ; this is a bookkeeping provision to legalize - expenditure which was previously charged against the new works vote for the - construction of the Fleet; coinage of silver, £ 7 , 2 7 6 ; purchase of gold for distribution to jewellers, £ 1 1 , 6 9 9; this amount has since been recovered; High Commissioner's Office, £ 4 , 5 2 9 ; redemption of Northern Territory loans, £ 1 8 1 , 6 2 5 ; up to 31st December, 1915, this expenditure was met from loan f u n d ; after that date the redemptions were provided for from revenue, and this is the first debit.",38
157,Mr BOYD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Is that for the redemption of the loans, or to meet the cost of handling them ?",38
158,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I understand it is for the redemption of loans as they mature. Mr Fenton,-Are they old South Australian loans?",38
159,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes , they are burdens on the Territory for which we became liable when we accepted the transfer. There were a number falling due at different dates. Additional advance to Small Arms Factory trust account, £ 3 5 , 0 0 0; on the 30th June, 1916, £12,396 was repaid from this trust account to revenue; the Naval College is responsible for an increase on general expenditure of £5,803; £30,000 is for an advance to the Trust Fund A d miralty account; the expenditure from this account is recoverable from the A d miralty; certain extra working expenses for the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway amounted to £ 1 0 , 9 5 9; various charges, such as rent, repairs, and maintenance,, came to £11,848, and the extra amount for the Postmaster-General's Department was £ 4 , 8 4 1 . The non-war services thus totalled £307,519. The only other items included are supplementary amounts for additions, new works, and buildings. They include an extra amount of £3,379 for the Federal Capital for that year, and £9,243 for the Flinders Naval Base, £3,012 for improvements to the Liverpool manoeuvre area, and £1,338 for sundry post-office buildings in New South Wales.",38
160,Mr MAXWELL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,What is the nature of the expenditure on the Federal Capital?,38
161,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That amount was spent when work was going on there. All these items stretch back nearly two years, some of them more. I take this to be a validating proposal, and naturally expect that criticism w i ll be offered of the methods employed, but I hope that the Committee will authorize me to deal with these matters a little more promptly in the future if the circumstances of the House and politics generally will allow.",38
162,Mr BOYD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,What is the good of debating finances that are two or three years old?,38
163,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I am not recommending a debate. I am suggesting that my honourable friend should for once in his life nod to the item without speaking.,38
164,Mr GREGORY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Will not these figures include the purchase of the Commonwealth steamers?,38
165,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No , they were purchased out of loan money. These Estimates deal only with supplementary expenditure out of revenue. Lord FOBBEST - How much of the total amount is to he recovered?",38
166,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The chief items recoverable are-Australia n Imperial Force remittance moneys, £63,000; money for Garrison Institute sales on transports, £40,000; £34,000 and £41,000 for Rabaul; £13,000 for wire netting for the Imperial Government; and £69,000 for foodstuffs for other Governments.

167,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Kennedy) [2.40]. - In justice to the Committee, the Treasurer should have given some explanation of the delay in asking for these amounts. Lord FOBBEST - I think it was your Government's expenditure.",39
168,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not care whether the expenditure was incurred by the right honourable member or by Mr Fisher when Treasurer; the fact remains that two years after the money has heen spent the Estimates covering it are brought, down, and if it had not been pointed out l to the Government probably we should never have had Supplementary Estimates for that period at all. No one holds the present Treasurer responsible, but £639,000 has been spent without the sanction of Parliament, and Supplementary Estimates are brought down two and a half years later. Surely that practice is not going to be continued? We are not sure that it will not be, although the Treasurer says it will not.",39
169,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am the detective, not the criminal.",39
170,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In this case the honourable member is not the criminal. In normal times no Government could last twenty-four hours with an Auditor-General's report such as I have here staring them in the face. The present Treasurer, if in Opposition, would be the first to complain. I want an explanation of the item I "" Secret Service Fund."" - Mr Watt - That report relates to 1916-17. These Estimates are for the year 1915-16.",39
171,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We do not know what the Secret Service Fund is for. It has only lately, come into our Estimates, 9,059 and the Committee is entitled to know . . 40,808 how far it has been used, and-for what purpose. I have been told that it is used . . 183,384 in various ways, but I have no authentic information. If anybody attempts to . . 234,328 mention the matter in the House, he is 4 immediately accused of a desire to injure some person without any foundation of . . 69,092 fact. I should like to know the amount of the fund and the purposes it has been ... 29,672 used for. .. 4,841 Mr Watt (Balaclava-Treasurer ) [2.43] - I am unable to answer the honourable member's question in connection with these Estimates. I do not know whether any secret service money was spent in 1915-16, or even in 1916-17, except what the Auditor-General states, according to the honourable member, in his report. I shall inquire, and let the honourable member know.",39
172,Mr HIGGS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Capricornia) [2.44] The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. MCDonald) will find that every Government has a Secret Sendee Fund. If the Treasurer knew how the money was expended, he would not tell. I wish, in passing, to congratulate the honourable member for Balaclava on his appointment to the position, and especially upon his determination to see that things are done more promptly in the future. The Secret Service Fund can hardly be discussed in open Committee.",39
173,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Auditor-General cannot even get the vouchers.,39
174,Mr HIGGS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"My information is that the amounts expended are submitted to the Auditor-General, and that the Auditor-General is asked to accept the word of the Minister. I should be prepared to accept the word of any Minister as to any amount in regard to this item. I do not think that the amount is large.",39
175,Mr BLAKELEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Unde r what item of the Estimates is secret service money voted ?,40
176,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable member will find the matter referred to in the Auditor-General's report for 1916-17.,40
177,Mr HIGGS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not think that the amount is large. If honourable members will make inquiries of the Treasurer, they will come to the conclusion that there is nothing improper about the matter, and that it is necessary, in the interests of the government of the country, to have this fund. All Governments have secret service funds, though these are not openly provided for in the Estimates. Question resolved in the affirmative.",40
178,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Balaclava-Treasurer ) [2.47] - I move That the following further sums be granted to His Majesty to defray the charges for the year 1916-17, for the several services hereunder specified, viz.:i . The Parliament .. n. The Prime Minister's Department .. in . The Department of the Treasury 51,584 iv. The Attorney-General's Department .. .. v. The Home and Territories Department .. vi. The Department of DefenceMilitary . . .. VII. The Department of the Navy .. 5,346 ' VIII. The Department of Trade and Customs .. .. ix. The Department of Works and Eailways .. x. The Postmaster-General's Department .. x i . War Services .. That there be granted to His Majesty to the service of the year 1916-17 a variation of the - appropriation already' made for the purposes of Additions, JiTew Works, Buildings, <fcc. It will be well for me to follow, in this case, the procedure I adopted in regard to the Supplementary Estimates for 1915-16, and make a general explanation. The expenditure out of Treasurer's Advance during 1916-17-no t including that on Additions, New Works, and Buildings - amounte d to £672,088, and the amounts are now submitted in detail to obtain an appropriation of Parliament to cover the amount involved. The expenditure may be separated as between "" W a r "" and "" Ordinary"" as follows:War expenditure . . . . £557,931 Ordirtary services . . . . 114,157 £672,088 The expenditure on war services is almost wholly made up of an advance of £550,000 to the Trust Pund, Defence Clothing Material Account, for the purchase of cloth from the British Government.. In anticipation of liberal reinforcements for the Australian Imperial Force, large stocks of clothing were obtained, to be paid from the Loan Fund as the cloth was issued. But the expectations in regard to reinforcements were not realized, and, in the meantime, it was necessary to provide funds for payment to the British Government. It is anticipated that the amount will be repaid from the Trust Fund during the current financial year, and provision was made in the Estimates of revenue accordingly. The balance of the expenditure for war £ services, namely, £7,931, is made up of 155 additional temporary assistance, medical examinations, &c.; in connection with War . . 13,128 Pensions, £7,229; remission of Customs duties on goods imported for the personal . . 2,053 use of prisoners of war, &c, £633; and overpayments to estates of deceased .. 58 soldiers, £69. The expenditure on ordinary services is ..3,148 made up as follows:-The Parliament, for a compassionate allowance and additional . . 7,237 telephone services, £155; Prime Minister's Department£13,128, £1,518 of this amount . . 20,208 represents salaries of Acting Public Service Inspectors in New South Wales, South ... 11,240 Australia, and Western Australia. A ..557,931 corresponding saving has been made under the special appropriation for Public Service Inspectors' salaries. The balance of the amount is made up of temporary assistance, Audit Office, contingencies of the Prime Minister's Office and High Commissioner's Office and other miscellaneous services. Then, in the Treasury Department, the expenditure was £51,5S4. Owing to the abnormal conditions brought about by the war, it became necessary to purchase large stocks of paper for stamp printing and ordinary departmental printing. This necessitated advances totalling £22,447 to the Trust Fund, Stamp Printing Account, and Government Printer Account. The amount will be recovered when the paper is issued for consumption. An additional amount of £9,654 was required for the maintenance of persons in charitable institutions admitted under the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. The balance of the amount is made up of additional temporary assistance, postage, and telegrams, &c, for the Treasury, Maternity Allowances Office, In valid and Old-Age Pensions Ofiice, Taxation Office, &c. The Attorney-General's Department required for law costs, printing, &c, an additional amount of £2,053; there were sundry small amounts in the Defence Department, totalling £3,148; for the Home and Territories Department, £58; and for the Department of the Navy, accounts totalling £5,346 were paid-includin g £5,000 advanced as a working credit to the Trust Pund, Wireless Workshops Account. The expenditure in the Department of Trade and Customs was £7,237, made up of-administratio n of Commerce Act, £2,612; temporary assistance, lighthouses, £2,182; sundry small' items, £2,443; total, £7,237. The expenditure in the Department of Works and Railways was £20,208. This is mainly accounted for by an advance of £15,000 to the Northern Territory Railway Stores Account for the purchase of coal. When the coal is' issued for consumption, the amount will be' repaid. Already £3,297 has been recovered. The expenditure in the Postmaster General's Department was £11,240, which was made up of sundry amounts for mails, legal expenses, salaries, and miscellaneous items, a grand total of £114,157. It was not found necessary during the year 1916-17 to depart materially from the Estimates for Additions, New Works, and Buildings, as passed by Parliament, and it was possible, by a re-arrangement of various items, to obviate the necessity of asking Parliament for an additional appropriation. The Bill now before the House is merely to vary the original appropriation, in a few cases, in the manner indicated by the Schedule.",40
179,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Kennedy) [2.55] The other day I made a statement concerning the purchase by the Prime Minister of ships for the Commonwealth, to which the right honourable gentleman made a reply a day or two later. I am not going to traverse that reply. It is sufficient for me to' direct attention to the report of the Auditor-General, who says' that "" no vouchers accounting for the purchase of the ships, nor for the London transactions since"" have been submitted to him; and that ""endeavours have been made in order to obtain these accounts through the Treasury."" I ask the Treasurer whether the matter has come before him.",41
180,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Not so far as I remember.,41
181,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Who is responsible for the fact that the Auditors-General cannot get the vouchers accounting for the purchase ?,41
182,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am informed that the Auditor-General has evidence of the payments, although he has* not had the technical vouchers submitted to him, they being in London.",41
183,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"He says that he has had no vouchers accounting for the purchase of the ships, and does not know whether the amounts stated are correct. The Prime Minister may claim that the transaction has been a great gain to the Commonwealth, but the Auditor-General tells us that, from the 30th September, 1916, to 30th June, 1917, the earnings of the ships in Australia were £92,114; and that, in addition, £69,825 had been remitted from the London office. These two sums total £161,939, and make up the whole earnings of the fleet at the date I have mentioned, the net profit, so far as Australia was concerned, being £19,384.",41
184,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"At that time, we had not had a great deal of use out of the ships.",41
185,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I believe that some of the vessels have not come to Australia. The Committee have a right to know exactly what has been earned by them.,41
186,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If the honourable member will ask me to bring down particulars of their earnings up to a given, date, I shall do my best to obtain the information, and I think that he will be satisfied with it.",41
187,Mr MCDONALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Auditor-General's report reveals what is nothing short of a scandal. Honourable members should have the fullest information regarding both the purchase of the ships and their earnings. I enter my protest against the manner in which the transaction has been carried out. The Auditor General tells us that "" it appears desirable that legislation should be effected to define the powers and functions of the general manager"" of the Shipping Department of the Commonwealth. No such legislation has been introduced, nor has it been foreshadowed in the Ministerial statement. The Prime Minister's claim that the purchase of the ships was the crowning success of his life reminded me of the saying thatSuccess will not always bear the golden apple, sometimes spotted, and not infrequently rotten to the core.",41
188,Mr HIGGS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Capricornia) [3.0] We are entitled to learn from the Treasurer whether or not the receipts and expenditure in connection with Commonwealth steamers are to appear in the ""annual statement of accounts which is presented to Parliament. We should be in a position to find in the year's Estimates a subdivision containing the salaries of the chief officers who will administer the Shipping Department. give us some sort of control over these vessels, as we now have control over the Trade and Customs Department, the Conimonwealth Eailways, and other services in connection with the Commonwealth. If this course is not to be followed, are the accounts of the Department to be something quite apart from the Treasury; are honourable members not to have any say whatever in regard to those who are employed in it ; are they not even to be called upon to vote the salary of the Controller ? MT. MAXWELL - Thes e are ships that pass in the night! ' Mr HIGGS - The honourable member may. have described them accurately. Is it the idea of the Prime Minister that the purchase of ithese vessels is to be regarded as a mere passing experiment or phase of the war ? Do the Win-the-War party intend to abandon their capitalistic notions and go in for Socialism? lis it their intention to establish a permanent Socialistic Commonwealth Shipping Department?",42
189,Mr GREGORY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I hope not.,42
190,Mr HIGGS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It will be regrettable die Win-the-War party do not intend to continue the Commonwealth Shipping Department. If they do intend to do so, honourable members should be allowed to point out in the House any defects in the scheme. The matter should not be left to the whim and caprice of the Prime Minister, who is administering the Department.",42
191,Mr ARCHIBALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"And 'the unions would nominate the crews, I suppose.",42
192,Mr HIGGS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I dare say that, in hia time, the honourable member would have recomknended that all the men employed on the waterside should be engaged through his union. Apparently he has analysis. It is altered his views.",42
193,Mr ARCHIBALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Shoul d we recommend men who make war on society?,42

If he does so, he will find that some waterside workers are not the only men who make war on society. Mr Hopper, the manager of- the Lake's Creek Meat Works, in Queensland, a very big establishment, engages his men through the secretary of the union. At one time he was opposed to It will secretaries of trade unions, but now he regards the trade union secretary as his outside manager. ' Mr ARCHIBALD - I suppose he is one of the Eyan gang. - Mr HIGGS - I am sorry that the honourable member should choose to refer to a very able man, a very honest man, - and a statesman- I presume that he is alluding to Mr Eyan, the Premier of Queensland-in an opprobrious way by talking of the "" Eyan gang."" - The people of Queensland have shown at the recent election what they think of what the honourable member calls the "" Eyan gang."" We know what the Prime Minister is prepared to undertake in regard to the shipping business, and we 'know what he can do; but we are not - prepared to allow the Department to be control-led outside this House.

MCDonald), I have not a great deal to say, .because coming new to the job, as I do, they will absolve me from the necessity of making promises at this stage. However, I wish to give briefly my view as to what I think should be done, and as to what I shall endeavour to do. Both honourable members claim that a matter of such ""importance should be brought well within the purview of Parliament.. I hold the same view, and, no matter how the general expenditure on salaries or contingencies may be lumped into one sum, I consider that the salaries of the chief officers of the Department should be set out in the annual Estimates, so that they may be brought up for discussion here, enabling the whole policy of the Department to be open to the criticism of honourable members. In framing next year's Estimates, I hope to be able to do this. The other question raised is whether or not we can have a statement of receipts and expenditure of an intelligible kind for submission to the House. I do not know whether the operations of this Department can be set out in the shape of an ordinary commercial balance-sheet, but it is my desire that statements of the operations of all the enterprises on which the Government have embarked should be submitted to honourable members, so that rhey may know during given periods what these concerns have been earning and spending. I shall endeavour to get the information for honourable members as early as possible.",42

210,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"A meeting waa held in the Socialists' H all , Melbourne, where thousands assembled to protest against the deportation of Italians f o military service, but the censorship was used by the press to prevent any word as to that meeting going out to the public. The same censorship has been used in gard to the "" tabloid "" speech which I conscription. made the other night upon this matter. The people of Australia, owing sorship, were prevented from knowing that my speech was dealing with the matthat ter of the deportation of Italians. It was camouflaged by reporting me as making some remarks concerning an Allied counforeign country. try and the present .war. It cannot be denied that the Government have given orders to the press to suppress all reference to these matters. Italians, naturalwhat ized or unnaturalized, have been called upon by the Italian Government, aided and abetted by the Australian Governnot-h ment.",44
211,Mr BAMFORD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Does the Italia n Government recognise naturalization papers issued to Italians in Australia ?,44
212,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Not so far as the Army is concerned, as is shown in Hall's International Law, sixth edition, that I quoted the other evening. The Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) will remember that when he introduced the Naturalization Bill he dealt with the law as it relates to Germany.",44
213,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I said at the same time that naturalization here protects any person from going under the conscription law of Italy .,44
214,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It does not protect an individual if the Australian Government is in league with the Italian Government,",44
215,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It does protect the in dividual, as a matter of fact; but there was one case, possibly a mistake, which came under my notice, and into which I ordered an inquiry.",44
216,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Minister will not deny that the Italian Government claim naturalized British subjects, so far as military service is concerned?",44
217,Mr FOWLER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I understand that the Commonwealth Government does not recognise that claim.,44
218,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Government does recognise that claim, in so far as they have allowed the Italian Consul to call up men, although these men have produced their naturalization papers. Whether a man be naturalized or unnaturalized, if he has come to this country as a boy of, r say, three or four years of age, has been brought up uuder our conditions, and is subject to our civil and criminal law, he should be protected by the Australian peoreple who have protected themselves against",44

224,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Of course, he is; he is liable to all the pains and penalties to which Australians are liable.",44
225,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That does not make him a citizen. There is a well-recognised status of citizenship. The honourable member would not contend that an Australian who lives for weeks or years in another country ceases to become an Australian citizen.,44
226,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am not setting up that doctrine; but I contend that if a man is good enough to live here and conform to our laws, he is good enough to be protected by the people who themselves have rejected compulsory military service.",44
227,Mr GROOM,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But you make the claim on the ground of citizenship.,44
228,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes , and on the ground of common humanity. My point is that the Australian people have exempted themselves, and yet. by an arrangement with one of the other countries concerned, a War Precautions Regulation is issued calling upon every Italian here liable to military service in Italy to report himself to the Consul under certain penalties. That War Precautious Regulation was subsequently amended so as to embrace all Allied countries. If this ""is allowed to go on, the time will come when all Servians, Americans, Italians, and Frenchmen resident in Australia are drafted out against the wishes of the Australian people, as expressed at the two referenda, when no distinction was made between different classes. Then those who think with the Government will turn round and say that all the subjects of our Allies have been called upon, while the English, Scotch, and, possibly, in the near future, the Irish, conscripts are allowed to remain in Australia. In my opinion this action in regard to Allied subjects is simply the thin end of the wedge, and if the Australian .people sit down under it , then conscription, without any referendum or appeal to the people, will be carried out. When the anti-conscription majority has thus been broken down, and the English, the Irish, and the Scotch",44
229,Mr FOWLER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,There are no Scotch anti-conscriptionists.,45
230,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There are a few in Ireland at the present time anyhow. The honourable member for Perth does not follow Mr Lloyd George's statements very closely, or he would know that there is a considerable number of .Scotchmen and Englishmen residing in Ireland at the present time. At present we have the' Commonwealth Government hand and glove with' Allied Governments to facilitate the deportation of Allied citizens. The Italians, of whom I am speaking, are paid 2d. per day as members of the Italian A r m y. The Prime Minister has told us that their dependants in Australia are receiving the separation allowance laid down for dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force, namely, Is. 5d. a day for the adult, and 44d. per child, plus 2d. paid by a benevolent It a l i a n Government. What is going to become of the 30,000 women and children who are dependent on the 6,000 odd Italian citizens eligible for military service? Will any honourable'member contend that the allowance I have mentioned will keep body and soul together?  information as to the numbers?",45
231,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Fro m the Italian people concerned.  say ? ',45
232,Mr CONSIDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"You can find that out at your leisure. I have a list of thirty-four of these Italians who live in and about Melbourne. All of them are possessed of property, and are suffering severely in consequence of the action taken by the Government. One of them possesses twoshops worth £ 6 0 0 at St. Kilda, and another a shop, valued at £250,0 in Carlisle-street. In the case of the latter he is forced to sell, and has been offered £ 8 7 for his property. An Italian at N h ill , Victoria, has been offered £700 for a business worth £ 2 , 5 0 0; a man at Northcote has received no offer at all for a property - worth £ 2 0 0 , and the same has to be said of a property worth £500 at Richmond. For a property in Malvern-road, an Italian conscript has been offered £ 7 0 for a property worth £200. So the list goes on, offers of £ 6 0 , £ 7 0 , and £ 5 0 being made for properties and businesses worth £300 and £400. In these circumstances, the benevolent Australian Government offers to allow the dependants of these men Is. 5d. a day*, with 4 j d . for each child. Then what about those Italians who have no property at all-the labouring class ? Their Australian wives, and their children born here, are left to subsist on the separation .allowance. The Australian Government is saying that' voluntarism has been "" nailed to the mast, "" so far as Australian /citizens are concerned; and what working the Australians will not tolerate themselves we are compelling the people of Allied countries to accept. Unless adequate provision is made for the dependants of these men who are being "" shanghaied "" out of the country, they must become a tax on the general community, and it is a crying shame, and a disgrace to any country calling itself civilized, to perpetrate such an atrocity on helpless people. In reply to a question as to whether Australian soldiers are being used for the purpose of arresting these conscripts, the Prime Minister told us that any necessary arrests are being made by the civil police and the Garrison Militar y Police., or by members of the Distriot Guard. Thus we have the spectacle of the Italian Consul utilizing the governmental machinery of the people of Australia for the very Object against which we have most emphatically declared ourselves. Behind the people, per medium .of the War Precautions' Regulations .and Orders in Council, men are being ""shanghaied "" out of the country; and there is a policy of smother and hush manipulated by the present Administration, with the effect of absolutely preventing any publi city being given to the state of affairs. That is uot very remarkable, because the Goverument are Prussianizing Australian citizens. By surreptitious alterations, of the War Precautions Regulations they bave taken away the right of Australian citizen soldiers to be tried before a civil magistrate. The whole military system, against which Australians were supposed to be fighting overseas in order to keep it out of Australia, is being introduced through regulations issued by the present Government. Regulation 494, paragraph l i v . , provides for ' a n y trainee who neglects orrefuses to pay any penalty or fine for an offence against the Act and regulations, ' ' by order of the civil Court or by sentence, of court martial, &c.,"" and that has been amended by the addition of the words "" or by award of a Commanding Officer."" So that, it is no longer necessary to hale a lad before the civil magistrate and allow the prosecution to have the ordinary publicity. Too many lads were taken before the civil Court, and the public were beginning to know in that way what wastaking * place. That did not suit the military authorities, so the Government have by regulation altered the military system for the worse. Regulation 495 allows of the imposition of a sentence of three months' hard labour for any of the offences,, great and small, detailed in the preceding; section. Nonpayment offines may therefore be severely punished by court martial. pointed out in the House on another occasion how the lads in Broken Hill were being hauled before magistrates for the most trivial offences; but what sort of things will occur when these lads can be charged, not before a. civil Court which is adjudicating in the full light of day, but before their Commanding Officer, aiid without any publicity being given to the proceedings? The Government have also included absence from parade amongst the list of offences which a Commanding Officer is allowed to punish summarily. In future the Commanding Officer need not bother the magistrate to compel attendance at d r ill. All he has to do is to haul the delinquent before him and fine him, and, if he does not pay the fine, to sentence him to three months' hard labour. Prior to entering this Parliament I had an opportunity of travelling with a person who occupied a high position in the Australian Army Reserve, and I overheard him saying in conversation w t h another traveller that it was necessary to tighten up the compulsory clauses of the Defence Act ; but in the then existing state of public opinion it would not be wise to do that yet, because if the matter came, before Parliament the people would probably in sist on wiping out the compulsory clauses. His policy is now being carried out under the cloak of secrecy. The press is muzzled ; magistrates are not to be allowed to deal with offences, but the military officers are to be given power to strike terror into the hearts of the lads they are drilling and intimidate, them so that they will become blind tools in the hands of employers. It is about, time that honourable members told the Government in no uncertain .way that they will not allow any more of this monkeying with the rights of Australian citizens. Wie are daily being assured of the necessity of maintaining the liberties that we possess in this country, while at the same time, i h a hole-and-corner manner, the Government are amending regulations in order to interfere with the rights, of the people. Through the medium of the sausage-machine regulations they are turning out night and day, every vestige of liberty possessed by the Australian people prior to the war is slowly but surely disappearing. I have taken this opportunity of ventilating the interference with the rights and liberties of young Australians who are being trained under I the compulsory clauses of the Defence Act, and the outrage perpetrated on the dependants of Italians, who are being forcibly deported ,from this country at the request of a foreign Government, and I hope that honourable members will not allow this state of things to continue.  eligible Italians in Australia. MT . CONSIDINE - If there were only one I would kick up the same raw.  naturalized.",45
233,Mr CONSPDINE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"JI make no distinction between a naturalized citizen and an unnaturalized citizen. I contend that a man who is good enough to live in Australia, and who conforms to our laws, is entitled to the same treatment as other citizens. The people have, decided that conscription is not good enough for Australia.",46
234,Mr GREGORY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It is not good enough for them! - Mr Considine - I hope this matworkers. ter will not he treated in a jocose manner. The righto and liberties of men are at stake, as also is the well-being of less women and children who are to be left to the tender mercies of the Government, who are shanghai-ing Italian citizens out of the Commonwealth. Mr FlNLAYiSON (Brisbane) [3.40]. - I rise to enter another protest against what is taking place in connection with the censorship. I hold the galley slips of a weekly newspaper which has been continuously published in Brisbane for nearly thirty years. These are proofs of reprinted articles that appeared in the Brisbane Daily Standard, the Rockhampton Record, and other papers, but the censor would not allow them to be published in the Brisbane Worker, presumably because they reflect upon the conduct of the Government in connection with the war. The original purpose of the censorship regulations-and it is still being placarded-wa s to prevent information of value to the enemy being published. That was a good and sufficient reason, and, so long as the censorship was confined to that purpose nobody could, or did, complain of it. But the censorship has been applied for - a very different purpose, and, although members on the Government side may deny that there is any political censorship, I ask them what construction the ordinary man in the street can place upon the interference that is taking place with the press. Evidence such as I possess must provoke the opinion that the censorship is being imposed solely for political purposes. I hope the Government do not regard themselves as superior to criticism; but one would think that they regarded themselves as sacrosanct, when they refuse to allow a reputable newspaper like the Brisbane Worker to criticise their actions. Mr ""WEBSTER - Did these articles, which you have copies, appear newspapers in the same form as that in which you have themf",46
235,Mr FINLAYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes ; and the cen- - as you do. sor has made a red mark through the three galley slips. This is not an uncommon happening. Honourable members have reas peatedly quoted and - exhibited examples of information that appeared in the Age and the Argus being refused pubarticles ? lication in such papers as the Woman Voter and the journals published by Articles published in a number of newspapers that were favourable to the Government were not allowed to appear helpin the Labour press. ""We know that the Government have no very kindly feeling towards Labour newspapers or Labour members, but they must recognise that Labour members have some standing in the comimunity by reason of their positions in this House as representatives of the people. If only one side is to be heard in politics, and only favourable criticism in connection with the doings of the Government is to be given publicity, it would be better for the Government to close down altogether those newspapers which are hostilely critical, rather than to strangle them slowly by means of the censorship.",47
236,Mr JH CATTS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The censorship in Australia is infinitely worse than it is in Germany.,47
237,Mr FINLAYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Perhaps the Postmaster-General will turn his Australian and not his official ear to me when I admit that I . am in receipt of newspapers from the Olcl Country, and find in them open, unadulterated criticism of the most severe character directed against the Imperial Government.",47
238,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That cannot injure recruiting there.,47
239,Mr FINLAYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Then does the Minister suggest that censorship of thekind I have exhibited is imposed because the statements might prejudice recruiting?,47
240,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That is one of the reasons for the law.,47
241,Mr FINLAYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have often heard it put forward as a reason, but this exercise of the censorship has exactly the opposite effect. The fact of the censorship being so severe on the Labour papers is hindering recruiting. The people say, "" We are allowed to know only one side. Why should we support a Government of that refuses us the ordinary rights of in other civilized communities?""",47
242,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Number s of honourable members on the other side think the same,47
243,Mr FINLAYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I know. They have often expressed themselves privately decidedly opposed to the actions of the 'specific Government in that regard ,47
244,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Will you let me see the _ Mr FINLAYSON - I have no objecthe tion. No honourable member can find in Supplementary Estimates the censored parts anything detrimental to the interests of the country. , I am reminded that it is probably a breach of the Act for me to have these papers, but I presume the Minister will not take advantage of my handing them to him .",47
245,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,My only object in asking for them is that I may have them looked into.,48
246,Mr MAHONY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Prime Minister may take a different view.,48
247,Mr FINLAYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am prepared to risk it . The Prime Minister does a lot of funny things, and very unfair things; but, perhaps, this would be a b it beyond even his limits. There is a feeling of dissatisfaction and unrest in the mind of the community caused by the belief that one side is being unfairly and unduly penalized. A f t e r all, criticism is most valuable in a democratic community, and criticism of the Government and governmental administration is a healthy sign of progress. Mr Justice Higgins, in a lecture on one occasion, said the war was always the subject of proper criticism, and that the administration of defence by the Government was particularly a proper subject for publio criticism. It is only by criticism and discussion in public of public affairs that we have been able to arrive at our present state of political advancement. It would be to the advantage of the Government, and of our conduct of the war, if the censorship was confined strictly to the purposes for which it was originally imposed. This would remove a considerable amount of ill-feeling. An other unfortunate proceeding is the r a i d ing of premises and the seizure of private property by the military. A number of institutions are being branded as ' disloyal, but loyalty and disloyalty are almost interchangeable terms, because what one man considers disloyalty another may just as conscientiously believe to be the most intense exhibition of loyalty. The man today who is the Prime Minister of the Empire, and considered a shining example of enthusiastic patriotism, was at one time looked on as one of the most disloyal men in the community. On one occasion he had to disguise himself to escape from the wrath of the loyal mob. I have received a letter from the secretary of the Irish National Association of Queensland, in which the following appears : My place_ of business (85 Melbourne-street) and the privacy of my home were ransacked [1*9] [19 APBIL , 1918.] 1915-16 and 1916-17. 4093 from top to bottom by no less than five men, with a number of others outside; and official and private letters, books, &c, belonging to the association and myself, and other people residing with me, were forcibly taken possession of and carried away, although I protested against the property of other people, being tampered with. I put no obstacle in the way as to my own property being examined. Further, at the request of another official who came on the scene during, the operations at my shop, I accompanied him to the association's rooms, and on unlocking the door, I was astounded to find two other men right inside, without any request to anybody re entering the said rooms. There were also a couple of men on the landing. These men searched the Irish National Association rooms and took away some rule-books and papers. The Irish National Association, as a peaceful body of citizens of this State of Queensland, feel that their rights have been forcibly invaded without any just or reasonable cause, and in upholding their rights as citizens,' and in the interests of justice, they not alone claim, but make demand, for protection against the unwarranted attacks of unscrupulous and designing politicians and their agents. That discloses a condition of affairs that no Minister can justify. The society was established many years ago for patriotic, social, and friendly purposes. It s loyalty has never been challenged. It is not by any means a political association, and in cludes men of all shades of opinion. There are a number of - Labour men in it , but I know quite a number of anti-Labour men who are enthusiastic members of it . Why did the Government think it necessary to do the things described by the secretary? The Government were very busy for a while in connection with the Industrial Workers of the World's rooms. In my opinion, there was mighty little justification for that, and now they are extending their attentions to the Irish Association. I wonder if they will try that sort of thing on the Caledonian Society? There are a number of Labour men in it , and there are a number of the other side also. What about the rooms of the St. George's Society? Of course, the 'Welsh Society is protected by the overshadowing power of the Prime Minister, but I have no doubt you could find the Government's brand of disloyalty in that, and even in the St. George's Society, if you wanted to. Disloyalty of the same kind could be found, I believe, even in the Caledonian Society. I will guarantee to find in any church evidences of what the Government regard as disloyalty. A f t e r all, what are we loyal or disloyal to ? No matter what our connection with outside institutions may be, I believe, that we are all loyal to Australia. Once that is established, the opinions of Australians in regard to anything else are of very little importance in comparison. A r e Ministers going to continue this method of carrying on the war? To what extent has the raiding of premises helped them in their programme of winning the war? B y what possible extension of this power, or the seizing of papers, or the holding of property, are they going to add one soldier to the Empire, or increase the strength of the ' Allies by a single ounce ? Will it shorten the war by one day? Will it save the l if e of one Austraian soldier or bring peace nearer? If the Government can show that it will do any of these things, and give their justification for it , I will support them; but every one knows that instead of helping forward a better state of things it is ""hindering it . Members opposite talk about restoring harmony and good feeling, and burying the hatchet. The Prime Minister says, "" Let bygones be bygones."" This is the Sansard report of the right honourable member's speech. He said I appeal to honourable members opposite to help the Government, to co-operate with it during this war, and to stand by our side in the attempt to solve those difficult and complex problems that confront us. I say again, if they desire to completely collaborate with this Government, let them say so, and I , for one, will go more than half-way to meet them. In the earlier part of his speech he saidWhen the Nationalist party was formed, or before it was formed, the Leader of the Opposition was asked to join the party, and endeavour to create a truly National Government by including all sections of the House. He declined to do so; he would have none of it. If my friend will say to me now that he is prepared to work with this party, I , for one, will be prepared to help him. If I am the man who stands in the way, and he will only work with the National party upon the condition that I am not Prime Minister, I will stand aside if he is prepared to agree to a policy acceptable to the Nationalist party. I invite ""the honourable Leader of the Opposition to join hands with us either in the Government, or outside it, and help us to serve the best interests of Australia and the Empire in this great national crisis. The condition of agreement to a policy acceptable to the Nationalist not mentioned when the.speech was made; it was inserted by an alteration of the Hansard report. Let me, by a quotation the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 13th February last, show how closely the attiMr Finlayson. tude of the Prime Minister resembles that of the Kaiser. This is a cablegram from LondonAdvices from Amsterdam state that the Kaiser, in a speech at Hamburg, declared that he wished to live in peace with his neighbours, but German victory must first be acknowledged. The Prime Minister is willing to co-operate with us, and invites us to j o in him by agreeing to the Nationalists' programme. We are in favour of winning the war, but we do not support the methods of the' Government. Our very existence as a party is conditioned on the fact that we are opposed to the political policy of the Prime Minister. How can we be expected to join him while such things as I have mentioned continue to happen ? We have appealed to the Government over and over again during the last three years to justify their actions, or to stop what we complain of. A tremendous amount of irritation has been caused by what they are doing. This dates from the time when the Prime Minister began to talk about conscription. One might, have thought that, having discovered the mind of Australia on that matter, and, knowing the heart-burning and disturbance that he had caused, the righ t honourable gentleman would not have dragged the matter up twice. While he has been preaching peace, and holding in one hand the laurel wreath, in his other hand he has concealed a dagger, with which he is prepared to k ill his friends, and with which he has already in flicted on them some very severe stabs. If honourable members desire that Australia shall put forth her full energy as a united country, as she should do at a time like this, they should try to eliminate the causes of irritation and division. Australia cannot be united politically, socially, morally, and economically while the Government persist in their censorship and military dictatorship, and the sooner that is recognised the better. The Government should satisfy the people that there are good reasons for what censorship is exercised, and that that censorship is not political ; and to get the best out of Australia, now and in the future, We must find out party was the principles on which we can agree and the methods on which we can come to a mutual understanding. Are we to believe from that Ministers are in earnest about securing harmony, or are they concerned merely with their own political interests?",48
248,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Every effort is being made today to remedy what the honourable member complains of.,50
249,Mr FINLAYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is a satisfactory statement. Even after three and a half years of war, an improvement in administration will be acceptable. It might amount to an admission that mistakes have been made, but,the man who never admits that he makes mistakes seldom does anything else. According to the prayer book, we all "" do those tilings we ought not to have done and leave undone those things we ought to have done."" It is for the Government to cease from doing the things that they have been doing and to do the things that they have not been doing. This will take them a long way in the direction of good administration, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will endeavour to induce his colleagues to try to bring about peace and good-will in the community by removing the causes of i r r it at i on and misunderstanding. I had intended to refer to the high price of foodstuffs, but I shall leave that matter over u n t i l next week.",50
250,Mr BAMFORD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Herbert) [4.8] - A little while ago there was a disastrous cyclone in Queensland, and the Commonwealth Government generously helped the sufferers. Since then there has been another similar disturbance furthe r north, and I ask the Treasurer if an appeal has been made to him from the Cairns district for assistance, and, if so, what is the nature of the Government's response? I wish to be able to in for m that section of my constituents who have been affected what is likely to be done for them.",50
251,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Balaclava-Treasurer ) [ 4 . 9 ] - I have no knowledge of any appeal from the district referred to, but an appeal may have been made to the Prime .Minister. I shall make an inquiry, and let the honourable member know the result as early as possible next week. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolutions reported.

ENLISTMENT FOB HOMESEBVICE - AUDI TOB-GENEBAL'S STAFF - IMPOBTATIO N OF JUTE GOODS - REPATRIATION ' SEB VICE. Motion (by Mr Watt ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. Mr J . EL CATTS (Cook) [4.16] - The following paragraph appeared in this morning's Argus:Senator Pearce added that the whole defence position of Australia was very unsatisfactory, and that the Ministry proposed to strengthen it. They intended to enlist men between 21 and SO who were not fit for service abroad, and to extend home training. No one knew what would come out of the war, and we might yet have to. fight in Australia. In company with other members. I have received numbers of applications fro m men who are asking whether there is any chance for home service. They are slightly over age or under the standard for service abroad. I would like to know from the representative of the Government if he can say approximately how many men Senator Pearce requires for home service, because there appears to be an ample supply who could come under the category mentioned, and their enrolment could be facilitated. As Senator Pearce has said that the matter has been decided on, there should be no reason for delaying it, and the Minister who represents the Minister for Defence should be able to supply the necessary information. The agencies in the different States do not seem to have been made acquainted with the decision of the Government.",50
252,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Maribyrnong) [4.19] Because of the strictures made upon hi3 Department by the Commission which inquired into the administration of the Defence Department, the Auditor-General has complained that his work of auditing accounts and his association generally - with the Defence Department could be brought more up to date if the Government would consent to increase his staff. I wish to know whether the Government have considered the matter or taken steps to enable the Auditor-General to fulfil the functions for which he has been appointed, especially in connection with his association .with the accounts of the Defence Department.",51
253,Mr GREGORY,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Dampier) [4.20] There has been a great deal of trouble in the community regarding the importation of jute goods. The difficulty is very ous ih Western Australia, owing to the shipments not quite corresponding with the promises; but I think special effortsare being made in this regard. earnestly suggest ithat the Government should on Wednesday next publicly announce what their intentions are for the ensuing season.",51
254,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY,Do you mean as to the distribution ?,51
255,Mr GREGORY,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I mean as to the purchase. Merchants are making their purchases, and' it is rumoured ithat the Government propose to acquire all the jute of next season, and to adopt a method of distribution through agents. I am not so much interested on behalf of the merchants-who , however, ought to be treated fairly-as I am concerned for the primary producers. We certainly do not desire to have the same conditions as were experienced last year, or even such as now prevail in Western Australia, where there is such a shortage of bags as to seriously interfere with work in the country. Of course, these troubles are bound to occur; and we desire to know the intentions of the Government, so that those interested may take what steps they deem necessary under the circumstances.",51
256,Mr RODGERS,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Wannon) [4.22] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister who for some time will control this House a matter which, I think, he would do well to personally consider. I suggest that the Government should invite the co-operation of men who are prepared to volunteer their services, without charge, in the administration of repatriation at head-quarters. There are many young fellows at present engaged in the work, and earnestly doing their best; but I think that in the case of returned men who are called upon, at ages varying from twenty to thirty, - to enter into new walks of life, the assistance and advice of older men are required. I say nothing against the young men who are there now, but we requirethe services of a number of experienced and sagacious men who have themselves been successful in life Mr W1ATT (Bakclava^Treasurer) [4.25] - The honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) has inquired as to the conditions under which home service men are to be called up and utilized, and has complained that the public generally are serinot aware of what those conditions are. Mr J. BL CATTS - Hardl y complained!",51
257,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY,"At any rate, the honourable member offered some comments. The I absence of information is due to the fact that the decision cf the Government has only recently been arrived at, after caref u l consideration. I shall take an opportunity to ask the Minister for Defence to prepare a definite statement for early circulation, so that the public may know exactly what is required of them. As to the subject referred to by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton), there has been some difficulty in arriving at the view of the Auditor General, and at an agreement between him and the Prime Minister's Department, by which his office is controlled. Speaking from memory of some weeks ago, I think the request of the Auditor General was for some considerable number of temporary clerks to do auditing; and the view of the Department and the Minister was that so important a function should not be discharged by such employees at law salaries. Mr (SINCLAIR - The Auditor-<}eneral""s Department is costing £40,000 a year now.",51
258,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY,"It is costing a large sum, but increasing expenditure must mean increased cost of auditing. The chief difficulty was to obtain the services of competent and trustworthy men for so important and confidential a function; and the Auditor-General recommended the engagement of men at about l is . a day. This, as I say, the Minister did not consider desirable. I shall endeavour to see whether the views of those concerned cannot he harmonized in the near future. As to the supply of jute, the Minister has prepared his plan .with the concurrence of the Cabinet; and if I amable, I shall, by Wednesday or Thursday next, get him to furnish me with a statement which will enable honourable members to show their constituents exactly what the proposed system is.",52
259,Mr RODGERS,SUPPLEMENTARY,Bra n bags are costing 16s. a dozen in New South Wales. MT . WATT - I S that so !,52
260,Mr ATKINSON,SUPPLEMENTARY,"What Minister will control this matter? MT. WATT - That has not been defined ; but it will be one of the three connected with the Customs Department, and probably the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Greene), who is familiar with country affairs, will be associated closely with the administration. The repatriation difficulty is a real one. The Minister has determined, wherever possible, to give preference to returned Boldiers in the work of the Department.",52
261,Mr RODGERS,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I am not suggesting that the services of any of these should be dispensed with, but merely that men of capacity and pubhc spirit, who are willing, should be allowed to help.",52
262,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I shall mention the, suggestion to the Minister, knowing that his policy is, wherever possible, to employ re- turned soldiers.",52
263,Mr RODQEBS,SUPPLEMENTARY,And I do not wish to appear as opposing that policy.,52
264,Mr WATT,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I am not suggesting that the honourable member does oppose it, but merely that he desires that the voluntary system in the case of suitable men shall be availed of. Question resolved in the affirmative. . House adjourned at 4.27 pjn.",52
