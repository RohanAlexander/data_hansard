CAS A has written to the operators concerned in these incidents to remind them of the condition contained in their Air Operator's Certificate. In one case of repeated incidents, CASA found it necessary to pursue the matter further with the operator and the regulatory of authority of the country concerned. CASA inspectors conduct random inspections of foreign operators at their first port of call in Australia. During these inspections the inspectors assess the pilot in command's ability to understand and speak the English language. Failure of an operator to comply with the conditions contained in an Air Operator's Certificate could result in suspension or cancellation of the certificate.

Telstra Employees: Defence Reserve Leave (Question No. 240) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing theÂ· Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 30 November 1998: (1) What award or other provisions for Defence Reserve leave apply to Telstra employees. (2) Has Telstra management indicated that Defence Reserve leave is under review and that it is proposed to restrict each employee to a maximum of two weeks leave each year. (3) Is it a fact that the system of common induction training for the Army which was introduced by the Government requires new Army Reservists to be absent from civilian employment for up to seven weeks. (4) Will the circumstances described in the previous parts of this question discourage Telstra employees from enlisting in the Army Reserve; if so, is this consistent with the Government's intentions for the Army Reserve. Mr MCGauran-The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) Telstra has advised that its employment policies were recently reviewed under a policy simplification process. The resulting policy on Defence Reserve leave is as follows: 30 days paid leave (inclusive of Saturdays and Sundays) per calendar year may be approved. In addition to the above, a staff member may also apply for Annual Leave, Long Service Leave, Leave Without Pay, Rostered Day Off or Flexible Hours Leave. Management approval of leave for the absence of a staff member from the workplace is discretionary having regard to the balancing of customer needs, the achievement of the area's work objective and the individual's request. Defence Reserve Leave policy has been with Telstra and its predecessors since January 1951. (3) Common Induction Training (CIT) for all Army recruits, both Regular and Reserve, comprises recruit training and Initial Employment Training (lET). In accordance with Competency Based Training and Assessment principles, both Regular and Reserve soldiers must be trained, and achieve, the same competencies if they are to be employed in the same workplace. Currently, the delivery of the recruit component of CIT requires all Army recruits, both Regular and Reserve, to undertake a common recruit course'that consists of 45 days, that isÂ· six weeks and three days, of continuous training. (4) Telstra policy has various leave provisions which may be available to staff members having regard to the operational requirements of the company. The revised Telstra Defence Reserve Leave provisions would provide a simpler and more flexible Defence Reserve Leave system, with no loss of leave day quantum. Although staff, only once, would need to apply for leave additional to Defence Reserve Leave to undergo Common Induction Training, the total revised package to significantly discourage Telstra employees from enlisting in the Army Reserve.

21,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,YORK STREET,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There is no action being taken by the Government or the Health Insurance Commission to prevent professional sportsmen and sportswomen from obtaining Medicare benefits. Tasmar (Question No. 406) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 10 February 1999: (1) Was Tasmar, a drug used to treat Parkinson's Disease, withdrawn from sale in Australia on the basis of new evidence; if so, what was the evidence. (2) Has he received correspondence from sufferers of Parkinson's Disease who wish to continue using Tasmar despite the risks. (3) Is it a fact that Tasmar continues to be sold in the USA with additional warnings enclosed in the package. (4) Under what conditions would he allow Tasmar to be re-released for sale in Australia.",150
22,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,YORK STREET,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) took the decision to cancel the registration of Tasmar (effective 25 January 1999) following a thorough review of the safety of the product. This was undertaken because of reports of a number of cases worldwide of serious hepatic (liver) injury, including three deaths. The TGA concluded that the product was not safe under the approved use, taking into account the hepatic effects and the possible occurrence of neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome. The TGA soughtthe.advice of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) before taking the decision to cancel the registration of Tasmar. Prior to consideration of Tasmar the sponsor was invited to justify why the registration of the product should not be cancelled. The safety information on the product, including the response from the sponsor, was reviewed TGA and then considered by the ADEC. The question: Committee recommended that the registration of Tasmar should be cancelled due to its association withÂ· serious, unpredictable and possibly fatal hepatic toxicity. Monitoring liver function may protect against the development of these severe hepatic effects. The Committee considered that the risklbenefit balance for the product was unfavourassessment able and it was not possible to restrict the tions adequately to permit its continued safe Regulatory action similar to that taken by Australia has been taken by the Regulatory Authorities in the European Union and Canada as a result of the same concerns over the serious hepatic effects. Tasmar has been withdrawn from the market in these jurisdictions. (2) Yes. (3) Tasmar has not been withdrawn from the market in the United States (US). However, in consultation with the US Food and Drug Administration, Roche Laboratories Inc. has introduced into the US prescribing information for Tasmar a boxed warning pertaining to the hepatic effects of the product and has taken the unusual action of requiring written informed consent from the patient prior to Tasmar therapy. The European Union and Canada have, like Australia, withdrawn the product from the market. (4) For Tasmar to be re-released for sale in Australia, the sponsor, Roche Products Pty. Ltd., would be required to submit to the TGA an appliCommittee cation to register the product. For such an application to be approved, it would need to be supported by adequate data to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the product for the indications proposed in that application. In particular, evidence would be required to demonstrate that liver monitoring is able to detect hepatic changes and to predict adverse hepatic events. Evidence of the true incidence of hepatic injury associated with Tasmar, as well as data that would enable prediction of factors which render people susceptible to adverse hepatic events following treatment with Tasmar, would also be required. Child Disability Allowance (Question No. 407) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 10 February 1999: How many children (a) with disabilities and (b) suffering from diabetes became ineligible for child disability allowance in (i) 1994, (ii) 1995, (iii) by the ADEC, 1996, (iv) 1997 and (v) 1998. Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the followby the ing answer to the honourable member's (a) Information on the number of people whose Child Disability Allowance (CDA) was cancelled prior to 1 February 1998 is not available. From 1 not February 1998 a total of 20,400 CDA customers . were cancelled in the course of a review to confirm ongoing eligibility prior to the introduction of new arrangements. Of these cancellations, indica7,900 resulted from the non-return of review use. forms-some of these customers have since contacted Centrelink and had their payments restored. Information on cancellations of CDA payments granted from 1 July 1998 is not yet available. Given that few eligibility reviews have been required since then, however, the number of cancellations in this group will be very small. (b) Information on CDA cancellations by medical condition was not collected prior to 1 July 1998. Information by medical condition on 1 July 1998 is not yet available. Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee: Aricpet (Question No. 410) Ms Macklin asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 11 February 1999: (1) Has the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory considered the listing of Aricept (donepezil), a drug for the treatment of memory loss, as a pharmaceutical benefit item; if so, (a) when and (b) what did the results of clinical trials presented to the committee by the manufacturing company show. (2) Are long-term clinical trials being conducted to ascertain the long-term effectiveness of Aricept in the treatment of memory loss; if so, (a) where are they being conducted and (b) when are they expected to be completed.",151
23,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,YORK STREET,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) considered an application for the listing of Aricept (donepezil) tablets 5 mg and 10 mg at its meeting on 5 and 6 March 1998. (b) The results from the pivotal study, at twenty four weeks, show that the use of Aricept resulted in some small benefits to patients, but the relevance of these benefits to patients' long-term health was uncertain. The PBAC concluded that, in the absence of details on longer-term patient outcomes and because of its modest efficacy, Aricept had not been demonstrated to offer acceptable value for money. The application was therefore rejected with the advice that to enable further consideration; the results of longer-term clinical trials which are designed to assess the impact on the quality of life of the patients; the quality of life of the carers; progress towards institutionalisation of patients (ie the time it took patients to go into an institution); and the use of other health care services would be required. (2) The Australian sponsor for Aricept has advised that long-term clinical trials (greater than six months) are being conducted with Aricept to ascertain the long-term effectiveness of this drug in Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (DSM-IV)popularly known as Alzheimer's Disease. Memory impairment is one of the manifestations of Alzheimer's Disease, and improvement of memory is one of the criteria assessed in clinical trials. (a) These trials are being or have been conducted in a number of countries around the world, including Australia (b) A number of these long-term studies have already been completed and final study reports have been submitted to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for review. Other long-term clinical trials are currently ongoing and are expected to be completed in 1999 or 2000. Studies are also being conducted with Aricept in patients with severe Alzheimer's Disease. Australian Defence Force: Health and Safety (Question No. 430) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 16 February 1999: (1) How many breaches of the (a) Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act and (b) Defence Force Disciplinary Act involving health and safety matters affecting Australian Defence Force personnel were reported in the last year for which statistics are available. (2) What (a) action was taken, (b) fines were imposed and (c) compensation was paid in respect of the breaches referred to in part (1). Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Defence does not collect statistics in the form requested by the honourable Member. The chain of command in Defence has responsibility for providing a safe working environment and in discharging the duty of care Defence has as a Commonwealth agency under the OH&S (CE) Act. Comcare conducts regular audits and investigations of Defence establishments to ensure compliance with regulations made under the Act. (b) Actions taken under the DFDA that may the involve health and safety matters affecting ADF personnel are reported in the Judge Advocate General's annual report in a range of categories, and cannot be specifically identified in the form required by the honourable Member without expenditure of considerable resources. (2) No specific statistics are available to answer this question, however (a) Over and above the Defence Organisation's internal inspections and audits, Comcare undertakes audits. In 1996/97 10 planned investigations and 23 reactive investigation were conducted by Comcare. In 1997/989 planned investigations and 31 reactive investigations were conducted by Comcare. Once Comcare audits a Defence facility, a report of their findings is produced. This is passed to Defence, which takes action to rectify and respond to the findings. Head Defence Personnel Executive formally responds to Comcare advising what actions have been or will be taken by Defence as a result of the report. Comcare may also exercise their right to revisit an establishment. (b) The fines imposed as a result of DFDA cannot be directly attributed to health and safety matters without individually examining all ADF charge sheets and determining the specific circumstances relevant to the incident and this is not considered practical. (c) Compensation paid as a result of breaches of the DFDA cannot be determined without a time consuming and expensive review of all individual compensation claims. Longford Royal Commission: Fire Hose (Question No. 447) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 18 February 1999: (1) Has the Minister's attention been directed to evidence given to the Longford Royal Commission about the failures of the fire hose couplings used at Esso's Longford plant.

(2) Does the project require an environmental assessment; if so, (a) has it been conducted and (b) what form of assessment was or will be used. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (2) Yes. The Citylink Extension proposal was designated by my Department on 23 December 1998 under the Commonwealth Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (the Act). The Department of the Environment and Heritage, which administers that legislation, is currently seeking details from the proponent regarding the proposal and the level of environmental assessment undertaken by the Victorian Government. Upon receipt of this information, the need for furCouplings ther environmental assessment under the Act will then be considered.

(2) In which cases does his Department have records of the discussions. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In order to answer the Honourable Member's question, extensive research would be required into Departmental files over a period of many years. In view of my Department's work on other priorities for the Government, including the preparation for publication of historical documents on Australia's relations with Indonesia concerning East Timor, it does not currently have the resources to undertake this research.
