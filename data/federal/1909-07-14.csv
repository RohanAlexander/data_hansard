3,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It would appear from the regulations that old-age pensions are ""not to be paid under Commonwealth administration except at post-offices. In my electorate are a number of old persons, living 12 miles from a post-office, and it is very difficult for them, by reason of infirmity and other causes, to get to it. Under State administration, the police, when on patrol, were instructed to pay pensions in these and similar cases. Will the Treasurer allow that system to continue? The matter is of great importance, not only to those on whose behalf I have asked the question, but, doubtless, to many others.",14

5,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"East Sydney) [2.39] - On e of the rcost striking features of this debate seems to me to be this, that it has been almost entirely confined to the affairs of the past, and has borne but very slightly ""upon' the concerns of the future. That might be an appropriate state of things for an old, decaying nation; but it is not a healthy characteristic in the political affairs of a young nation like Australia. Before I enter upon some rather controversial topics, I wish to say that I saw a great deal to admire in the manner, in which the late Prime Minister, the honourable member for Wide Bay, administered the duties of his high and responsible position; arid I am happy to say that his Ministers, generally, with one or two rather' serious acts by way of exception, displayed, as I thought, a degree of efficiency and ability which is deserving of the fullest recognition. I also think that the irritation which has been displayed by my honourable friends bas had some basis of justification. It is rather annoying, after giving five or six years of solid support, to receive five or six months of unsubstantial support in exchange. But we must remember that our friends opposite are not made of the ordinary political clay. They must remember that they represent the highest traditions of political disinterestedness and patriotism; that to them office was an infliction"", and that they desire nothing more than the opportunity of - serving others in great public undertakings. I rather regret, therefore, that my honourable friends have recently shown the ordinary characteristics of ordinary politicians. One of the most serious complaints which . have been made from the other side is a fear as to the future of Liberalism in Australia under this new fusion of parties. They point to one or two individuals upon this side of the House as representing a policy of Conservatism, and they profess to be gravely alarmed as to our political future. Considering that the leader of the present Government was looked up to until recently by them as one of the strongest - exponents of the most advanced Liberalism in Australia-considerin g that for six years the honourable and learned Prime Minister was theguide, counsellor, and friend of the Labour party-surel y they should rejoice that this advanced leader in Liberal politics has been reinforced by some honourable gentlemen who at former periods were in a state of more or less antagonism to him. belief opposite seems to be that the one or two gentlemen who are supposed to be Conservatives will direct the Government. That is a perfectly natural feeling on the part of those who have been accustomed to direct Governments for such a lengethened period of time; but I feel that the result will be, not the weakening of Australian Liberalism, but in the direction of strengthening it. Indeed, I believe it is a mere political trick of the most obvious kind to endeavour to describe any party, either in the Federal or in the State arena, as a Conservative party. There is no such party in Australia. There is no - country in the world where the people are less paralyzed by reverence for the past. There is no people in the world who have fewer fears as to the future. If I were compelled to point to a community which represents political progress in its most rapid and fearless guise, I should point to the political community of Australia. Our friends opposite go so far as to accuse honourable members on this side of favouring a policy of starvation. I regret the attempts which are being made to create a class feeling in the politics of Australia.",14
6,Mr MCDOUGALL,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who started it?,15
7,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Whereve r started, any. such attempt represents, not the highest, but the lowest, form of political controversy. I suppose'there is no one in this House who has to forget more than I have to forget in order to sit where I do. For seven or eight years I had the dubious privilege of sitting upon the other side, but during that long period I am not aware that I filled the air with many lamentations. When my honourable friends. profess such horror at sudden withdrawals of polical affection. I remember a time when I thought the delightful ardour with which the present Prime Minister regarded me cooled in an altogether too rapid and mysterious fashion. But if I sought for sympathy, for some expression of moral reprobation, I sought it in vain in the direction of my honourable friends. Their political conscience bas become suddenly tender. When the Prime Minister reverted to his old love, Labour took the erring head to its bosom in a rapture of perfect reconciliation. The Prime Minister has one great virtue. I do not know in the public life of Australia a man who possesses a more loving and affectionate disposition, but that disposition has, of course, the defect of its qualities, and The there is no doubt that the Prime Minister, during the last few years, has been guilty of a. series of political attachments equallv sudden and equally amorous. But when my honourable friends seek to attack the honourable gentleman-and I think the very able and learned member for West Sydney left nothing to be said in the shape of indignation, invective, or satire- I cannot help remembering that the Prime Minister can advance two pleas which are familiar in the divorce courts of the country. The first plea is one of condonation. When the Prime Minister having suddenly left them for me, suddenly left me to rejoin them, he was received back, as I say, in a spirit of entire forgiveness. That is his plea of condonation. Then he has the further plea of cruelty and desertion. After three years-the second term of three years-of the most devoted and f a it h f u l service, the honourable member was driven out of thepolitical wigwam of the honourable member for Wide Bay into the wilderness, without a word of explanation. At that time, when the Labour party sought to displace the Deakin Administration, some of our friends thought we should go behind the Ministry and save them. But I remem-bered the delightful anecdote with which the Prime Minister recently amused the Labour party, and which bore on the aboriginal method of contracting matrimonial alliances by brute force. I said that in order to bear this beauteous one - I mean the Prime Minister-trium phantly into our camp, we must adopt the free use of the club. The club has been used; and we rejoice in the new alliance which has been contracted between the gifted leader of the present Administration and the united Liberals of Australia. So fa r as I am concerned, in saying these things I have said everything I have to say with reference to the past. There is only one basis for any loyal and honest political fusion. At all times it is a strain, and sometimes a great strain; but there is only one basis on which this fusion can be justified, or on which it can succeed, and that is the basis of forgetting the antagonistic feelings of the past, endeavouring loyally to join forces in advancing the public interest. Personalities soon recede into oblivion, just as personages soon dissolve into dust. There are only two great objects worthy of public ambitions and parliamentary service, and these are to advance, in the best possible way, the interests of good government, and to advance, in the best possible way, sound principles of legislation. I believe that the union which has been arrived at on this side of the House is calculated to promote those great national benefits. For that reason I hope, whilst exercising a spirit of perfect independence, to be able to give the present Government thoroughly loyal and earnest support. I cannot forget that there are in and behind this Government a large number of my own old friends and supporters. When honourable members seek to draw some artificial line of Liberalism, as the honourable member for Gippsland did the other night. I should like to ask them what line of Liberalism divides men like the Prime Minister, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Minister of External Affairs, from men like the Minister of Defence, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, and the Postmaster-General?",15
8,Mr HALL,MOTION OF WANT OF,There is no line !,16
9,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"There is no real line. Once the fiscal question is set aside there no substantial line dividing the Liberals whom I have named. When my friends opposite become so impatient as to the sinking of the fiscal question, which has been agreed to in this case, may I remind them that there is no party here which has sunk the fiscal question so persistently and so scientifically as the Labour party of Australia has done. Is it not marvellous that ardent Free Traders like the honourable member for West Sydney, Senator Pearce, the honourable member for Grey, and, once, the honourable member for Wide Bay, should be able to co-operate loyally for so many years with the most rabid Protectionists in the Labour party? If they had not done so the Labour movement would have been impossible; and, surely, they can allow their political opponents the same privilege?",16
10,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,So long as the right honourable member avows it !,16
11,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Coolgardie is another one to whom I might have referred as a sound Free Trader; and surely, if my honourable friends opposite, in the pursuit of high political objects and, great national changes, to which they attach importance, have been able to work amicably together, the same privilege, with the same objects'in view, should be allowed to honourable members on this side of the House. May I be allowed to say that I listened to the speech of the honourable member for Gippsland with great pleasure? It was a speech of real ability, animated, I am sure, by honourable feeling. But may I also suggest to that honourable member that, as in the case of too many gentlemen whose politics have been fashioned in Victoria, the term Liberalism would appear to be defined in his view by the geographical-boundaries of his State? Liberalism is altogether too broad a term, and represents too great a principle, for any such limitation. Liberalism was not invented in Victoria; Liberalism in Australia is the child of the great Liberalism of the Mother Country, and the child of Liberalism throughout the nations. One of the points about this fusion which recommends it most strongly to me is that, for. the future, the term Liberal in Australian politics will have a broader meaning and a more generous sound-that this consolidation of Liberal forces will, I hope and believe, work effectively in our future political life. May I say, in all sincerity, is that, in my deliberate view, aided as it is by a considerable degree of political experience, that if there is one party which' should not lament this new development it is the Labour party of Australia? OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",16
12,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is the party which for so many years occupied a position in this Parliament altogether unworthy of its strength'and its ability, and, if it has a future, equally unworthy of its future. Surely my friends opposite will feel a greater degree of satisfaction in standing together shoulder to shoulder with a leader of their own choosing. Whether we regard the matter from that point of view or from another, we are now on the threshold of a stage of Australian politics which will reflect greater credit on all parties. To show how awkward the honourable member for Gippsland's definition of Liberalism is, I may point out that if there is any one principle to which he devotes his undoubted abilities, it is the principle of Protection. If the honourable member went to reside in the Mother Country, who are the men with whom he wouid find himself associated in the political struggles there? He would have to join the Tories of England. This reflection upon some of us is equally a reflection upon honourable members of the Labour party who hold similar fiscal views. The fact is that Protection, which may be in the estimation of many patriotic men-and in the estimation of most nations it is- a patriotic policy, is 1 not one that can ever mark the line between one set of advanced political thinkers and another. It has never done so.",17
13,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,No cheers from the Government benches now.,17
14,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member who excites my greatest admiration, is the honourable member for Hume. Great men like Gladstone could evolve from a position in which they were the hope of the Tories into another in which they became the hope of the Radicals of England. In the course of a long, active, fearless, and honourable public life, they could work conscientiously from one extreme to the other, without any suspicion of insincerity or of mercenary motive. That very distinguished public man, who is now, ""unfortunately, shattered in health- Mr Joseph Chamberlain-describe d an evolution in a precisely opposite direction. He began as one of the most advanced Radicals in England and ended as a trusted Conservative leader. That was an evolution in an opposite direction, yet who would endeavour to cast discredit upon either of those distinguished men, because, in the course of a useful and intense public life, their views altered? But the one great statesman of the world, against whom no such reproach can be levelled, is the honourable member for Hume. If his own version of his political career be the correct one, he began as a fossil, and a fossil he remains. I know the honourable member too well, however, not to be aware that that does not justly describe his public career, and I trust that, notwithstanding the strength of the antagonism that prevailed between us for many years, there is no element of personal bitterness in our fight.",17
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , but I brought down the right honourable member every time.",17
16,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable member did, that only shows what a rogue elephant can do when he gets his feet on you.",17
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I remember the right honourable member on one occasion did something in regard to his leadei.,17
18,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I hope that the honourable member will allow me to say a word or two. May I remind him that in the course of eight and a half years of Federation he has had six and a half years of high Ministerial office?,17
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is nothing.,17
20,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is there no point at which the honourable member's appetite can be satisfied ?,17
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not take office for the sake of filthy lucre.,17
22,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Order !,17
23,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is there no stage at which the honourable member is prepared to give others a chance?,17
24,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then the right honourable member is merely seeking office?,17
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , he is after the money. I never go for that:",17
26,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,We all admit that the honourable member for Hume is the one disinterested figure in national politics,17
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is the truest statement that the right honourable member has made.,17
28,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And that he enjoys a corresponding reputation in all quarters of Australia. I wish to show that the honourable member for Hume, to whom I have never devoted very much attention, is really one of the great statesmen of the world. No other public man has ever performed, a larger number, of political somersaults than he has done; but I am bound to .give him credit for having nearly always fallen on his feet. I can remember the time when the honourable member was a confirmed Free Trader.",17
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I was never a Free Trader.,18
30,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I mention these matters only because,18
31,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The right honourable member is now going into the past.,18
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is time that some one did so.,18
33,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have listened in this House year after year to allusions to the past without taking notice of them. I intend, however, to take some notice of them on the present occasion.",18
34,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,The right honourable member said that he would not do so.,18
35,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why drag up the past ?,18
36,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Because I am not made of the pure political porcelain that is to be seen on the Opposition benches; I am merely a. man with the ordinary feelings of humanity. The honourable member for Hume was'a member of a Government in New South Wales that proposed a 5 per cent, revenue duty.",18
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Twenty-tw o years ago.,18
38,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , but that is where the evolution comes in. The honourable member desired to make us believe that evolution had left no marks upon him. As a matter of fact, however, lie was a member of a Free Trade Government which, with a deficiency in the finances, proposed a revenue duty' of 5 per cent. An accusation was made that they were sneaking in Protection, but the honourable member and his Government emphatically repudiated the statement.",18
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,The right honourable member said that the proposal meant Protection.,18
40,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"When I deal with the honourable member I endeavour to get as near Holy Writ as possible for my authority. Here is the report of a speech delivered by Sir Patrick Jennings, the head of the Government of which he was a member, in regard to the proposal to impose a revenue duty of s per centWc have not put a sufficient amount of duty on anv of these articles to "" sneak in ' Protection. WeAnd the word "" w e "" included my honourable frienddisavowed Protection at the timeSir Patrick Jennings was referring to the last electionWe disavow it now. Was the honourable member and his Government sneaking in Protection under cover of declarations of that kind ?",18
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is a very cowardly way of trying to prove that I was a Free Trader. I was a Protectionist all the time.,18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member should ""take his gruel.""",18
43,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,r hope that the honourable member for Hume will allow us that freedom of speech which he cla'ims.,18
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then the honourable member should quote words from my own mouth, and not the words of others.",18
45,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We find that on the occasion in question, the honourable member's leader-and we know that loyalty to his leader is the honourable member's strong point-said I am not here to fall back from what the avowed policy of the Government has been all along, and will continue to be as long as we remain in office. I can account for the honourable member's sudden conversion to the policy of Protection. Up to this time Free Trade had been the policy of all political parties in the State. A few months later-at the elections, at the beginning of 1887-Si r Henry Parkes raised the Free Trade flag, and it became necessary for the honourable member for Hume to evolve with startling rapidity. He then evolved into Protectionism. To show how mixed, fiscally, the honourable member became a few months later, let me repeat something which he said on the 3rd May, 1887.",18
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Twenty-tw o years ago !,18
47,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is slow in all his movements, and takes time to evolve. Referring to Sir Henry Parkes, he then saidHe upset all his previous declarations that he would accept nothing from Victoria, but. in reality, he was instructed by the people of that Colony, which, unfortunately, is Protectionist, and, so, far behind New South Wales.",18
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,At that period it was true.,18
49,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is only fair to say that : the honourable member was then half grub and half butterfly, because, in other parts of the speech, he enunciated the soundest Protectionist principles. There is another matter in regard to which he has performed a striking, and, I think, meritorious, evolution. I am not impugning the sincerity of his conversion ; I merely say that he is a far more healthy political transformation than he imagines himself to be. The question of giving equality of electoral power was before the New South Wales Parliament, and the strongest opponent of the proposals of the Government of the day was the honourable member for Hume. He said, in reference to the Seats Re-distribution Bill One great objection I have to this the distribution of seats is to be on the basis of absolute equality of representation. He pointed out that in New Zealand and in Victoria the people in the country had a much larger share of political power than those in the cities. He showed whait he thought should be the difference between man in the country and a man in the town by sayingI think that three electors in Sydney should have only the same voting power as two in country.",18
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear; but let the right honourable member give my reasons. They are on record.",19
51,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am speaking of a principle, not of the honourable member's reasons. I thought it was a most sacred principle of Australian Democracy that each man and woman should have precisely the same share of political power! To the honourable member's observation, Sir Henry Parkes made this replyThat is a very undemocratic note to strike. The honourable member voted against the Bill , on the ground, amongst others, that the principle of equality of manhood was recognised. The honourable member is now one of those who believe that the utmost freedom should be given to men to combine in political associations for the promotion of their own interests, whether in or out of the Public Service. Upon that he is now sound. But when he was Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, and Minister for Railways, prior to the appointment of Railwavs Commissioners, a railway association was established. The question whether there should be such an association within the Public Service was keenly debated, and the honourable gentleman, when challenged upon, his attitude, was careful to explain that the only terms on which he would recognise a railway association were that its members must not deal with rates of pay or hours of labour.",19
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear !",19
53,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,An industrial association without power to deal with rates of pay or hours of labour ! That is one of those robust explanations of a real Tory principle which emanated from the honourable member in those times.,19
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did not the right honourable member support me?,19
55,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I never supported the honBill is that orable member in his life.,19
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,In what year was the occurrence just referred to?,19
57,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It was about the same old time. If there is a subject upon which the honourable member is now strong, and in regard to which he has endeared himself to the women of Australia, it is female sufa frage. That he regards as the sacred and inalienable right of female humanitynow! But, in 1890, when an Electoral Bill was introduced, the honourable member the declared that he could not accept female suffrage.",19
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear. I stated afterwards the reasons why I had changed my mind.",19
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Change d his mind ! Surely the honourable member never did that ?""",19
60,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hav e I not said that the honourable member falls on his feet after each of his somersaults. I am not imputing anything else to him. Another subject upon which he is now emphatic is the right of poor workers to protection from their employers. But when, on the 2nd September, 1890, there was a discussion in the New South Wales Parliament as to whether a sailor or his relatives should be allowed to recover at law if injury or death were caused to him by reason of the unseaworthiness of the ship he was on, the question arose whether recovery should be possible if he had not given notice before he went on the voyage that the ship was unseaworthy- a thing which an ordinary sailor could not be expected to do. But this is what the honourable member thought on the subject. He said that the unfortunate sailorWould know whether he was going to sea in a rotten ship, and, if so, he should give notice at once. There ought to be protection for theemployer in cases of that kind.",19
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,You coward.,19
62,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am quoting the honourable member's words.,20
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who passed the law to stop that business?,20
64,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I ask the honourable member for Hume to withdraw the remark which he has just made.,20
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If I have said thing unparliamentary I withdraw it ; but if you will allow me, sir-and I shall not do it unless you concur-to speak of the matter to which the right honourable member is referring, I shall add that I introduced the law which prevents rotten ships from going out of Newcastle and other harbors.",20
66,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I take this opportunity to mention that, when honourable members are called upon to withdraw a remark, it is proper for them to do so without adding an explanation which may, perhaps, be"" intended to have the effect of altogether destroying the worth of the withdrawal.",20
67,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I wish to give the honourable member every latitude in the matter. In spite of his efforts subsequently to secure the seaworthiness of vessels, he then thought that if a sailor went away in a vessel that was unseaworthy, without giving notice of its condition, the employer should be protected against any claim.",20
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,That rect.,20
69,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member had not then arrived at his present state of evolution. The words which I have read were uttered on the 2nd September, 1890, and are to be found in the New South Wales Hansard reports of that date, page 3376. I do not, like the honourable member, make vague charges, imputing all sorts of misconduct to others, without giving any authority. Perhaps the most remarkable proof of the honourable member's- I shall not say inat all. sincerity, but evolution-is this : When the great Federal movement came on, he one of the leading Protectionists in New South Wales. Yet he joined in a fiscal truce. To do what? To come under the leadership of Sir Edmund Barton, who was then fighting the battle of Federation !",20
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not thing of the sort.,20
71,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,This is a case where press may be at fault. It is only fair say that.,20
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I , not Sir Edmund champion. Barton, was Premier.",20
73,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I remember now that the honourable member shifted Sir Edmund for Barton. He performed a very dubious manoeuvre. Instead of acting as the loyal supporter of Sir Edmund Barton, who was his leader, he suddenly established a room of his own, and Sir Edmund was invited to walk downstairs, while he walked upstairs. We are told now that the honourable member, before he was able to displace me from any- the Premiership in New South Wales, gave solemn assurances to the Labour party of the day as to the obedient service he would render if they would be good enough to vote him into power.",20
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not correct. Not one word that the right honourable member has stated in regard to myself and Sir Edmund Barton is correct.,20
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is all absolutely true.,20
76,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What was stated by Mr. Nielsen, now member for Boorowa in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly ?",20
77,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,He was not at the time a member of the New South Wales Parliament.,20
78,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I know that he was not; but he afterwards became a member, and made a public statement in the Assembly a few days ago. Other people besides members of Parliament sometimes know things. If the honourable member for Barrier, who is not corwas at the time a prominent member of the Labour party in New South Wales, will say that there was no sort of understanding of any kind with the honourable member for Hume before the party determined to put him in power, it will be enough for me.",20
79,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I know of nothing official. I know of nothing from the Labour party, whatever may be said of individual members of the party.",20
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,There was nothing The right honourable member was put out of office because he deliberately paid was £ 3 6 9 to a member of the House.,20
81,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I ask honourable members not to convert this speech into a dialogue, and to be content to leave any corrections which they may think ought to be made until the right honourable member for do anyEast Sydney has finished.",20
82,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The other night the honour the. able member for Hume made a great attack to upon me, as though I had been an enemy of the early closing movement, and he its",20
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,So I was.,20
84,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The line I then took-and a very good Liberal reason-wa s this : I considered that the hours of employment in all shops ""should be strictly regulated and limited. But I did not want to play into the hands of the big shopkeepers of Sydney by closing the little suburban shops. None knows better than the honourable member for Newcastle that there was a great dispute as to whether all shops should be closed at a fixed hour, or whether there should be such a reform in the hours of labour as would enable the man whose wife, perhaps, attended to a shop whose trade was done mostly in the evening, to keep it open a little longer. All the big shopkeepers of Sydney went for the proposal of the honourable member for Hume, because it crushed out the small shops in the suburbs. I mention that to show that there was room for legitimate difference of opinion in the matter. wish to refer to the honourable member's greatest exploit. That was in reference to Federation. The honourable member joined this great fight and this fiscal truce to enable the battle to be won for Federation by Sir Edmund Barton, but he was opposing Federation all the time himself.",20
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I the kind.,21
86,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does the honourable member say that he never opposed Federation? . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Yes ; but openly, for two reasons.",21
87,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Of course, and I opposed it at one stage for three. orable member was a leading champion of the anti-Bill agijation, and then calmly walked into office, where he remained for six years afterwards, as a loyal child of Federation. No one objects to that. I simply point to it as a case of patriotic evolution. I come now to a recent point. The honourable member produced the other night a long list of what he said were anomalies in the Customs Tariff that must be immediately rectified.",21
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"A i d I am going to move in that direction shortly, also.",21
89,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,- I hope I shall be allowed to proceed.,21
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I hope the honourable member will be allowed to tell the truth.,21
91,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member tries hard not to be vulgar, but he never succeeds. He was fearfully in earnest about ' the Tariff when' I led a Coalition Government. The Tariff was the burning question of the day, and various Christmas dinners were said to be in jeopardy. But within a short time afterwards there was a project for a Government consisting of some remnants of the honourable member's friends, and I think a majority of the Labour party. It came to nothing, but there was a. project of that sort. Where would the honourable member's list of higher duties have been in a Government which included the honourable member for West Sydney, the honourable member for Coolgardie, the honourable member for Barrier, and Senator Pearce?",21
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I could not have passed the Tariff without the help of the Labour party.,21
93,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"May I say that to the Now I people of New South Wales? Can I say that the honourable member for West Sydney helped the honourable member ""for Hume to pass his Protectionist duties?",21

Surely they do not say that the Free Trade members of that party are The honmere political shams, who, under cover of a profession of one principle, would treacherously bring about the triumph of another? I would not say that about any member of the Labour party. I am happy to say that I have always been able to give the members of the Labour party, personally, every credit for their independence and public spirit. I have never had any personal quarrel with any of them.",21
96,Dr MALONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who could quarrel with' the right honourable member?,21
97,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is what I say of them, but the worse of it is that I get nothing but amiability from them. However, I would rather be on those friendly terms with my fellow members than occupy any office in this Parliament. That is mv idea of the pleasure of public life. I do not propose to range over the whole field of politics on this occasion, but I think I ought to refer briefly to one or two of the great questions of the day. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The right honourable member has not done with has he?",21
98,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is there anything left the honourable member?,22
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I only ask that the electorate. right honourable member will be here when I reply to him. I will scarify him.,22

102,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am obliged to the orable member for Lantr for the reminder, but I wanted to spare the honourable memnot ber for Hume three or four other things. The honourable member would now shrink with horror from the project of vesting he has of going to heaven. either our railways or our tramways in syndicate of capitalists, but there was a strong agitation in Sydney, represented by a number of private individuals, who wanted to take over the tramways, and had, I believe, the money ready to do it Who was the champion at that time of the - syndicate of capitalists who wished to the public trams of that city ? The able member for Hume. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - And Want.",22

106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,He was one of the Igreatest.,22
107,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then , on the question of the Sydney trams, the honourable member was something else. He backed up that :attempt of a syndicate to transfer the trams from a public to a private ownership.",22

109,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am only speaking of political evolution of which a man ' able. We had before us one of the most - delightful specimens of - evolution the world has ever seen when were debating the choice of a Capital site. The honourable member at that time was favouring four sites at the same time! They were Albury, Tumut, another with some unpronounceable name, and Tooma. think Tooma was the fourth' string.",22
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable me yet, member is wrong again.",22
111,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not know the names of of these places, but the honourable member certainly advocated several sites in his He voted for Albury as the only site for the Capital of Australia, although for weeks before, and for weeks That is a double-faced sort of evolution to which I did not think the honourable member Notoriously, he was asking the House to adopt one site, honand when Albury was put forward on the first ballot, one of the first votes, if the only one for it , was that of the honourable member himself. Yet he had no more idea of standing up for Albury than It is' only a fair to say that, in referring to the honoronce able member's changes of public opinion, I am simply placing him on the same pedestal as one of the greatest men of recent years-Willia m Ewart Gladstone. It is . not necessarily a reflection on a public man to sav that his views have changed. I berun lieve that on more occasions than one my honorown views have changed. I wish now to glance briefly at one or two of the leadMr Jack ing matters before us. The two great Departments with which the Federation his was intrusted apart from the Customs, were those of Post and Telegraphs and Detofence. In the administration of those two Departments the Federal authority has proved an abject failure. I do not want to put the blame on to this shoulder or on that. But, looking back over the past seven years, I say that if there is one fact more apparent in the public eye than another, it is that the Federal Parliament and Government have been absolutely incapable of placing the Post and Telegraph Department upon a sound basis. Now that we have a solid, powerful party on this side, now that the Prime Minister has the honour of leading so large a number of men, all qf whom, I believe, he will find loyally following him-wit h the independence the which we naturally possess as members of is capa Liberal party-no w that he has the power, now that he is surrounded by the instantaneous colleagues whom I see before me, I dewe voutly trust that that Department will be the subject of one or two reforms. In the first place, the service must be made efficient. In the second place, the revenue must be made sufficient, and in making the I revenue sufficient, those who use the telephones most should pay the most. The one reform that is wanted to make the telephone service efficient, and to put upon a proper financial basis, is that those people who use telephones to such an enormous extent in their business affairs, should be required to pay a proportionate amount for the services rendered. There is another principle, in harmony with the one I have just put forward, which ought to be kept in view. In adjusting the burdens of that Department, a sharp discrimination should be exercised in favour of settlers in remote districts. The pioneer class of Australia, who are out in the bush, cut off from the comforts of great centres of population, I would treat with the utmost liberality. I pass away from that subject to the subject of Defence. I think we shall all agree, without endeavouring to locate the blame for the unfortunate position, that the Department of Defence is another which has remained in a state of absolute inefficiency. When I spoke, a few months ago, looking upon serious danger to Australia as an affair of, perhaps, ten years hence, I was ignorant of the startling developments which have since come to light with reference to, if not the greatest power, certainly the greatest military power in the world. confess now, in the light of knowledge which has come to me, that I cannot put off for ten years, the grave dangers to Australia to which I referred. I feel that they are more pressing than I thought they were, and I give the honourable member for West Sydney every credit for seeing much further ahead than I , or most of us, did, The honourable member for years has had upon the business-paper a notice of motion which I still think may be, perhaps, going too far ; but in the light of the facts as we know them today, I cheerfully acknowledge that the honourable member took a course for which he deserves public thanks. He deserves every credit for remarks which he made, but which I , at the time, thought to be entirely overstrained. The fact is that the question of defence can no longer be treated theoretically; but has become one of immediate and practical importance. am, glad that an Imperial Defence Conference is to be held. Some of us who are not military or naval experts, can only learn as other laymen do, and the more we learn of the question the more clearly do we see that Imperial defence is just as much an Australian question as Australian defence is an Imperial question. The true dangers do not lie in these remote seas; the decisive battle will not be fought here, but near the very heart of the Empire. it The first thing we have to remember is that the fate of the British Empire will be decided in a few hours, many thousands of miles away, by means of terrible engines of war, which cannot be manufactured at a moment's notice. We have to face this fact, and I congratulate the Minister of Defence upon being, I believe, the first in Australia to express himself in favour of holding a Conference. It is the simple truth, I think, that the Minister of Defence, at a time when he had no idea of the fate in store for him. made an earnest plea for the holding of an I m perial Defence Conference. But tiiere is one lesson-we do not need to go to an I m perial Conference to learn. There are one or two simple principles by which we can test questions of military administration. Nearly the whole merit of the administration of our Defence Department has consisted in the number of valuable minutes written by Ministers. We have the most beautiful schemes and magnificent projects on paper, but they never materialize. But we have to remember that if we are really going in for the business of war, and preI parations for war, we must have something beyond mere skeleton schemes of defence. Our regiments of infantry and artillery must not be without the best of weapons and proper equipment, or even without reserve weapons and equipment, in readiness for the wicked waste of war if that calamity should befall us. Anything less will never mean defence, and can result only in disaster. Overlapping the Commonwealth and State domains, are several great questions. There are the questions of finance, the industrial powers of the States and the Commonwealth, and immigration. May I take the liberty of saying that I suppose there is not a more earnest believer in immigration; but I have watched with very great dislike a process of exaggerated statement which has amounted to positive deception. I do not desire to see people lured to Australia on false pretences; I do not desire to see the I lowest methods of commercial advertising applied to the great affairs of this country. I feel that this great national necessity is in serious danger of being discredited by the questionable methods which are being employed in some quarters. I am glad to see that the Minister of Defence has taken up in real earnest the question of physical culture, which lies much nearer than some of us think to the heart of the problem of the defence of this land. But there is a still higher form of enterprise, either of State or Federal concern, and that .consists in the development of the mental resources of Australia. When shall we realise in the actual affairs of government that the greatest factor in the future of this Continent, is not to be found in our mineral wealth, the richness of our soil, or the size of our territory ? The real wealth of Australia lies more within the mental powers of the people than in any other sphere, and I should like to see some sort of change which would have the result that there could not be superior talent in the most obscure and distant home in the bush which State enterprise could not reach, whose path it would not smooth. greatest task of all in the building of this nation is the task of developing to their highest pitch the intellectual possibilities the people. In regard to the Northern Territory, I desire to repeat the statements I have made on previous occasions. I have looked very caref u l l y at the provisions of the agreement, and I am quite prepared to repay to South Australia every penny that the Northern Territory has cost her. But I absolutely decline to fetter the Commonwealth in this transaction with any scheme of railway policy. That introduces an element into the transaction which, so far as I can at present see, will meet with the strongest opposition from me.  will keep the Northern Territory !",22
112,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We wish her well. I certainly think that South Australia is entitled to every penny that the Territory has cost her; but I am not willing to tie the Commonwealth to 'the construction of 1,100 miles of railway leading from nowhere to nowhere.",24
113,Mr ROBERTS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Regarde d in the light of defence, the honourable member will find that the railway leads to the front door of Australia.",24
114,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"An y Federal argument in favour of any aspect of the agreement will receive the utmost consideration at my hands; I am simply guarding myself against this agreement being made use of for the purpose of effecting some internal purposes of State railway service. If there is any Federal justification for the railway I shall say no more, because then the work might be absolutely necessary. It is right,- I think, to intrude for a. moment on what may be considered within the domain of State politics. Honourable members opposite have in their platform a very strong plank, which may be brought into service in a revenue producing shape, but the avowed intent of which is to carry out the work of breaking up the big estates of Australia. I do not think the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to do this; but, although a member of the Federal Parliament, I feel I am entitled to say, in the most public way, that those large landed estates must either be taxed out of existence or resumed out of existence. Without any reflection on the owners, many of whom have done a great deal to build up The the industrial progress of Australia, I consider that the time has come when these estates must be transformed into holdings of suitable for the purposes of single families. I do not favour the taxing process, and I shall give one or two reasons why. In the first place, as coming from us, for what is really the supreme purpose, I think the taxation is beyond our powers.",24
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I take it the right honourable gentleman is referring to large estates near centres of population ?,24
116,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not pretend to enter into any details, and I am merely using general terms.",24
117,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did the right honourable member not say some time ago that we had the power?,24
118,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We have the power of taxa tion- I do not question that for a moment. We have the power of direct taxation, which includes the taxing of land just as much as it does the taxing of incomes. The only point I make is that the breaking up of large estates is a matter for the political evolution of the States themselves-that it is not a fiscal question, but a land question, and should be taken up by the States. But I would say that those in the States who do not take up this question in a serious light, do not deserve for a moment to hold the power. My objection to the exercise of the taxing power is, first, that, for the object of breaking up estates, it is beyond our province, and, secondly, that it is altogether too slow and unsatisfactory a process. The next question is that of the policy of resumption ; and I entirely believe in that policy. But I have no hesitation in saying that, as it is being now carried out, it is a. weak and foolish policy. In the first place, it is altogether too slow; in the second place, it will allow the evil to grow again; and, in the third place, it sets up the values of lands which have not been resumed, as against the State itself.",24
119,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,When will the right honourable member join us?,25
120,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I desire to show my honourable friends opposite that my methods are absolutely diverse from theirs. I am at one with them in recognising the gravity of the evil, and in recognising that it is a curse which should be removed from the national prospects of Australia. I wish to say that my proposal, if I had the opportunity to submit one, - would follow roughly these lines: In the first place, the policy of resuming one estate after another is singularly weak and inconclusive, for the reasons I have mentioned. Most of these estates have been built up against the policy of the law-man y of them have become large estates by a manipulation of the declared land policy of the country. It is easy for me, not being in State politics, to say these things, but I take the full responsibility for my utterances. I should like to see an Act passed in the States declaring the existence of these large estates to be contrary to public policy-declarin g that every one of them will be gradually resumed, and that if the owners will not voluntarily subdivide, so as to unlock those estates for the benefit of Australians, and of people coming to this country, the States will themselves unlock the lands. I desire to leave to the owners the alternative of dealing with the lands in their own way.",25
121,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Where is the right honourable gentleman's red flag?,25
122,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"When an honourable member has strong views as to a state of things which is not good for the country, I think it is his duty to make no secret of those views.",25
123,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Look at the solemn faces on the Government side!,25
124,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,All I can say is that I have ten times more hope of seeing this thing done under Liberal auspices than under Socialist auspices.,25
125,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does the right honourable member refer to the present Government when he talks of-"" Liberal auspices ""?",25
126,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I regret to say that a large multitude assembled again today to listen to a continuance of the speech of the honourable member for Gwydir, and that they have been bitterly disappointed.",25
127,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not think that is quite correct.,25
128,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In view of my previous remarks about physical culture, let me say to my honourable friend that I never saw a more magnificent proof of physical culture than the honourable member gave us during those memorable nine hours. My only regret is that the mental equipment was not commensurate with the physical training.",25
129,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I have in my hands at this moment proof to the contrary.,25
130,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I ' hope the honourable member will forgive me if I have wounded his feelings. But to return to the land question, what, may I ask, is at the root of the evil? What has been the main animating feature of land owning and the aggregation of large estates? At the heart of that aggregation is the magnificent opportunity that it offers to reap wealth out of the national energies and the national development. I think that in any Bill such as that I haw mentioned there should be a clause providing that the value of the land to be gradually resumed shall in no case exceed the value at the time of the passing of the Act. That would take the heart out of the practice of holding on to the land, and for the future, at all events, we should have none of the increment derived from the employment of the energies and wealth of the State going into the hands of those who possess that which is the main factor of all human wealth and national prosperity. I wish now to refer to charges that have been made by the Opposition against honourable members on this side, implying that the forces of the new fusion will be used for the purpose of aggrandizing the wealthier classes of the community.",25
131,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Look at the Employers' Federation.,25
132,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"May I suggest to the honourable member that it is most unfair to stigmatize a whole party by the name of a particular office that one member of it may occupy? How intensely indignant members of the Labour party are when a quotation from Marx, Bebel, or some other eminent Socialist, is said to represent their views. My honourable friends have often just reason to complain of the use that is made of such writings.",25
133,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The right honourable member has played his part in that sort of thing.,25
134,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"On the contrary, I have always taken the opposite view. I have always endeavoured to keep the fight against Socialism free from any injustice of that kind, because I know that there are views expressed by leading Continental Socialists that are entirely repugnant to the beliefs and policy of the Labour party of Australia. It is equally unfair to brand a whole party with the fact that some particular member of. that party happens to be this or that. Just as we have in this great Liberal party some who lag too far behind, so my honourable friends of the Labour party have among them some who go too fast. What do the Socialists say of the Labour party? Do they not denounce its members as facing-both-ways-as contemptible shams, pretending to believe in Socialism, but not having pluck to declare themselves? My honor- next time. able friends had better look nearer home; they will find supporting them at election time a number of anarchists. would dream of branding the Labour party as anarchists because a few anarchists support them as against us? It would be grossly unfair to do so, and it is equally unfair to attack any other great party on similar grounds. It is a mean way of trying to carry on a political fight.",25
135,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is done by a member of the honourable member's party now.,26
136,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We have not the easy way of manufacturing a political conscience that honourable members opposite have. They are the creatures of a political Litany enforced by Athanasian penalties. planks of a large platform are read out to them one by one, and they are asked to take their choice. They are told : "" If you accept every one of these planks, just as we have put them to you, your calling and election is sure; but if you will not accept all these planks, if you will not accept them as the voice of vour political conscience and your political judgment, you must be everlastingly damned."" the position of the Labour party. policy and their brains are found for them : their conscience is found for them, and if they stray a single hair's breadth off one of those planks they f all into the sea of political perdition.",26
137,Mr ROBERTS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Would to heaven some one would find a policy for honourable members opposite - as is any honourable member opposite.,26
138,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"May I point out what an easy sort of view my honourable friends have when they .speak as they do of my honourable friend, the member for Fawkner, who happens to be president of the Employers' Federation? My answer to them is that he was president of that Federation when a majority of the electors in his constituency returned him to this House. There is one employer to every ninety-nine workers in the Commonwealth, and what a manly, fearless policy it is to gird at each of these isolated individuals as a child of Satan, and to speak of every worker as the unspotted child of righteousness ! Imagine what I could do with material of that kind if I were on the other side ! At the last general election my opponent, Mr West, polled remarkably well. I have never had a Committee for twenty years-* the Mr JH CATTS - He will poll better",26
139,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Let us hope that he will. I know that I shall do so. I shall Yet who see to that. Honourable members opposite talk of the resources of plutocracy being at the disposal of our candidates, but in connection with the great contest in East Sydney at the last general election, I was astonished to see the streets filled with motors, cabs, and omnibuses, all for the supporters of the unspotted son of righteousness. I am sometimes described as the friend of the capitalist, and of the employers-m v enemies have always so described me in the political arena - bu t at the last general election, I had not a vehicle working for me until about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when some one sent along a The couple.",26
140,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The right honourable member's friends had plenty.,26
141,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"But they did not send them. Unfortunately the children of mammon supplied motors for the opposition candidate. After all, the sooner we recognise fairly and manfully what is the real line of cleavage between honourable members opThat is posite, and those on this side of the House, Their the better. The real line of cleavage is the line between those who believe in development by private enterprise as against those who believe in development, in the industrial world, by State monopolies. That is the line of cleavage. There are, on this side of the House, men who are just as genuine in their love of Australiajust as keen in their instincts of humanity But a broad line divides us. The question that separates us is, whether the development of Australia on lines of private enterprise is the right method of development, or whether the industrial development of Australia along lines of State control, is the proper one. There broad principle involved, and it is upon the battle must be fought. I was suspected of some sort of disposition to run counter to the fusion; but there is no man in Australia who ought to be. prouder of the fusion than I should be, since I laid its foundation in the battle that I fought before the tors three years ago. It was then that I for an alliance between Free Traders and Protectionists, sinking the fiscal issue, order to fight what, in my opinion, was the greatest battle of all : the battle of who believe in the development of Australia by private enterprise as against those believe in development by State monopoly. Whilst there are wrongs to be redressed, believe in using to the utmost the power of Parliament to redress them; whilst there abuses which ought to be suppressed, I Wales. believe in the right and power of Parliaproposed ment to suppress them. But if honourable sure. members study the genius of the human race, in its last analysis, I think they find that the evolution will be, not towards more and more State interference, but wards less and less. I can imagine a time raised. of elevation and expansion in human destiny, in which, of all artificial contrivances, that of the State will least promote genuine happiness and welfare of mankind. I wish, in conclusion, to offer a few marks that I hope will be considered by honourable members on all sides of the House, and I think they will allow me to presume so far as-to make the suggestion propose to make. Whilst I can understand the resentment shown by memelse to guide us. bers of the Labour party on the occurrence recently of what to them were startling changes, I hope that that personal aspect of the fight has passed away. Since we are on the threshold of the greatest battle ever fought in Australian history, we might well be content to fight that battle outside when the proper time comes. In the meantime, we might all for once recognise the rests of the great masses of the Australian community, and in the few months that are left to us this session endeavour lines of broad patriotism-no t dealing with questions that arouse keen party flict-to do something for the benefit whole community in connection with ques-tions of pressing urgency and",26
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"r wish to make a personal explanation, and to refer to several points in respect of which the right honourable member for East Sydney misrepresented me in the speech that he has just concluded. The right honourable memis a ber had a brief prepared for him by the that honourable member for Parramatta.",27
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I prepared no brief for him. The statement is incorrect.,27
144,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable member went back to the years 1885 and 1887, and accused me of then being eleca Free Trader, and of making statements called that showed that I was a Free Trader. As a matter of fact, however, he did not in quote one statement made by me to the effect that I was in favour of Free Trade. those He quoted remarks of Sir George Dibbs or Sir Patrick Jennings, but he did not who quote mine. I was in two Ministries before the fiscal question arose. When Sir I Patrick Jennings proposed duties of 5 per cent., it was the second occasion that duties are of that kind were proposed in New South I think some such duties were years before, but of this I am not I was a Minister, but not Treasurer, in the Government of the day.

The right honourable member misrepresented me. He spoke of the proposal to impose duties of 5 per cent, as a Free Trade proposal. He forgot to say that, later on, the Dibbs Government imposed duties of 10 and 15 per cent., which were regarded as Protectionist, and that ever since I have been in the van of the Protectionist cause.

The provision for which I voted required sailors who knew that their ships were rotten to give notice of the fact before going to sea. If a man did not know that his ship was rotten, how could he give notice? In 1897, following on the right honourable member's five years' termof office, I passed the most stringent Act to prevent rotten ships from being sent to sea. I did that without his assistance. One or two rotten ships may since have been purchased, to be sent to sea and sunk, but in the year before the Act was passed no fewer than eight such vessels had been sent, out from Newcastle and lost.

159,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member must not introduce new matter.,28
160,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Labour party joined with me in putting the right honourable member out of office, for no other reason than because he had broken his promise to the House. He accused me of having played fast and loose with Sir Edmund Barton. There are those here who know what happened. I never played false with any one. Sir Edmund Barton was not the fighting man who was I then needed in State politics. He led for a month or six weeks, but there would have been no real Opposition under his leadership, and therefore the party chose me, not because I intrigued for the position, but because I was ready to take forceful action. I think that I have now pretty conclusively explained the matters wherein I was misrepresented, and, in conclusion, sir, I can only point to the satire of calling the party opposite the Liberal partu.",28
161,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Bass') [4.20] - I have never felt more disappointed at anything which has taken place under Federation than at what has taken place here during the last few weeks. During the five and a half years I have occupied a seat in the House, I have been disappointed at the small amount of business which has been transacted. Why? Because of the system of party politics we have; the excess to which party politics are pushed, and the frequent introduction of New South Wales politics into our deliberations. I recognise that it is very difficult for any one to follow the honourable member for East Sydney. He always attracts a good house by reason of the humor he introduces into his speeches and the ability he displays in many things, especially in quoting from Hansard extracts which suit his particular point, and leaving out those things which do not, misrepresenting, by that method, statements which have been made. I feel at somewhat of a disadvantage knowing that the entertainment for the day has come to the an end, and that the audience is getting rather tired of listening to debate upon the position of public business. If the Commonwealth is to achieve the progress and prosperity which should distinguish a young country, the House will have to exclude from its deliberations personalities and State politics. And just as we are not expected to refer to another place in connection with the Parliament, so I consider that it would be a very good thing if we were prohibited from dealing here with State politics and the history or Australia.",28
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who began that in this debate?,29
163,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not desire any interjections from the honourable member, because I know his ability at putting speakers off the thread of their arguments. He is a very old politician, and very skilf u l in the art of interjecting and defending his own party. It is not for me to say who introduced State politics and historical allusions into this debate. I know that a lot of blame is attached to the Labour party for "" stone-walling."" I know that, for mere party purposes, the Labour party is accused of obstruction by certain newspapers. When I sat on a Ministerial bench for_ four days and four nights, without being able to go to my home, who was obstructing the business of the Commonwealth? Many members of this Ministry were then obstructing the present Prime Minister. If fie at that time was right, how is it that the then Opposition have gone over to his side? Is it because they have been attracted by the fruits of office or power, by the loaves and fishes? Or was f he party I was. then supporting wrong? If we are to conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth with business method the sooner we get rid of many of our present practices the better. A short time ago the honourable member for Ballarat was sitting on the Opposition bench, and when the Fisher Government brought down a Governor General's speech of thirty-two clauses, he 'said that it was only intended for the shop window, that it contained many clauses which could not be dealt with during this session. But the other evening he laid upon the table of the House a memorandum containing thirty-four proposals. If the speech was intended for the shop window, was not his own memorandum also intended for the shop window, rather than for practical purposes? It only shows how some men change their view with their position in the House. When a man is sitting on the Opposition bench he will say anything and everything against the actions, the motives, and the policy of the Administration, but as soon as he gets a place on the Treasury bench he will bring forward a policy containing a number of similar items, as the Prime Minister has done in his memorandum.",29
164,Mr KING OMALLEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is the curse of party politics.,29
165,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is the curse of party politics, and until the people awake to a sense of their responsibility, and to the amount of taxation which is put upon them by reason of party politics, the system will be continued. Unfortunately, we have to sit on one side of the House or the other, because there is no middle position. I may be accused of sitting on a rail or doing something of that sort, but it does not matter to me. I believe that every honourable member should accept the responsibility of his own action, and should not be bound hand and foot to one side or the other. A short time ago the honourable member for East Sydney twitted the honourable member for Hume with being a Free Trader, because his leader was a Free Trader. Are we to understand that every honourable member who sits on the Government side today is a Protectionist because the leader of that side is a Protectionist ? It is most peculiar to hear these taunts flung at different honourable members, because their leader happens to advocate one thing or the other. If we desire to do our business in an expeditious way, so that we may be able to return to our homes from time to time and ascertain the wants of our constituents, we shall have to get rid of a number of these long tedious speeches. In travelling about the country a short time ago the Prime Minister said that the old age pensions were in danger, as there was not enough money with which to pay them. Yet before he was in office a week or two, and notwithstanding the fact that Parliament was to meet in about a fortnight, he transmitted a cablegram promising a Dreadnought or its equivalent to the people of England, thereby showing that according to his view there was plenty of money at the disposal of the Commonwealth. What is the position? Although the Government have made that offer to the Old Country, we find that our volunteers have not enough rifles to use, that ammunition is very scarce, the inference being that we have not enough money available even for defending Australia as it ought to be defended.",29
166,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,They could not take one-half of the cadets to the encampment.,30
167,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Cadet s could not go to the encampment because we had not sufficient funds for the purpose, while we could offer £2,000,000 to the Old Country. It had not asked for the gift, which was not really needed. tunately, I cannot say much regarding the Postmaster-General's Department whilst I am a member of the Postal Commission. I propose .to deal with a few matters which concern my district, and if I should appear to be parochial, it is simply owing to the fact that I do not wish to deal with the larger and wider question of administration and management at the present time. In my district there is one post-office shows a profit of £400. The town wishes to connect with another town across the river, and only six miles away, by means of a postal service, at a cost of eight or ten, or perhaps fifteen, pounds a year. But the people cannot obtain that connection because of the starvation system which obtains. In other country districts the school teachers have offered to take charge of papers and letters for the parents of the children, but the Deputy Postmaster-General has gone on the huckstering principle of offering to give the whole of the revenue received to the postmistresses for looking after the service. That, I contend, is a very peculiar attitude for the Government to take up. It was not adopted in connection with the construction of the telephone from Melbourne to Sydney. I was very pleased to hear the honourable'member for East Sydney speak as he did in reference to the accommodation' of outlying districts. When a service is required in Melbourne or Sydney, no question is asked as to whether it will pay. Throughout Queensland there are hundreds of places where the services are not paying, although those places are quite entitled to have them; yet we in Tasmania cannot get a service costing £ 1 0 or £ 1 5 , because there is no money available, although we are supposed to be able to afford to give £2,000,000 to the Old Country to buy a Dreadnought. I have often mentioned the subject of wireless telegraphy. Some two years ago the Government put on the Estimates £10,000 for the establishment of wireless telegraphy stations in Australia, but last year the money was struck off. I asked the then Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Maribyrnong, if it was simply a political placard, or whether he meant business. He said there was no political placard in his Department; but it appearsnow that there was in that instance. Every one who has read what has taken place in the world recently knows the advantage of wireless telegraphy to Australia for shipUnfor- ping purposes. There lie between Victoria and Tasmania King Island and Flinders Island, which have no communication with the mainland. Yet nothing is being done to provide it for them. They have, or are supposed to. have, a mail service once in three weeks, but they have no cable or wireless telegraphy, and if a storm arises they can hold no communication with the mainland for weeks, as I have known to which happen in the past. If there is a wreck there, they have no means of notifying the people on the mainland of what has happened. I say, therefore, that the Government were not justified in giving away £2,000,000 when a small service of that kind cannot be provided for the people. Wireless telegraphy has already saved many lives in peril upon the ocean, and is capable of saving many more. We have had an intimation that the Union Steam-ship Company are quite willing to establish wireless telegraphy on the whole of their large fleet as soon as stations are established on the land. Of course, it is of no use on the ships unless there is an installation on the land to communicate with. I trust that at an early date the Commonwealth will establish a wireless telegraphy service for the safety of the people as well as for the benefit of those who live in isolated positions. When I entered the House, I thought that we should deal in a business-like way with questions like that of uniform postage stamps, but recently, when in Queensland, I , bought a few more stamps than I required, and they are in my pocket-book still, for they are of no use to me in any other State. A commercial traveller, when in any particular State, must buy only the exact number of stamps that he requires, or make a loss on them. What an absurdity that is in a country which is supposed to be federated ! We know that it is on account of the bookkeeping system which is at present in vogue, but surely the States are not so narrow minded that they will not accept one another's stamps? This is one of those things that irritate and annoy the public, whereas it would only be a small item for the States to agree upon. A penny stamp should be recognised as a penny stamp all over Australia, no matter what State it is issued in. There are several anomalies with regard to the - Tasmanian postal service which should be rectified. In Victoria, the postage on circulars is one halfpenny, but in Tasmania it is one penny, and if a business man in Tasmania wishes to send out 2,000 or 3,000 circulars, he can have the whole of them sent to Melbourne, and posted here at a reduced rate, and then sent to Tasmania. That State does the whole work of distributing them, and gets nothing for it. The Tasmanian business man saves one half-penny on every circular he sends out, but he gives the revenue to Victoria, and the work to his own State. It may be said that that sort of thing would not be patriotic, but every business man likes to do things as expeditiously and cheaply as possible, and under present conditions there is every inducement to Tasmanian merchants to have their printing and posting done in Victoria. This great injustice to Tasmania has been brought before various Postmasters-General. No remedy has been applied, and yet we call ourselves a federated community. If we are to prosper, to look upon one another as brothers, with the motto "" One destiny, one flag, and one people,"" we should do away with the bookkeeping system, which causes a large amount of expense in checking the business of one State against another, when we are all supposed to be members of one firm. The people of Victoria would never think of checking whether goods were to be sent to Bendigo, Ballarat, or Ararat. The goods come here, the duty is paid to the Customs,' and divided. When we federated, the bookkeeping system should never have been introduced. It was claimed that it would be useful in showing how things would work. That purpose has been achieved, and now we are spending a lot of money every year to produce a check which is only sufficiently correct to prove that the whole system is of no benefit. We should work in a Federal spirit if we are to have a federated Australia. With regard to the question of the State and Commonwealth finances, I have heard a great deal about State and Commonwealth rights, but, after all, the money belongs to the people, whether it is spent by the Commonwealth or by the States. We are all one, and we cannot be sepa[43 ] rated. It is only a question of coming to some arrangement. I cannot see the benefit of having Conferences. The State Premiers should meet first, and agree as to what jthey want. Then this Parliament, not our Government, should decide what they are prepared to concede to the States. Those two conditions being satisfied, it would be for the Premiers and the Prime Minister to negotiate, and to come to final terms. That is how any business concern would deal with the matter. If one man is dealing with six others, those six first agree as to what they regard as a fair bargain to make, the other man then meets them, and they talk the matter over in a business-like way. If there is a difference of a few pounds, they compromise, and the business is transacted. What is the use of the Prime Minister meeting six State Premiers if the latter have not first made up their minds what they require? All the Conferences that will be held, and all the talk that will take place can never remedy the trouble, until the Premiers first meet and decide what they require, and then deal with the Commonwealth in a reasonable and proper manner. There is sufficient wisdom amongst the Premiers, with the assistance of the Prime Minister, to do what is right in the interests of all. We hear a great deal about buildings belonging to the Commonwealth, and others belonging to the States, but they all belong to the people of Australia. It is just as if a man had money in both pockets, and had to pay an account out of one or the other. The appointment of a High Commissioner has been spoken of for years, but nothing has been done. I thought the matter would have been dealt with a long while ago, but long delay has been caused, because one party wanted to send one man, and another party wanted to send another man, and, consequently, the question of this, the most important appointment of all, has been neglected. Many of those who at present occupy the Treasury bench opposed the names of certain men that have been suggested for the position. The establishment of an agricultural bureau is one of the steps which I advocated before I came into this House, and I thought that it would have been accomplished before now. Its establishment is calculated to be of immense value to the people, but while honourable members representing different parties have been fighting each other, the business of Australia has been laid on one side, and nothing has been done in this matter. I' am very sorry that the members of the Ministry and members generally on the other side should think it unnecessary listen to an honourable member from Tasral mania. The right honourable member for Jast Sydney in this House merely reprethe sents a constituency, just as I do. Honorthe able members can walk out of this 'Chamam lier and go about their pleasures, but when :.i great gun rises to make a lot of f u n delay business, they manage to be present.",30
168,Mr KING OMALLEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,S h all we call for 11 quorum?,32
169,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not care whether a quorum is present or not. I cannot it if honourable members think no more of the business of the country than to attend here only for pleasure and amusement, and cannot make it convenient to attend when an honourable member desires to discuss political and financial questions importance. I think, however, the people of Australia should know how they are represented, and that i honourable members anticipate a "" blackThe f a c e"" entertainment, they can all manthe age to be here. We have passed a quaranwhich, tine law, and we are told that quarantine is now in the hands of the Federation; but if one desires to take a prize beast from Victoria to Tasmania, he will find that the animal must undergo four months quarantine in the latter State. It may half-starved or neglected at the quarantine station while there. When I was a memThese ber of the State Parliament, I tried to deal with this question of quarantine. There are a few individuals in charge the administration of quarantine legislation in the various States who seem to me to every obstacle they can in the way of free exchange of animals of all descripmany tions between the States. At one time in Tasmania, six months' quarantine was enjustified; forced, but in the State Parliament, managed to reduce the term to four months. I thought that under the operation of a entitled to be so called. Federal Act. a sensible course would followed, but I find that four months' quarantine is still enforced in Tasmania, in the case of animals transferred from the other States. I think that if animalSj, after undergoing examination, were here for a month or two months, and then put on lxiard ship with a clean certificate, should be sufficient merely that they should be re-examined on arrival in Tasmania. But I find that the provisions of the old State Act are still being enforced. This applies to animals of every description. We find that the authorities in some of States are prohibiting the importation of to potatoes from Tasmania. We have a FedeQuarantine Act, but all power in these matters appears still to be in the hands of State authorities. If business men had control of quarantine in Australia, I quite 'sure that they would not permit the present obstacles to the transfer of stock , and from one State to another to continue. In reference to the present position of political parties, I should like to say that as a Protectionist and a supporter of the last Deakin Ministry, I felt that we occupied a. position of power, while we could rely upon help the assistance of the Labour party. When the Labour party withdrew their support, the present Prime Minister stated on the floor of this Chamber that he was prepared to support that party so long as of they were prepared to carry out his policy. that But as soon as we got into recess, the honourable gentleman, and others, comf menced to break away from that promise. Prime Minister has now joined with party that was then in Opposition, and he said, was comprised of the wreckage of a number of other parties. I do not approve of calling any party names in this House. Every honourable member has a perfect right to sit on whichever side of. the House he pleases, to adopt what be policy he thinks fit, and to change his opinions, if he thinks it wise to do so. are matters for himself and his constituents, and are no business of mine. At the same time, as one who regards himself of as a Liberal, I feel that the present Ministry and their supporters are not entitled put to call themselves the Liberals of Austhe tralia. The Governmait are comprised of members who can never be called Liberals,- and who, I think, would not feel in claiming that title for themwe selves, though I admit that the Prime Minister, and some of those with him, were While the be Labour Government were in power, the present Prime Minister and the members of his party were in a position, as the centre party supporting the Labour A d ministration, to control the legislation of kept this Parliament. The Labour Government could not have passed a single Act without it the support of the true Liberal party. Even if the Labour Government had introduced extreme measures-and I have not seen any of their extreme measures-abou t which so now much has been said, they could not have the passed them without the assistance of the Liberal part)*, and, therefore, from the Liberal point of view, the interests of the country were perfectly safe. That cannot be said now, when the Prime Minister and some of his followers have joined forces with those who used to be in opposition to them. I do not often take notice of what appears in the newspapers, nor am I influenced by what they say. But an article appearing in the Age of the 14th of May last puts the position as it then existed so clearly that I cannot do better than make a short quotation from it. After referring to various difficulties, and the danger to the seats of certain honourable members, the article continuesStill, wlien all these allowances are made, arid even when such considerations are emphasized, they do not suffice to excuse the Liberal party permitting itself to be absorbed in a combination of Conservatism and anti-Socialists, where it must become a back number, without power, without influence, and only a disappointed spectator of the d r if t of high purposes. this time of stress and strain, when all kinds of influences are beings employed to submerge the Liberal party and its leader, it is the duty of that party more than ever to stand firm in its integrity. I agree entirely with that statement of the position. I ask why this great change? We were told by the Prime Minister that it was because the seats of certain honourable members of the Liberal party were being endangered by the action of the Labour party in the constituencies. In my opinion, it will be a sorrv day for Australia when we are to consider the security of our seats in this House rather than what is right to be done in the interests of the country. I have never considered the security of my seat. I remember that I have been sent here by the electors to do what I consider best in the interests of Tasmania and of the Commonwealth as a whole. I will use what wisdom I have to that end. But I will never support a policy merely in order to save my seat. I should have an utter contempt for any member of this House if it could be said of hirrj that he supported a certain course in politics for any reason of that description. We should always consider the good of Australia, rather than any of our own individual interests. With reference to the fusion that has taken place, I would remark that the word is a peculiar one in politics. One night the electric lights went out in my house. I was told that the cause was that the wires had fused. I wonder whether the Liberal light has gone out now that the Liberals have fused [43]- 2 with another party. We have heard many interpretations as to what the fusion means. The honourable member for Lang gave us an interpretation that was altogether different from what I was told when I was asked to enter the Fusion party. The meeting at which the matter was explained to me.was a private one, and I am not one of those who would state publicly what was done at a private meeting. But, at all events, I can say that the version given by the honourable member for Lang was totally different from that given to me on the occasion to which I refer. The question of defence is one of the most important that could be brought under the attention of Parliament. I referred to it on the last occasion when I . spoke as demanding to be dealt with in a firm, strong manner. But under our party system of Government as soon as one Minister gets In used to his office he has to make room for another one. Not so long ago the honourable member for Eichmond was Minister of Defence. He was succeeded by a senator. Now the honourable member for Parramatta holds the office. The present Minister has, on previous occasions, stated definitely that he is opposed to the policv brought forward by the Prime Minister and also by the Labour Government. He has stated on several occasions that he is opposed to compulsory training. I do not know whether he intends to adapt himself to the altered circumstances, and to support the principle that he has denounced, but which is now so popular. The Prime Minister stated to the press some time ago that the Minister who has gone to England has been sent there to represent, the Government. What the views of the Government may be on this important question I do not know. If the Government representative expresses his own opinions, as explained here and elsewhere in Australia, I doubt whether he can at the same time represent the views of the Prime Minister, and he certainly cannot represent those of Australia. I am glad that it was on the recommendation of the Fisher Government that the Imperial Conference was called. In view of the fact that the Imperial Government invited Australian representatives to be sent, it is to be regretted that the subject was not dealt with apart from party politics. We read in the press, when the present Government came into office that it was their intention to send the honourable member for Richmond to London in company with the honourable member for Brisbane. If , however, the Government had wished the question to be dealt with apart from partu considerations, they would have done a just and riglif thing had they sent Home the ex-Minister of Defence in company with a member of the Cabinet. The fact that they sent a Minister unaccompanied showed conclusively that the Government are working the defence question on party lines. That is not as it should be. No matter whether a man be a. Liberal or a Conservative, a Free Trader, or a Protectionist, defence should be considered as a purely national question. The same consideration applies to Australia's - relations with the Empire. There is one thing in connection with the administration of the Fisher Government of which I did not approve. I allude to the expenditure of £250,000 which was set aside by Parliament on the understanding that it should not be spent until we met again. The expenditure of that money without consulting Parliament was not a right thing to do. In my opinion, if ships are to be built in Australia, the sooner we begin the better. If we had sent to the Old Country and had brought out some men to teach our own people to build the ships that we require, instead of sending men Home to learn ship-building, we should have followed a wiser course. The men who have gone Home will not be able to learn the whole business of ship-building within the time they will be keot there. If we had imported three or four good men from England, they would have been able to leach our own people far more effectively.",32
170,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who was it that sent the men Home?,34
171,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Fisher Governanent did, and I do not think that they did the right thing. The motion now under discussion is one of no-confidence in the present Government. I am in doubt as to what the Government intend to give us.",34
172,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,So are its members.,34
173,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Many of the members of the Government have changed their political opinions so often, that I should not be surprised at anything they did. If I thought that it was intended to give us the policy of the old Deakin Government, I should be inclined to support the Ministry io a very great extent. As far as they bring forward such measures .as were submitted by the former Deakin Government I , shall support them. But I cannot have complete confidence in a Government that is composed of men holding so many beliefs. I thought at one time that I might be able to sit behind the Government, but when after a three weeks' adjournment the Prime Minister sent Home an offer of a Dreadnought, knowing the financial position of Australia, I felt that I could not have any confidence in a Government that did such a thing. The Prime Minister should not have sought to put so great a burden upon the people of Australia as to pledge them to the extenf of ,£2,000,000. For years we have been scraping up every penny to give to the States, knowing their necessities and the difficulty they had in making both ends meet. We have returned to the States several million pounds more than we need have returned, for the same reason. Yet we find the Prime Minister offering to give away £2,000,000 without consulting Parliament. How is this state of things brought about? It occurred simply because a few newspapers started an agitation. It was commenced in Sydney and Melbourne. The Premiers of these two great States were not very warm on the subject. In fact, they were opposed to the project. But, of course, the newspapers began to lay on the whip. A few people in the States then began to agitate, but, excepting in Victoria and New South Wales, the Premiers threw cold water on the project. Mr Wade and Mr. Murray, however, came forward and said that, if the Commonwealth, or the Labour Government, did not make an offer, they would make one themselves. As soon, however, as there was a change of Government, we saw the reason for the hurried motion which was brought on the other day. When we were in recess, the new Government, knowing that we must meet in less than a fortnight, offered a Dreadnought, or its equivalent, thus placing a heavy burden on the people, though, in some of the smaller States especially, taxation had been stretched to the utmost. Before a Government give away money in this way, Parliament ought to be consulted.",34
174,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Parliamen t will be consulted.,34
175,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Quite so; but there is a solid crowd which will vote in favour of the proposal in order to save the skin of the Government-no t because they are in favour of such a. gift, but because they fear the advent of a Labour Ministry.",34

Some years ago, the ber Minister of Defence said that he did not like the Reid-MCLean Ministry garded - because it contained too many Proment tectionists; and I may say that I do not like the present Ministry because it contains too many Free Traders, and men who conwith tinually blocked legislation which was introHitherto, duced by the Deakin Government, and which I considered to be for the .benefit the community. I do not expect any good Liberal legislation from the Government, though I hope I may be disappointed, and, if so, any legislation of the kind will my support. I cannot understand why, in a House of this kind, so many lawyers should be included in the Ministry to the exclusion of business men. There are seven lawyers in the present Government.",35

188,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We all know that lawyers have but one object in view, namely, to make money; and they are so shut up in their offices that"" they do not understand the business relations of the people.",35

But business men are thrust aside; and the results are not satisfactory. I have nothing to say against the Minister of Home Affairs, either as a lawyer or as a member of this House, but what he know, of public buildings and the other works undertaken by the works branch the of his Department? When the honourable in member for North Sydney was Minister of Home Affairs, he wished to do away with the present cumbersome method of carrying out public works through the Department of Home Affairs; and that would, in my This is called the Deakin Government, but I do not so regard it. The Government are pracday tically a unicorn team, represented by the able Prime Minister, with the right honourable member for Swan, and the honourable memfor Parramatta on either side, and that being so, the Prime Minister cannot be reas leading the party or the Governin any shape or form. What do we find ? That a departure has been made from all well-recognised traditions in connection the system of responsible government. the invariable practice has been for His Excellency the Governor General, of upon the defeat of the Ministry of the day, to send for the Leader of the Opposition to form a new Administration, and for that individual to select his own Minhave isters. But no less than three men had a voice in the selection of the Ministers constituting, the present Government.",35
191,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was a regular caucus.,36
192,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It was another form of the caucus. This circumstance, I think, points to the fact that honourable members are coming to favour the system of elective Ministries. Had the Prime Minister enjoyed a free hand in the selection of his colleagues, I take it that he would not have overlooked the claims of so many of his old friends. But he was bound by the right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Parramatta to choose so many Ministers from each party to the fusion. As a result, we have the present Ministry. I venture to say that, if Ministers were asked to commit to writing the planks of their platform, the only plank upon which they would be agreed would be one antagonistic to the Labour party. If they are in agreement upon other planks, a great change of front must have come over certain honourable members since they occupied seats upon this side of the Chamber. I should like to know where my Protectionist friends opposite would be if the Prime Minister were suddenly taken ill whilst Tariff revision was under consideration, and if the Minister of Defence was called upon to act as leader of the Government. Instead of selecting his old friends and supporters as Ministerial colleagues, the Prime Minister was compelled to include in his Cabinet many honourable members who had endeavoured to block his efforts to enact useful legislation. If they had had their way we certainly should not have upon the statute-book today many of the most useful measures passed by this Parliament. I maintain that, if we are to have party government in Australia, the Ministry should consist of a party with one policy, and not, as it does now, of political fragments. Seeing that the Government have decided to impose a tax upon the people of Australia for all time in connection with the proposal to present a Dreadnought to the Mother Country, I cannot say that I have any confidence in them. But if they bring forward measures of which I approve, I shall vote for those measures. There are many other subjects which I might discuss at length. Whatever we, as legislators, may 3p, I believe that Australia will prosper. I do not' know whether I shall be here next year, and I do not very much care. I am satisfied that, if the people could only witness the way in which business is transacted in this Chamber, if they could only realise how precious time is wasted, they would certainly not appoint us as directors of their affairs. When I entered this House, I - was imbued with the idea that honourable members were really the directors of the affairs of Australia, and that it was their bounden duty to manage those affairs as they would the business of a large company. If we did that, if we acted as reasonable individuals and avoided all personal abuse of each other, I am convinced that we should do much to shorten debate and to expedite the transaction of public business. We are now laying the foundation of the Australia of the future, ""and I trust that those who have had more education and more oppoiv tunities for improving their position than I have had will throw their hearts into their legislative work, so that the result of our labours may redound to our own credit and to that of the Commonwealth. I trust that the remarks which I have made will not give offence to anybody. I regret having had to speak as I have done, but I believe that we should exercise the gifts with which God has endowed us to the advancement of the material welfare of this country, so that its future may be bright and prosperous. I trust that our efforts will be directed to this end, that we shall be imbued with a determination to do what is right for the people as a whole, and that class domination and class misrepresentation will find no place in this House.",36
193,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yarra) [5.18] - I am sorry that after delivering his little lecture to both sides of the House the right honourable member for East Sydney should have absented himself from the chamber. In the course of his remarks he stated that the Ministry were being criticised because one or two of them were Conservatives. Upon previous occasions I have heard honourable members upon this side of the chamber numbered according to their fiscal beliefs, which they had held some time previously, and not according to the votes they had given on the Tariff. Now, if we reckon Conservatives by the number of Conservative votes which they have cast, I make bold to say that we shall find a majority of Conservatives amongst honourable members opposite, and not one or two, as was alleged by the right honourable member for East Sydney. That gentleman also inquired whether the Labour party thought they, the Conservatives, were going to direct the Government as the Labour party used to do? Has he not been assured by the Prime Minister time and again that the Labour party have never attempted i o dictate to him in any way? In making that statement. I do not forget that there is - one measure which would not have been upon the statute-book today had it not been for the Labour party- I refer to the Old-age Pensions Act. The right honourable member for East Sydney further said that it was assumed 'Khat Literalism had been weakened by the fusion which had taken place. I do not know whether Liberalism has been weakened, but I do know that Conservatism has been strength-ened, and that every Conservative, both in this House and in the Senate, is supporting the present The honourable member went on to say that he was sorry that members of the late Ministry were lamenting their defeat. I have only to say that I have indulged in no lamentation, and that, so far as I am aware, the other members of the late Government have done very little. Surely the able member would not judge of our - actions by what is written of them in the Age. I remember when the right honourable member denounced that journal in this House, and surely he is not going to believe what it writes of the Labour party today ! It is more bitterly opposed to us than ever it was to him. And so with the Argus. It may be said that at the present time there is practically only one morning newspaper published in Melbourne, since the - one is merely an echo of the other. It 'suits their political purpose to declare that the Labour party are squealing because they were turned out of office, and they have repeated their misrepresentations of - us so often that they really begin now to believe them. We have been told that after the honourable member for Ballarat applied the political stiletto to the ReidMCLean Administration we were glad to - support him once more as Prime Minister. Honourable members know that when sitting in the Ministerial corner I did not hesitate to explain that I supported the Deakin Government, not because of any great love for them, but because I , and our party generally, had a greater dislike for the then - Opposition.",36
194,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Labour party liked us.,37
195,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I admit that we had no objection to some members of the Deakin Ministry, but I did not hesitate to criticise that Ministry just as freely as did any honourable member of the then Opposition. Although the honourable member for East Sydney intimated that, he did not intend to deal with the past-that he would deal only with the future-yo u must have observed, Mr Speaker, that in a speech extending over full y an hour and a Half he devoted only five minutes to a review of the future policy of the Ministry, the remainder of his address being directed to a recital of the political history of New South Wales, ""and to a consideration of the question of whether or not the honourable member for Hume is more radical in his views today than he was some twenty-five years ago. Apparently the strongest Ministry. accusation he could make against the honourable member was that some twenty-five years ago he was a Free Trader, whereas he is now a Protectionist. That statement, no doubt, was heard with horror by the Prime Minister. The honourable member honor- also said that the honourable member for Hume had brought forward a list of Tariff anomalies. Every one knows that as soon as we had passed the"" Tariff Bill , and long before the Labour Ministry came into existence, the honourable . member for Hume stated that he intended to go through the Tariff and to prepare a list of anomalies, with a view to their rectification. Such a statement, I dare say, may be found in Hansard, but, even if it cannot, honourable members will have no difficulty in finding in the newspapers reports of interviews, with press representatives, in which he expressed - his intention of adopting that course. It will be learned with interest by those who are organizing an alleged Liberal League in Victoria that, according to the right honourable member for East Sydney, the Coalition have sunk the fiscal issue y and that they claim that in that respect they are only following the lead of the Labour party. I would reply to the honourable member that we have never sunk the fiscal issue. There is a broad distinction between giving to every member of a party freedom to vote as he pleases on the fiscal issue and a determination by a party, as a whole, that the fiscal issue shall be. sunk. We have in this House twenty-six 1 members of the Labour party, and, judging by their votes on the last Tariff, not more than six of that number are Free Traders. There are in this_ House at least twenty members of the Labour party who are free to.support the opposite fiscal policy. Honourable members on the Government benches, however, are not free.",37
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why not include the fiscal issue in the platform of the bour party, if it is so important?",38
197,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We are not elected as us fiscalists, but as Labour men, and the newspapers take care to let that fact be known. The Treasurer is aware that the Labour Conference at which our platform is drawn up consists of dewill legates elected by the votes of all care to join any of our Labour organizaGovernment, tions. Honourable members of the party are not free to insert a fiscal plank in the programme after it has been drawn up by the Conference, and they would not be free to withdraw such a plank from it . The Treasurer, however, is free to insert in his programme any plank that he pleases, and later on to run away from it .",38

I shall not say that the Governorable member for Swan. ment and their supporters have swallowed their principles, for some of them have never had any principles lo swallow; but it is not unreasonable to say that they are prepared to drop any plank in their programme when it suits them to do so, and to pick it up again when they think it expedient. I have no doubt that at the next general elecI tion the people of Victoria will be told, - the Coalition Government are still in existin ence-whic h is very doubtful-that great prominence will be giy.en by them to the second plank in the programme which the Prime Minister put forward at bourne Town H all meeting. I refer to the plank of effective Protection- a plank which the Ministry has dropped.",38

Only yesof exploration? terday a deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs to urge that a higher duty'should be placed on a certain item, and when I had the honour to hold that office I also received a deputation desired to bring under my notice certain anomalies in the Tariff. Notwithstanding George Dibbs. that the present Ministry have had nothing to say in this House in regard to the tion of effective Protection, I have no doubt for Hume. that they and their supporters will give prominence to it in Victoria, although that will not be done in New South Wales. LaThose who mount the stump in support of the Government party in this State will tell that they believe in the policy of effective Protection; but does any one imagine that honourable members sitting behind the Government and representing the Free Trade constituencies in New South Wales make the same statement in that State? who We know that they will not. Unlike the the Labour party have one Labour platform for all Australia.",38
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ,",38
203,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Minister of Defence denies that statement.,38
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why , the Labour party has a new programme every day. I read of a new one only yesterday.",38

Honourable gentlemen opposite make no reply. t is said that they have sunk the Tariff if in imitation of the Labour party's action regard to the fiscal issue.

212,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am speaking of his first statement. If it was right to fasten the opinions of Sir Patrick Jennings to the honourable member for Hume, is it not right to fasten those of the present Prime Minister to the Minister of Defence, and to the Minister of [Home Affairs, whoi were elected as Free Traders?",39
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable member for East Sydney fastened to the honourable member for Hume the words which that honourable gentleman had uttered, as a reference to Hansard will show.",39

219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is honourable members opposite who have turned round.,39
220,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"At any rate, we have not gone back. As a matter of fact, the torian representatives, with whom the right honourable member for East Sydney is now - sitting, all took an attitude similar to - of the honourable member for Hume. When - an Electoral Bill was before this House a few years ago, all the Victorian reprefor sentatives, except myself, wished to give - country constituencies a larger representafor tion than city constituencies. Personally, I could not see that it was fair to give 14,000 men in a country constituency the member. same representation as 42,000 in my convote. - stituency. I agree with what the right honourable member said about the deception of intending immigrants, and I hope that the Ministry will put facts fairly before those whom they are trying to attract this country. People should not be brought here under false pretences. They should know exactly how things stand before they leave theii own country. He also gave credit to the Minister of Defence for advancing physical culture among the cadets. But it was the Minister's predecessor who convened a conference to consider the possibility of having a medical inspection of the State schools, while the honourable member for Hindmarsh moved a motion in favour of teaching the cadets physical culture, and I , by asking questions, two or three years ago, got the Prime Minister to promise to refer the matter to a Premiers' Conference. Therefore, the inception of the idea lies, not with the present Minister, but with his predecessor, and with the others I have mentioned.",39

He is that no more than any other honourable member who sits in the Ministerial corner or on this side. All that he can do is to vote or against particular proposals which are brought forward.

If I call this Ministry an Employers' FedeMinistry. ration Ministry, it will only be because that body has furnished the proof that it another. is. I have not taken the proof from anybody else. They have stated that i Socialists are quoted against us, we sent it. It is well-known that the official Socialist party in Victoria, and, I believe, in other States, have always been most bitter in denunciation of the Labour party.

I admit that the does not appear to have to swallowed anything, except that which, perhaps, has disagreed with him. TheMinister of Home Affairs is just the sameas he was previously. Outside the Househave never been doubtful as to the Prime Minister's attitude to the Labour party. I hold in my hand a copy of theto British Australasian for 23rd May, 1907, which contains a report of what is knownas his ""deep-water"" speech. As it is not a cabled account, as it cannot be said to have been faked by any newspaper here, as it was published in London when the Prime Minister was there, I propose to put - on record what the Prime Minister did say - of the Labour party, and afterwards show how mistaken he was in his statements regarding the number of Labour members in the State Parliaments.",40

237,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Prime Minister was fooling either the people in the Old Country or the Labour party here. He could not possibly be true to both at once. Either he meant this, or he did not. If the report was cabled out inadvertently, perhaps we did not get the proper strength of the position. Therefore, I propose, in justice to the honourable and learned gentleman, to put on record the report which appeared in the British newspaper.",41
238,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,The report appeared in a London newspaper before the cablegram came out here.,41
239,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The speech, was addressed to a number of British financiers, and the report is headed ""British Capital in Australia,"" with the sub-heading, "" Mr. Deakin Explains the Position of the Labour Party.""",41
240,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Prime Minister - was induced by a man named Hain to make the speech.,41
241,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That has nothing to do with me. The report reads as follows: Mr Deakin attended a luncheon last Thursday at De Keyser's Royal Hotel, in order to meet a number of representatives of British - capital invested in Australasia. Mr Richard Hain presided, and amongst those present - were Lord Vaux of Harrowden, Sir C. Rivers Wilson, Mr Harmood-Banner, M.P., Mr. Faithfull-Begg, Mr A. B. Leslie Melville, 1Z. Garcke, Mr R. Percy Sellon, Mr J. Cecil Bull, Mr J. B. Braithwaite, Mr A. H . Stoncham, Mr A. C. Willis, Mr A. F. Farish, advocates. Mr Beckwith Smith, and Mr Oliver Wethered. Mr Harmood-Banner, M.P., in proposing "" Continued success to the Commonwealth, to British Interests Therein,"" said that they met, as business men, to lay before Mr Deakin - certain matters in regard to which they thought he might help them. One of these was the question of making safe British capital invested in Australia. He also thought that investors in industrial enterprises should be treated manner that would make it easy to obtain tal here for the development of Australia. party. Manufacturers in this country felt the scourge of the municipal trader, and so they had not much to complain of as to the Colonies being worse than the Motherland in that respect. Mr Braithwaite said that one of the things which had hindered a free flow of British capital into Australia was the diversity of the company laws in the different States. Labour legislation in recent years in Australia had done a gTeat deal to make English investors timid about placing their money in Australian undertakings. Mr Faithfull-Begg said that he was interested directly and indirectly in investments in the Colonies, and he was frequently consulted with regard to them. There was, undoubtedly, a widespread sentiment in favour of investing "" under the flag,"" if that could be done with equal safety and advantage, to sending money to South America, and elsewhere. After all, he did not think that sentiment counted for very much in this matter! Capital was selfish, and would go where it could get the best terms. Mr Deakin, in replv, said that there was no need for him to point out that, besides the central Government, every State in Australia had its own Government, exercising absolutely independent authority over its citizens and its own undertakings. Among those undertakings, as it happened, came the whole body of municipal and private enterprises, the land, and the railways, and all the great industrial associations connected with them. The central Government had limited powers of control over the whole Continent; but, before dealing with the Commonwealth aspect of the situation, he would refer to the chief or most persistent cause of alarm to. investors-namely , what was called the rise and growth of the'Labour party. That party had its initiation in Australia at a time of reaction. There had been a great financial expansion, and bankers, in order to find investments for the large amount of money at their command, had encouraged enterprises which would not stand close scrutiny. Then alarm spread, and investors, who have lent money on short terms .to bankers, who had been foolish enough to lend it on long terms, called it in, and a crisis followed. The Labour partu had its time of growth and maturity, but at p'resent it was in very deep water as a party. Mr Deakin then reviewed at considerable length the position of the Labour party in the several States. He said that an election, in Victoria the other day-the State from which he came-ha d left that party with only 15 F. members out of a total of 6.5. In the Upper Mr House they had, he believed, not a single representative, so that the prospects of Labour P. legislation were far from encouraging for its In New South Wales a coalition had been formed between Mr Carruthers, who had not and a large majority, and the party which he dishad placed- a party previously in alliance with the Labour party. Mr Carruthers would be going, to the country in a few months, and there' seemed to be not the slightest doubt that the ' coalition of the two regular parties, as they might be termed-unde r Mr Carruthers and. in a Mr Waddell-woul d 'result in the return of a capiMinistry with a great majority of the Labour In Queensland a Government had been formed out of the Labour party, but it had been defeated, and there was no doubt that that party would not count in the new Parliament about to be elected. In Tasmania the Labour party had never yet exercised any practical influence, and it did not appear likely to do so. The State of Western Australia had a short experience of the rule of the Labour party, but they were defeated and placed in Opposition, and, so far as he was aware, there was no prospect of their resuming their lease of power. The only State in Australia today in which the Labour party was represented by the Ministry was South Australiaj where they were in  formed just recently of events which indicated that within a short time the Labour party there would be in a minority. To all intentsand purposes, in these several States who had control of the various matters to which reference had been made, there would be, probably before this year closed, 'or shortly after, a strong Government entirely independent of the Labour party, even in the popular House. That fact, he thought, disposed in a practical manner of the difficulty of investors owing to any fear of what the. Labour party might do: That statement is interesting in view of the present position in the various States. In Victoria, there are now twenty-one Labour members in a Legislative Assembly of sixty-five. At the last election, which was brought about for the express purpose of dishing the Labour party, it was the only party that increased its numbers, as it gained six seats. The Prime Minister said that there was not a single representative of the party in the Victorian Upper House, but there have been two representatives of our party there for over six years. I do not know sufficient about the position of the Labour party in New South Wales",41
242,Mr HALL,MOTION OF WANT OF,They had an increase of seven at the last election.,42
243,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is a very fair rate of increase In Queensland, where the Prime Minister said that the party would not count in the new Parliament about to be elected, they are in a very strong position, despite all those who have left them. In Tasmania, where the honourable gentleman said the Labour party had never counted, it has two-fifths of the whole of the representation in the Lower House, more than either of the other parties by itself, and very little less than the two together. In Western Australia the party is stronge than ever. That was the speech which the Prime Minister made'as a prophet. When he was away from the party he said it did not count, and that outside the Federal arena we were put in our places. Only a few months ago he described the different parties that sit opposite, with the exception, of the party of ten that he has taken over, as the wreckage of the Black Labour party,, of the Free Importing party, of the antiSocialist party, and the Individualist party. But there is now the wreckage of another party washed up with the flotsam and jetsam on the other side of the House - the wreckage of his own party-and hetook them there. I do not blame him for doing so, for it is quite right that all the wrecks should be together. We have been, told that the fusion was brought about in order to dish the Labour party, and that it would last, at any rate, over the next election; but as any Senate candidates returned at the next election will hold their seats for six years, the fusion must last for six years. That means that honourable members opposite have agreed to sink the Tariff for at least that time. Some honourable members may say "" so much the better,"" but they will not be able to fool the people into the belief that the arrangement is to last only three years. That being the case, Protectionists, if they intend to support the present) Ministry, must know that there can be no dealing with the Tariff in any way for the next six years. Senator Best admitted yesterday that there was no hope of dealing with it. Is there a combined party opposite, and if so, what are the objects for which it has come together?",42
244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,To down the Labour party.,42
245,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I believe that is the only reason. The Manchester Guardian, which carries as much weight, politically, in England as any other paper, said of the present Ministry, in its issue of 2nd June, 1909, after receiving a cable that the Fisher Government had been defeatedTHE AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL CRISIS. The Governor General of Australia has refused to permit Mr Fisher to dissolve Parliament, and the Labour Cabinet must resign without a chance of appealing to the country. We do not attempt to criticise the propriety of Lord Dudley's refusal, but it obviously gives Mr. Deakin the power to prevent the Labour Premier appointing the Australian High Commissioner and the Australian delegates to the Naval Conference. Whether Mr Deakin's prestige will benefit from a few months in office before the inevitable general election of next year is. another question. Mr Deakin has defeated the Labour partu by an amazing coalition. He himself stands for high Protection and the new Protection, for Federal as against State authority, for compulsory military training, for democratic land reform. Yet he has combined with Mr Cook's party, which advocates Free Trade, and State Rights, is opposed to military training, and represents "" property."" the coalition more unnatural, it has been arranged to defeat a party which has taken over all the prominent planks of Mr Deakin's own programme. The terms of the coalition are that the Cookites approve Mr Deakin's programme, and that Mr Deakin makes no attempt to carry it out; but, of course, pose of the coalition is to get into office. One cannot help thinking that, however desirable and estimable that consummation, the means will prove unpalatable to the Australian people. Some of Mr Deakin's own friends have alglad ready broken from him with cries of "" Judas,"" and the transaction does look rather unpleasant. It is all the less pleasant because for many years there has been an astonishing reality and sincerity about Australian politics. WithMinisterial out producing any very distinguished political personality, Australia has been singularly tions :f r u it f u l of political ideas and political experiments, and the whole world would be the poorer if that fertility, which is the consequence sincerity, were checked. That is the opinion of a newspaper which, at the present time, has more influence in please advise politics in Great Britain than any other newspaper published there. I admit that it does not count out here, but I submit that its summing up of the position is absolutely accurate. It is clear that the Cookites have adopted the Deakinites' platform so long as they are given a 'definite assurance that no attempt will be made to carry it out.",42
246,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why do not honourable members opposite permit an attempt to carry it out ?,43
247,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Postmaster-General will have an opportunity, a little later, to carry it out. One of the objections to the Labour party hitherto has been that we hold caucuses. I admit that the objection is not frequently urged today, because other parties have recently been so busy holding caucuses themselves. Objection also has been taken to the Labour party's pledge, and in this connection I should like to say that I have with me a copy of a letter, to which I referred in speaking on the adjournment of the debate on the Address-in-Reply. I refer to the letter which was sent to Mr E. F. G. Hodges by Mr J. Hume Cook, the member for Bourke, as ""Government Secretary.""",43
248,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WANT OF,What is the date of the letter?,43
249,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is dated 24th of 1906. That was prior to the last Federal elections. The partu could not, at that time, have been selecting candidates for the a copy. Parliament to be elected after this - This To make is the letter in full The Parliament of the Commonwealth, Parliament House, Melbourne, 24th May, 1906. To Mr E. F. G. Hodges, Main-street, Box Hill. the real purDear Mr Hodges, Re Mernda electorate; yours of the 21st inst., addressed to the Prime Minister, has been referred to me for answer. The Government is to have your offer to stand in the Liberal and Protectionist interest, and your request for Ministerial approval is noted. It is my duty 'to inform you, however, that before any candidate can secure the official support of the and Protectionist forces, he must be prepared to agree to the following condi1. To give an unqualified assent to the fiscal proposals of the Government, and a general of support to all other Ministerial measures. 2. To withdraw his candidature for any given constituency if not selected for it. If you are prepared to accept these conditions me at .once. Yours in truth, J. HUME COOK, Government Secretary. P.S - If you are willing to offer your services generally, and without regard to any particular seat, your claims will not be overlooked. The letter was written about six months prior to the last election, and I direct attention to the fact that it was written on the official note-paper of the Commonwealth Parliament. What right has any member to use official note-paper for correspondence of this kind ? I know that objection would be taken if , from this House, the secretary to the Labour party conducted correspondence on the selection of parliamentary candidates on official note-paper.",43
250,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,There is not much in that.,43
251,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think that it ought not to have been done. It will be seen from the letter which I have quoted that a candidate desiring 'to secure the support of the Ministerial and Protectionist forces at that time was required to pledge himself to proposals of which he knew nothing. *He was asked to pledge himself to give a general support to whatever measures the Government liked to bring forward, and, further, and I should like specially to emphasize this conditionTo withdraw his candidature for any giver constituency if not selected for it. May, When I referred to this letter on a previous occasion I had no copy of it with me at the time, but I have since obtained",43
252,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is Mr Hodges a member of the Labour party?,44
253,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I propose to deal with this letter in my own way, and I shall not be drawn aside unless it suits me. I should like to know who were intrusted with the selection of candidates under the conditions referred to in the letter I have read. In the Labour party, any person who has, for three months, been a financial member of a Labour league, or whose union is affiliated with the Political Labour Council, and who is an elector for a particular district, can take part in the selection of a parliamentary or municipal candidate for that district. But what are we to say of a party in which two or three, or, at most, perhaps, eight or nine, make the selection of candidates, especially in view of the fact that some of the selectors are in no way representatives of the State for which they act ?",44
254,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,It*is the worse feature of Tammany H all repeated.,44
255,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Before the selection of the honourable member for Batman for the constituency for which he was afterwards elected, I saw the honourable member walking up and down in front of Parliament House, and I said, "" What's up?"" He replied. "" A deputation is inside asking the Government to select me."" That deputation went before the honourable member for Bourke. I have been informed that that honourable member. ""Yours in Truth, J. Hume Cook, Government Secretary,"" said to the deputation, "" We must have an application from Mr Coon himself; and we must have it in black and white that he will never again rejoin the Labour party? Mr HUME CooK --That is incorrect.",44
256,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is absolutely correct; I make the statement on the authority of more than one person whose word I would sooner take than that of the honourable member.,44
257,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is not so.,44
258,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member does not know. He was not present; he was walking up and down outside Parliament House waiting to hear the verdict. The ""Government Secretary"" further Stated, "" Personally, I am very favourable to Mr Coon as a candidate,"" and he went on to sav, "" It really rests with me, gentlemen. If I favour h""m it is pretty sure he will be selected."" Any one who knows the honourable member will realise that that is the kind of thing he would say-that he would try to put on as much style as possible, anil would lead the deputation to believe that he was the great "" I am.""",44
259,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member should write a novel; his romancing is so good.,44
260,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am stating facts.,44
261,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Will the honourable gentleman say whether Mr Hodges ran as a candidate for Kooyong?,44
262,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Last week the honourable member for Dalley quoted the letter to which I have referred as it appeared in the Labour Call.,44
263,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why did not the Labour Call put it all in?,44
264,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,That I do not know. I have read it all ; does the honourable member object?,44
265,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,No ; the honourable member can read it twice if he likes.,44
266,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am glad that the honourable member for Llanecoorie has entered the Chamber. When the honourable member for Dalley was quoting the letter he said, "" Is it not made clear that that letter is a thing of years ago ?"" It was not a thing of years ago, it affected the last Federal elections. It does not go back any further than that.",44
267,Dr CARTY SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member for Dalley thought the letter was written a week or two before.,44
268,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He addedI see that it is dated 24th May, 1906.",44
269,Dr CARTY SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member might as well be fair. Those who were present know that the honourable member for Dalley was not aware when the letter was written, until I drew his attention to the fact that it was written years ago.",44
270,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was not here when the honourable member was speaking. Apparently there were many interjections, as the report shows that Mr Speaker had to appeal to honourable members to keep order. The honourable member for Dalley went on to sayI am pleased that the error has been so quickly corrected, but the incident shows that the Labour Call, which is supposed to be the organ of those puritans opposite, has taken advantage of a deliberate lie, or has made it appear that what occurred some years ago is applicable to present conditions. Now, in the first place, the Labour Call published the date. It did not mention the fact that the letter was written just before the last election, but any person reading the document must have known that that was so. I do not know whether this procedure was in operation prior to the last election, or will be in operation again.",44
271,Mr HUMECOOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It wil l always operation for Labour men who want to get in as Liberals.,45
272,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member mean to say that I cannot produce any more letters from him?,45
273,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , member cannot.",45
274,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Ver y well, we will see.",45
275,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member can search all Victoria for the purpose if he likes.,45
276,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I know that men announced that they were the selected Government candidates at the last election. have before me a journal which I have no doubt the honourable member for Bourke has seen. It contains three photographs of Ministerial candidates for the Senate. There is also a photograph of the Government Whip at work in his office. I shall deal with this publication a little later.,45
277,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not say that there were no selected Government candidates.,45
278,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Who selected them? The honourable member for Dalley tried to make out that the Labour Call endeavoured to mislead. I say that it did not. If that had been the intention, the date of the letter would not have been published. The honourable member called, our party puritans. He has not always called us by that name.",45
279,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What the Labour is not true. Call left out was that Mr Hodges applied for selection. A Labour man wanted to get in as a Liberal. - M.r. TUDOR - The Sydney Worker published the letter, but made a slight mistake, which I hope will be corrected. The portion of it stating that a candidate who was not selected would have to withTwenty-three. draw was not inserted. I trust that that error will be corrected, to show the tactics of the Ministerialists. Now the honourable member for Batman sent along a deputation asking for his selection. that the deputation came from him. This was before Mr Higgins had been on 25th June, saidappointed to the High Court Bench. The deputation told the Secretary to the Cabiis net that they intended to run a candidate in opposition to Mr Higgins. The Secretary indeed, to the Cabipet stated that if Mr Higgins - was not on the High Court Bench before the election took place the Government would support him. I wish I had been present the other day when the honourable be in member for Corio said that the Labour party endeavoured to undermine the position of Mr Higgins. The position was this. The procedure of our party in the State of Victoria is, that when the branches of the Labour organization in an electorate have convened a meeting, to ' arrange for the honourable the selection of candidates, they call for nominations for the purpose of making a choice. Intending candidates are notified in the press. Every one knows about it . Probably, honourable members saw that I had to nominate a week or two ago for the purposes of the next election. Everything is done in the open. In the electorate I of Batman the leagues at Fitzroy and Collingwood, and, I believe, also a part of Northcote, and part of East Melbourne, were represented at the meeting. The Fitzroy section was strongest about not running anybody in opposition to Mr . Higgins. But the Collingwood league, led by the honourable member for Batman at that time, said that they would run a candidate against Mr Higgins in anv case. A meeting was held, and the Central Executive advised that the matter be held over as the election would not be held for two months.",45
280,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They did nothing of the sort, and the honourable member knows it.",45
281,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not, and the honourable member will have an opportunity of refuting my statement afterwards, if it The matter was held over. There was a break-away from the Labour league in Collingwood, led by the honourable member for Batman. But the bulk of the members who broke away have, as far as I know, with one or two exceptions, gone back to the Labour league.",45
282,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,H ow many resigned?,45
283,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable member says that twenty-three resigned because they desired to oppose Mr Higgins, I'will He will admit take his word for it. The honourable member for Corio, in his speech in this House Every time that Mr Justice Higgins' name mentioned in Labour circles throughout the Commonwealth it is cheered, and justlv so: the learned gentleman has been almostadopted by the Labour partu, although lie was; always a member of the Liberal party. But If remember the time when the man who is now cheered was opposed,, and every effort made by the Labour party to hound him down and deprive him of his seat in the House. I ask the honourable member for Batman was that true? The honourable member has heard the question, and he may answer when he speaks in this debate. The honof orable member for Corio went on to sayJust before Mr Justice Higgins was elevated to the High'Court Bench, he was faced with a Labour antagonist in his constituency, although he had been Attorney-General in a Labour Government. The honourable member for Batman knows that that statement of the honourable member for Corio is absolutely incorrect. Mr. Justice 'Higgins .was not (faced with a Labour antagonist at the time he was appointed io the Bench; and, indeed, that was the complaint of the honourable ber.",45
284,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Was it not the honourable member's complaint also?,46
285,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I-di d not deal with the matter one way or the other.

On page 217 of Hansard of this year the honourable out member for Batman is thus reportedThe honourable gentleman also said that, one time, I stood as a candidate for the Collingwood City Council, as one not a Labour man, and was defeated; but that on occasion, when I signed the platform of the Labour party, I was returned. Let me tell the Minister that I never signed the platform.",46
288,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did the - honourable sign the Labour pledge?,46
289,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,No ; not as a Labour candidate for the Collingwood Council; and if produce any pledge that I have signed^ I am prepared,46

332,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,Unfortunatel y I cannot interject.,49
333,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member can neither interject nor speak. the course of his speech the honourable member said that he had carefully perused the official report of the Political Labour Conference, held at Brisbane last July, and, that being so, he was doubtless aware, although the House was not, that the resolution carried in regard to the question of patents was not correctly printed in the list of resolutions appended to the report. In his anxiety to endeavour to^besmirch the Labour party, however, he availed himself of a typographical error, and did not give the Conference credit for carrying the resolution that it did. The resolution actually moved by Mr Lamond, of New South VVales, and seconded by Mr Ward, of South Australia, was as followsThat the existing Patents Act should be amended to provide that no letters patent should protect any patent after the expiration of two years from registration, unless the article patented shall be then manufactured in the Commonwealth. The honourable member did not read to the House the proviso, "" Unless the article patented shall be then manufactured in the Commonwealth,"" although he must have known that there was such a limitation.",49
334,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That proviso appears in the report?,49
335,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It appears in the body of the report, but not in the resolution as printed in an appendix to the report.

It would certainly be advantageous from the point of view of the workers, and I should ; like to know whether the Ministry propose to provide in the Bill to amend the Patents Act that letters patent granted in the Commonwealth shall not hold good after a certain number of years, unless the article to which they relate is manufactured in Australia. Does the honourable member for Corio believe that a During man should obtain a patent in Australia in respect of an invention, secure the local market for all time, and at the same time make no attempt to manufacture in the Commonwealth the article to which it relates ?",49
340,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member ""should press the Treasurer for his opinion as to that.",49
341,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,He says that it does not matter.,49
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"On e would think that one had always lived only for oneself, and that the Labour party were the only people who had done any good for others.",49
343,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Corio, in the course of his speech, also stated that, at the instance of the Richmond and Hamilton branches, the State Labour Conference, Eeid in April last, decided that the following new plank be added to the platformThe establishment of State farms, mines, factories, and shops, for the purpose of affording employment, under Government supervision, to citizens requiring it , the employees to be, as far as possible, the consumers of the wealth they produce and to receive as wages an equivalent of the net total produced. He endeavoured to make light of this resolution, declaring that it meant that a journeyman, butcher would be paid for his labour by receiving something out of the. butcher's shop.",49
344,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member suggested that he would receive sausages as payment.,49
345,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,And sausages are just as much a mystery as the honourable member for Corio is.,49
346,Mr MCDOUGALL,MOTION OF WANT OF,How would the lawyers be paid under that system ?,49
347,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The resolution applies only to those who produce something useful, and I do not know that the lawyers produce anything except trouble. Any one can see at a glance what was the object of the Conference in passing the resolution. We are told that the chief objection that honourable members opposite have to the Labour party is that the members of it have to go to outside bodies for their instruction ; that they are not allowed to vote on any question without receiving directions from outside. That is an absolutely incorrect assertion. I have been a member of this Parliament from its inception, and have never been told by any branch, league, union, or executive-or by a member of any such body-that I should vote in a certain direction. But what is the position of the present Ministry? What action was taken in framing their programme, and more particularly in regard to that portion of it relating to the new Protection? When the Ministry was in process of formation, Messrs. Joshua, Hogg, Beale, and Farleigh, according to a press statement which has never been contradicted, conferred with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, and the Treasurer, and at the close of the Conference Mr Joshua informed representatives of the press that they had been able to fix up things very nicely, and yet these men cornplain that the Labour party is amenable to outside influences'! I when the Fisher Ministry was in process of formation, delegates from the Political Labour Executive of New South Wales had visited Melbourne for the purpose of directing what the Ministerial programme should be, what would honourable members opposite have said? If the Trades Hall Council of Melbourne, or of any of the other State capitals, had carried resolutions declaring that we should embody certain proposals in our programme, 'there would have been at once an outcry that we were amenable to outside influences. Nevertheless, we are told that members of the present Ministry consulted with outsiders in regard to their new Protection policy. They had a conference with employers, but the employees were not consulted. Are the workers entitled to no consideration? Would the honourable member for Maribyrnong, whom I am sorry not to see in his place, consult the licensed victuallers as to how far an amending Licensing Act should go? Of course not. He would know that they would not be prepared to go very far. Yet this Ministry is prepared to consult the employers .as to how far the new Protection legislation should go. As Mr Tudor. another instance of its readiness to consult outside bodies, let me quote from the progress report of the executive committee of the council of the Victorian Employers' Federation, which met on Monday last. According to the Age of today's dateThe report noted the success achieved by the deputation from the Employers' Federation to the Postmaster-General, protesting against the extreme telephone charges imposed by the Labour Government, and which resulted in the appointment of two expert accountants to go into the financial side of the question, while, for the present, subscribers remain under the old terms and conditions. The Employers' Federation virtually says that, ati its dictation, the Ministry has abandoned the rates of the Fisher Government, and gone back to the old terms. Then, in regard to the action of the banks in charge ing i d each for the cashing of postal notes, according to the Age of the 8th inst., the Postmaster-General, after listening to the secretary to the associated bankssaid the explanation given showed the subject in a ^new light altogether. He did not, in view of the representations now made, intend to take any further action, unless the Chamber of Commerce or some other traders' association made further complaint. Ministers have said, incorrectly, that the f , Labour party is amenable to outside influence, whereas, as a matter of fact, they themselves are continually running after the Employers' Federation, Chambers of Commerce and kindred institutions to get) their advice. The right honourable member for East Sydney declared that some arrangement must shortly be made regarding the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. What does the Ministry 1 intend to do about that? It is going toconsult the Premiers on the i6thi August, and then bring forward its policy. It has; no financial scheme of it's own, but must' go, cap in hand, to the Premiers, to learn what they think should be done. In regard to its general policy, the Government' no doubt intend to follow the lead of the press. At a meeting of the Victorian Employers' Federation, held on the 26th May- I quote from the Argus of the followingday-it was resolved to adopt the following resolution of a conference of delegates from the Chamber of Manufactures and the Employers' FederationThat this Conference is not averse to an amendment, if such be necessary, of the Constitution to provide that all the States shall"" have Wages Boards, such Boards to be in the first instance established ' by the States themselves; and that failing such establishment, and"" only after due and sufficient notice shall have been given, the Commonwealth shall have power to appoint such Wages Boards and to execute their awards. I thought that the amendment of the stitution was a question for the people, not for the employers only ! Apparently the employers must be asked whebe successful. ther Parliament may move in the matter. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.'-Hav e not the employers the right to express their opinions?",49
348,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,As much right as any one else.,51
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is what they are doing.,51
350,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They are doing more than that. One of the first resolutions ried in this Parliament, eight years ago, asked the Governments of the States give us power to enact industrial legislarate, tion. That resolution was come to mously, but none of the States has acted on it'. Are we to adopt the views of the Employers' Federation, and wait until the States take action, allowing the slowhave est of them to keep back the more progresAustralian sive ? The boot trade is one in respect which new Protection might well be operative. The making of boots is an industry in all the States, though the factories are chiefly in Victoria and South Wales. In three of the States wages have been fixed by awards of Wages Boards or the Arbitration Court. The 'fixed in Victoria is £ 2 8s. per week the worker of average skill, and the Judge of the New South Wales Arbitration Court,. in awarding the same rate to similar workers in his State, said If at any time during the existence of 'award the minimum wages in the boot trade in Victoria shall be, by any Wages Board termination, raised above the minimum above stated, then the minimum wages payable under ChijS award shall be 'the amount fixed in Victoria, provided that the minimum wages under this award shall be at rates not vene. higher than as follows. Then follow particulars of rates. Judge . Heydon declared that if he had had power to fix wages for all Australia would have allowed a minimum wage of various States. £ 2 14s. per week to the bootmakers. Subsequently the matter was dealt with in Queensland by a Wages Board, which the weekly wage at £ 2 , instead of £ 2 8s. In New South Wales the Judge, having access to confidential documents and profit and loss accounts of the various firms, said that he would award a weekly wage of £ 2 14s. if Victoria would bring her weekly wage up to that point; and whenever she does the rate in New South Wales will rise automatically.  ConWages Board in Brisbane have appealed whole to the Minister against the award.",51
351,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I trust that they will,51
352,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,They are being robbed of 14s. a week.,51
353,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They are being deprived of at least 8s. a week compared with the bootmakers of New South Wales and Victoria. This is a strong case to show the need for uniform industrial legislation. Does it cost less to live in Queensland than carin Victoria or New South Wales ? . Is it any better to live in the former State than into either of the other two States? At any there is not a difference of 20 per unanicent, in the cost of living. The boot operators in Victoria and New South Wales have no right to be receiving 20 per cent, all more than their brethren in Queensland. I not a copy of the award of the Western or South Australian Court. I .tb know that there is not an Arbitration Court made or Wages Board in Tasmania. According to today's newspaper, the Australian Boot large Trade Federation have written to the variNew ous manufacturers in New South Wales, Victoria, and the other States, but not a single manufacturer in New South Wales rate or Victoria has agieed to meet the reprefor sentatives of the men, in order to fix a rate for all Australia. All this is staring us in the face, yet we are asked to allow the determination of these questions to be left with the States. We are asked to this allow the boot operatives of Queensland to desuffer a loss of 8s. a week, and.not to put wages out a hand to help them. This is one of the cases which demonstrate that this Parso liament should have the power to interTo my mind, it proves that there is immediate need for an alteration of the Constitution to empower a Judge of the Federal Arbitration Court to fix rates-of the wages throughout Australia, instead of he having different rates prevailing in the",51
354,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Eac h State ought to be fixed the best judge of its own conditions.,51
355,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Probably the honourable member is not acquainted with the operathe tion of a Wages Board. That beautiful Act which was passed at the instance of the honourable member for Flinders provided that seven members of a Wages Board had to be on one side before an award, could be obtained. That Act has been amended, like most of the measures which he introduced, and that provision was wiped out. It also provided for an Appeal Court, which has not been wiped out. If Tasmania fixed a wage of 36s. a week or less, would it not be an incentive to every manufacturer to go to that State? The'only thing which would stop manufacturers from taking that course would be a strong trade union.",51
356,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Inter-State Commission could.,52
357,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"When is it likely to be created? What time is the honourable member going to allow to elapse before it is brought into operation? How many years is he prepared to allow the men in Brisbane to receive 8s. a week less than the men in Victoria or New South Wales? In other words, how long does he intend to punish them ? The States have to agree to the surrender of this"" legislative^ power, and does the honourable member think that the Legislative Councils are likely to give their consent?",52
358,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not mean as to the employees, but as to the States.",52
359,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am quite prepared to believe that the honourable member does not know anything about the employees.,52
360,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I know as much as the honourable member does.,52
361,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Like every other honourable member on the Opposition side, the honourable member's consideration is with the employers.",52
362,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,All the virtue is on the Opposition side.,52
363,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is right. Honourable members on the other side will not consider the interests of the employees. There is another phase of this question which even the employers in New South Wales have complained of, and that is the great disproportion of boy labour ployed in the trade in Victoria. According to the Act passed at the instance of the honourable member for Flinders, and amendments thereof, manufacturers are allowed to have an unlimited number of boys in their factories. That state of things could not be prevented, even by an Inter-State Commission.",52
364,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,My honourable friends have the Factories Act.,52
365,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,We cannot alter the thinks State Factories Act.,52
366,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The State is as good a judge as is the honourable member.,52
367,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Is the' honourable member aware that in Victoria a man has to possess £2,000 worth of property before he can stand as a candidate for the Legislative Council ?",52
368,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Judge is bound by the Act.,52
369,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Without an amendment of the Constitution, the Inter-StateCommission could not deal with State matters, except under certain circumstances.",52
370,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It could, if the States liked to give to us the power to legislate.",52
371,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In one of the factories in Victoria, there .are twelve: boys employed to one man. Does the honourable member think that that is a fair proportion to obtain? No wonder the boot manufacturers in New South Wales complain about what goes on here!",52
372,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It does not need a Federal Arbitration Court to alter these things; the State can act.,52
373,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"How are we to get uniform conditions unless we have one body operating over the whole area? The Employers' Federation are prepared to allow sufficient time to the States to act before it is willing that the Inter-State. Commission should be empowered to take any action in the matter. Let me quote a few figures here to show the employment of boys in . the boot trade in this State. According to the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories for 1903, 988 boys and 1,998 men were employed. By 1907, those boys should have grown into men, and there should have been a fair increase in the number of men employed; but'the increase was only 79, the total number of men in the trade being 2,077. If one-half of the boys who were employed in 1903 were taught properly, and have remained in the trade, an equal number of the men employed in that year has been pushed out. According to the last report of the em- Chief Inspector, which was issued about this time last year, T.,379 boys were employed, showing an increase of .391, as against an increase of only 79 in the adult males. Is it proposed to trust to the Inter-State Commission to alter that state of things?",52
374,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"There is no need, because the States can do so.",52
375,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As it affects only the workers, of course 'the honourable member that there is no need for the Inter-State Commission to act; but if it affected the employers and some Chamber of Commerce, or, to use the words of the Postmaster-General, some traders' institution made representations to this Government, then the thing might be altered. that one reason in favour of altering the Constitution so as to empower the Federal Arbitration Court to deal with industrial conditions was the judgment given in the Broken Hill case, as it affected the smelters at Port Pirie. Mr Justice Higgins said that it was quite enough for a man to work six days a week. When I learned the Ten Commandments, sir, there was one to this effect: ""Six days sha.lt thou labour,"" but the directors of Broken Hill companies say that that commandment is wrong, and that their men should labour seven days a week, or 365 days a year. What do honourable members on the other side propose to do about that ? Do they propose to leave it to the Inter-State Commission?",52
376,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,To revise the Ten Commandments ?,53
377,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Perhaps the Commandments are not up to date enough for the people who support the Ministry, and it may be that they will propose to strike out the word "" s i x "" and insert the .word ""seven."" What would have been said if a trade union had fought in the Law Courts to break one of the Commandments? A few remarks would have been made by the press on the subject, but I have not heard a word from honourable members opposite with regard to the action of the Broken Hill Proprietary directors in fighting the men upon that question. We have been asked why the Deakin party have joined the fusion, and one reason given is that their seats were being attacked by the Labour party. Some of them think that that is a good and sufficient reason for breaking away from their pledges. The Age published, on 15th July of last year, an article to this effectOne of the most exquisite of political contradictions is when an advocate of Party Government denounces the system of party pledges. Yet that is what we are treated to in the organ which holds a brief for Party Government. Apropos of the Labour pledge, we are told that that pledge "" undermines the foundations of Parliamentary institutions."" The reason given for this absurd statement is that every man ought to enter Parliament with an open mind on every question, to parley and argue, and finally give his vote wherever he may see the greatest weight of logic. Needless to say, we hold no brief for the Labour party, or its pledge, or anything concerning it. But everybody is interested in wishing that even the .most petrified Conservative should hold rational views at least about his own party. The idea that any party pledge, however rigid, can '' undermine the foundations of Parliamentary institutions"" is founded. on absolute ignorance of what Parliament is. The party pledge, so I think far from being a subversion of Parliament, has been for a couple of centuries the very basis of it. Every party has a pledge-the pledge to support its own programme. And it goes, of course, quite without saying that when a candidate' is elected on a given pledge, he is no more free to break that pledge in Parliament than is a man free to break his promise of marriage. 1 Those are the views of the Age on pledges such as those honourable members no doubt gave to their constituents. They plead that when the Labour party were supporting them they did not oppose the members of the Labour party, but take my own case. Have they not always opposed'me? I did not ask for immunity from Ministerial opposition, nor did "" I get it. The Age, of 15th December, 1903, just before the general election, published a list of those for whom it desired that the electors should vote. I do not know whether the Deakin Government, at that time, had any party pledge, or whether their supporters had to sign an undertaking to withdraw their candidature if not selected. At the top of the'list the Age saidElectors who desire to uphold Protection and"" support the Preferential Trade policy of theDeakin Government, and who are opposed toSocialism, should vote thus. And for Yarra they advised the electors tovote for my opponent, as they had every right to do. I had supported the Barton.. and afterwards the Deakin, Government for two and a half years, but did I squeal ?' I did not say a word.",53
378,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why did not the honourable member join the Deakin party ?,53
379,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Accordin g to their lineof argument I should have joined their opponents. Their paper opposed me for all it was worth . I remember preparing adiagram at the time showing the amount of space which the Age had given to my speeches during the campaign, and the amount it gave to those of my opponent. Mine looked like a little'black spot on a white piece of paper, whilethe other resembled a Collingwood footballer's guernsey, black and white all the way down. That paper gave columns to my opponent, and practically nothing to me. I was returned, and"" for three years, with the exception of thetime the Watson Government was formed, and the few months that the Reid-MCLeanMinistry lasted, I supported the Deakin Administration again. Yet at the end that time the Liberal party supported my opponent. At any rate, the Age said they did. for, in a leading article on the roth December, two days before the election, it announced, "" Mr Vale runs as a Ministerial candidate."" It had been advising the people how to vote in the Yarra electorate. I did not squeal, although they opposed me, but I came back and supported that party until last November.",53
380,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who is squealing?,54
381,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Ministeria l supporters sav that they have gone over because they are being opposed in their constituencies. I did not go over when I was opposed.,54

383,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I need not have supvote ported the Deakin Government, but it part of the political history of this country that the Labour party supported them and in? kept them in office. Perhaps the honourable member means that the Labour party caucus compelled me to support that Government. Nothing of the kind.",54
384,Dr CARTY SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why did the honourable member do it, then?",54
385,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Because I believed in them more than in the men who were on the'other side. When we oppose members of the Liberal party they say that they have never opposed us, and I have in stanced my own case, in which they did oppose us.",54
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member say he could refuse to Government after the caucus had decided to support them?,54
387,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The caucus never decided to support the Government. Some honourable members who have never been in a caucus profess to know nore who are in it , but of course that does not apply to the honourable member for ParraProtectionist matta. Many people accept as gospel truth that which appears in the press, from people who have never been inside a caucus.",54
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member say that as a caucus the Labour party never decided to support the Deakin Government ?,54
389,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I have already answered that question.,54
390,Dr CARTY SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As a caucus, they - decided to put them out of office.",54
391,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As a caucus, we thought of it was about up to them to go, as they were doing nothing. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh reminds me, in the division on the question of a Postal Commission seven members of the party voted on one side, and I suppose eighteen or nineteen of us on the other, and that was a vital question with the Government.",54
392,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The caucus does not determine regarding the l if e of Governments.,54
393,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The pledge and programme of the party are on record in Hansard, and, as one of the executive officers of the party from the time it first met until last November, I do not think it has taken a vote on half-a-dozen occasions as to what it would do on any plank of the platform, because it was so unanimous.",54

395,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,We have been told that the Liberals have never opposed Labour men.,54
396,Dr CARTY SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who said that?,54
397,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member for Maribyrnong said so at Footscray. Mr 'MAUGER - I : never said that we never opposed Labour men. I said that we had not opposed Labour men who had supported us.,54

The Trades H all people today know better what should be done. They have insisted upon pledges, and so have led to the formation of a stronger party, not only in Victoria, but in every State of the Commonwealth. I have said that the Age more nearly represents the Liberal party than does the Protectionist Association, and that is proved by the fact that at the last elections, if a candidate, selected by the Protectionist Association and the Ministry of the day was not also selected by the Age he was deMr Roberts was selected by the Ministerial party to. contest Balaclava.' I suppose that he was a pledged man, in accordance with ""the conditions contained in the - letter which I read this afternoon. He lost his deposit because the Age selected some one else. Mr Miller was the selected Ministerial candidate for Fawkner, but he was not The selected by the Age, and he lost his deThe Ministerial party ran three for»the Senate, Messrs.

We have been told that the Labour party are vote-splitters, but I remind honourable members that we gave the present honourable member for Gippsland a clear run against the last representative of that constituency. Of course, Mr Wise won the seat. We gave Mr Nicholls a clear run for Flinders, against the present member for that con stituency. Mr Nicholls - lost the seat, although the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I believe, went down to Drouin to speak for him. We did not interfere  the Conservative candidate won.

It was my intention to go into other matters at length, but I will, in the circumstances, omit some. I must, however, briefly refer to the question of a land tax, and to some other subjects. We were told by the right honourable member for East Sydney this afternoon that some system would have to be adopted to enable people to settle on the land. I have before me a copy of a letter-it has been mentioned before in this House-writte n by a Mr Ritchie, of Hamilton, asking for .£1,000 to be subscribed for the purpose of opposing the honourable member Wannon.

422,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Chea p land can be obtained in the Wannon.,56
423,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It all depends upon what the honourable member means by ""cheap."" I believe that there is some'land in the neighbourhood of Koroit which has been sold at £ 1 2 5 per acre for farming purposes. That is cheap,'is it not?",56
424,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Lan d can be obtained for £ 5 and £ 6 per acre. Dr. WILSON - The land at £ 1 2 5 is cheap in comparison with other land at £ 5 per acre.,56
425,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,We have been told that the Labour movement is not as strong as it used to be. The honourable member for Hunter said last week that the strongest men are leaving our party. Did he refer to the honourable member for Perth ?,56
426,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Perhaps he referred to the : honourable member for South Sydney.,56
427,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for South Sydney has not left the Labour party, and has no intention of doing so. He intends to retire from politics, as is well known, but that is not on account of any difference with the Labour party.",56
428,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why is he retiring, then ?",56
429,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not mind telling the honourable member privately, but the reason has nothing to do with the Labour movement If we whatever. I think that most honourable members know that. The honourable member for Hunter was not in the first Federal Parliament, but probably he is aware that the only members who have left our party have been Mr Ronald, formerly member for Southern Melbourne; Mr Dawson, formerly a senator from Queensland; and Mr Barrett, formerly a Victorian senator. Are these the "" strong men "" that the honourable member for Hunter referred to?",56
430,Dr CARTY SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did they leave of their own accord?,56
431,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think they left for a variety of reasons.,56
432,Dr CARTY SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,What happens to a man who leaves the Labour party of his own accord ?,56
433,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As a rule he goes out of politics. He does if we have any say in for the matter. I venture to say that if honourable members opposite could deal with the four members who formerly sat with them, but who are now in Opposition, they would do so at the next election. In that respect, they are in precisely the same position as we are. I remember Senator MCColl congratulating the miners on deciding not to take political action last year. But since then a new ballot of the miners has been taken. The Postmaster-General will no doubt be glad to know that last year there was a majority of 600 Bendigo miners against political affiliation. This year there is a majority in Bendigo of nearly 100 in favour of that course. In Chewton and Rutherglen, as the honourable member for Indi will be interested to learn, a majority of 100 against political action has been turned into a majority of over 100 in favour. At St. Arnaud, the honourable member for Grampians will, perhaps, be pleased to learn, the miners have turned a majority of twentythree against political affiliation into a majority of twenty in favour. In Ararat, which is also in the constituency of Grampians, there was last year a majority of forty-four against political affiliation. This year there is a majority of seventeen in favour of that course.",56
434,Dr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Will the honourable member now give us the figures for the Torrens electorate for the last two elections.,57
435,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have not got them. But, as you know, Mr Speaker, the Torrens electorate at the last State election returned five Labour members. It returns five Labour members today. The newly elected member is a Labour man. Further, it has to be remembered that a by-election is sometimes harder to win than is a seat at a general election. I am also informed that at the last general election the Labour party in Torrens had the assistance of the great Liberal newspaper of Adelaide. At the recent election, that organ was against us. But our party in South Australia have been able to do what we have always done in Victoria. We have increased our - strength, not because of any support which 'the newspapers have given to us, but in spite of most bitter and unscrupulous opposition. Does any person dream that there would have been a fusion in Federal politics if our party had remained at the strength which it possessed in the first Parliament, when we had only sixteen seats out of seventy-five? The reason for the fusion is the remarkable growth of the Labour party. Out of the sixteen Labour members who sat in the first Federal Parliament, fifteen are here today. There were fifty-nine other members in the first Parliament. Where are they now? Thirty-four of them have gone. Some have died, some have left Parliament for other reasons; but if we are to believe the honourable member for Wentworth, when a man leaves Parliament, he does it because he wants to leave his party. The fact that stands out is that we have increased our strength from sixteen to twenty-seven. In the Senate, we have a proportionately greater strength, and we hope to be still stronger after the next election. There is a Liberal organization at work in Victoria. I have before me a clipping from the Age newspaper in relation to it. As the Age is a. supporter of the Liberal party, it must be inferred that the gentleman who made the statement which I shall quote, at North Fitzroy, on the 28th of last month, represented the views of the Liberal party. The chairman of the meeting was Mr F. ONEILL, and he made the remark thatThe Labour part}' did not want to have any duty on pianos, but they were restored to the schedule through the effort of Mr Coon, and one of the first results of that is that a factory has been built in Richmond. A member of the audience interjected, "" What about Joe Cook?"" The chairman said : "" The Liberal party has swallowed Joe Cook, who has swallowed its programme."" What are the facts in connection with the piano duties ? The Labour party did not oppose those duties, which were never removed from the schedule, or, if they were, it could only have been on the initiative of a Minister, and not on any action taken by a private member.",57
436,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I submitted the motion for the duty. - Mr TUDOR - Yes , I know; the' honourable member for Batman did not move that the duty be restored, and, having looked through Hansard, I cannot see that the honourable member did more than I did myself-vote . If there is one private member who deserves any credit in connection with the piano duties, it is the honourable member for Newcastle, who worked very hard in their support, as he did in the support of other items.  Mr Beale is working so hard for the Labour party !",57
437,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have no doubt that Mr Beale will do in the future as he has done in the past; that is, do his best to ""down"" the workers, as he did during the Victorian railway strike. I have here the Labour Call of last week, which contains a record of the whole of the divisions taken in this House in connection with the piano duties. If honourable members remember, there was a proposal for a fixed duty, and an ad valorem duty, and the fixed dutywas abandoned, leaving a duty of 40 per cent. The honourable member for Lang moved to reduce that duty, and his motion was defeated by one vote. Was it by a vote of» a present Ministerialist that the motion was defeated ? Twenty-nine of the present Ministerial party voted or paired for a reduction of the duty, and only fourteen of them voted against the motion, whereas eighteen members of the Labour party voted against the motion, and only six for it ; in other words, the Labour party were three to one against any reduction, whilst the present Ministerialists were two to one in favour of a reduction. The honourable member for Dalley moved that the duty be 30 per cent, in the general Tariff and 25 per cent, in the preferential Tariff, and this was agreed to on the voices. When the schedule went to the Senate, what did the Labour members there do?",57
438,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member must not refer to what takes place in another Chamber.,58
439,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Maribyrnong, speaking at Footscray, said that a new piano factory was being erected in Richmond, and that but for the vote of the honourable member for Cook in reducing the duty, another factory would have been started in Sydney. The duties on pianos left this Chamber at 30 and 25 per cent., and came back at 25 and 20 per cent.; and amongst the votes for the lower duties were those of two men who were recommended by the Age as Protectionists at the last election. Will the honourable member for Maribyrnong state that fact in his electorate, instead of throwing the blame on a member of the Labour party ?",58
440,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That does not answer what I said; we tried to replace the duties, and would have done so but for the vote I have mentioned.",58
441,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member did not say that at Footscray, according to the report.",58
442,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Of course I said it.,58
443,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I shall make it plain at Footscray that the reduction of the duty was not owing to the vote of .a Labour man.,58
444,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,And I say it was.,58
445,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I believe that some honourable members who were returned to this House.as Protectionists voted for the lower duties; but the honourable member for Maribyrnong said not one word against them, throwing the whole of the blame on a member of the Labour party.",58
446,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is no answer.,58
447,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then I do not know what the honourable member would regard as an answer. At the same meeting the honourable member 'saidThe Old-age Pensions Act was introduced, as promised by Mr Deakin years ago, and passed by the Deakin Government. Now the Labour members were claiming that the Act was their measure. A VOICE - It was passed with the help of the Labour party.",58
448,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Labour members assisted. It was their policy, and there was no virtue in assisting. What are the facts? There would have been no Federal old-age pensions today had it not been for the honourable member for Wide Bay.",58
449,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Rubbis h !,58
450,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Will the honourable member believe the Prime Minister or the Age ? On 19th March, when the honourable o member for Wide Bay, the Leader of the' Labour party, introduced a resolution dealing with old-age pensions, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, as reported in HansardMinisters say now that, if the Conference of Premiers agrees to their financial scheme, they will provide old-age pensions at once, but that if that scheme is rejected, we must wait until the Braddon section expires.",58
451,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is so. The Premiers have not adopted the financial scheme of the Government, and the Braddon section has not expired, and yet we have Federal old-age pensions.",58
452,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is as unfair as the rest of the honourable member's comments.,58
453,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was pointed out afterwards that that interjection was not intended to convey the meaning the honourable member puts on it.,58
454,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the Prime Minister, or any other honourable member, will find me the quotation where' that was pointed out, I shall be pleased to read it.",58
455,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have pointed it out before, only two nights ago.",58
456,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then I have not seen the report.,58
457,Dr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Dalley moved that old-age pensions be instituted this year, and the Labour party all voted against it.",58
458,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is wrong. The Age of the 26th June, 1908 - the newspaper to which the honourable member for Maribyrnong owes his political existence-containe d the following: For example, it is certain that neither the Old-age Pensions Act nor the Royal Commission on postal affairs would have been passed last session had it not been for the insistence of the Labour party.",58
459,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"So I say, too.",58
460,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member said no such thing. On the words of the Prime Minister and the Age, I say that if the Labour party had not insisted, the aged poor would not be receiving Federal pensions today.",58
461,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"How did the Labour party insist? Mr TUDOR. - Le t the right honourable member ask the Prime Minister. I say that when Mr Fisher submitted his motion in favour of old-age pensions, it was not the intention of any other honourable member to take similar action. How was the money with which to pay those pensions provided? By means of the Surplus Revenue Act. How many honourable members opposite voted in favour of that measure? Why, thirty of them voted against it . Would the aged poor of Australia today be receiving at £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year more than they previously received if honourable members opposite had had their way?",58
462,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,We thought that the Surplus Revenue Act was illegal.,59
463,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And the States thought so, too. They fought the measure in the High Court, and were defeated.",59
464,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Dee s the member say that that Act provides the whole of the money that is necessary for the payment of old-age pensions?,59
465,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I say that if the Surplus Revenue Bill had not been passed, sufficient funds would not be available with which to finance old-age pensions. The only person who is entitled to credit for his action in that connection is the honourable member for Wide Bay, the Leader of the Labour party. To him is due the entire credit for having shown the way in which old-age pensions could be paid at least eighteen months prior to the expiration of the Braddon section. The honourable member for Flinders voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill .",59
466,Dr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,But not against the payment of old-age pensions.,59
467,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Of course not. Much as some honourable members opposite would have liked to vote against the Old-age Pensions Bill , they dared not do so. But instead, they voted against the measure which was necessary to provide the money with which to pay those pensions-a n infinitely worse action. I can respect an open enemv, but I cannot respect honourable members who voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill for the purpose of killing the old-age pensions scheme, and who had not the courage to stand up and publicly avow their intention.",59
468,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,That statement is just about as unfair as the remainder of by a certain number of votes. the honourable member's remarks.,59
469,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I can assure the Treasurer that I have no desire to be unfair. I have merely stated the position as I view it. Many honourable members used the Surplus Revenue Bill as an excuse for delaying the initiation of a Federal system of old-age pensions.,59
470,Mr ATKINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Surplus Revenue Act provides only a very small proportion of the money required to pay those pensions. least Mr TUDOR - The greater proportion of it is provided by that Act. It is not my intention to delay the House any longer. This afternoon the right honourable member for East Sydney declared it was not his intention to deal with the past, but, as a matter of fact, practically the whole of his remarks were devoted to the past. In my opinion, the well-being of the inhabitants of Australia was better honourable safeguarded by the late Ministry than it is by the present Government. I do not think we can look to honourable members opposite for any system of land legislation which is likelv to promote settlement.",59
471,Dr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Le t us leave the matter to the States ,59
472,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , let us leave it to the States, with their Upper Houses. Some honourable members affect to believe that the present Ministry will give them new Protection. As a matter of fact, every opponent of the Factories Act is to be found upon the other side of the Chamber. Why does the Employers' Federation subscribe to the principle of Wages Boards? Simply because it believes that those Boards represent the lesser of two evils. I believe that the only way in which we can obtain an effective system of new Protection is to be obtained by an amendment of the Constitution. The newspapers of this city are constantly exhorting us to get on with the business of the country. But when the Prime Minister proposed a three-weeks' adjournment of the House, and the Opposition suggested that an adjournment for two weeks would be ample, the press supported the plea of the Government that a fortnight would not be too long to enable them to prepare their measures. Yet, if any member of the Labour party now dares to express his opinions, he is accused of blocking business. We have been told that this motion will be defeated Whether that statement Se true or not-r ",59
473,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member knows very well that it is true.,60
474,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If some honourable members disregard their principles, and vote in a certain direction for the purpose of saving their seats, I have no doubt that it will be defeated. Put the reason underlying their action will be a desire to stave off the evil day as long as possible-the day when they will be called to account for having broken the pledges which they gave to their constituents at the last general election.",60
475,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"B y way of personal explanation, I should like to correct the inference which is to be drawn from certain remarks by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. ferred to a letter which I wrote about three years ago to a Mr Hodges, and he endeavoured to induce the House to believe that that letter was typical of the communications forwarded to every other candidate seeking the support of the Government at that time. That is an entirely wrong construction to place upon it, and, therefore, I propose to state the facts.  similar letters which were forwarded to two other men.",60
476,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member has not. The facts are that prior to the general election in 1906, Mr E. F. G. Hodges wrote to the Prime Minister, Mr Deakin, asking that he might be selected as the Government candidate for Mernda. At that time. I was acting as secretary to the Cabinet, and the letter was referred to me for an answer. As a result, I forwarded a reply, of which the honourable member for Yarra has read a copy.",60
477,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is a correct copy.,60
478,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I believe that it is an exact copy. At the time that letter was written, it was believed that Mr. Hodges was a member of the Labour party, and as, in duty bound, I had to protect the Government from securing the return of candidates under false pretences ",60
479,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Mr Hodges applied to be Selected as the Government candidate for Mernda. In reply to his application, I gave him a dose of the political medicine which the Labour party administers to its candidates, by asking him if he were willing to stand down if not selected. He did not reply to my letter, but, apparently, as the result of it, withdrew his candidature for Mernda, and a little later came out in his true colours as the Labour candidate for Kooyong. We have it on the authority of the honourable member for Yarra that no person can become a Labour candidate unless he has been twelve months a member of some organization affiliated with the Political Labour Council.",60
480,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am afraid that the honourable member is now proceeding beyond a personal explanation.,60
481,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is a part of the matter to which the honourable member referred. However, my point is that Mr Hodges, when seeking to be He re- selected as a Government candidate, must have been a member of the Labour party, as shown by the fact that he subsequently became the Labour candidate for Kooyong, a neighbouring constituency, and that he was endeavouring under false pretences to obtain the nomination of the Government for the constituency of Mernda. In such circumstances, it is my duty to expose the sort of Tammany tactics which these gentlemen apparently adopt in order to secure, election to this Chamber as Liberals, only to desert the Liberal party at a later stage, and to join forces with the Labour party, to which they always belonged. It was done in another case.",60
482,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is that part of the honourable member's letter correct in which it is stated that all persons seeking selection as Government candidates must do the same thing.,60
483,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not know whether or not a correct copy of the letter has been read, but I stand by what I wrote. I repeat that Mr Hodges, knowing that he was a member of the Labour party, tried to secure selection as a Government candidate, and to get into this House under false pretences. If these Tammany tactics are the tactics of the Labour party, the sooner they are exposed the better.  orable member had left that unsaid.",60
484,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I have more to follow.,60
485,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Batman) [9.17] - I rise with some diffidence to address myself to the question before the Chair after the extraordinary speech of the honourable member for Yarra, but I feel it my duty to make some reference to the attack which he made upon me.",60
486,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Order ! It is quite impossible for the honourable member to proceed whilst honourable members are moving about the chamber, and speaking in loud tones.",61
487,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"At one time. I was a member of the Labour party, and when it no longer represented the workers I saw lit to discontinue my connection with it, I paid up my dues, and resigned. I desire to read a statement made in this House on the 28th May last, by the honourable member for Yarra, who said - 1 The honourable member for Batman had to sign a promise that he would not stand for the position, in order to become eligible for selection by the Committee. He was then suggesting that I had to sign a certain document in order to secure the nomination of the Literals for the Batman constituency. The honourable member for Boothby interjected, "" So he signed the pledge ?"" and the honourable member for Yarra continuedYes, that is so, according to the statements of those who were present at that meeting. I give that statement a most emphatic denial. At no time did I sign a pledge as a Ministerial candidate. I was never asked to sign a pledge, and I did not sign one. So much for misrepresentation No. 1. Let me deal now with the second misrepresentation. The honourable member is reported in Hansard to have interjected, in the course of a speech made by me on the same dateDid the honourable member never sign the Labour pledge ? I repliedNo; not as a Labour candidate for the lingwood Council; and if he can produce pledge that I have signed I am prepared. to resign straight away. The honourable member has produced to the night a Labour platform card with my name written across it, and he has sought to tie me down to that as a pledge signed by As a member of the Central Executive of ihe Political Labour League, the honourable member knows full well that my selection as a candidate of the Labour party would not be endorsed unless I signed its pledge, and the municipal pledge I did not at any time sign. I come now to misrepresentation No. 3. The honourable member produced to-night a letter which was written and in 1902, but which was misdated that 1903. It was written at a time when I was in no way connected with the Labour party, but the honourable member played such tricks on me? has repeated to-night a speech which he hearsed a few weeks ago at a meeting held in the Collingwood Town Hall- a speech made, not in. the interests of the country, but with the object of downing me. And this is the attitude which the honourable member adopts towards one who was at one time the chairman of his election committee, and was selected to move a resolution in favour of his candidature at all his large meetings. I was the chairman of the honourable member's election committee when I was one of the representatives of a ward in the Collingwood City Council. That council, by the way, is the most democratic in .Victoria, and yet there is not a pledged Labour man in it. The Labour party have an opportunity at the forthcoming municipal election to endeavour to secure the return of five candidates, but they have decided only to challenge my re-election, and to allow all the other retiring councillors a walk-over. In connection with that municipal election, the honourable member for Yarra will have an opportunity to air his eloquence on the public platform.",61
488,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is a Labour rat all the same.,61
489,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,A few days ago the honourable member for Hindmarsh stated that I went cringing-and crawling to the Labour party to secure immunity from opposition.,61
490,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,1 did not say that.,61
491,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member said that I wished to rejoin the Labour party. As a matter of fact, I have never sought to rejoin the party, and have never approached any one acting on behalf of the party with that object in view. It is true that Colthe honourable member for Hume once sugany gested that I should approach the Attorney. . . General in the Labour Administration-the honourable member for West Sydney-and Minister of Defence, Senator Pearce, with a view of securing the withdrawal of the Labour candidate selected to oppose me. me. I told the honourable member, however, that I would not do anything of the kind, and I did not. The honourable member for Hindmarsh inferred that I endeavoured to secure immunity from opposition on the part of a party that stoned me at the last election j that broke up nearly every meeting that I held, that howled down the Prime Minister, who spoke at one of mv meetings, covered up, after midnight, every notice I had had posted. Is it reasonable for the honourable member for Hindmarsh to accuse me of trying to re-join a party that At the last regeneral election, I was opposed by a Labour candidate, Mr Solly, who resigned from the State Parliament in order to fight me. The result of the election was that I secured 7,098 votes as against 6,617, polled by the Labour candidate, 330 secured by Mr. Painter, who stood on the same platform as I did, and 151 polled by Mr Vernon. In other words, I defeated the selected Labour candidate by 481 votes. Labour Conference held on the 17th March last, for the purpose of selecting a candidate to run in opposition to me, Mr Lloyd, a member of the Collingwood branch of the Labour League, suggested that I should not be opposed, and Mr Miller, ex-President of the Trades Hall Council, suggested to the Conference that steps should be taken to expel him from the Labour movement for having dared to make such a proposition. The honourable member for Yarra saw fit to accuse those on this side of the chamber of having broken their pledges. I have not broken one of mine, though I should have had to do so had I supported the Fisher Government. I was returned after the strongest fight against a Labour candidate which any Victorian representative had to make. The Ministry of the day determined, on the 27th November, 1906, to support me, but the Age selected me only on 12th December, the day of the election. I said on the 4th December last that I would not support the Fisher Ministry because of its attitude in regard to the fiscal question. I stated-Hansard , volume X LVIII . , page 2743-that I was returned as a Protectionist in tion to the Labour party, and the Labour leagues in my own electorate today are ing a candidate to oppose me at the next ral election. I do not complain of that, but I do complain of the stand taken by the Minister on this question. Earlier in the day I had asked the Minister of Home Affairs whether, in view of the fact that tenders are being called for the provision of ventilating fans in the General Post Office, Melbourne, he is prepared to give an opportunity to Australian manufacturers to tender? At present the latter are debarred. The honourable member for Coolgardie, who was then Minister of Home Affairs, repliedAt present I am not advised as to the position ; but may have the information later on. I then asked the Prime Minister if he was prepared to announce what is the fiscal policy of the Government-whethe r they are Protectionists or Free Traders ? To which he repliedThe Government will have no hesitation in declaring their policy at the proper time. It may be thought that the policy of the Ministry was declared in the Gympie speech. But when the honourable member for Wide Bay, after speaking of the great At a progress made by Australian industries, referred to the fiscal question, he merely saidThe Commonwealth Parliament has power to deal with Customs and Excise. It has. power to put on a protective Tariff. Australians have, rightly or wrongly, settled on a policy of Protection for Australia. Rightly or wrongly ! Surely the Ministry claiming the right to lead a national Parliament should have a definite fiscal policy.",61
492,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Has the honourable member's party a definite fiscal policy ? Mr COON.:- I am speaking for myself, not for any party. The honourable member for Wide Bay was silent as to the attitude which his Government would take regarding Protection and Free Trade. But speaking in Melbourne on ist December, at a conference of manufacturers, he saidThe Conference would not have been able to present such a full-hearted report of progress had it not been for the fulfilment of the policy of his right honourable friend, Mr Deakin, at the last Federal elections. To Mr Deakin and his party Australia was indebted for the protective policy which had enabled the Commonwealth during the last year to make such marvellous progress in its manufacturing industries. opposiBut at Gympie he made no declaration of policy regarding the fiscal question. The selectreason can be understood. He had in his gene- Ministry the honourable member for West Sydney, one of the bitterest opponents of Protection in this House, the honourable members for Barrier and Coolgardie, and Senator Pearce, all Free Traders', and the honourable member for Boothby, a shandygaff Protectionist. The honourable member for West Sydney, speaking in this chamber on 28th August, 190.7-honorabl e members will find his remarks recorded in Hansard, volume XXXVIII., page 2484Every one knows that I am a Free Trader. I have never he.sitated to declare myself in favour of Free Trade, whether the policy has been popular or unpopular. . . . The greatest crime imputed to the Labour party in the New South Wales Parliament, was that it had sunk the fiscal issue, which we have never regarded but as of secondary importance. The honourable member says that the Labour party has always regarded as of secondary importance a question affecting industries employing 250,000 persons, and distributing wages to the sum of £19,000,000 per annum. He addedThe Free Trade members of the party have always voted for the lowest duties possible. I have always stated that I did not consider Protection desirable. Then he stated, at page 24881 wish now to state my attitude on the Tariff. It is one that I have always maintained. I do not think that Protection provides more employment for the people. I have never thought that it does so. Yet I am told that I broke my election pledges by ceasing to support a Ministry containing' an honourable member who had stated that Protection does not increase employment. The other day the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that he had no fiscal sins to answer for, that he was neither Protectionist nor Free Trader. I find that in 122 divisions he voted for Protection sixty-six times, and for Free Trade fifty-six times. When the honourable member for Calare was speaking on the Budget on the 4th September, 1907, he saidAs honourable members are aware, members of the Labour party have no particular fiscal faith. . . . To-day I am sorry to see that the Opposition are not led by a gentleman who is pledged to Free Trade principles as the first plank in his political programme. He regretted the fact that on the Opposition benches, there was riot an honourable member pledged to Free Trade, so that they could have ousted the Ministry-on their Tariff proposals. The honourable member for Hume does not say, ""Hear, hear,"" to that sentiment.",62
493,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not hear what the honourable member said. I do not like backsliding Protectionists.,63
494,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have not a great deal of faith in backsliding Free Traders. intend now to quote an extract from the Barrier Truth, which I understand is the only Labour daily newspaper. Writing on the 2 ist September, 1906, it saidHere, in Broken Hill , efforts are likely to be made to introduce the fiscal herring into Laborism. So far as individual expressions of opinion are concerned, and as long as they are confined lo mere opinions, we have no right to object. If a Laborist believes conscientiously in Protection, the Labour platform in no way prohibits him from doing so. Nor does it stop him from giving utterance to his ideas as often as he pleases or wherever he pleases. If , again, a* Laborist has foreign trade beliefs there is no reason why he should be afraid to enunciate those beliefs. Labour platform does not say that he should >iot be a foreign trader. [44] I have heard some honourable members state that they do not like being classed as foreign traders, but the Barrier Truth says that a Labour man can be the representative of the foreign"" trader, that, if he likes, he can be in favour of sweated labour from other parts, female labour in Japan, and long hours in Germany and elsewhere. The honourable, member for Hume, says, "" I am in favour of new Protection, Factories legislation, high wages, and short hours,"" but at the same time he is prepared by his vote and speech to allow sweated goods from other countries to come into Australia.",63
495,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Rubbish, and the honourable member knows it.",63
496,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I believe that the honourable member is an authority on some things, and therefore I propose to quote from the Sydney Bulletin, which he told us the Other day he considered is one of the best newspapers in Australia.",63
497,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,So it is.,63
498,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I amglad to hear that.,63
499,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,It does not support the honourable member now though.,63
500,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In its issue of the 24th June, 1909, it wrote in these termsThe foreign trader in the Labour ranks was always an anomaly and always a traitor. His special craving was for the free admission of the goods of any kind of nigger or other undesirable who was willing to work twelve hours a day for a shilling or eighteenpence. If the Australian workman, toiling ' eight hours per day for one shilling or so per hour, could not produce goods which would enable them to sell in free and open competition with the cheap article of the nigger or other foreign undesirable, the only theory that the foreign trade alleged Laborite had to offer was that the Australian should take less wages or work longer hours. I That quotation is taken not from a Labour newspaper or the Age or the Daily Telegraph but from a journal in which the honourable member for Newcastle believes. I ask him if he believes in that conclusion about the foreign trader.",63
501,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,But it does not convert the honourable member.,63
502,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Le t the honourable member go back to his constituents after the exposure to-night and 'see what they will say.,63
503,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am prepared to go back to my constituents and - to be returned. The,63
504,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is not game to go to them at once.,63
505,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I have not the least doubt but that my majority will be increased if I should have the honour of a visit from the honourable member to my constituency.,64
506,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I will go down right. I will help the honourable member out as fast as I can. After the exposure to-night he should resign.,64
507,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"When the honourable gentleman gets a seat on the Treasury bench he does not care very much about resigning it. I remember him stating that the Labour party would get the backwash of public opinion for turning him out of office. Sir WILLIAM LYNE,-They will kick out the honourable member and a few more too.",64
508,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall now show that Protection does increase employment. Several honourable members interjecting,",64
509,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The conversations that are taking place between honourable members must cease.,64
510,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I propose to quote statistics with regard to New South Wales.,64
511,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am sorry to have tb take this step, but the honourable member for Hume, immediately I gave a certain direction, disregarded it, and continued the conversation to which I had objected.",64
512,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I did not tear what you said, sir.",64
513,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then I ask the honourable member now to observe that these conversations, so highly irregular and so disturbing to the honourable member who is speaking, must cease.",64
514,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In New South Wales on 31st December, 1907, there were 4,387 factories and works, showing an increase, as compared with 1906, of 526 j the hands employed were-male s 66,66'], increase 6,688; females 20,527, increase, 2,684; total, 87,194; increase, 9,372. That shows that protection has increased employment in New South Wales as well as in other States. The late Prime Minister, the honourable member for Wide Bay, recently challenged the honourable member for Maribyrnong to produce a record of any vote which 'he had given for free trade. I produce the record to show that the honourable member for Wide Bay voted for Free Trade, when he and other Labour members, and the House generally, knew that a certain class of machinery was being made in Australia. I refer to rock drills. Those who voted for Free Trade on that item included the honourable members for Calare, Kalgoorlie, Coolgardie, Maranoa, Grey, Darling, and Barrier, all Labour members. Those who paired in favour of Free Trade included the honourable member for Wide Bay, the honourable member for all Perth, and the honourable member for West Sydney, also Labour members. Every one of them on that occasion voted or paired for Free Trade, with the result) that a number of men have been thrown out of employment. That was one case.",64
515,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,What was the vote taken on ?,64
516,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The question was "" That the item be free,"" and it was carried on the casting vote of the Chairman of Committees, the honourable member for Kennedy, who is also a Labour member. Those honourable members, who claimed to be in favour of new Protection, shorter hours, and higher wages, were prepared to tell the miners of Bendigo, Broken Hill, and Western Australia that their sons could go down into the deep mines and work for their living; that they would allow the importers to flood the markets, and throw the young men of those places out of employment, and that, instead of being engineers the miners' sons could be miners for all they cared. On the night that division was taken, I stated that not a single miner had asked for the duty to be takenoff rock drills, but the importers were represented here, and won the day. Honourable members who were sent here to represent theworkers thought of the importers first and voted Free Trade on that item. I come now to the question of wire netting. I had the honour and privilege of receiving a letter signed by 200 workmen of Lysaght's wire netting works in Sydney, thanking me for the efforts I had made on their behalf. When in Sydney, I was informed by-the manager of that firm that not a single Labour member had ever visited the factory or made inquiries. The duty was taken off by misrepresentations, and not one of the Labour members went to the factory or knew anything about the works or the wages that were being paid there. I went to the factory to obtain information to refute the statement, made by the honourable member for Calare and others, that the men in Lysaght's wire netting works were not being paid a sufficient wage. I now produce the firm's wage list, which is open to the inspection of any honourable member. It shows that at the time some of the men were earning £ 3 10s., and others £ 3 per week. But what can we expect when the honourable member for Yarra, who was Minister of Trade and Customs in the late Administration, and who boasts that he is the pure merino, that he is the only champion of the workers, and that he supports a policy of shorter hours and higher wages, stands up in this Chamber as the champion of prison-made goods, and urges that those men should be brought into competition with prison labour? That honourable member expressed the opinion that the men who were toiling outside should be thrown out of work by this Parliament granting a bonus to wire netting made in Pentridge. The honourable member knew at the time that these men were going to be thrown out of employment, but he said that the prisoners at Pentridge should get a bonus for making wire netting. From pages 12178'and 12:r79 of Hansard, 5th June, 1908, I find that the honourable member saidT fail to see why prison-made wire netting produced in Australia should be prevented from participating in the proposed bounty. The honourable member, as late head of the Custom's Department, while knowing of the issue - of a regulalation prohibiting the importation of prison-made goods, was prepared to subsidize prison labour in order to allow it to enter into competition with free labour. Speaking on the same question, Sir William Lyne saidIt would compete with the industry established in New South Wales. The honourable member for Parramatta, the present Minister of Defence, said I rise chiefly for the purpose of offering my sincere congratulations to the secretary of the Labour party in this Parliament upon his magnificent attempt this afternoon to sweat down the wages of the wire workers of Australia by bringing them into competition with bounty-fed prison labour. , The honourable member for West Sydney, who was Attorney-General in the late Labour Government,* said, on the same questionI cordially echo the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta in denouncing in the most enthusiastic way the attempt of Victoria to compete by means of prison labour with the free labour of the State. I represent. It was not the State of Victoria, but the representative of the workers, from the democratic constituency* of Yarra, that sought here to champion prison-made goods in competition with the products of free labour. Yet the honourable gentleman will shortly be telling the workers in my district to vote against me because I was [44]- 2 against the workers. I say that, if I stood here as the champion of prison-made goods, I should expect at the next election to reap my reward, and I should get. it outside, and not inside, of this Chamber. I want to say that 120 men were thrown out of employment at Lysaght's wire netting works, as a result of the remission of the duty. When the honourable member for Hume introduced the Tariff, the duty he got carried was the means of reducing the price of wire netting from £ 3 6 to £ 3 1 . To-day there is no Protection in that industry, and I am given to understand that, as a consequence, the farmers have to pay more for their wire netting than they otherwise would have to pay. What did the Fisher Administration propose to dc with respect to the question, of new Protection, on which the honourable member for Yarra spoke so strongly?"" New Protection could have waited for the next three years, so far as they were concerned. Their only* desire was to get to the country. Yet they told the workers, ""You can only get the benefits of the new Protection from us."" I venture to say, without the least fear of successful"" contradiction, that the last Administration were anxious to secure a dissolution and go to the country. They knew that, if they did secure it, there could be no new Protection carried, because there could, in that event, have been no immediate amendment of the Constitution. If honourable members require any proof of that, they have only to read the speech of the late Prime Minister in November last. When making his Ministerial statement, he told the House that there was no hurry about the new Protection, because a Bill had to be framed and passed six months before a general election. Amongst other things, he said that honourable members were not desirous of going to the country, and as he had no wish to irritate them it was net his intention to bring on such a measure at that time. The workers are told that honourable - members on this side are against the new Protection and Factories legislation. We can thank the late proprietor of the Age newspaper, Mr David Syme, and the present Prime Minister, for Protection in Australia. By whom have proposals in support of the new Protection been put forward in this Chamber ? Has it been by members of the Labour party? No. The first to submit such a proposal was Mr Justice Higgins, when member for the constituency which I now have the honour to represent; the next was the honourable member for Maribyrnongneither of these gentlemen was a Labour member-and the third was myself. All were members of the Liberal party. I had the honour of submitting a motion in this Chamber, soon after my return, that, in order that the workers should receive equal Protection with the factory owners, this Parliament should ask the various States to give it power to deal with the question of new Protection. I venture to say that, so long as the present Prime Minister is at the head of the Commonwealth Government the workers will have to expect the same benefits at his hands as they have received in the past. No one can gainsay the fact that there is no man in this House, or outside of it, who has worked harder in the interests of the workers, and none who has championed the cause of Factories legislation, in season and out of season, more effectively than the present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Ballarat. We are asked to believe that the honourable members for West Sydney, Barrier, and Kalgoorlie are in favour of the new Protection. In the States of New South Wales and Victoria there are 7,000 women employed in the shirt-making industry. I propose to read some evidence which I have taken from a report presented to the House of Commons last year in connection with this industry. I shall quote briefly the evidence given by a couple of employees in that industry in the Old Country, in order to compare the conditions there with those which prevail in the same industry in Australia. This is the evidence given by one womanWhat trade are you engaged in ?-Shir t maker. You are married, I think?-Yes . What family have you?-Six children. Hon' many of them are young?-They are all young, the eldest being fourteen. What is your husband's occupation?- A labourer. Is he in.work?-He ;;ot into work about three weeks ago, after being out about three years. Has he been ill ?-No , he is quite strong. How long have you worked at shirt making? - About sixteen years. May I ask if you are a quick worker?Yes, very quick. How much - can you earn per day at your work?- I average ios. per week-fro m 9s. to ios. per week. How many hours per day will you work in earning that?-Between 15 and 16 hours. am sometimes up at six o'clock, and I work till ten at night. Mr Coon. I will quote the evidence of another witness. She was also a girl engaged in the shut trade in England. She was examined as follows :You are in the shirt finishing?-Yes. Do you work at home?-Yes . Do you make shirts throughout, button-holes, and buttons. Is that the best class of shirts?Yes, for trie best class we get 8d., and others 5d. per dozen. That is all done by hand?-Yes . That is not work that could be done by machinery ?-No . It is all done by hand. At 3d. per dozen, how much can you earn a week?-You cannot earn more than about 5s. or 6s. a week, and then you have to sit up_ from six in the morning til l twelve o'clock at night to earn that. Here was a girl who made 84 buttonholes for 51L, whilst the wages board in Victoria has laid it down that such a worker must be paid rs. od. The members of the Labour party say that they stand for the policy of new Protection. But they do not stand for the old Protection. They are prepared to allow shirts made under the conditions that I have described to be imported into this country in competition with shirts made by .our own women and girls who are paid 120 per cent, higher wages. The honourable member for Yarra took credit to his party on account of old-age pensions. He said that the old men and women of this country would not have had old-age pensions had it not been for the Labour party.",64
517,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They would not, either.",66
518,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What did the Labour party do in connection with invalid pensions? Did they propose to pay them ? Did they make any reference to the subject? While the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was sitting in the Ministerial corner last session, he chided the late Administration with having proposed invalid pensions merely as a placard. He represented that it was simply a matter of make-believe. The Labour - party were in power six months and could at any time, by proclamation, have commenced to pay invalid pensions. But they made no attempt to do so. No provision was made for paying them. The present'Leader of the Opposition, in his Gympie speech, simplv made a passing reference to the subject. He said in effect, "" I regret to say we are not able to pay invalid pensions yet."" Not one single word was contained in the Governor General's speech respecting invalid pensions. I If the Labour party were in earnest on the subject, why did they not make provision for ithe ©Ml men and women who are 111-s'allids, who 'Should have been receiving these pensions xo-.day ? It surprises me to find that though the Labour party - was in ipawer for six months they did not - think - that this matter was of sufficient importance *o receive -;ec©g-nition. At the - same time (they 'had £ 7 50,000 in the Treasury upon M'llniioh they could operate at once. Surely the first duty - of tihe Labour Ministry was to have started the payment of these pensions by Proclamation.  - which has the honourable member's support doing in the matter ? Mr COON. - I have .not ,the ihonour to - occupy a seat on the Ministerial .bench at the (present moment, and therefore I do riot know.. But when .honourable members opposite talk about old-age pensions I am entitled to ask why thejate Prime Minister did not take .the responsibility of saying ;ait Gympie, "" I believe that invalids should receive pensions, and am prepared to - commence .the payment of them on .the ist July.''' But no:! He simply regretted that his Government could not clo It. What was the trouble? Was there no money available? Was the ex-Prime Minister .afraid of the difficulty offinancingold-age anil - invalid pensions? Yet the - honourable member for 'Yarra takes credit to 'his - party - in 'Qonnexion wife this matter. As a matter of 'f-act his - party simply - brushed it asidle. Instead, the late Cabinet said, "" We are going to'build a bush capital.'"" Tha't was their First >plarik.

520,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"So .was ithe ex-Minister of Home Affairs before he became .a .member of the late Ministry. On the 23rd October tie said, in his .place in this ""House, that the - question - was not of sufficient importance to 'be dealt with, and moved that the Bill under consideration be read that dav six - months.

I shall, on alloccasions, freely vote money, if the opportunity offers, for the - prevention of these - great annual losses - I now desire to draw, attention to the vote which, on 10th November last, displaced the 'Deakin 3tdmiriisti ation.

No one knows why the ""DeaTcin 'Government were removed-=no t - a 'word 'on the point has 'been saicl by the ex-Prime Minister or 'any of his followers. We have been told that in the opinion of the Labour Government the Deakin Government did not move fast enough; But I ask: How fast did the Fisher Government move? The Labour party said to the Deakin Government: '' Here are your Estimates; do you propose to increase the salaries of all the higher officials? If you do not take your Estimates baclc, you shall not remain on the Treasury benches."" But did the Fisher Government re-model the Estimates? As a matter of fact, not a single figure 'or line was altered-no t a single salary was reduced. All the officials in the higher ranks were given increases, while the men in the lower ranks received no recognition. And how did the Fisher Government carry on the business of the country? As soon as they got into recess they went from one end of Australia to the other denouncing the men who supported them. Their first act was to conciliate political leagues in the various constituencies ; and we had the announcement that, if the Government were turned out of office, honourable members would be sent to their masters-the electors-at the earliest possible moment.",67
522,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,But honourable members did not go to the electors!,68
523,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That was not the fault of the Government, and, in my opinion, only the members of the Ministry desired to appeal to the country, the rank and file of the Labour party having no desire in that .direction. Then I am accused of having broken my pledges, and been called upon to resign. The honourable member for Yarra produces a card, and says to me, ""Resign now."" . They want my seat. But let me tell the honourable member for Yarra that whether I resign my position or not, the Labour party cannot secure my seat. They had the chance of a lifetime at the last elections, and they "" missed the bus."" I was elected to this Parliament upon a definite pledge, and a definite programme, to represent the great mass of workers in my constituency. When I shrink from doing my duty, when I cease to represent the men and women who sent me here, I shall cease to enjoy their confidence. But up to the present time. I am quite willing to place my record in this House against that of"" any of the twenty-six pledged members of the Labour party. I am prepared to rely upon my record in Hansard, and I venture to say that there is not.one man in the Labour party who has done more for the workers than I have. I do not stand here as the representative of the foreign trader or of sweated labour or of prison-made goods. I am here to advocate equal opportunities for every man and woman in the community. I believe that the policy which the Prime Minister has placed before us will receive the endorsement of the people of Australia. When honourable members opposite are prepared to occupy eight or nine hours in delivering speeches for the purpose of blocking progressive legislation, I would ask them whether their action is calculated to provide employment for the workless amongst us. Not a bit of it. Their only concern is to raise a bogy by declaring, "" Look what the supporters of the present Ministry have done to us. They have turned us out of office."" Why do they not accept their defeat like men ? Why did they go to the Collingwood Town Hall, and exclaim, "" Look at your representative who has broken his pledges. We did not expect to gain office?"" But they got there, and it took a team of bullocks to drag them from the Treasury bench.",68
524,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member's action marks the end of his political career.,68
525,Mr COON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It will take fifty men like the honourable member to terminate my political career. What did the Labour party do in Collingwood at the last election? They had a supper prepared, and engaged a brass band to play "" See the conquering hero comes,"" for "" Fighting Bob."" But when the poll was announced, "" Fighting Bob "" was found to be 500 votes behind me. That gentleman then said: "" Well, if I cannot beat you at the polls I am prepared to fight you.

It is a matter of indifference to me that I have been defeated."" But he added : "" I am in a position to keep my wife, and that is more than the successful candidate can do."" When Mr Solly could not get even in any other way he uttered that cowardly insinuation. Those honourable members who talk so much about representing labour, merely represent themselves. I have no apology to offer for votes, I ami proud of them. ' I said on December last that I was opposed to fiscal atheists, and the Labour party Free Traders, and I have since said that I am opposed to any party that is not prepared to find work for pur workless.

528,Mr CARR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Macquarie) [10.34] - I do not intend to.allow such an epoch in the have changed. history of this Parliament as the fusing of two old parties to pass without people. offering a comment or two. I shall, howto ever, ' endeavour to avoid the Billingsgate in which some honourable members have inby dulged, although I admit that each speaker has been provoked to say things of a criminatory nature- a circumstance that is quite understandable. With regard to fusion of political parties which has taken place in this Parliament, I have nothing to say against those honourable members who thought it was necessary for them to sink their party pledges for the good of the country. Doubtless that was the view entercompromise, tained by most of them; if not, their have action is open to other imputations. My contention is that when a party conin siders it necessary, as a party, to sink principles-whe n it thinks it desirable to coalesce with another party-it should at least seek the sanction of the people for what it proposes to do. If its members do not seek that sanction, they are open to withdrawn. the imputation of being self-seekers, or having taken action merely to serve their own purpose. I make no such imputation against the Government and their supimportance. porters, but I say that they are open to such a charge. My conception of Demoof cracy is that when a representative of the people thinks fit to sink his principles only fair to Democracy that he should before the people, and ask their sanction for what he has done. In this connection the Government and their supporters should think well of the writer who has said that my consistency is the doctrine of- - fools. 4th They should inscribe that dictum on their banners, and it ought certainly to give them some consolation. I have heard it whis' pered that honourable members opposite do not care to go to the country at the present juncture, because they consider that people are not in a fit frame of mind had to receive an appeal from them. Possibly that view is entertained by some honourable members opposite. If it is, they evidently I am assume that something has occurred to stimulate action on the part of the people in a direction which would prove disadvantageous to the fusion. If that be so, they are not ignoring the fickleness of public opinion-assumin g that it exists-the y are putting off the evil day, hoping, no doubt, that when, in the ordinary course of events, they have to go to the country public opinion regarding the fusion will We have been charged with only pretending to desire to go to the ' Personally, I should be delighted do so, because, if the policy on which I was elected is not to be carried into effect this Parliament, I have no desire to be a member of it. Our allegiance to the late reDeakin Government has been described as "" similar to that of the Liberal party to the the present Ministry. There is, however, a very material difference between a fusion and an alliance, such as ours was. As I understand the fusion, it means the sinking of the .individual opinions of both parties and a blending of them into the. form of a such as we are supposed to in the manifesto issued by the Ministry. That was not the attitude that we adopted regard to the Deakin Administration. its We simply allied ourselves with them, on the distinct understanding that, whilst their course of action met with our approval they should have our support, and that as soon as it ceased to do so, our support would be No such arrangement has of been made by honourable members opposite. They were divided, not only on the fiscal question, but on matters of even greater It has been said to-night by several honourable members that the division opinion existing among the two parties to the Coalition with regard to the fiscal it is question is no more to be condemned than go is ours. There is, however, a distinct difference .between the position of the Labour party and that of honourable members opposite. The honourable member for East Sydney sought to show that there was very little, difference between the treatment of the fiscal question by the present fusion aftd, the attitude o.f the Labour party in regaled to, it. As a matter of fact, however, the members of o.ur party have not agreed ' to, sink the fiscal iss.ue; we have simply agreed that the members of the party shall be free to vote as they please in regard to, it. The honourable member for Swan asked to-night why we did not include the fiscal question, in o.ur platform. We have apt done so for the obvious reason, that we are not agreed upon it. We include in ourplatform, only those planks on which we are in absolute agreement. We have agreed to differ on the fiscal question, but the fusion have agreed to sink it, and, in. so faras they haye undertaken to do so, they have proved unfaithful to the trust; reposed in them by the people. Although, most honourable members opposite may con-, side* that they were justified, in t-he best istferests o£ Australia, in sinking their pinojiples, I repeat that, having determined to do so, they should have gone to, the p,ubl.ic, thei* masters,, and have sought theirindorsement. To refrain from doing so at the present juncture, lest public opinion should be against them, is worse than 'cowardly. They fear the fickleness of public opinion, ye.t do not hestitate to. endeavour to take advantage of it, believing that public opinion in regard to their action wilil have changed, and that they will come off better at the polls later on. Some of those participating in the fusion have declared that it was brought about because our party declined to. refrain from opposing the Deakin. party at. the: next general eleoliion. It has beensaid again, and again bymenabjeijS; of; our party-and it cannot be repeated too, often-that we have no, power to, cpntrol outside organizaty&ns iii the- .selection of candidates for Parliament;. We hayeno more power over fjheip in that respect than they have oyer us. Our agreement with themis inblack, and white, and. is drawn upbefore w.e enter this House. Before a Labour candidate goes before thepu.blic he has endorsed his; party's! policy, and, knows exactly where he. is... There is, nq> occasion, to call in any on,e to advise us. Our party is, not conductedon. such loose lines... The people ar,e in a much, better position when they are represerafed by a party the members of which ate. bound, to. a definite, platform, which is, suljrnj.ttied.'in black a-jd white to. thp electors, than, they are when, they, are repre-. sented by men who are not so pledged. Mr Carr. Having pledged ourselves to a definite platform, we are free from our so-called masters.. When that platform is altered we participate in the work of amende ing it, and if we do not endorse the. alteration we have no right to submit ourselves as candidates supporting the policy of the Labour partyI t will thus be. clearly seen that we are not controlled by outside influences, and that there is not the slightest necessity for such control. l l is purely optional for honourable, members of the Labour party to consider or to re-fuse to consider, any outside Influence that may be brought to bear upon them. I .do not know of any outside influence being exercised upon us, and' I should decline to be so influenced. It would be a distinct interference with theliberty of the subject ifany combinationin Parliament, dictated to. any combination outside as to the candidates to. be run at an election. Any half-dozen citizens may run a candidate. If they make a foolish, choice, the general public will put them right. If the honourable member for Ballarat has not,, in the. view of the public,, merited blame, he will be. kept in public life, even though a section may run a candidate against him. It is. a very weak argument in support of the fusion to say that the Labour party intends to oppose the. Liberal party at the elections. If the Liberals are the strong, men they are supposed to be, they, need, not fear opposition. In any case,, they should take the, stand that they advocate a ce.rt.ain policy,, an.d will.,, if kept. in. Parliament, carry it out,, taking their chances, of opposition at the elections.. Hf the. public dp not. want, my policy,, I dft1 not \vant tp represent them in Parliament. That is. my attitude. No fusion would have any attraction for ijie under a threatof opposition. As to the organization of' the Labour-party, I claim that it is "" broad based' upon the people's will.""' It is more broadly based than that of any other party in politics. The rank and file of' the community, those whom the conditions of society affect more vitally than any other cl'as, the men without inheritance, have drafted ourpolicy in their owninterests, an.d therefore in the interests of the nation. The programme of the Labour party is the programme of those who are the backboneof the nation-. Others mayjoin with us, butit is the people atlargewhom we represent-. Our organization properly claimstheattentionand meritsthesupport bestowed' on it Theautomatic functioningof Democracy is its great feature; It corrects its own errors, and provides the wily effective way of securing society against class domination Of any sort. No matter what section may draft a policy, that policy cannot stand without the endorsement of the whole community. For honourable members opposite to talk about sectional influence and class domination is ridiculous. We - cannot dominate without the sanction of the public. Parliament drafts policies, but the public must endorse them. The members of the Labour party are the servants of the public, and subject to the will of the people to the same extent as other members. I have a word or two to say upon the programme which the Government has placed before the Hotfse. New Protection is not to receive the liberal treatment at the hands of Ministers which it would have received from the Fisher Government. For one thing, it is not proposed to consider the consumer. There is no mention of him. All that is proposed is to take cognizance of the working community. But as the workers are consumers too,- it is essential, in any scheme of new Protection, to protect the consumer as well as to protect the worker, and the employer. No definite measures are promised. In fact, the Government seems' disposed to transfer its obligations arid trust to a Board ' which will be beyond the control of Parliament. I arr.' prepared to admit that it - would be advisable to place those controlling a nationalized industry outside the pale - of immediate politics. But when, not the running of a special industry but the supervising Of all industries, in other words the seeing that all play fair, is the matter in hand, the Government cannot afford to transfer its obligations. The Parliariieiit directly representing the people should be the supreme factor in seeing that the affairs of the commercial and industrial world are conducted as they should be. We cannot afford to entrust the interests of the community to a Board vested with supreme powers. I am a keen believer in the new Protection. Were I otherwise, I should be unworthy of my position. I agree with an - old writer who calls that nation the wealthiest which nourishes the greatest number of human beings. No doubt honourable fhembers Opposite aref as desirous as T. am of the welfare Of the cornroUnity, 'but we differ as to the way in which it can best be attained. The fact that some of - out politicians have a long past has given risett>marly of the speeches' which we Have heard during the debate. It has made me pleased that my political past is short, but I hope that when it comes to be as long as theirs,' it Will not afford food for such! discussion and recrimination. Political parties in this House differ largely as to methods. TheLabour party is of opinion that in the interests of the individual, and bo that the greatest number of human beings may be benefited and properly nourished, monopolies should be nationalized. The right honourable member fOr East Sydney, cm the other handy thinks that we should devote all our energy to encouraging and stimulating individualism. We agree that until the individualism becomes oppressive, it is well to let it alone. But orice it does' become oppressive',- we hold that we must nationalize. Do I understand that tfie Government are now agreeable to an adjournment of'the debate?",69
529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes ; I said at the outset that the honourable member could have an adjournment at n o'clock. Mri CARR- - I ask leave to continue my speech to-morrOw. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Mouse adjoiir'ne'd at 10.56 p.m.,71
