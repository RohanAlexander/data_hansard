1,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Does the Minister for Home Affairs know if it is true, as stated in the press, that the Railway officials deny the allegations made by honourable members regarding travelling accommodation, and declare them to be unjust? Will the Minister place the following statement before the Victorian Railways Commissioners, in order to ascertain if it can be disproved-That an attencomplaint, dant booked Mrs Hutchison and myself on Tuesday, 14th November, for Friday, of Members. 17 th. That he was informed ail the cars were full, but he would see if accommodation could be found. That the attendant later on made inquiries. That on the 17th, after 4 p.m.,, the attendant was again informed there was no sleeping accommodation. That when I applied at the booking-office about 4.30,1 received the same reply myself. That oh application for a compartment, I was told it could not be provided. That on stating I did not blame the bookingofficer, but that I would have to see his superior officer, and that I did not intend to travel myself, having been detained by. my parliamentary duties, he immediately booked Mrs Hutchison in the sleeping-car. Why could this not have been done at the time a berth was refused, a minute before ? As Senator Guthrie was booked for Adelaide, and had his berth cancelled on Friday, why! could I not have had that gentleman's berth? Will the Minister consult my South Australian Labour colleagues, on whose behalf I have had to complain, regarding the truth of my other complaints ?",12
2,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I shall certainly put the honourable member's statement before - the officials concerned. Of course, I am not at present in a position to form any opinion on the subject-.",12
3,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Honourable members ought to have seen the Minister on the subject, instead of referring to it in this House. It is purely a departmental matter.",12
4,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Personally , I should prefer in all these cases to be furnished with a written complaint, about which I could cause inquiries to be made. In regard to the complaints made by the honourable member's colleagues, I shall be glad if he will give me, in writing, a succinct account of the treatment complained of, so that I may cause the matter to be inquired into.",12
5,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I have found - the Railway authorities exceptionally obliging.,12
6,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"So far as the Department of Home Affairs is concerned, the Railways Commissioners of all the States, and their officers, have always extended us every courtesy.",12
7,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The members of the Tobacco Select Committee are complaining of the treatment they Rave received. Mr..GROOM - If there is a ground of 1 should like to hear both sides on that particular .matter. These complaints may involve the reputation of certain officers, and should, in fairness to them, be properly investigated. I will take steps to request that they may be inquired into.",12
8,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I have always found the Railway authorities very obliging.,13
9,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I do not complain without cause. We have been long suffering. DEATHRATEINNEW GUINEA.,13
10,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I understand that the Government have further information in regard to the death rate in the northern division of New Guinea, which, according to the last account, was abnormal. Is the Prime Minister prepared to inform the House on the subject?",13
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When the administration of British New Guinea was last under discussion, I ventured the opinion that the death rate in the northern division-between 22 and 23 per cent - wa s abnormal, and due to special causes. The returns for the. following twelve months, which have since come to hand, substantiate that opinion, the death rate, according to the most recent information, not exceeding 6 per cent. Evidently the first information was erroneous, or the excessive death rate, of which we were informed, was due to an epidemic, because, so far as we know, there has been no appreciable change in the surrounding conditions.",13
12,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Is the honourable and learned gentleman referring to the death rate among native carriers?,13
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Amon g native workmen of Whether generally. The men who serve as carriers amongst often take work in the mines on there. TELEGRAPH MESSENGERS: WESTERN AUSTRALIA.,13
14,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that numerous complaints have been received of the great delay in delivering telegrams at Perth and other towns in Western Australia ? 2. Has he been informed that this delay is due to the Department being compelled, owing to the smallness of the wages paid to telegraph messengers, to employ boys under age and also others more or less unfit for their duties? 3. Does he expect that in Western Australia, where the cost of living and the rate of wages generally, exceed the figures ruiing in the Eastern States, efficient messengers can be obtained for wages considered adequate in the latter? 4. In view of the loss and inconvenience sustained by the public through delays in the delivery of telegrams, will he take steps to increase the efficiency of this branch of the service by reverting to the old rate of salary paid to messengers in Western Australia?",13
15,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Numerous complaints were received some time ago, but they are not now numerous. 2. It is not considered that the delay is due to the smallness of the wages paid, and no boys are employed under the age of fourteen years, or who are known to be unfit for their duties. 3. No, but the wages of telegraph messengers in places that are distant from the capital of the State are supplemented by district allowances, and temporary messengers in such places are paid higher rates, amounting in some cases to £ i per week. 4. Salaries can only be increased upon the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner, who is quite aware of the conditions with respect to the rates of wages and cost of living in Western Australia. DISTRICT ALLOWANCES .",13
16,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon noticeWhen - vvill the amounts withheld from officers in the Postal and Telegraphic service, as District Allowances, be paid to them?",13
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The district allowances that were withheld pending the approval of the Classification Scheme are now being paid. NA GEOGRAPHY . Sir LANGDON BONYTHON asked the Prime Minister, upon noticehe has received any^ offers of copies works on Australian Geograpny for distribution the schools of Great Britain; and, if so, arrival the nature of such offers?",13
18,Mr DEAKIN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:When submitting a sample copy of An Australian Geography, the publisher, Mr C. W . Wittber, of Adelaide, offered-in the event of the Commonwealth Government selecting it for distribution in Great Britain-to supply 25,000 copies at 5d. each-^52 0 16s. 8d. As already stated in this House, in reply to a question by the honourable member on 14th September, such a purchase will be considered in connection with the distribution of other publications as part of a general scheme. HOBAR T POST OFFICE . Mr KING O'MALLEY asked the PostmasterTGeneral, upon notice I. Is he aware that a number of employees in the Hobart post-office suffer serious inconvenience through the absence of sun blinds under the skylights ? 2. If so, will he take immediate steps to remedy the evil complained of ?",13
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The Postmaster-General is not aware that such is the case. 2. Immediate inquiry will be made with a view to remove any inconvenience. NEW STANDING ORDER: LIMITATION OF DEBATE . Debate resumed from 22nd November (vide page 5627), on motion by Mr . DEAKINThat, notwithstanding any provisions in the Standing Orders to the contrary, there be forthwith adopted the following Standing Order, namely :(a) After any question has been proposed, either in the House or in any Committee of the Whole, a motion may be made by any Member, rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other member is addressing the Chair or not, "" That the question be now put,"" and the motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. [i) When the motion, "" That the question be now put"" has been carried, and the question consequent thereon has been decided, any further motion may be at once made which may be requisite to bring to a decision any question already proposed from the Chair; and also if a clause be then under consideration, a motion may be made, "" That the question, ' That certain words of the clause denned in the motion stand part of the clause,' or ' That the clause stand part of or be added to the Bill ' be now put."" Such motions shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. («) An affirmative vote of not less than twenty four members shall be necessary to carry any motion under this Standing Order.",14
20,Mr WILKS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," I shall not detain the House much more than a quarter of an hour, because I have no wish to deal with this question at length, or to go over again ground which has been traversed by other honourable members. But I cannot allow the occasion to pass without expressing one or two views on the subject. In my opinion, if we adopted the closure, we should make the admission that the House is unworkable, .and I am not prepared to admit that this body is an unworkable institution, or composed of men who neglect their public duties. No doubt every Ministry is apt to consider that the Opposition is taking up too much time, but to try to make the public believe that business cannot be conducted in this House is to utter a libel on Parliament. I am in favour of limiting speeches, and I think that the amendment suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney would be an admirable one to adopt to effect that purpose, while it is more democratic than the suggestion of the Government. The honourable member, except under certain circumstances, would not allow members to speak longer than an hour. I think that if such a rule were adopted, it would result in betterthought-out speeches. Honourable members, knowing that only a certain time would be available to them, would prepare their subjects more carefully, and would present their views with more method., so that our discussions would do great credit to us, and cause the House to be respected by the press and by the country. I do not wish the public to think that this House has descended so low that business cannot be conducted here without the drastic rule which the Ministry wish to apply. In my opinion, the proposed new standing order has been brought forward in a spirit of petulancy, but I hope that the feeling provoked last week will not continue, and that a special session will be devoted to the whole subject of standing .orders. There is really no need'for the closure here, because the number of subjects on which the Commonwealth Parliament is permitted by the Constitution to legislate is not very large. In the States Parliaments, where the members number more than the members of this House, and there are more subjects to legislate on, there may be some reason for the adoption of machinery to prevent delay, but, as I have said, we have not that reason in our case. Besides, all our measures are subiect to the review of the High Court. I hope that it will be the aim of honourable members to make our 1 legislation as perfect as possible. A p parently, the object of some of the States Parliaments is to rush through as much legislation as can be passed, in order to make a record for the session, though the result generally is that a great part of following sessions has to be devoted to the consideration of amending Bills. The value of ' the work of a. Parliament cannot be ascertained by applying a foot-rule to the measurement of its legislation. In this matter, the Federal Parliament should set an example to the Parliaments of the States, and while dealing with measures slowly, should take pains to deal with them thoroughly, because our usefulness is gauged by the effectiveness of our legislaopinion, tion, and not by its quantity. Some honport orable members seem to think that the ends at a later stage. duty of Parliament is to rush through so Party, many measures each session-to merely nominate them; but our real work lies in criticising and making suggestions in regard to tiTe proposals put before The very fact that our membership is small should constitute an argument against adoption of drastic closure rules. comparison can be instituted between a lation, House containing only seventy-five memall bers and the British House of Commons, containing 670 members. Neither our conditions on all-fours with obtain in the 'States Parliaments. working strength is about fifty members, but assuming that we could secure the tendance of the whole seventy-five sentatives in this Chamber, the Opposition could not number more than thirty-seven, and it is not likely that the whole of the members forming that section of the House would engage m obstructive tactics. seems to me that the Government are proposing to use a Nasmytb hammer to crack a hazel nut. It would be far preferable adopt the suggestion of the honourable ber for North Sydney. The honourable member for Franklin elicited from the honourable memoer for Wide Bay last evening the important admission that the "" gag"" was being brought into operation for the special purpose of doing justice to the working man. That was an admission that the Government proposal was introduced with a specific obiect. Do I understand that the Labour Party are supporting the closure in order that they may pass a cersilenced tain measure through this House?",14
21,Mr FRAZER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,No .,15
22,Mr WILKS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member for Wide Bay stated that the object secure justice to the working man. I think that our energies should be directed to curing justice, not only for the working man, but for all sections of the community, I represent as large a number of working men as any honourable member, and I long to the working class. I understand that the working men desire that all their ends shall be achieved by constitutional means. They do not wish that the closure shall be applied in order that the measures of which they approve may be rushed through Parliament without proper conirimy sideration. If they are not successful into be one Parliament they appeal to public and endeavour to secure such supas will enable them to achieve their If the Labour in supporting this proposal, aim at the erection of a strong party engine, they will before long regret their action. In the next Parliament, another us. Ministry may be in power, and the Labour Party may find themselves in opposition, the They may resist to the utmost of their No power the passing of certain proposed .legisbut if the closure be applied to them their efforts will be without avail. I cannot understand why members of the are Labour Party should lend their support to those which the Government proposal, Our ' Mr Frazer - If we are ever guilty of wasting time to the extent that the Opposiattion have done, we shall deserve to have reprethe closure applied to us. Mr . WILKS - It is not necessary to app l y the c l o s u r e e v e n to the s t r o n g e s t Oppos it i o n that c o u I d e x is t j n t h is Chamber. We k n o w t n at although one or two members It m a y occasionally obstruct business, dilatory m o t is cannot 'be availed of to any effect o n i m l e s s the members of the Opposition are to thoroughly united, and feel that they are memjustified in using every means that the Standing Orders permit. The Melbourne A „ e h as advocated a measure of this char a c t e r for m a n y m o n t h s past, but I am not i i i j . g to believe that the Prime Minister is w n a c t in g at the dictation of that newspaper, o r t n at his proposal was framed in the Age o m o s . TJnder the motion, as it stands, a n unpopular member, erven though lie m i h t be advocating in a perfectly legitig m at e manner the best of causes, would be by the application of tha "" g a g . "" ""We are told that the Government will not apply the closuie, and that the new standing order is intended to act merely as a was to warning to honourable members. That amounts to an admission that a provision for sethe closure is useful chiefly when it is not availed of. I have some recollection of the way in which' the closure was applied in the New South Wales Assembly. It bewas used only after long sittings, and usually in the early hours of the morning, I have seen Ministers of the Crown rushing about the passages screaming "" gag."" with a view to summoning their followers to the Chamber to silence some members nf the Opposition. Their cries now ring ears like the shrieks of tormented souls. It frequently happened that, be- cause the "" gag "" had been applied to one honourable member, it was thought necessary to apply it to others, in order to avoid invidious distinctions. No regard was paid to the consideration that an honourable member was furnishing the House with valuable information. If the Government proposal be adopted, the closure will be employed to enable Ministers to pass without delay practically any legislation they deem desirable. The same course will be followed by succeeding Ministries, and the ultimate result will be instability of policy. Fighting at the elections will be keener, and the party that comes back with a majority will use the closure without compunction in order to demonstrate to the people that they are carrying out thq po-licy of which the majority have approved. This will lead to constant changes of policy. One Ministry will, in the most expeditious manner possible, render nugatory the work performed by a previous Administration. Take, for instance, the Tariff question. At present we have in operation a semi-protective policy, with which certain protectionists are not fully satisfied, and of which free-traders do not approve. If at the next general election a majority of honourable members favourable to an increase of protection were returned, a new Tariff might be introduced and rushed through without any discussion. Public feeling might undergo a change before the succeeding election took place, and the position of parties, so far as the fiscal question is concerned, might be so altered as to lead to further amendments of the Tariff. This is not a desirable state of affairs to contemplate. I believe that those honourable members who are now advocating the closure will be the first to endeavour to abolish it. The members of the Labour Party, in supporting it, are certainly preparing a rod for their own backs. Those who represent the most radical thought in the country should be the very last to advocate the adoption of such a conservative machine as the closure. If we had 200 or 300 members in this House there might be some reason for adopting measures for limiting debate, but up to the present time no excuse has been afforded for such a proceeding. If the motion now before us be passed, it will be futile for honourable members of the Opposition to discuss the supplementary ""gag"" proposals which the Government intend to submit. They call the further proposed additions Mr Wilks. to the Standing Orders ""machinery clauses,"" but they are intended to impose j still more restrictions upon debate. If these be adopted the members of the Op-position will be, to all intents and purposes, chloroformed, and the Government will be able to perform any political operation they may please. It has been admitted that we are not a disorderly House. Notwithstanding the strain that was imposed during the: recent long sittings, it must be admitted that the proceedings were orderly, and, in view of all the circumstances, reflected credit upon honourable members. This fact in itself should be sufficient to show that there is no necessity for the adoption of such stringent rules as those proposed. There is no necessity for us to hurry' our legislation through. I think that the public would be better served if they were not disturbed by so many legislative innovations as are now being thrust upon them. If it could be shown that the Opposition were, day in and day out, obstructing the public business, there might be some reason for adopting the closure, but no one can pretend that honourable members travel hundreds of miles in order to block business. As I have said, it is evident that the Labour Party, favour the closure, \5e0ause fhey think that it will enable them to secure justice for the working man.",15
23,Mr WEBSTER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Member s of the Labour Party desire to do justice to all.,16
24,Mr WILKS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I am sure that that is the desire of honourable members generally. I am a representative of the workers, and am, indeed, a member of the working class ; but I am not prepared to join with the Labour Party in passing a motion which will enable the closure to be applied to prevent the proper consideration of the various measures submitted to us. I cannot understand why honourable members should be so anxious to lead the public to believe that a House consisting of only seventy-five members cannot carry on its business without the application of the "" gag."" I well remember the occasion on which the honourable member for Gwydir was held by the Chairman of Committees to have been guilty of tedious repetition. From a perusal of the Hansard report of his speech. I have come to the conclusion that he was badly treated; but at the time in question, a heated debate was taking place, and, as a supporter of the Government, I did not wait to consider whether the honourable member for Gwydir was in the right or not. The only consideration that weighed with me for the moment was that he was in opposition, and I, therefore, supported the proposal that he be no longer heard. The incident furnishes an illustration of the way in which the closure may be applied. The adoption of such a motion as that now before us will give rise to unpleasantness. I am confident that those who are closured will seek to get behind the standing order, and, in some way or other, to obtain revenge. I am satisfied, Mr Speaker, that if you were on the floor of the House, and were closured in a way which you considered unjust, you would succeed, despite the existence of such a standing order as that now proposed, in ""stone-walling,"" and so wasting the time of the House, if you desired to do so. I know, at all events, that that is the course which, in like circumstances, I should follow. Another point is that the proposed standing order may be unfairly applied. An honourable member who, because, perhaps, of a mere mannerism, is somewhat unpopular, may be closured almost as soon as he rises to speak; while another, who, although possessing less ability, is very popular in the House, may have not only liberty, but licence, extended to him. I would ask honourable members to carefully consider the amendment suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney. His proposal is a democratic one, and would place every honourable member on an equal footing. If the limitation of debate which he suggests be imposed, I think it will lead to honourable members preparing their speeches more carefully than many of them do at the present time. My experience as a member of this House forces me to the conclusion that the Government proposal is absolutely unwarranted, and that the application of the closure will cause friction. again, if, as the result of a generai election, one party in the House be returned with increased strength,, it may seek by means of the closure to graft on to the statute-book of the Commonwealth the particular proposals which are embodied in its programme. In this and other ways the proposed standing order, if adopted, must tend to weaken the stability of our parliamentary institutions. I utterly fail to understand why honourable members should be anxious to see measures forced through the House without being adequately discussed. No one can sav that the House [<9i] is a disorderly one; if it were, there might be some reason for the adoption of this motion. Every honourable member should bear in mind that in supporting the motion he will assist in forging a weapon that may be used against himself. Its adoption will be an indication, to the public that the House is neither intelligent nor publicspirited. I am sure that that is not the case. The members of the first Parliament, like those of the present one, were all public-spirited men; but it seems that the Government desire to pass this standing order in order that they may be able to control even an Opposition thirty-seven strong. I trust that the motion will be amended in several respects.. In conclusion,. I have only to say that if any one ought to be grateful for the consideration extended to him by honourable members, it is myself. During the last few days I have received the most kindlv treatment at the hands of honourable members, and this is only indicative of the feeling which prevails among honourable members generally. We are not an assembly of savages that we need to be dea'lt with in the way proposed by the Government.",16
25,Mr WEBSTER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,We are martyrs.,17
26,Mr WILKS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"f t cannot be supposed that honourable members travel 1,200 milesas many of the Opposition do-ever y week merely for the purpose of attending here to block the transaction of public business. We have neither the temper nor the inclination to do anything of the kind; and I regret that it should have been thought necessary to introduce such a proposal as that now before us. It will enable the "" gag "" to be applied, not merely to an individual speech, but to the various questions that may be submitted to us. If the dominant party at any time seek an excuse for applying the ""gag,"" they will put up Then., an obnoxious member, who will soon give rise to a feeling of irritation, with the result that the closure will be applied, and the measure under consideration rushed through. I earnestly hope that if the House is not prepared to accept the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for North Sydney, it will at least insist upon the Government proposals being amended in several other directions.",17
27,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," I think that the House is pleased that the honourable member for Dalley, after his temporary indisposition, is once mdre able to take part in our deliberations. Honorable MEMBERS. - Hear ,",17
28,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I also believe that the House generally is delighted to find a return, to common sense, and that the idle task of building up a ""stone-wall"" to block public business has. been abandoned. I view the proposal now before us with mixed feelings, because, during my political career, I have invariably opposed the application of the closure. In the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, ot which I had the honour to be a member for some seven or eight years, the closure obtains; and the present leader of the Opposition in this House did not hesitate to avail himself of it when he wished to force through the House measures which he had introduced. Although I was then giving a general support to the Government of which he was the leader, I could not concur in his action in that regard; but, as the result of my experience in this House, where, in the absence of such a standing order, a minority has been able to hold up the Government and the majority supporting them, I have come to the conclusion that some such proposals as those now be- fore us are absolutely necessary.",18
29,Mr CONROY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The standing order proposed by the Government will mean,, not the limitation, but the suppression of debateMr BROWN. - I regret that it should be necessary to take such a step, for I feel that in such a House as this the greatest liberty should be extended to honourable members. But when liberty is so abused as to become licence, and the business of the. country is held up for an undue length of time, something must be done to protect the rights of the House.",18
30,Mr CONROY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Is the honourable member aware that the Senate of the United Stateshas absolutely refused to pass laws dealing with the suppression of speech, and that 1 today it is the strongest legislative body in the world ?",18
31,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"That may be so, but probably it has not been faced with the conditions which now confront us, or with those that have induced the States Legislatures to resort to the closure.",18
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Does not such a statement partake of the cry of "" stinking fish""-no Parliament in the world is as bad as ours?",18
33,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"No . But the proceedings in this. Chamber during last week will give the ""stinking-fish"" party some hear. ground for making statements derogatory toi the national Parliament. I wish to deal briefly with, the position taken up by the honourable member for Dalley. He denies that any necessity exists for the introduction of proposals of this character. But I would remind him. that during the currency of the last Parliament he recognised the need for arming the majority with power to control its own business in a proper manner. Upon page 4335 of Hansard, vol. XVI.., he is reported to have said I consider, however, that we have a serious grievance against the Ministry, for no effort has yet been made by them to secure the adoption of permanent Standing Orders for our guidance.",18
34,Mr WILKS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,That is a speech which I made upon the Standing Orders.,18
35,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"A little later on the honourable member saidThe want of proper Standing Orders has given me many a sleepless night, and I wonder, therefore, at your placidity, Mr Speaker, under the ' circumstances. The honourable member then dealt .with the powers of the House under existingconditions. In this connection he observedA l l that we have for our guidance are temporary Standing Orders, and in view of the fact that you, Mr Speaker, have had, practically no greater power over us than has die chairman of a public meeting-havin g no permanent rules for your guidance-it redounds to the credit of the House that our proceedings have always been characterised by a due regard for the best traditions of political institutions. That was am accurate presentment of the case at the time. The pity is that it is not an .accurate presentment today. The honourable member also statedThe Chairman of Committees was powerless to stop the flow of their eloquence, and the patience which he has exhibited under the circumstances has been truly remarkable. Honourable members have harassed,, worried, and bullbaited the Chairman, and yet, with all these facts before them, the Government have,, taken no steps to protect him or the Speaker. It would be in the interests of the Government if they facilitated' the adoption of proper Standing Orders, because the public business would be transacted very much more expeditiously. The presentcondition of affairs is scandalous. Although no "" stonewalling """" has yet taken place, there ""is a positive danger that, with other members in opposition, the abuse of parliamentary forms might occur. . . . It is a standing disgrace that this important subject should be neglected; and if the Prime Minister is not careful he will find some honourable members taking advantage of the present orders in order to "" stonewall"" the proposals of the Government. I am surprised that the newspapers have not published articles commenting on the neglect of the Commonwealth House of Representatives, to frame proper Standing Orders - It may happen that in the future some designing Opposition will take advantage of the faultiness of the Standing Orders to prevent Ministers from carrying on the work of the country. The honourable member was a very good prophet. The position to which he referred has actually 'been reached. Opposition have practically decided to "" hold up "" the Government of the country. They have consistently blocked the transaction of public business during the present session. The first sign of a departure from the principles of fair criticism and a general Tecognition of the Tights of honourable members manifested itself when the Labour Government assumed office. The attitude then adopted by certain honourable members marked the beginning of a new era in our political history, and naturally it provoked reprisals when that Administration was defeated. A disposition was exhibited on the part of some of its supporters to repay the late Government in. their own coin. But, although I felt strongly that fair treatment had not been meted out to the followers of the honourable member for Bland, I did not feel called upon to copy their bad example. Consequently I took no part in the opposition that confronted the late Prime Minister. Indeed, whenever any of his followers were compelled to absent themselves from the House, I was not only prepared to pair with them, but to assist in maintaining a quorum. When, the ReidMCLean Government was displaced, similar objectionable tactics were adopted towards the present Administration. Although there is a substantial majority in this House in favour of the measures - which they have submitted, the session has been chiefly remarkable for its barrenness. What is the cause of that barrenness? Undoubtedly it is due to the action of the Opposition in deliberately attempting to block the progress of Government measures. In support of my statement. I need only quote an extract from an article in. the last issue of Life, a magazine published in this State which cannot be charged with being' hostile to the Opposition. It says The month proved another disappointment to all those who fondly imagined that the principal business of the Federal Parliament is to - work, not squander its time in futile verbiage. Prime Minister is evidently sensible of the fact that his assurance to Lord Northcote that the sent Parliament was capable of transacting the affairs of the country was, to say the least, somewhat premature. When the leader of the Opposition advised read the Governor General to dissolve this ' [>9i]-2 liament, after the defeat of the late Government, no doubt he assured His Excellency that the House, as at present constituted, was incapable of carrying on the business of the country. Evidently those who sit behind him are endeavouring to The prove that he accurately presented the situation. The other night the Prime Minister outlined the Bills with which he proposed to deal during the remainder of the session. I trust that he will adhere to his intention, and that he will decline to permit this Parliament to be prorogued until all those measures have been passed, even if the adoption of that course necessitates the House reassembling after Christmas. I have no desire to see useful measures pushed into the background., and to be called upon to face my constituents without being able to point to a record of useful legislative work. Such a position might be satisfactory to the' Opposition, who wish to prove that the Government are incapable, but I am satisfied that it is not one which will commend itself to the great majority of the electors.",18
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,What does the honourable member say about consulting the electors ?,19
37,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I am prepared to consult my constituents whenever the honourable member is willing to appeal to his. The hi.norable member feels very jaunty just .now because he happens to have the Employers' Federation behind him.,19
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Why does the honourable member utter a .slander of that kind ?,19
39,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The Employers' Federation is behind the honourable member in regard to the business awaiting our attention .in this House. I should like to direct his attention to a paragraph which appears in one of the leading newspapers of this city today. It relates to a condition of affairs which obtains in a partially inhabited island in the South Pacific, where responsible government has only been in operation during the past five years. This is how the Age - describes the proceedings in its representative ChamberThe central power of this (obstruction tactics) is the bunch of members who have come to be The known as the "" squealing dozen."" They are a body of ill-mannered and intensely aggressive pretype-loud , self-assertive, and boisterous to the verge of clownishness.",19
40,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I do not think that the honourable member should such a statement as that. ParThe honourable member would not be in - order in using such words himself, and, therefore, he cannot be permitted to quote them.",19
41,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Then I will leave honourable members to read the article for selves. The statement which I have read indicates the nature of the criticism which proceedings such as those of last week tend to provoke, and the impression which is conveyed to the electors. Before the resent ""stone-wall,"" I had occasion to take exception to what I considered undue levity in the conduct of business here.",20
42,Mr WILSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The honourable member lectured us well.,20
43,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I thought it my duty to myself, to the House, and to the electors, to express my dissatisfaction on the subject. I find that I am not alone in the view which I hold, the honourable and learned member for Parkes having expressed a similar opinion in a very instructive letter, which appeared in last night's Herald; though, instead of blaming the House altogether, he blames the press to some extent for giving prominence to cer'tain conduct. Thg proceedings - of laat week have accentuated what the conduct of business throughout this session has made evident, that, if the majority is to rule, - some provision must be adopted for putting an end to 'the tyranny of the minority. The Opposition have dictated to the Government what business they are to bring - forward, and how much is to be transacted on any particular occasion. When I was a member of trie Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, and the right honourable member for East Sydney was Premier of the State, he would say that a certain amount of business had to be done, and would keep the House sitting until-it was done, in some cases going to the extreme length of applying the closure in order to get his business through. this House, however, the Opposition have been taking it upon themselves to instruct the Government as to what business shall be done. We have heard a great deal about their offer to give the Attorney-General so many clauses of the Trade Marks Bill. cause he refused to accept that offer, and to deal with the measure as they thought it should be dealt with, they claimed to be justified in preventing the transaction of business for more than a week. Such conduct is an exemplification of the tyranny ©f a minoritv. But if the best traditions of parliamentary government are to be maintained, we must recognise the principle of majority rule, which, whatever its disadvantages, is preferable to the tyranny them- of the minority. To secure the recognition of the principle that the majority must rule, the Government have introduced this motion, providing^ for the adoption of the. closure. My experience in New South Wales disposes me to oppose the adoption of the closure, as applied to debate, unless it is supplemented by a provision for its application to individual speeches. When the motion now before the House was submitted last week, very few speeches were made upon it, although "" stone-walling"" tactics prolonged OUT discussions for several ,days. The probabilities are that, had the Government been able to applv the closure, they would have done so, and the motion would have been got through at the expense of honourable members who had not spoken, and wished to address themselves reasonably to the question at issue. If, on the other hand, the closure had been applied to individual speeches, only offending members would have been punished, and other members would not have been deprived of their rights. I should be very loth, except in extreme cases, to apply the closure to a debate, but I should have no hesitation about applying it to an individual who was evidently obstructing the progress of business.",20
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"If the closure had been applicable in the past, no one would have suffered more frequently than the honourable member.",20
45,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I am prepared to take my chance of that. There is, however, one consideration which has given me some concern. Last night reference was made to the fact that the closure was applied in New South Wales to force through the In Tariff proposals of the Reid Government after a discussion of eighteen hours. I fear that that incident may be taken as a precedent. It can easily be conceived that the manufacturing industries of Victoria may develop to such an extent that, ultimately, it will be possible to make Be- three-legged glue pots here, and then, no doubt, we shall be asked to place an import duty upon such articles. Mv fear is that the closure may be applied to the discussion of such a proposal. I deny, however, that to oppose thd adoption of the closure is to make an attack on freedom of speech. Every one must admit that the House .has a right to conduct its business as it thinks fit, and all that the Government have proposed is the adoption of certain rules which will give the majority power to do that. If the closure is applied harshly and tyrannically, those who are responsible for such application wiil no doubt suffer, because I think that the improper application of this rule will bring its own punishment. But although I should have been glad could the House have continued to transact its business without a restrictive rule of this character, the proceedings, not only of the past fortnight, but of the whole session, have forced me to the conclusion that an effective weapon of the kind proposed must be placed in the hands of those who are intrusted with the conduct of business, and, therefore, I shall support the motion.",20
46,Mr KNOX,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," I shall not detain the House for more than a few minutes, because I do not think that any very great advantage will be gained by prolonging the debate; but, as I represent the most populous electorate in Victoria, after that of the honourable member for Yarra, I feel that I should be failing in my duty to my electors if I did not enter my protest against the passing of the motion. The merits of this proposal have not been properly discussed, because it has been brought forward by the Government in order to provide means for forcing through the Trade Marks Bill, in which have Been inserted provisions which are detrimental to the best interests of the manufacturing community, and of the public at large.  who say that.",21
47,Mr KNOX,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member should not talk rubbish. Many of his interjections are calculated to destroy the reputation which he has gained for taking a sensible view of matters. I contend that the Government proposal has not received that calm consideration at the hands of the Government to which its importance entitles it. The manner in which it has been introduced is objectionable, and the merits of the proposal are questionable. Many of lis, believe that the honourable members on the Government side have done as much as have any others to obstruct business in this House, and no section of honourable members can say that they have not upon occasions prolonged debates unnecessarily. I am sure that members of the Labour Party, when sitting on this side of the Chamber, have occupied as much time as members of the present Opposition have done in expressing their disapproval of Government proposals. The honourable member for Canobolas has referred to the tyranny of the minority. There is no doubt that, so far as this House is concerned, the tyrannous minority sits in the Labour corner. It is perfectly clear that they are tyrannising over Ministers, who are being used merely as instruments to give effect to the decisions of the Labour caucus. Surely no body of men in this Parliament should be more jealous than the Labour Party of any attempt to interfere with the rights and privileges of the minority. They at one time represented very insignificant minorities in the Australian Legislatures, and yet they could not complain that they were unjustly treated on that account. The Opposition represent a minority merely because two smaller sections of the House have united their forces for the purpose of carrying through certain measures, of which the general body of electors do not approve. It is unfortunate that, owing to the circumstances under which the Government proposal was introduced, we are unable to give reasonable and proper consideration to its merits. We all agree that if our proceedings are not to be extended beyond due bounds, some steps will have to be taken to put a stop to the unnecessary repetition of arguments, and the deftvery of speeches of inordinate length. And most honourable members are prepared to consider proposals in that direction. The greatest resentment of honourable members on this side of the House is directed to the manner in which the Government have submitted the proposed new standing order. The present time is most inopportune, because any such measure should certainly not be adopted without the most serious consideration. In view of the small number of representatives in this House, and the large area that is affected by any legislation passed by this Legislature, it will be a most serious matter to interfere with the. full liberty of speech. Two or three votes, one way or the other, may decide questions of the greatest importance and the most far-reaching results; and in view of these circumstances we should afford the fullest opportunities for the ventilation of the views of representatives from all parts of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will realise the grave responsiTasmania bility that they are assuming in applying repressive measures to a minority which recently performed such excellent .service. They are, with the assistance of trie Labour Party, proposing to forge a weapon which may be used with the most disastrous efbe fects. I am glad to say that the moral standard of honourable members is exceedthe ingly high, and that no suggestions have ever been made against their integrity honour. But the proposed new standing order will place in the hands of Ministers and their supporters a power, which will subject their moral fibre to the severest I hope that we shall at least so amend the motion that it will be impossible for a vate member to move "" that the question be the business of the House. now put."" The Ministry should take the full responsibility for their actions. only should the power of ""moving "" that question be now put "" be confined to Minunion isters, but you. Mr Speaker, should be made the sole judge of whether or not any proposal before the House has been suffiof ciently discussed. \ think that we should provide that, even in Committee, the sure shall not be applied except with the are to be rendered innocuous. concurrence of Mr Speaker. I have the greatest respect for the Chairman of mittees, but I think that, just as we require Mr Speakbr to be called in whenever the attention of the Chairman is called to absence of a quorum, so we should present provide that he alone shall determine whemy ther the closure shall be applied.  declined to accept - the Chairman's word. They suggested that he could not count. Mr KNOX . ' - I have the fullest dence in the Chairman of Committees, think that it would be wise to amend the motion in the way I have indicated - The honourable member for Riverinalast night quoted the speeches of various honourable members in connection with the introduction of the closure resolutions in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. I venture to submit, however, that, so far as the plication of the "" gag "" is concerned, position of the two Parliaments is altogether dissimilaT. Members of the States Parliathe Ministry. ments do not suffer inconvenience in attending to their duties, but members of this House have to travel long distances from week to week, and various obstacles might be placed in the way of their attendance here. For example, the representatives Limitation of Debate. might be prevented, by the breakdown of a steamer's machinery, from athas tending here for a few days; and, similarly, various difficulties might be placed in the way of the attendance of other honourable members. In their absence, it would possible for a few honourable members to apply the closure and rush a Bill through House. I therefore think that it is absolutely necessary that the Government proor posals should at least be properly safeguarded. I rose solely to enter my emphatic protest against the motion, which to dangerous my mind is most inopportune. It is idle for any one to suggest that it has been of tests. introduced merely because of a sudden desire on the part of the Government to pass prinew Standing Orders, applying generally to The public recognise that this motion has been subNot mitted for the specific purpose of enabling the them to bludgeon through the House the label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill . We have been asked again and again why we should so stoutly resist the passing those provisions, since the union label clauses inserted in the Bill on the motion cloof a private member in. another place, Such a suggestion is an insult-to the intelligence of Comhonorable members. Every one knows that the union label provisions of the Bill are to be used for a certain purpose, but that the is a matter which I am not at liberty at to discuss. The feeling of most of constituents is one of gratitude to the Opposition for having taken a course which has enabled the people to realise the true who purport of the Government proposals. They recognise that the Opposition have been fighting, not so much because of a motion confithat may, after all, be so amended as to but meet with the approval of honourable members, but because it is the evident desire of the Government to coerce the minority, who wish the country to be fully apprised of what is going on. It is for these reasons, and because we believe that the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill will prove disastrous to the very people who are apnow doing their utmost to rush them through the the House, that we have taken up a resolute stand in opposition to the proposals of",21
48,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," The concluding remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong would lead one to believe that the rights of the minority in this House have of been absolutely ignored. In view of recent experiences, I had almost come to the conclusion that ioe majority had forfeited whatever rights they originally possessed. Many objections have been urged against the' Government proposals, and it has been freely stated that there is no justification for them. But those who make such an assertion must be speaking with their tongues in their cheeks. The history of this Parliament affords ample evidence of the necessity for some such standing order as that now proposed.",22
49,Mr CONROY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Did not the honourable member once boast that no argument that might be adduced would cause him to change his mind ?,23
50,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I am not aware of having made such a statement, but there are some unfortunate individuals who have not a mind to change. Their prejudices have become so petrified that they find it impossible to alter their views with respect to any question. We have only to review our proceedings in order to find ample proof that some such proposals as those now made are absolutely necessary. The Government in office, when this Parliament assembled, found it impossible to carry on business, and their successors were in the same position.",23
51,Mr CONROY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,They passed so many measures that we have since had to amend many of them.,23
52,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Order ! The honourable and learned member for Werriwa will have another Opportunity to speak.,23
53,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"What was the position of the late Government? Did they not tell the country that it was absolutely impossible for them to proceed with business in this House? Did they not inform the people that the forms of the House were such that it was impossible for them to secure finality in relation to the consideration of contentious measures, and that they, therefore, proposed to pass new Standing Orders ? I venture to say that the Opposition are not entirely to blame for the present situation. Instead of allowing our parliamentary institutions to be discredited by proceedings which culminated in the unedify.ing spectacle which we witnessed last week, the Government should have submitted such proposals as those now before us immediately on taking office. A curious change has come) over the situation. As soon as the gun was placed in position, there was a complete transformation on the part of the Opposition, and, this week, twenty speeches, which have not averaged forty minutes each, have been delivered in the House. Wlhat is the reason for this sudden f all in the average?",23
54,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Because we entered into a compact with the Government to dispose of the matter to-night.,23
55,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Why did the Opposition enter into that compact? They knew that brute force would prevail when reason would not. Can honourable members of the Opposition say that they have taken up a dignified position? It is absurd for them to talk about the desire of the Government being, to suppress debate, when we know that in the House of Commons, to which we look for light and guidance, more drastic Standing Orders prevail. And yet the business of the nation is dealt with satisfactorily in that House.",23
56,Mr WILKS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The r e are nearly 700 members in that 'House.,23
57,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The proportion is about the same, and the volubility of members of the Australian Parliament is by no means less than is that of the members of the British Parliament. It is idle to say that the; motion means the suppression of speech.",23
58,Mr CONROY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Then for what is it intended ?,23
59,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"As a policeman arms himself with a baton for protection, so honourable members in this House also desire to arm themselves with a weapon of defence - No Government would seek to apply the closure unless they felt that the stress of the situation rendered it absolutely necessary to do so. Although I have condemned the failure of the Ministry to introduce thefee proposals earlier in the session, I am pre-' pared, even at this fate hour, to be subjected to them. I prefer to place my privileges and rights as a member of this House, under the control of the majority, rather than that of the minority. During the present session, the Government have been absolutely controlled by the minority. What business has been done up to the present time? Practically, only one Bill of importance has been passed.",23
60,Mr CONROY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The honourable member gauges the work done by the House by the number of Bills that we pass.,23
61,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,C e r t a in l y not. I judge of the work by its importance.,23
62,Mr KELLY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member does not believe in the application of the ""gag"" to enable the passing of the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill ?",23
63,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I think that the "" S g "" is y convenient when an hona v e r orable member becomes a nuisance. The temper of the Opposition today reminds me of an incident of the early days. When we sought, in the back-blocks, to subdue the ""brumbies."" we used to say that we were "" fizzer"" hunting, and it was not long before we reduced those which we caught, to such a state of submission that they would eat out of our hands. When the final touches have been put upon our Standing Orders,, we shall be able to capture the Opposition with a "" johnny cake."" Every time that I have looked at the Opposition benches during the present session I have been irresistibly reminded of a birdcage. I have heard the same old tune times out of number. But this remark does not apply merely to the present Opposition. I am free to admit that when I sat upon the other side of the House I was associated with honourable members who adopted precisely similar tactics. Whatever position I may occupy in this Chamber, I"" shall never lend myself to deliberatelv obstructing the business of the country. If the proposed Standing Orders recoil upon those responsible for their introduction, they will not receive any sympathy from me. In my opinion, the proposals of the Government are intended to achieve a good purpose, and I feel that they will be used only to facilitate the proper conduct of public business.",24
64,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I thought that the honourable member was referring to the union label.,24
65,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"As far as I can see, ' a good deal has been said concerning the purposes of the union label which has no application whatever.",24
66,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"It is a wonder that the honourable member is prepared to endorse the application of the "" gag "" to secure its adoption.",24
67,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I support the Government proposals, because I desire to see public business transacted. I grew tired of supporting the late Government because it was powerless to accomplish anything, and I should grow equally tired of supporting the present Administration if they did not push on with useful legislation.",24
68,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N, I am sure we are all delighted with the lecture we have received at the hands of the honourable member for Moira. He has admitted that when in Opposition he resorted to extreme tactics to prevent the transaction of public business.,24
69,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable membershould quote me fairly. ' Mr SYDNEY SMITH - I may tell the honourable member that his support of the Government is of no value whatever in the absence of the support of the honourable member for Bland. In a leading article this morning the Age points out that it is the duty of the Ministry to make the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill a non-party question. The honourable member for Moira must know that at one tim& the Age had power to say to the Government : "" This measure must be made a partyquestion."" Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honourable member must not discuss the Trade Marks Bill.",24
70,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I do not intend to do so. The honourable gentleman admits that at one time the Age,24
71,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member is deliberately transgressing the direction of the Chair. You, sir, told him that he was out of order in making a certain statement, and he immediately commenced to repeat it.",24
72,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I asked the honourable member not to discuss the Trade Marks Bill. His next remark was that he did not intend to do so. The honourable member will have to keep that promise, and I am sure that he will do so.",24
73,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Speaking generally, and with no reference whatever to the question of the union label, I say that at one time the Age could dictate to the Government. Mr WATSON.""-Is it not a fair thing that the honourable member should leave the Age alone whilst, he discusses the question of whether or not the proposed standing order should be adopted?",24
74,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I cannot see how any remarks of the Age can have any bearing upon this question, or that the Honourable member has any right to introduce that newspaper into a discussion of this kind.",24
75,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Then , I will not refer to the Age. I will say that at one time a Certain influence was sufficient to induce! the Government to take any course which was suggested. That power has now vanished. The Age has no influence with the Government today. All the power is exercised by members of the Labour corner.",24
76,Mr MCLEAN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The Tocsin is the power behind the throne now.,25
77,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Yes ; the position of affairs has completely altered.,25
78,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,What has that to do with the question under consideration?,25
79,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Las t night the Vice-President of the Executive Council made a long attack upon individual members of this House. But we did not hear the honourable member for Bland rising to points of order then. He is very sensitive to criticism.,25
80,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member has had a very wide latitude allowed him. Mr SYDNE Y SMITH - The honourable member for Bland does not care how he ""gags"" anybody. I think he is most tyrannical in his attitude towards others. I repeat that the Age cannot influence the Government today as it used to do. The Ministry dare not submit a proposal tomorrow and say, "" This question is a non-party one,"" without'the approval of the honourable member for Bland.",25
81,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I rise to a point of order. I desire to know whether the honourable member is in order in so frequently evading your ruling, sir, which is that he must confine his remarks to the question under consideration. During the whole period that he has been speaking, I submit .that he has not addressed himself to the question for one moment.",25
82,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I notice that honourable members upon either side of the House very strongly hold the opinion that all who speak upon the other side are speaking aside from the question. I think that the honourable member for Macquarie is perfectly entitled to show the genesis of the proposed standing order if he wishes to do so.,25
83,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Honourable members opposite do not like any statement to be made which reflects upon them, although they are in the habit of making assertions-persona l or otherwise-whic h reflect upon the Opposition. The honourable member for Moira can make any suggestion that he chooses to the Prime Minister, but no heed will be paid to it unless it meets with the approval of the honourable member for Bland.",25
84,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,We have heard that statement' made over and over again during the past fortnight.,25
85,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I remember one occasion, when the honourable member for Moira attempted to lecture the right honourable member for East Sydney; but the latter soon gave him his reply. I notice from today's newspapers that the Government Whip has been addressing a public meeting, at which he pointed out that the "" gag "" has been introduced for the purpose of preventing the Opposition from giving expression to their opinions.",25
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,He did not say that.,25
87,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I shall quote the newspaper report of the honourable member's remarks.,25
88,Mr FRAZER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Fro m what journal does the honourable member propose to quote?,25
89,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Fro m the Argus. Honourable members may laugh. Do they suggest that the report is inaccurate ?,25
90,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The honourable member must not read from newspapers or other documents referring to debates in the House during the same session.,25
91,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The honourable member to whom I allude pointed out that these proposals had been introduced because the Government intended to bring forward legislation dealing with the harvester question.  ber really believe that he made that statement?,25
92,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I have no doubt that he did. Of course, if the honourable member denies its accuracy, I am prepared to accept his assurance.  would make that statement.",25
93,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Order ! I notice that there is a general disposition that the honourable member for Macquarie should not speak at too great length. One of the bestways to shorten his remarks is for honourable members to refrain from interjecting. I ask honourable members to allow him to make his speech in his own way.,25
94,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,It would be a good thing if he discussed the question under consideration. Mr SYDNE Y SMITH - I did not intend to speak at any length upon this proposal. I should not have discussed it in detail but for the honourable member for Bland.,25
95,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Order ! The honourable member must confine himself to the question before the Chair. Even if disorderly interjections are made, there is not the slightest reason why he should reply to them.",25
96,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Las t night the Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that the late Sir Henry Parkes had brought forward certain closure proposals. That statement is perfectly true. But I would point out that those proposals are of a very different character from the proposals of the Government.,26
97,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,They are much more drastic.,26
98,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"They are not anything like so drastic as the proposals of the Government. Under the Standing Orders which were adopted at the instance of the late Sir Henry Parkes, the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees, as the case might be, was invested with discretionary power to determine when the closure should be brought into operation, and even then its application required the support of forty honourable members.",26
99,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,That is not correct. I 'read the debate only a couple of nights ago.,26
100,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"It was necessary for forty honourable members to vote in the affirmative, in order to secure the application of the closure.",26

102,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Fort y members are nearly twice the quorum of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, but the number the Government require for the application of the closure here is less than the quorum, and little more than the strength of the Labour Party.",26
103,Mr THOMAS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Why does the honourable member always, sneer at the Labour Party ?",26
104,Mr HUME COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,He will not do so when the elections come on - the,26
105,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I do not sneer at the Labour Party, although I draw a distinction between the members of the party in this House and the labourers outside. I have certainly never been anything like so offensive in my remarks about the party as the honourable member for Bourke has been, although he is now being supported by the caucus. Although I feel that there are occasions when honourable members, are called upon to take a strong and determined stand for their rights and those of their electors, I am prepared to give fair consideration to anv reasonable proposal to prevent abuse of the privileges of the House. Honourable members say that the "" gag "" has never beem abused; but, on one occasion, when I visited the New South Wales 'Legislative Assembly, in company with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa and the honourable gentleman who then represented Kalgoorlie, we saw three members ""gagged,"" although we remained only a few minutes. I have taken the trouble to go through the New South Wales Hansard record, to be able to tell honourable members exactly how the "" gag "" has been applied elsewhere.",26

107,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,B y the remnant of the honourable member's Government which was led by Sir John See.,26
108,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Why does not the honourable member refer to the instance in which the Tariff proposals of the Reid Government were closured through?,26
109,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I leave that instance to the honourable member. In 1902, at 1.20 a.m. on a certain sitting, the See Government refused a request for an, adjournment, and brought forward the following consolidating Bills:-The Public Health Bill, the Constitution Bill! the Parliamentary Electorates Bill, the Billiard and Bagatelle Licences Bill, the Standard Time Bill, the Usury Bill, the General Legal Procedure Bill, the Svdney Corporation, Bill, the Width of 'Streets Bill, the Public Parks Bill, the Cattle Slaughtering Bill, the Sydney Abattoirs Bill, and the Sydney Mint Bill. Certain honourable members pointed out that in some respects those Bills differed from the legislation which they had been introduced to consolidate; and, in the succeeding three hours and eighteen minutes, the ""gag"" was applied no fewer than twenty-two times, although whole report of proceedings does not occupy more than thirteen columns of Hansard.",26
110,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The Bills were accompanied with certificates stating that they merely consolidated the existing law.,26
111,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Yes.. But honourable members were not bound to accept those certificates. They had a right to show that the Bills differed from the existing law, and that contention has since been borne out by several of the judgments im the Law Courts. _ Mr SPENCE - It was held by the authorities that the House had no power to deal with them. Mr SYDNEY SMIT H - No outside authorities can bind the action of Parliament.",26
112,Mr FRAZER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Does the honourable member think that the House would have been wise in trying to amend those Bills?,27
113,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I believe that - some of them, were amended in some particulars, and I understand that the Courts have since held that some of their provisions differ from, those of the laws which they were introduced to consolidate. Those proceedings were an instance of the gross abuse of this power. It has been said that there has been a lot of obstruction here this session, but I do not think that there is any ground for that statement. Last Tuesday week, when the House met, the Opposition found that the Trade Marks Bill-which , on the previous Friday had occupied a position at the bottom of the notice-paper-ha d been moved to the top. As honourable members had assembled under the impression that they would be asked to consider the Electoral Bill, the honourable member for Parramatta moved the Chairman out of the chair to protest against the alteration. He, himself, spoke for only ten minutes; but tihe discussion of the motion lasted for some time. Ultimately, however, the friendly suggestion was made that fifty-seven clauses should be passed, and that then the House should adjourn. Many honourable members opposite thought that the proposal was a fair and reasonable one. ",27
114,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I believe also that that opinion was shared by the majority of Ministers. We evinced our desire to help the Government to carry on the business of the country, but they declined our offer, and then calmly charged us with obstruction, and introduced the closure proposal.",27
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"There was nothing to discuss in the fifty-seven clauses referred to. - Mr SYDNEY SMITH - There were - one or two matters of great importance to be considered, but we were quite prepared to dispose of them after indicating, as briefly as possible the amendments we considered necessary. There was no dictation on our part, but a friendly suggestion was made, originally at the instance of proposedsome honourable member on the Government side of the House. There was no juswith tification whatever for the attitude assumed lowinga view by the Government towards the Opposition, nor was there any warrant for the introduction of the motion now before us. The honourable member for Moira has criticised our action in debating the proposed new standing order last week. We had no desire to remain here until midnight on Saturday; but we considered that the Government had acted unfairly towards us, and entered the strongest protest of which we were capable. We were quite prepared to consider the Government proposal in a reasonable way, but we resented the action of Ministers in trying to impose the closure upon us without affording fair opportunities for debate. After we had had a rest, an arrangement was entered into with the Government to close the debate to-night, and although that compact has been broken by the Prime Minister in giving notice of his intention to introduce still more drastic proposals, we intend to perform our part of the agreement. We do not object to measures that are intended to prevent abuses of the rights and privileges of honourable members, but we resent the action of the Government in introducing closure provisions, with the evident intention of forcing through the House a certain measure containing manv objectionable features. If the Government had been sincere in their belief that the Opposition were obstructing public business they should have introduced their closure proposals long ago. We should then have been able to fully discuss them on their merits. I regret that the motion now before us was not dealt with in Committee, where proposed amendments could have been more conveniently considered. That course was adopted on a former occasion, and I fail to see why it should not have been followed in the present case. Under the circumstances, we must do our best to safeguard the rights and privileges of honourable members, and to remove at least some of the objections which now attach to the proposed new standing, order. The manner in which the closure has been applied in New South Wales- a manner that was never contemplated when it was introduced - ha s convinced me that it would be very undesirable to adopt any similar rules in this House. Amendment (by Mr DUGALD THOMSON) That all the words after "" n a m e l y "" be left out to inserting in lieu thereof the folwords :- "" No member shall speak for more than one hour on any question before the House except in the debate on the Address-inReply or on the Budget, or in a debate on a motion of ' No Confidence,' or in moving the second reading of a Bill , or in moving a resolution. In a Committee of the House no Member shall speak for more than one hour in all , or four times in all, on any question before the Committee. This rule shall no; apply to a Member in charge of a Bill or resolution. Any Member may speak for a longer period or more frequently than .is allowed by the two preceding rules with the leave of an ordinary majority of the House or Committee, as the case may be. The question whether the Member be further heard shall be put forthwith without amendment or debate.""",27
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Parramatta) A new proposal has been submitted from this side of the Chamber for the express purpose of limiting debate rather than of stifling or suppressing it. altogether, and I venture to say that, if relief be needed in this Chamber, that is the direction in which it should be sought. If we adopted the closure, as proposed by the Government, and deliberately exposed to the application of the "" gag "" the representatives of the people, many of whom come here with a view to making specific proposals, we should place in the hands of a tyrannical Government the power to prevent the views of the constituencies from being expressed, and to thus deal a deadly blow at our representative institutions. I, therefore, think that if there be a desire to save time and to transact business at a greater rate of speed than has hitherto been the rulef, the direction proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney is the one in which limitation of debate ought to be sought. I am not quite sure whether we are not in danger nowadays of forgetting what is the real object for which Parliament assembles. come lately to regard Parliament as merely a machine for turning out laws to be judged by their number, rather than by the>r quality and importance. And so one becomes'impatient of debate of any kind, since it' interferes with the quantity of work that we turn out from time to time. I trust that we shall agree to some modification of the drastic proposals of the Government, that we shall accept proposals which, while limiting debate and allowing business to be done with reasonable despatch, will not result in the total suppression of free speech in this Chamber. Reference has been made this afternoon by the honourable member for Canobolas to the"""" holding up "" of this House. If anv honourable member has held up this, and the last, Parliament, it is he. He has drivelled from the back Opposition bench for three or four hours at a stretch, with less than half-a-dozen honourable members in the Chamber, and those anxious to reach their homes. If any honourable member has added to the tedium 1 of attendance here-ha s added to the obstruction of the business of the House, so far as prolonged debate is concerned-the honourable member for Canobolas has done so. I know of no one who has more freely indulged in that kind of debate, which he now declares lead's to the Parliament being "" held up."" No honourable member has wasted the time of the House to the same extent that he has done, when his speaking has been absolutely of no avail,",28
117,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The honourable member will find that the Hansard reports of my speeches are not nearly so long as are those of speeches made by himself.,28
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"If I turn to Hansard, I shall find that the honourable member has spoken for four hours at a stretch, whilst I have always been able to compress my remarks within an hour and a quarter, or an hour and a half at the most. The majority of my speeches have been delivered in less than an hour. The honourable member, taking no thought for the convenience of honourable members, nor of their desire, to get home, has always been regarded as the last speaker in a debate, and has added wearily to the weary waiting of the House. We now find a sudden change of front. The honourable member has either turned right about face, or some great overshadowing influence is upon him. He now feels that the House is being ""held up , "" because reasonable speeches We have are being made upon a most important proposal. I was never more surprised than by the speech which he made this afterneon.",28
119,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"According to the honourable member for Gwydir, the speeches delivered this session, by the honourable member cover ninety-one yards of Hansard.",28
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"D u r in g this short session I have had to do my own f a ir share of work, in addition to that which should have been done by the honourable member. He has had the "" gag "" put upon him in the caucus, and I have, therefore, been compelled to take his share of the burden of talking. If I were to measure the space covered by the Hansard report of the honourable member's speeches, I believe I should find that it totalled not ninety-one yards, but 199. The honourable member for Gwydir also gave us some statistics last night j but if the speeches which he delivered last session were measured, it would be found that they ran into very much more than ninety yards. The peculiar feature of this debate is that honourable members, who are now most anxious to apply the "" gag,"" have indulged in the dreariest drivel, and have spoken longer at a stretch than has any other honourable member. Take, for example, the honourable member for Coolgardie, The! Opposition well remember sitting last session, with aching hearts, on the Government side of the House, whilst the honourable member from the second Opposition bench reeled off by the yard a report by some Post-office officials concerning postal matters in Western Australia. He has now come to the conclusion that debate ought to be! limited. It seems that, as the result of their crossing the gangway, the opinions of these honourable members concerning liberty of speech, and the foundations of democracy as a whole, have! been completely revolutionized. I congratulate them upon the slender basis on which their democracy rests, since the mere transfer of their seat from one side of the House to the other makes such a vast difference in thair views on this subject. The honourable member for Canobolas made use of an expression that conveyed the inference that the Opposition were acting at the instigation of the Employers' Federation. I wish to inform him that I am acting neither at the instigation of that body, nor of that of the Labour caucus. am aware, there is no compulsion upon me' to do anything of which I do not approve individually. Instead of acting at the dictation of an association of any kind, I am taking that course which I believe best fits in with a sound and healthy view of democracy, and certainlv is in keeping with a desire to do that which is best in the interests of Australia as a whole.",28
121,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"If press telegrams are to be believed, the honourable member is being thanked by employees' organizations all over the Commonwealth.",29
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I am glad to receive support from anv Quarter, and should not. mind if the Opposition received the thanks of the labour leagues for the stand which they have taken with' reference to the "" gagging "" proposals of the Government. I think that we are entitled to their thanks. It will be found hereafter that we have beem seeking to preserve liberties which' the honourable member and his caucus confreres are flinging contemptuously away-libertie s which were won only after years of struggling and much tribulation. A peculiar feature of this debate is that we have had one honourable member after another declaring that he does not believe in the "" sand-bagging "" process proposed by the Government, and yet intimating that he is going (o vote for it. The honourable member for Coolgardie spoke against the "" gag "" as an institution,, but announced his intention to vote for' it j whilst the honourable member for Gwydir spoke in favour of this proposal,, and concluded by saying that he would vote against it. The rule of contrariness seems to have been operating throughout the debate. Honourable members in the Ministerial corner find themselves in a tight place. They are going to vote for the Government proposals, although they really hate them, and will probably avail themselves of a convenient opportunity to rescind them. They are going to vote today under compulsion. And why? Simply because the "" g a g "" is associated with the passing of a proposal to which they give their hearty support. That emphasizes another point. There are members of the Government who do not believe in the union label, but they 1 seek to maintain their place and power by putting up what they describe as a fair record of legislation. They are in favour of the "" gag,"" bufj not of the union So far as I label clauses of the! Trade Marks Bill . It is well known that half the members of the Government are strongly opposed to those provisions.",29
123,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I would remind the honourable member that the question under consideration is not whether some form of closure is desirable, but whether the form to be adopted shall be that proposed by the Government, or that which has been 5 submitted by way of amendment by the honourable member for North Sydney. I ask the honourable member to confine himself to a comparison of the two forms.",29
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I suppose, sir, that I shall be in order in showing how the "" gag "" might be applied in connection with any proposal submitted to the House?",29
125,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,That question has been disposed of.,29
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,May I not show that the formproposed by the Government is unnecessary ?,30
127,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member, more than a week agOj dealt with that matter, and the only question now before us is whether the proposal made by the honourable member for North Sydney should be substituted for that put forward by the Government. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Judgin g by their attitude, and the expressions to which they have given public utterance, I believe that the form proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney would be more in accord with the views of Ministers. We know well that they do not all believe in the motion submitted by the Prime Minister. We are face to face with a singular combination, constituting the majority in this House, which makes it possible for the form of closure submitted by the Government to be passed. Ministers themselves do not believe in the union label provisions of the TradeMarks Bill, but tfhev do believe in a form of closure, whilst honourable members in the Ministerial corner do not believe in the "" gag,"" but are strongly in favour of the union label provisions of the Bill to which I have referred.",30
128,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The question of whether the "" gag"" will be applicable to the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill must apply equally to the consideration of the two forms of closure, and, therefore, the honourable member, instead of discussing the relative value of the two proposals now before the Chair, is simply discussing the desirableness of applying the "" g a g "" in any form. That is a matter with which he has already dealt, and I ask him not to make any further reference to it.",30
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"On e reason why I am advocating the adoption of the milder form of "" gag "" proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney-if any form of "" gg"" ^ at o °e adopted-is that it enable the House to discuss those measures on the business-paper to which it is to be applied.",30
130,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,That is a matter common to both proposals. It is not involved in a comparison of the two.,30
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,May not an honourable member give his reasons for favoring or opposing these proposals? Surelv no more cogent reason for opposing the Government proposition can lie given thanthe effect which it would have upon the business to which it is to be applied ?,30
132,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"If anything were needed to show the force of the point I have raised, the nature of the honourable member's speech would supply it. He is using precisely the same arguments that were used by a number of honourable members when discussing the main question. If those arguments were applicable to the first question they certainly cannot be applicable to that now before us. It is not for me to suggest the lines of debate which are open to the honourable member. There are a number which are quite applicable to the question before the Chair, as indicating the difference between the form of closure proposed by the Government and that put forward by the honourable member for North Sydney.",30
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I favour the form of closure proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney, inasmuch as it is far milder than is that submitted by the Government. The honourable member for North Sydney simply desires to so regulate debate that the representatives of the people will be able to speak upon any subjectas a matter of right, without seeking 'the condescension of the Government, or of the caucus which supports them. I venture to say that, if effect be given to the Ministerial proposals, it will be possible not only. to suppress debate, but to suppress the most useful portion of the debate which takes place in this House. It very frequently happens that honourable members who indulge in long speeches do not contribute so materially to the elucidation of the subject in hand as do those who subsequently address themselves to it. The ""gag"" is not applied after calm deliberation, and as the result of the exercise of reason. It is usually applied in a time of clamour-in a period of temper and obstinacy. Throughout"" a long parliamentary will experience I have never seen it applied deliberately, and as the result of the promptings of reason. On the contrary, it has always been put into operation after great asperity of feeling had been engendered. Let us suppose that honourable members were discussing the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill, or the Commerce Bill-tw o measures which the country has never demanded. If ever there were two proposals which required thorough and exhaustive discussion it is those two. Let us suppose that we were discussdiscern ing either of those measures, and out reasons why its consideration ought to be deferred until an appeal had been made to the constituencies. If under isuch question. circumstances the honourable member for Bland happened to be in a similar mood to that in which he was this afterhope noon when the honourable member for Macliberty quarie rose to address himseif to this tion, what chance should we have of debatbe ing those measures in any reasonable spirit I do not hesitate to say that the honourable member would have applied the "" g a g instantly, had he been able is not just that men who prepare speeches which will educate the people, and madue terially contribute to the betterment proposals under review, should be clodeputy sured out of their right to speak, or "" they should be permitted to speak only . the whim of a Government which may haptunity pen to have a majority behind them. urge that the milder form of closure posed by the honourable member for Sydney should be adopted, because it will guarantee a fair and adequate discussion of all measures which may come before this Chamber. I am perfectly content to subscribe to the limitations which it would pose. I can generally say all that sire in an hour, even upon a big and I am quite sure that in Committee three speeches extending over twenty minutes would exhaust all my matter ordinary circumstances. Whatever disabilities Inhere in that amendment, quite willing to submit to them, because I am not one of those who drivel on hour after hour simply for the purpose suming time. The very men who intend to vote for the Government proposal the greatest sinners in that respect. is the outstanding feature of this debate. Those who have compelled us to listen four or five hours at a stretch to the drivel now wish to stifle reasonable debate, and to entirely prevent the possibility fair discussion whenever any class posal of theirs may be under review. hope that the House, even at this _ period, will return to reason. There is reason whatever behind the Government posals. On the contrary, there is more crass obstinacy than I have seen exhibited in this Chamber by any other Ministry, and we all know whence the pressure applied. We all recognise why these posals are being pressed forward. their genesis. Upon the very night pointing that they were originated",30

We can The amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney amounts to an automatic limitation of all discussion. Its would mean that a speaker, having occupied a certain amount of time, would matically "" shut down,"" and could only continue his address by permission of House. It seems to me that that proposal constitutes a more serious interference with the individual rights of honourable members perience. than do the pro]30sals of the Government. Under the latter, it is only when a majority of the House is satisfied that the under consideration, has been sufficiently debated, or that the discussion has degeneness rated into a "" stone-wall,"" or that an vidual member has exhausted his legitimate rights, that the closure can be applied. seems to me that, if there be any ranted interference with the liberties dividual members of this House, it is found in the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney. For that son I shall vote against it. Mr MoCAY (Corinella) - It is not more than an hour since the honin orable member for Canobolas spoke upon the main question; but in that interval he has succeeded in crossing the floor of the House, because he spoke from the Opposition benches. I sup-' pose that he was induced to take such a decisive step by what he regarded as a sonal attack on the part of the deputy leader of the Opposition. In .that case, my conmit gratulations to the honourable member Parramatta upon his powers of speech mingled with regret that he has lost lower. The honourable member for Canohour, bolas, in the course of a very brief address, made one or two rather astonishing statealthough ments. He characterized the amendment the honourable member for North Sydneywhich is now' under consideration as alternative to the proposal of the Governmember ment-as an automatic closure. that he must have forgotten for a moment the real meaning of that word. The word ""closure,"" as applied to individual memwould bers, means putting an end to the speech, not of a favoured individual, but of some honourable member who happens to receive scantier consideration than is extended others. Upon the other hand, the application of the closure to debate applies equally those who have not spoken and to those who have. The amendment presupposes that operation under ordinary circumstances any honorthat able member can say all that is necessary in an hour; but it provides for exceptions. During a debate on an Address-in-Reply, a adoption member is not limited to an hour, and sometimes honourable members like to speak be autoat great length on those occasions.",31

I could understand the honourable member for then Gwydir or the honourable member for Darling saying: "" I could speak for five hours, or for fifteen hours, on this subject without pereffort, but I am being limited to one hour."" At first blush, one might be inclined to adthat one of those philosophic discussions for with which the honourable member for are Darling used to favour us last session, a folcould not well be terminated within an because it is one of the advantages, or disadvantages, of such utterances that, they have a beginning, they can of end anywhere of nowhere without impairing their efficiency or destroying their aran tistic completeness. But the honourable would only have to ask for leave I think to continue his remarks to be permitted to speak as long as he wished. Under the procedure which I am advocating, there be no extraordinary maximum limitation, and if an honourable member were addressing himself to a question on which the House wished to hear him further, perto mission to prolong his remarks would willingly be granted. It seems to me that the to great advantages of this alternative proposal are that the rule is not brought into only when feeling is running high ; it will not prevent the full and fair discussion of any measure before the House and that it will not allow a majoritv relying on its numbers, and on nothing else, to force measures through the House. Objections raised to any proposed course of legisladuty tion will have as full an opportunity for for our decisions. expression as arguments in support of so far as the number of those opposing permit. I should not have trespassed upon the time of honourable members in this nexion, but that I wish to point out that this proposal represents in substance the clusions at which the last Government arrived as to what ought to be done to limit debate. They did not intend to provide for any such closure as the present A d ministration has brought forward, because they felt that any limitation of debate should be of such a nature that it would act automatically, and could not be used as a weapon by the majority in times of excitement.

The proposal of matthe Government, which some of the members of the Labour corner are supporting, to would have met with but scant considerait tion from them a few months ago, when the Trade Marks Bill was not so near its The honourable member for Canobolas, in saying that the amendment provides for a greater restriction of debate than does the motion, expressed only half the truth. It provides a greater restriction of debate by the majority, but not so great a restriction of debate by the minority. It .puts every one on the same footing. Whether a member belongs to the majority or the minority he supwill have the same rights. But honourable members will not be on an equal footing under the Government proposal. It is only the majority that can apply the closure, and the majority will not do it so long as its members wish to talk. They will use apthis power only to prevent the minority",33

150,Mr ROBINSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The Government Whip said last night that it will be used to to throttle the free-traders.,33
151,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I do not wish to throttle the free-traders, though I desire to conand vert them-perhap s a harder, but, at any rate, a more humane task. Under the proposal which I am supporting, I should have only an hour to try to do that; but, no doubt, the House would give me leave to continue remarks which had so excellent an object. Let us take a specific case, and contrast the probable working of the two proposals. If the Government proposal be agreed to, when the trade union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill come before us again there will be a counting of heads, and the side which discovers that it has a majority will determine to remain silent, in order that the clauses may be passed through as quickly as possible. It cannot be thought that the weapon will not be used, because, until the socialistic state has arrived, human nature may be expected to use any serviceable weapon that is put into its hands. It is therefore quite reasonable to suppose that the majority will endeavour to pass into law, irrespective of their merits, the trade union label provisions of the Prime Minister, which bear the imprimatur of the honourable member for Bland. The minority, believing those provisions to be detrimental to the community, and feeling that the country should be informed in regard to their probable effect, will proceed to debate them. With what result ? That after a number of honourable members in the minority had spoken, we should hear cries from the majority that no one on their side had spoken, that no one had had an opportunity of speaking, because all the time had been taken up by members of the minority-eve n though the members of the Opposition had remained seated after each speech, in order to give members of the majority an opportunity of standing up and catching the eye of the Speaker^ and that opportunity had not been availed of. That fact, however, would be forgotten. The minority would be charged with having occupied all the time, and members in the majority would say, "" We must stop all this talk. We do not want to speak ourselves, and we do not want others to do so."" We have had an instance of that today, although the closure has not been in operation here. The result would be that, with the proposed new standing order behind them, majorities would invariably rely upon their numbers, instead of upon their reasons, and the country would be deprived of an opportunity to hear just criticisms on the proposals that the majority were trying to force through.",33
152,Mr FISHER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I have seen the closure in operation in Queensland for some years, Mr MCCay. and it has had no such effect as that described.",34
153,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The events of last week make me very much afraid of what is going to be done during the next week or two.

The advantage attaching to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney, as compared with the Government proposal, is that honourable members who sit silent because they are in the majority, will not be able to prevent honourable members on the other side from exercising reasonable opportunities of expressing their views.",34
154,Mr MAHON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,No one has objected to affording reasonable facilities for speech.,34
155,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The amendment proposes to fix a reasonable limit to the speeches of honourable members, and that is the reason I support it It would debar the majority from preventing the expression of just criticisms by the minority. The Government proposal could be applied to prevent just criticism, and probablv would be brought into operation when the criticism had be j come of the keenest, and the majority were most anxious to prevent it from being pursued. I would not mind if I felt certain that the new standing order proposed by the Government would never be abused. That is to say, that it would never be used. Some honourable members have urged as a reason for supporting the Government proposal that the closure would not be applied. The new standing order proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney would be used, and would'Tie a Teal thing, because it would be the duty of the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees to see that it was applied. Surely a standing order which it would be the duty of the Speaker to apply should be preferred byhonorable members to a provision subject to abuses which it would Tie the duty of the Speaker to guard against? Our proposal, owing to its fairness, is placed in the hands of the Speaker; whilst the other, on account of its unfairness, is made subject to the Speaker's control.

Any honourable member who refuses to agree to an amendment find in this House. upon the main proposal which would have the effect of imposing upon the Speaker or Chairman the duty of preventing its time. obvious abuse is openly confessing that he wants the standing order to be abused. Whatever may be the views of honourable members on the main question, as comeight pared with the amendment proposed by ' whole of the time. the honourable member for North Sydney, I feel sure that the majority will at least leave the final check over the exercise the proposed standing order in of the Presiding Officer.",35
158,Mr KENNEDY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Is not the and learned member's argument based i-nou the presumption that the majority may any time abuse its power?,35
159,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Yes , and I say that people of Australia are now protected against the abuse of power by the exeraware,, cise of the right of the minority to point out abuses. It is because the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydin ney would permit the minority to exercise its right in that direction, without enabling them to wantonly waste time, that I preattempt fer it to the Government proposal. That is the whole question. What the minority want is an opportunity to point out abuses. They cannot carry anything into effect, they can criticise everything, and it is fear of wholesome criticism that prevents the majority from engaging in wrong-doing. The. amendment would enable the minority to do' what was legitimate, 'without perought mitting them to indulge in wanton obstruccial tion. It would limit the speeches of orable members, and place all upon an equal footing, .except to the extent that would exempt honourable members in charge of Bills, or resolutions, from restrictions as to time. It would require honourable members to confine their remarks within what would, in 99 cases out of 100, prove less than an hour each. to be an. ample margin of time. sequently, with the alternative offered [23 NOVEMBER , 1905.] Limitation of Debate. 5707 them, honourable members-unles s they desire that the power given under the standing order shall be abused-should have no the hesitation in making a choice.",35

161,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I am not permitted to refer to the proceedings in another place, he but if in any other place connected with I do not the Federation there is a similar order in force, I will say that in no other place does such a state of affairs exist as we",35
162,Mr HUMECOOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"He a r , hear. Eight or ten members are monopolizing all the",35
163,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The amendment now before the Chair would prevent that. I am supporting it because it would prevent any or ten men from monopolizing the It would also prevent any individual member from speaking for four or five hours at a time-as was of done by an honourable member who was in the hands opposition last session.,35
164,Mr HUMECOOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The honourable memhonorable ber means last week.,35
165,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"U n d e r the proposal of zt the honourable member, for North Sydney, an honourable member of the Opposition the would be prevented from speaking for four or five hours at a time. So far as I am no speech of that length has been delivered during this session. I have not been sufficiently curious to search' Hansard. order to discover to what length speeches have been extended. When I do refer to Hansard, I read the speeches, and do not to measure them with a yard stick. I do not consider it necessary to take up much more time. I should not have spoken so long, but for interruptions which led but me somewhat off the track. I support the the amendment now before the House, because I believe in it. I regard it as a fair thing. It will treat all members alike, and will make exceptions only where exceptions to be. made. It will prevent any spepowers from being put into force at hontimes when excitement is running - high. It will prevent undue debate, and undue obit struction. It will provide for limitations which will bring about the result which some honourable members sav has been produced this week, during which the speeches delivered have extended lover 'something I consider that Conthat will be a desirable result. It will to achieve all that can be desired-unles s honourable members seek to stifle debate and silence criticism, and thus enable things to be done, of which the country cannot be properly informed, through Parliament. Under these circumstances, I deem it to be my bounden duty to heartily support the amendment, and to express the hope that the more moderate of honourable members on the Government side of the House, who agree that there should be some limitation of debate, but who join with me in my dislike of the Government proposal, may see their way to adopt the alternative now presented to them. The amendment will enable us to bring about the limitation of debate in a form that is not open to abuse, whereas the Governmefnt proposal is one which, in view of the circumstances of the case, of the existence of three parties in the House, and of the dominance exercised by the Labour Party, is most likely to be abused. Abuses are bound to occur when opportunities are presented, and I have no desire to see any such opportunity afforded. I trust that Honourable members will realise that the amendment is a wiser and fairer proposal than that originally made, and that if adopted it will effect all that can reasonably be desired, if honourable members do not wish to abuse the powers intrusted to them.",35
166,Mr FISHER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Most of the observations of members of the Opposition have been based upon the assumption that the Government have been subject to some outside influence' in this matter; that has weakened ' their arguments.,36
167,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I sincerely believe that to be true, and, therefore, I have no hesitation in saying it. Honourable members cannot expect me to be silent on the point, if I believe that to be the ease.",36
168,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,That has nothing ever to do with this debate.,36
169,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"It may possibly, in some distant way, be urged as a reason why the proposal now before the Chair, rather than the original one, should be adopted. However, I do not propose to press that point. I shall satisfy myself by once more urging honourable members to seriously consider whether it is not correct, as has been stated, that the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney is fairer and less likely to be misused in a moment of excitement than is the standing order proposed by the Government. ' Mr LONSDALE (New England^ -. ! stronglv support the amendment, which I think should find favour with all honourable members, who desire to extend fair play to the minority. It will result in the limitation of debate, but will yet allow every honourable member an opportunity to express his views. Few honourable members can deliver a well-thought-out speech extendingover .an hour; but I do not think that we should agree to any standing order which would prevent an honourable member from placing his views before the House in the clearest and strongest terms possible. If the Government proposals were adopted, the closure might be applied because of the tedious repetition of three or four honourable members, with the result that a number of others who would not think of addressing the House at length, would be absolutely debarred from expressing their views upon the question under consideration. The honourable member for Coolgardie referred last night to what he described as the lengthy speeches delivered by members of the Opposition ; but upon analyzing his figures, I find that the average time occupied in the delivery of the fifty-four speeches to which he alluded was less than one hour. It must not be forgotten that those speeches were delivered in connection with the consideration of such important matters as the Budget, the Estimates, and the Commerce Bill . In the circumstances, no one could say that they were unreasonably long. It has been urged that the closure proposals of the Government should be. adopted in order to prevent time being wasted by the present Opposition. The honourable and learned member - for Corinella has clearly pointed out, however, that as the Ministerial Party accept without demur every measure put before them, it neceswhat- sarily follows that the Opposition, in the interests of the country, must carefully examine those proposals. It would be wrong for the Opposition to allow measures submitted to the House to pass without full . consideration; and if their efforts to induce the Ministry to remedy defects in the measure submitted resulted in their being closured, faulty laws would surely be passed. Ill-considered legislation comes back upon us; nearly every session we' have to pass Bills to amend measures; that have not received full consideration. I trust that the Government and their supporters will view this matter from an intelligent stand-point, and will agree to some of the amendments which have been foreshadowed. We have been told by honourable members opposite that they have no desire to pass drastic standing orders, but that some limitation of debate is necessary. If that be their view, I think that the standing order submitted by the honourable and learned member for Corinella to the Standing Orders Committee should carry out their desire. Nothing has occurred in this House that should induce us to carry the Government proposals. If the Prime Minister had been free to take independent action, he would not have submitted them. I believe that if he had bad at his back only the members of his own party, these drastic proposals would not have been made. The force behind him has compelled him to adopt a course which is not in accord with his own desires. I hope that honourable members opposite will dismiss from their minds the feeling that the. Opposition ought practically to be destroyed, and that some of the amendments which have been foreshadowed will be accepted, so that, whilst liberty shall not develop into licence, freedom of debate will not be absolutely abolished.",36
170,Mr JOHNSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," At an earlier stage in the debate I intimated my intention to move an amendment, which I think would be more effective than that now before the Chair, but as I resumed my seat without moving it, I was precluded from submitting it to the House at a later stage. I shall therefore tentatively support the amendment now under consideration, and in the event of its being negatived, shall ask another honourable member to move that of which I have given notice. The form of closure proposed 'by the honourable member for North Sydney is certainly preferable to that submitted by the Government. It would undoubtedly provide safeguards against the arbitrary application of the "" gag "" at the instance of what might be at any time a tyrannical majority. It is only reasonable that certain important questions should be exempted from the operation of the closure, and provision is made for this in the first part of the amendment. It provides thatNo member shall speak for more than one hour on any question before the House, except in debate on the Address-in-Reply, or on the Budget, or in a debate on a motion of "" No Confidence,"" OT in moving the second reading of a Bill , moving a resolution. The Ministerial programme for the session is usually embodied in the Governor-Geneto ral's Speech at the opening of Parliament, and in the interests, not only of the House, but of their constituents, honourable members feel themselves called upon, in discussing the Address-in-Reply, to give expression to their views on most of the questions touched upon. Unless an amendment be adopted that will afford honourable members an opportunity to adequately discuss such matters, a great injustice will be done, not only to honourable members themselves, but to their constituents. When a charge is made against an honourable member that he has adopted a certain attitude in regard to some of the proposals outlined in the Ministerial programme. Hansard affords him the only means of refuting the accusation; but _ M debate on such a question as the motion for the adoption of the Addressin-Reply is to be seriously restricted, honourable members will be left entirely at the mercy of any one who desires to place them in a false light before their constituents. The next matter which the honourable member for North Sydney proposes to exempt from the closure rule is the Budget. We all know that the Budget deals with, many questions which demand the most earnest consideration. Proposals for large expenditure may involve increased taxation, and there is nothing which requires closer scrutiny on the part of honourable members than does the Treasurer's annual statement. I would remind honourable members that, although the last Budget was a most voluminous one, the debate upon it was comparatively brief. This affords an illustration of the fact that under ordinary circumstances honourable members have no desire to unduly prolong their speeches. It is only when matters of a highly contentious character are under consideration that honourable members of the party to which I belong, at any' rate, exhibit any desire to speak at unusual length. I think it will be generally admitted that a no-confidence motion should be the subject of the fullest and freest discussion. How can an honourable member compress all his reasons for objecting to the policy of a Government, as well as to its acts of administration, within the the comparatively brief period of one hour ? I can readily conceive of cases arising when more than two hours would be necessary to or in enable a speaker to even enumerate, without discussing in detail, the misdeeds of a Ministry. It would take fully that time set forth without any argument the misdeeds of the present Government. I admit that it would be very convenient for the Ministry which happened to be in power if the ""gag'' could be applied to a debate upon a no-confidence motion, but 1 maintain that such a proceeding would be very immoral and unjust. Then I can easily understand that, in moving the second reading of a Bill , a Minister may occupy more than an hour in explaining its provisions. during the current session I have known Ministers to exceed that time. I think that the Minister of Home Affairs occupied more than an hour in moving the second reading of the Copyright Bill .",37
171,Mr GROOM,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,No. I spoke for only three-quarters of an hour.,38
172,Mr JOHNSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I think the Minister must have been oblivious of-the flight of time on that occasion; but still I do not object, for I hold that a Minister should be allowed the fullest latitude in explaining any measure in detail, so that honourable members may be in a position to understand the reasons which have induced the Government to bring it forward. Whilst, under the proposal of the Government, it would be competent for any honourable member, the moment a Minister rose to explain the provisions of a - Bill , to move the ""gag,"" the amendment would prevent any such motion from being put from the Chair. Consequently, the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney should commend itself to all sections of the House. In submitting a resolution, too, I think that very great latitude should be allowed to honourable members. In this connection I have in. my mind the motion relating to Home Rule which was recently moved by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. Let us suppose that the moment he had risen to submit that proposal, a member' of the Opposition, who did not approve of its terms had taken advantage of the fact that there were a sufficient number of members present to close the honourable and learned member's mouth, they would have been able to absolutely block him from assigning reasons why it should be carried.",38
173,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"That could be done only after the question had been proposed, which means after it had been, put from the Chair.",38
174,Mr JOHNSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"In that case the Gomost vernment proposal would have limited the right of others to reply to the honourable and learned member, which would have been just as reprehensible a procedure as [REPRESENTATIVES.] Limitation of Debate. that of preventing the mover from proceeding upon the lines that he had mapped out for himself. It must be also recollected that many subjects are brought before this House which are of a highly contentious character, and that, in order to secure the fullest information upon them, honourable members frequently spend many hours in the library consulting various authorities. Even It seems to me that it would be a fatal mistake to prevent them from, giving to the House the benefit of their researches. The first part of the amendment ought certainly to appeal to honourable members upon both sides of the Chamber. In the course of his remarks, the other day, the honourable member for Gwydir adopted a very "" YesNo "" . attitude. After speaking strongly against the"" Government proposal, he concluded his speech by announcing his intention to support them. H is arguments simply meant that, so long as the closure was applied only to members of the Opposition, he was prepared to support it. That is a most remarkable attitude for the honourable member to take up, but it is one which accurately reflects the position of many of his associates in the Labour corner. H is argument, 'reduced to the last analysis, was: "" I do not believe in the right of any one else to ' g a g ' me, but I believe I ought to have the right to ' gag ' everybody else."" The honourable member also stated that my speeches during the present session occupied thirty-six yards in Hansard. That may or may not be the fact. .Certainly it is not a reason why I should be brought under any system of closure. But, .in extenuation of my offence-if I am guilty of any- 1 must say that I was repeatedly requested to speak by honourable members who sit in the Labour comer. That fact was evidenced by their repeated calls for "" Johnson."" It seems to me most unkind that, after courteously acceding to their request, I should be charged with unduly trespassing upon the time of the House. But, upon looking up Hansard for last session, I find that one speech of the honourable member for Gwydir occupied no less than 342 inches. I have not had time to measure the space taken up by the whole of his utterances last session, but, so far as my researches have gone, they occupy no less than fifty-nine yards of Hansard. On the important questions before the House, the utmost limit of any speech I have made has not much exceeded half the length of many of those of the honourable member for Gwydir on very ordinary questions. H a d his distinguished namesake, Mr . Daniel Webster, or the no less distinguished Lindley Murray, been compelled to listen to those speeches, they would have induced homicidal tendencies in the breasts of those two gentlemen. The amendment has been framed with the object of securing the limitation of debate, and at the same time preserving the right of individual members, whether belonging to the minority or to the majority, to give fair and reasonable expression to their views. That right might be absolutely denied under the closure provided for in the motion, but the amendment removes that objection. So far as my own speeches are concerned, I would point out that there is an essential difference between them and some of those uttered by the honourable member for Gwydir, inasmuch as I have never risen with the deliberate intention of wasting time, and when I have spoken at unusual length, have dealt with matters of national importance. I should not, however, object to be limited to one hour, if that limitation applied to all, though I feel that no rule for the limitation of debate should be discussed at a time of excitement. A matter of this kind should be dealt with only when cool thought and calm deliberation are possible. The amendment provides that, on any question before the House, except in the debate on the A d dress-in-Reply, the Budget, or a motion of "" No-confidence,"" speeches shall not exceed an hour, and that in Committee no member, unless in charge of a Bill or resolution,, shall speak for more than an hour in all, or four times in all, on any question. That seems to me to be a fair and reasonable limitation, because, as a general rule, we deal in Committee, not with large questions of principle, but mainly with constructive questions of detail. I have heard it urged as an objection to this rule that a practical "" stonewall "" might still be set up, under it, by every member of a partu determining to occupy the full period! allotted to him. But, it must be remembered, that even under extraordinary circumstances that would never happen. In the momentous debate which has just been concluded, the bulk of the speaking, as has been pointed out by Ministerial supporters, was done by eight members of the Opposition, although the proceedings occupied almost a whole week. Notwithstanding the fact that the feelings of tfhe Opposition were then ailmost at 1 white heat, a number of its members hardly exercised their right to speak, while others did not speak at all. Therefore, it seems to me that the objection does not hold good. The third part of the amendment allows an honourable member to speak for a longer period, or more frequently, than is provided for by the two preceding rules, with the leave of a majority of the House, or of the Committee, as the case may be. ' That 'seems to me a wise provision, because there may be subjects under discussion on which certain honourable members may possess special, and perhaps even expert knowledge, which they could not fully convey to honourable members within the space of an hour. The question is to be put without amendment or debate, whether the member be further heard, and, if carried in the affirmative, he is to be permitted to continue his remarks. In this connection, I should like to point out that the amended code of standing orders recommended by the Standing Orders Committee, provides that the following motions shall not be open for debate, but shall be moved without argument or opinion offered, and forthwith put from the Chair without amendment:-The motion for the first reading of a Bill , the motion ""That the debate be now adjourned,"" the motion ""That the Chairman report progress."" the motion "" That the Chairman leave the chair,"" and a motion reinstating lapsed business on the notice-paper. The Prime Minister wishes to add another motion, but I shall not refer to that proposal, as it will shortly come before the House. The adoption of the suggestion of the Standing Orders Committee would still further check the tendency to undue discussion. I understand that a proposal similar to that contained in the amendment was seriously considered by the late Government, but that they were prevented from placing it before the House because of their retirement from office. In New Zealand, similar rules are in force, and work wr y satisfactorily, very few all-night sittings having taken place there. I fear that, unless we modify the original proposal of the Government, the effect of it will be similar to the effect of less drastic closure rules in other Legislatures. Wherever the closure is in force, a Ministrv wishine to rush Bills through, keeps the House sitting beyond reasonable hours, until, finally, irritation is caused amongst honourable members by want of rest: Consequently the adoption of the closure proposal would encourage, instead of prevent all-night sittings, because Ministers would find it more easy to induce honourable members to apply the "" g a g "" when they are reduced' to a state' of nervous irritation than under normal conditions. I regret that the motion and the amendment were not referred to the Standing Orders Committee. The matter would then have been properly considered, and the Committee might probably have been able'to suggest a form of standing order which would have been generally acceptable, and would have met all the requirements of the case. I presume, that owing to the resignation of several members of the Committee, as a protest against the high-handed proceeding of the Government in going behind the back of the Committee in connection with this standing order, it would not be practicable to refer the question to them at this stage. I shall certainly support the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney.",38
175,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Macouarie) I would point out that the amendment now before us is on the lines suggested by certain members of the late Government. The late Prime Minister pointed out that some fair limitation should be imposed upon the speeches of honourable members, and his colleagues generally concurred in that view. I do not approve of the proposal of the Government, because it seems to me to be undesirable to confer upon a small section of honourable! members the power to close down a debate, and stifle discussion. I have seen the closure greatly abused in the New South Wales Assembly, and I should very.much regret to see a similar rule applied to our proceedings. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney appears to me to meet all the requirements of the case, whilst it possesses the special advantage of being free from the possibility of abuse. It fixes a time limit for speeches, which may be extended, with the consent of thd House. That is not ani unusual provision, because in connection with the discussions in this House to which a time limit applies, honourable members frequently pay honourable members the courtesv of_ agreeing to their request for an extension of time. As a rule! it would 'be possible for honourable members to compress their remarks within the limits prescribed in the amendment. It has been stated that the closure proposal was introduced by the Government on account of the extent^ to which honourable members of the Opposition had occupied the time of the House. I think, however, that excepting one or two cases, the speeches delivered have not been inordinately long. I have looked through the records of this session, and I find no warrant for advancing the reason indicated. In a previous session I delivered a speech extending for over four hours, but I had a special object in view, namely, to protect the rights of honourable members. But for my action, the debate upon a very important matter would have been closed, and a number of honourable members who desired to speak, but who were not at the time in a position to do so, would have been deprived of an opportunity to express their views. The debate subsequently extended over two or three weeks.",40
176,Sir JOHN FORREST,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Then the honourable member was responsible for that three weeks' debate ?,40
177,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Yes , and I am proud of it The very fact that the debate was extended to such a length showed that I did not act without good cause. It must be generally admitted that in all Parliaments the privileges of honourable members are sometimes abused, but the Government do not propose to deal with that particular evil. They propose to take power to summarily close down a debate, irrespective of the number of honourable members who may desire to address themselves to the question. Under their proposal, an honourable member, by speaking at undue length, might bring about the 'application of the closure, and cause many others to be penalized. Any honourable member who abuses his privilege should be dealt with without visiting his sins upon innocent persons. It would in my opinion be far preferable"" to impose a time limit upon speeches, and thus safeguard the rights of honourable members, as is proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney. It has been stated that the late Government intended to introduce the closure, but that is not correct. It was mentioned .'that the late Prime Minister had made such an intimation through the press, but although I have carefully searched through the newspaper reports, I have not been able to find any foundation for that statement. The right honourable member for East Sydney certainlv did point out that it was necessary to impose some limitation upon the speeches of honourable members who were disposed to impede the public business, and the majority of his colleagues concurred in that view. That opinion was formed as the result the obstructive tactics that were resorted to during the previous session. Under Government proposal, an honourable memvidual ber might, merely because he was unquestion. popular, have the closure applied to him after he had spoken two or three words. This afternoon I mentioned a case in which anhonorable member in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly had the clodifference sure applied to him eight or ten times the one evening.,",40
178,Mr BROWN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,That was not due to his unpopularity.,41
179,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The closure realizes was applied, because the honourable ber referred to had made himself obnoxious to a certain member upon the Government benches. On one occasion he was *' g g S i ' "" before he had uttered a e< words upon a motion for the second reading of a Bill . That appeared to be a gross interference with the rights an honourable member. I was present the New South Wales Legislative Assembly when three honourable members had the closure applied to them before they had uttered more than twenty words. principal reason for supporting the ment is that it would prevent such an unfair application of the closure. Whether an Government. honourable member be popular of unpopular, he has a right to be heard. It often happens that the most unpopular members of a House are those who make the most valuable contributions to the debates, and there should be no attempt to unduly curtail their utterances. It is because I am aware that the closure has been abused in other Parliaments that I urge honourable members to accept the amendment, which, I may say in passing, accords very largely with the view of the late Government when they intimated their intention to introduce new Standing Orders. I have no wish to prolong the debate, but trust that we shall come very speedily to a division, 1 in order that the various other amendments that have been foreshadowed may be dealt with.",41
180,Mr KELLY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," Like the being honourable member who has just seat, I do not propose to devote more than a few minutes to the consideration of the amendment. The principal difference tween the original motion and the proposal submitted by the honourable member for North Sydney is that the latter is intended to penalize an offender in connection with of unduly protracted debate, whilst under the Government proposition the closure would the undoubtedly be applied not only to indioffenders, but to the whole issue in In view of the present state of parties in this House-in view of the fact that we have three parties, which, in the words of the Prime Minister, make constitutional government almost impossible-the between the two proposals is in especially, maxked. The standing order proposed by the Government would enable them, or any of their supporters, to closure a motion, and the proposition becomes infinitely more obnoxious the moment one the peculiar situation in which Gomemvernments may find themselves in, this House. Let us take, for instance, the almost impossible situation of three parties, one party, the smallest, being in power, and two another, twice its size, supporting it",41
181,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I fail to see that the me to remarks now being made by the honourable of member have any bearing on the amendin ment before the Chair. They would have been appropriate to the general question, but that having been disposed of, the only question now before the Chair is as to the My relative advantages of the form of closure amendproposed by the honourable member for North Sydney and that submitted by the",41
182,Mr KELLY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The amendment is a proposal to limit the duration of debates. I firmly believe that some such limitation is necessary. I am informed that the honourable member for Gwydir, in the course of last session, made speeches covering no less than seventy-two yards of Hansard. That honourable member, at all events, should support the amendment. Surely those who have offended by speaking at undue length should be the first to support it. Unless they ""do, the people will be, naturally, suspicious of their motives. An honourable member who in one session has made speeches covering seventy-two yards of Hansard should support any proposition to fix a time limit.",41
183,Mr JOHNSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member for Gwydir does not believe in the closure applied to himself , although he would resumed his apply it to others.",41
184,Mr KELLY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I trust that the honourable member will be generous, and recognise that be the physic with which he is prepared to dose the Opposition is one which he might well use himself. Under the amendment, an honourable member will be able to address himself to a question of importance for an hour. Surely that is a reasonable proposal ? Surely, even if the Government refuse to accept the amendment, they are not prepared to say that one hour is insufficient to enable an honourable member to properly debate any question that may be submitted. I should think that the Minister of Trade and Customis would be able within an hour to elaborate at least one argument and address himself properly to it. Why does he oppose this amendment ? And why does the Vice-President of the Executive Council propose to vote against it? These two honourable gentlemen can hardly refuse to support it, since it would not interfere in any way with their liberties. An hour would surely be a reasonable time to enable the Vice-President of the Executive Council to work off one of his jests. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I trust that if honourable members feel impelled to pass the closure motion in its original form, they will recognise that it will interfere with the right of their constituents to watch the progress of business in this Chamber, and that they will be extremely sparing of its use. If they take up that attitude, and so make the abuse of the proposed standing order impossible. I, for one, shall feel that a great many of my objections to the Government proposition will have been proved almost groundless. Amendment (by Mr DUGALD THOMSON) putThat after the word "" namely,"" line 4, the following words be inserted :"" No Member shall speak for more than one hour on any question before the House except in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, or on the Budget, or in a debate on a motion of ' No Confidence,' or in moving the second reading of a Bill , or in moving a resolution.

186,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I understand that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne does not desire to proceed with his amendment.,44
187,Mr LIDDELL,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," Although this Parliament is now one which reflects considerable credit upon the Commond I trust that it may long continue to do so-the trend of politics is such that it is possible that at a later stage left the Federal Parliament will not maintain its present standard. We are fortunate in having to preside over us a gentleman into whom every honourable member places the most implicit trust, but the time may come when the high office of Speaker will not be so worthily filled. PartV feeling may 19 run so high that the rights of members may be endangered, unless they are efficiently safeguarded. Therefore, in order to bring the proposed new standing order somewhat into accord with that which has been adopted by the House of Commons, I moveTliat the following words be added : ""Provided always that this rule shall be put in force only when the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees is in the chair, and it appears to the Chair the motion is not an abuse of the rules of House, or an infringement of the rights of minority.""",44
188,Mr HIGGINS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Northern Melbourne). - The honourable member proposes to add to the proviso which I had intended to sert a provision that the closure shall be enforced, unless it appears that the motion is an abuse of the rules of House , or am infringement of the rights 1 of the minority. If that member had moved his amendment at the place at which I had proposed to insert it. it would have had some sense in grammar, and reason, but inasmuch as he proposes to tack it on to the end of the motion, it will have no sense in reason or grammar, and I feel free to vote against it.",45
189,Mr MCCAY,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," Wit h every ney) respect to the honourable and learned memgard toI the ber, it appears to me that the amendment learned member is not only good in sense, but is also good I merely wish to for in grammar, and that it also proposes to do common justice. Therefore, I propose Minister, to vote for it. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) I merely desire to add to the the honourable and learned member for Corinella, that the reason can be corrected, and the grammar can be amended, and that, therefore the difficulties suggested by the "" stone wall."" honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne are not insuperable.",45
190,Mr HIGGINS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member would "" stone-wall "" a grammatical correcpossibly tion. Mr JOSE PH COOK - There is anthe other reason for this political cocktailism.",45
191,Mr HIGGINS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I rise to a point of order. I wish to know whether the honourable ber is at liberty to use such a term with regard to another honourable member?,45
192,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I would ask the hon The orable member for Parramatta to withdraw his remark.,45
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Certainly . I shall substitute a very old parliamentary expression. I would say that another reason why the honourable and learned memthey ber has jumped Jim Crow over his own modifications. amendment is to be found in the decision of the caucus not to admit of any modification of the Government proposal. I congratulate my honourable friend upon his complete subserviency to caucus rule.,45
194,Mr DEAKIN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," I desire to say that the the action of the honourable! and learned memthe ber for Northern Melbourne has been taken out of loyalty to the motion, owing to his resolution to accept the standing order in its present form, rather than permit his inamendment to become an instrument for , not impairing or destroying it. In the most generous fashion he has sacrificed his own the wishes to those of the Government.",45
195,Mr JOHNSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," The position occupied by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is a surin prising one for a gentleman who claims to be the philosophical radical far excellence of this House. Henceforth, he will be known as the champion political chameleon of this Parliament. ,",45

198,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,That was before the,45
199,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"That fact should not be allowed to influence our legislation. The honourable member has given the very worse reason that could be advanced for passing legislation in a certain form. We are legislating for future, and not for to-night or tomorrow, and honourable members ought not to urge that the occurrences of today should memaffect the decision of the House in connection with resolutions that will operate on the parliamentary life of the Commonwealth, possibly for many years to come. Prime Minister stated that the Government were not wedded to the particular form of their proposal.",45
200,Mr DEAKIN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Hear , hear.",45
201,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,And that would be willing to accept reasonable,45
202,Mr DEAKIN,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I stated that we would consider them.,46
203,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"A m o n g other things, he stated that a provision that the application of the closure should be subject to the approval of the Speaker would not meet with his opposition. Now we find the honourable and learned gentleman opposing that proposal which originally came from a member on his own side.",46
204,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"Macquarie) The Prime Minister has contradicted the statement made by the honourable member for North Sydney. When the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne proposed his amendment, he said'I should like to move the insertion of the following words, which appear in the House of Commons rule"" Unless it appear to the Chair that the motion is an abuse of the rules of the House, or an infringement of the rights of the minority."" Those words must be well weighed. If it be permissible for any honourable member to move, "" That the question be now put,"" the power may be exercised simply to waste time. I, therefore, hold that Mr Speaker, or the Chairman, should be able to say, "" I will not put the motion; it is an abuse of the rules."" If , as has been suggested, the word "" Minister "" be substituted for the word "" member """,46
205,Mr ISAACS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The Prime Minister expressed his willingness at the outset to agree to that amendment.,46
206,Mr HIGGINS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"If such an amendment be made, the need for a provision as to an abuse of the rules of the House will not be so great, but even in such circumstances, it is desirable that Chair should have the right to determine whether the moving of the motion, "" That the question be now put,"" is an abuse of the procedure of the House. A Minister usually has a majority with him, and if some such provision as I suggest be not inserted, there will be a great danger of the rights of a minority being interfered with. It was clearly understood that the Government approved of that amendment. should l'ike to know what explanation can be offered for the change of attitude on the part of the honourable and learned member. He was at great pains to condemn honourable members of the Opposition for obstructing the business, but he cannot accuse them of ever having gone back on their principles. He boasted of being great democrat, and an advocate of justice tleman repliedfor all classes of the community, and he urged that no honourable member should be an amendment. permitted to move ""That the question now put,"" except with the consent of Chair. Why has this great change taken place?",46
207,Mr WATSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,Why has the right honourable member for East Sydney changed his views ?,46
208,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The change to which I refer has taken place within the last few days, and is of a lightning character. Surely the honourable and learned member has some principles, or has he surrendered them to the caucus?",46
209,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I would point out that the conduct of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melboumel lis not before the Chair. The question is whether certain words should be added to the motion.,46
210,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I submit, Mr . Speaker, that it will be competent for me to criticise the views of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne.",46
211,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,I think not.,46
212,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The views of some honourable members on this side of the House have been criticised.,46
213,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The only question before the Chair is the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter, and, so far as I am aware, it contains no reference to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne",46
214,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable and learned member said that he could not accept the amendment, because it was ungrammatical, and also because it was not proposed to insert it in the right place.",46
215,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable memthe .beT may discuss the question of whether or not the amendment is grammatical, or is proposed to be inserted in its proper place; but it is not competent for him to discuss the motives of the honourable and learned member for Northern - Melbourne, or to make any such reference to him as he was doing when I first called him to order. I Mr SYDNEY SMITH - If honourable members turn, to page 5280 of Hansard, they will find that, when the Prime Minister was introducing the motion, the honourable and learned member for Werriwa interjectedWould the Prime Minister accept an amendment to include Mr Speaker's approval ? a And that the honourable and learned genI should be prepared to favourably consider such be It is remarkable that the honourable and the learned member for Northern Melbourne, after giving notice of an amendment which it was generally understood would be moved by him-and which appeared on the business-paper-shoul d have suddenly withdrawn it. He has gone back upon his principles, and his action compels honourable members of the Opposition to take his place and fight for the rights and privileges of this House.",46
216,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," I desire, Mr . Speaker",47
217,Mr GB EDWARDS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"I rise, Speaker, to avail myself of the new privilege that has just been conferred on honourable members by movingThat the question be now put.",47
218,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"When , the whole of the amendments have been disposed of the main question must be put from the Chair, and carried, or otherwise disposed of ; but until it has been carried, such a step as the honourable member proposes cannot be taken.",47
219,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," I wish to say, Mr Speaker, that I was discussing this amendmentwith the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne about"" ten minutes ago, and that he then told me that if it were proposed to insert it at its right place, namely, in paragraph a, he should feel that he ought to vote with the Opposition, even if he were the only honourable member on this side of the House who did so.",47
220,Mr ROBINSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," I think that it is to be regretted that the members of the late Government should have displayed any heat in connection, with this matter. Their experience of honourable gentlemen on the Treasury bench should have prevented anything of the kind. They have been sold once at Ballarat, and are now being sold again.",47
221,Mr SPEAKER,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,47
222,Mr ISAACS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,It is perfectly ouerile.,47
223,Mr ROBINSON,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable and learned member for-Indi is a judge of puerility. In deference to your ruling, Mr . Speaker, I withdraw the statement, and regret that I should have had to make it.",47
224,Mr WILKS,WORKS ON AUSTRALIA N," This is about the last opportunity we shall have for free debate, and I wish to say that I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter. I deeply de-. plore the attitude of our radical friend, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who, for grammatical and mathematical reasons, is not prepared to support the very amendment of which he himself gave notice. It seems that the Labour Party have made an addition to their code, and that they are not prepared to support anything which is not grammatical or mathematical. I favour the amendment, because it will render it impossible for an ill-spirited member to move the application of the closure. I am strongly of opinion that the closure Mr should be applied only with the concurrence of Mr Speaker or the Chairman of Committees. Some honourable members may render themselves obnoxious and be ""gagged,"" with the result that the closure will be applied to the whole question at issue, and unpleasantness will arise. This danger will be avoided, to a large extent, if we provide that a proposal to apply the closure must meet with the approval of Mr . Speaker or the Chairman of Committees, whose impartiality is undoubted. On more than one occasion the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has given notice of amendments and abandoned them in the same way that he has done to-night. In the first Federal Parliament he was known as "" the revolving light,"" and I now christen him "" the grammatical and mathematical member for Northern Melbourne.""
