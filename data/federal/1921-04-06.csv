1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. NEW MEMBER. Mr SPEAKER informed the House that he had received a return to the writ issued for the election of a member to serve in the House of Representatives for the electoral division of Kalgoorlie, in the place of the Hon. Hugh Mahon, endorsed with a certificate of the election of George James Foley, Esq. Mr FOLEY made and subscribed the oath of allegiance. ASSENT TO BILLS. Assent to the following Bills reported:Air Navigation Bill. Aliens Registration Bill. Appropriation Bill 1920-21. Commonwealth Bank Bill. Comonwealth Electoral' (War-time) Bepeal Bill. Immigration Bill. Industrial Peace Bill (No. 2). Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill. Land Tax Bill Nationality Bill. . Passports Bill. Quarantine Bill. Biver Murray Waters Bill. Sugar Purchase Bill (No. 2). War Precautions Act Repeal Bill. . Navigation Bill (which had been reserved for the signification of his Majesty's pleasure). CLERICAL STAFF.",19
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Honourable members will recollect that at the last sitting of the House I intimated ' that Mr ' Thomas W.oollard, the Clerk-Assistant, proposed to retire from the service of the House' on his attaining the statutory age. That gentleman relinquished his position on the 31st of last month, and consequent on his retirement I made the necessaryrecommendation for the following changes to be made in regard to the officers in attendance in the Chamber:Mr Clapin to be Clerk-Assistant. Mr Hubert to be Second Clerk-Assistant. Mr MCGregor, who some time ago resumed duty after serving as an officer of the Australian Imperial Force, to be Serjeant-atArms and Clerk of Committees. These, and other changes, will not add to the total number of officers, but have rendered possible a very necessary rearrangement of duties. When the House of Representatives first met there was a Second Clerk-Assistant, but, later, on the promotion of the occupant of .that office, Mr Speaker Holder said he did not propose at that time to fill the position of Second Clerk-Assistant, as he desired to try if the work could be efficiently performed with only two Clerks. In view of the fact that the sessions of the House of Representatives are very much longer, aiid the work of the Department much greater than it was anticipated at the inauguration of Federation would be the case, I think the time has now arrived for the appointment of a Second Clerk-Assistant to be again made. The present Clerk and the Clerk-Assistant are of the same age, and, in the event of their retiring at the same time, the House would be at a disadvantage if an officer who had had no previous experience at the table were to be appointed Clerk of the House. I may add that in the State of New South Wales there is a Second Clerk-Assistant in the Legislative Assembly. Other officers of the staff have also recommended for promotion as a result of these changes, and Mr Frank Clifton Green, Clerk-Assistant; and Serjeapt-at Arms of the House of Assembly, Tasmania, has been appointed Clerk of the Papers and Reading Clerk. Several of the applications for this position were from officers of other Departments who possess high qualifications and have distinguished military records; but, after exhaustive consideration, the choice fell on Mr Green, who, in addition to his other qualifications and good military record-^including the award of the Military Cross-has the great advantage of experience as an officer - of Parliament. Honourable members will be interested to know that we have now on the staff of Mr Speaker. the House,ex-officers of the Parliaments of Western Australia, New South Wales, Yictoria, and Tasmania, a combination which is of obvious benefit in dealing with the work, of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. In reference to the financial aspect of the alterations made, I may state that, excluding the salary of an officer formerly. paid under the non-clerical branch, the annual cost of the clerical staff will be £4,310, as against the annual rate of £4,370 at the initiation of the Parliament - includin g a salary of £1,200 then paid to the Clerk by the Victorian Parliament - showin g that the cost of the salaries of our clerical officers is now £60 per annum less than it was twenty years ago. The present is only the second occasion on which promotions have been made in the staff, and the total amount of the increases in salaries is more than counterbalanced by the fact that, notwithstanding the great increase in the work of the Department, our small clerical staff, is actually one less in number than when it started. I have just learned that my recommendations would be given effect to. MINISTERIA L STATEMENT - ",19
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.8] -(B y leave)- I have a statement to make concerning the business to be submitted to Parliament. It is the intention of the Government to ask honourable members to confine' their attention, during the rebeen mainder of the session, to the consideration of the Tariff; and, though circumstances beyond, our control, and, indeed, beyond that of the Parliament, may compel the consideration of other matters, Ministers do not now propose to submit any new measures. As honourable members are aware, the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), as the representative of Australia, attended at - Geneva the first assembly of the League of Nations, and although it was sought to raise the question of mandates., the assembly was induced by him-h e having the sup- 1 port of the representatives of Great Britain-to refrain from doing so. The formal mandate to Australia has now been issued, and the Civil Administration is either now proclaimed or is in course of being proclaimed. The Proclamation has been submitted to His Excellency for signature. is only one other matter to which I desire to refer. The Government of Great Britain has issued to^ the Prime Ministers of the various Overseas Dominions an. invitation to attend a Conference to be held in London i u June next. I intend tomorrow to make a statement in regard to the questions to be discussed there, in order that the House may have the fullest opportunity of expressing its opinion on these and all matters' incidental to the Conference.

SHIPBUILDIN G CONTRACT. NA COMMITTEE.  the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works furnished to His Excellency the Governor General an interim report in connection with its' inquiry into the Kidman and Mayoh shipbuilding contract.

I now lay the report on the table of the House, and move That the paper be printed. Question resolved in the affirmative. SENIOR CADETS: ANNUAL TRAINING.",23
5,Mr BOWDEN,INTERIM REPORT OF PUBLIC WORKS,I desire to ask the Assistant Minister for Defence whether any determination has been arrived at in regard to the request made to the Departo t i - ment to shorten the seventy days' annual training now required of Senior Cadets?,23
6,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,INTERIM REPORT OF PUBLIC WORKS,"I would refer the honourable member to a statement made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce),, and published in the press, in which it was announced that the consideration of this matter was deferred pending the return of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) from England. MR. FLEMING, M.P.",23
7,Mr FLEMING,INTERIM REPORT OF PUBLIC WORKS,"In the Melbourne newspapers of the 11th and 12th ultimo, the Treasurer was reported to have said that he was as surprised as any one to than the price which the people of this hear that Mr Fleming had joined Country party, and that the honourable member had given no intimation of his intention so to do. I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he ever made any sueh statement?",23
8,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INTERIM REPORT OF PUBLIC WORKS,"I believe that what purported to be an interview with me was published in the newspapers about the time mentioned by the honCommissioner orable member. All that I know of that I moveinterview is that a reporter met me on the steps of the Treasury as I was leaving for home and plied me with the usual questions. I parried those as best could, and I remember my last words to the reporter were- "" I have nothing ever to say about Mr Fleming's retireasked ment."" The rest is due to a very enterI prising reporter. AUSTRALIAN"" - WHEAT BOARD.",24

10,Mr HUGHES,INTERIM REPORT OF PUBLIC WORKS,"I am unable to supevidence ply the information for which the honcause orable gentleman asks.

Because freights have see it. varied, and are varying, very, considerably, and as the whole of the wheat has been shipped, but as, I understand, only a comparatively small portion has been mittee. despatched, it is impossible to say what the f.o.b. equivalent of the c.i.f. of the wheat sold to Germany. But I may remind the honourable member of a tostatement I made, which appeared on "" That Saturday, showing that the average price that this wheat has been sold at is more affirmative. the country have been asked to pay.

21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Naturally , legislation of that kind will form part of the financial proposals for next year. There can be no doubt as to what tliese proposals will be; so far as I can see at present, they will be to fall in with the arrangement which has been made.",25

The Prime Minister will'recollect that I asked several times, when the House was last in session, for that document to be tabled. I should like to know whether there is any reason why it should not be made public now?",25
29,Mr HUGHES,THE GOVERNMENT ANDTH E,"If the honourable member is in possession of information to the effect that that contract has now been settled, I can only say that no such information has reached me. I will place myself in communication with the other party, or, if necessary, with the British Government^ in order to ascertain if the matter has been settled, and, if so, a copy of the contract will be laid upon the table. I have had no information since I last had the honour of replying to the honourable apmember upon the subject. SAVINGS BANKS.",25

ADJOURNMENT (Formal). NA SHIPBUILDING.",26
39,Mr SPEAKER,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I have received from the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) an intimation that he proposes to move the adjournment of the House, in order to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The wholesale dismissals of workmen from the Naval Dockyards, Cockatoo Island, and matters in connection with the administration of the dockyards and shipbuilding generally.'' Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",26
40,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Dalley) [3.37] - I regret the necessity for having to move a motion of this description today, especially upon a matter affecting rhe welfare of so large a number of Australian residents. The action of the Government, or the Naval Board, or whoever was responsible for the sudden dismissal of a very large number of men from their employment at Cockatoo Dockyard, came as a shock, not only to representatives of the Labour party in this House, but also to many honourable members who are sitting behind the Government. This action seems to have been taken in the most heartless and ill-considered manner possible. . The employees at Cockatoo were engaged upon work which was expected to continue for a lengthy period, but, without a word of warning, a notice was sent to the Dockyard from the Nnval Board that, nearly 2,000 men were to be discharged. I telegraphed to the Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith), who, I understood, was in charge of Naval affairs and controlling the Dockyard authorities, and I received a reply, not from the Minister, but from an official, which, without intimating that the Department was prepared to give any explanation, referred me to the Treasury. As a parliamentary representative, I protest strongly against such treatment. My wire to the Minister warranted the courtesy of a reply, if not from him, at least, in his absence, from the Department. But the oflicials merely intimated to me that my communication-had been referred to 'another set of oflicials in another,. Department. However, after a good deal of sparring in connection with the matter, we found that, although the Minister for the Navy was not prepared to make 'any explanation .to me-hi s silence was that of the grave-the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) jumped into the arena and said that the explanation for the dismissals lay in the fact that the whole of the money voted for new naval construction had been exhausted. I want to point out, in the first place, that it could not have been a sudden discovery that all the money for new naval construction hai been exhausted. Every month a statement is forwarded to' the Naval Board showing exactly what work has been done in the various naval yards-Cockato o Island. Garden Island, and elsewhere-rand in that way the Minister for the Navy ought to have known what his officials clearly must - hE ve known, namely, the amount of money Mhich had been expended out of any particular vote. In fact, for months past the Department must have been aware of the position of the various funds. Yet n -» warning was given >to the men. At almost a moment's notice they were suddenly thrown out on the Street. In my opinion, they were at least deserving of some notice of the intention of the Goveniment.. As the dismissals were not confined to men engaged in. new naval construction work, but embraced all classes of workers, the only case put up on behalf of the Crown, namely, the contention of the Treasurer as to the lack of funds, must fall to the ground. Hundreds of men '\pre discharged who were engaged upon merchant ship construction, upon ordinary maintenance work, and upon repair work generally, but according to the Treasurer ample funds were available for this class of work.",26
41,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,1 = there anything novel in that?,27
42,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"There is something novel in it to me, although possibly it might not be novel for honourable members opposite to throw men out of work in ""tins heartless fashion.",27
43,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Does not the honourable member know that men are always coming and going at the dockyards ?,27
44,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"-Yes , men engaged upon casual work, but some of-the men of whom I am speaking have not been engaged upon casual work. My complaint is that men who have been employed at Cockatoo Island for thirty or forty yeans, who were engaged, not upon new naval construction, but in assisting in the preparatory work for the construction of the projected 12,500 tons merchant ships, have been thrown out of work in such a heartless fashion. It could not have been for lack of funds, because the Treasurer admitted to the representatives of the men in Sydney that ample funds were available for the purpose of proceeding with the work of merchant ship construction. I also complain on another ground. At Cockatoo Island, as is the case with all dockyards where large numbers of men are employed, there is always liability to - accidents, and a number of men have met with accidents while employed there. They were entitled under the State and Commonwealth laws to certain financial compensation-in this regard their legal position was undoubted-bu t they compromised with the Government, and, instead of receiving monetary compensation for their injuries, accepted a lighter form of occupation in the yand with the promise of permanency. These men have also been thrown out of work in a ruthless fashion, although, so far as the industrial tnrnioil outside is concerned, they are on the scrap-heap, because, owing to the injuries they have received, they are utterly unfitted to"" follow their occupations in competition with others. Therefore, the Government are not only acting heartlessly, but are also breaking a inoral agreement they entered into with these men. Had the men gone to the Courts upon their legal rights they would have been granted monetary compensation for loss of hmbs or other injuries sustained, bnt, believing that the Government would act in an honourable way, they compromised with them, and now they find themselves thrown out of work. I can supply tl t; Ministei with the names of very many men who haxe been affected in this way. In view of the fact that the Treasurer has told us that ample funds are available for new merchant ship construction,' I would like to point - out that there are thousands of toas of material-frames , plates, angle bars, &c - lyin g at Cockatoo Island in readiness for merchant ship struction. There is a vast amount of preparatory work to he undertaken in handling that material, so that when the Commonwealth are prepared to proceed with' shipbuilding it will all be ready to go right into its place. Eventually this would lead to economy. Men could be employed economically and well on that class of work, and, on the Minister's own statement, ample funds are available there for. Why, then, does not the Minister make provision to employ men at that particular work ? There is another very serious aspect of the matter. After years of experience on the island, an pert shipbuilding staff has been built Previously, Australia had been handicapped by lack of men with the necessary training and experience to make the industry successful; but as an outcome of shipbuilding activities during the war years, we have now a trained staff, together with expert workmen. However, the action of the Government means that these experts will be scattered. Some of the very best men on the' island, in regard to whom no action has been taken by the Government to retain their services, will, be snapped up 'by private firms and lost altogether. to the Commonwealth industry. The Gdvernment suddenly stepped in and stopped work on the Adelaide. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) stated in Sydney that he would not make money available to proceed with work on that vessel. Why will he not do so? Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is reported to have stated in Sydney, according to the Evening News of the 11th March last, that the Treasurer might make a Treasurer's advance against the vote that Parliament would be asked to make for shipbuilding. Thus, it is explained, the Treasurer had power, if he liked to make funds available, to permit the work to proceed on the Adelaide; and the men need not have been discharged. The Treasurer told a deputation of the men in Sydney that he did. not intend to make any money available for further work upon the Adelaide. What is he going to do with the Adelaide? he propose to leave her io lie and rot in Sydney Harbor?",27
45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,No ; absurd !,28
46,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Then what does the Treasurerpropose to do with her? She to the Adelaide. conis. lying there as a spectacle for the people of Sydney.,28
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Nothin g has been altered. She has been lying there for two years.,28
48,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Why ? When her keel was laid, in 1917, she was launched within eight months. That period compares favourably, in respect of similar work, with the work of any naval shipbuilding yard in the Empire. The laying down of the keel and the launching of the hull within eight months implies very rapid work. For those engaged upon this new indusex- try in Australia to be able to comup. pete so well with the Old Country, and create an actual record, speaks volumes for the efficiency of the men at Cockatoo Island. However, after the hull had been launched, she was left tied up to one of the wharfs. By the instruction of the Naval Board the whole of the activities on the Adelaide were stopped. The purpose was a very good one, I am bound to admit. At that period the whole of our transports were returning with troops, :at the conclusion of the war. These craft had to be refitted and handed over to the original owners;, they were urgently wanted for oversea and Inter-State commerce. The whole of the men available at Cockatoo Island were therefore put on to the task of reconditioning. The outcome of all this was, however, that for about nine months only three men wore actually employed on. the The Adelaide. She remained for about eighteen months with practically no work whatever being carried out upon her. _",28
49,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,What about lack of requisite machinery?,28
50,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"There was ""tons"" of work which could have been proceeded with on the Adelaide. The administration, no doubt, had acted rightly-and I do not complain-in taking the men off and placing them on the reconditioning of transports. But to blame the men for the delay in the construction of the Adelaide, in viev of t i e facts known, is so much nonsensa. Does Mr MCWILLIAMS - Is it a - fact that there were putty, bolts in the Adelaide^",28
51,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"No; , that is another story, which I propose to tell on another occasion. The allegation does not apply For two years the Adelaide lay untouched. That is reason for the delay in her completion. As work on the transports was ending, the responsible official of the Naval Board gave instructions to the dockis yard authority to proceed with the .pletion of the warship; and, as the men became available, they were put on to the Adelaide, so that there would be dismissals or dislocation of the highlydischarge trained staff. Suddenly, however, came the word to stop. From whom, or whence, or why, I do not know; but work ceased. It was. necessary to proceed with it is necessary today. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said money could be made available. I accept his word. Treasurer can do as the Prime Minister has suggested. Why does he not mtfke pletion money available from the source indito create an army of unemployed? cated? The warship is lying unfinished in the harbour. She is needed as a fully equipped and commissioned unit. never know bow soon we may want that vessel; and notwithstanding all the Cockatoo. sneers and hints that she is already obsolete, it will be found that she is one of the most modern iand up-to-date vessels of her class afloat today.",28
52,Mr HUGHES,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Wit h respect to the honourable member's quotation of remarks alleged to have been made by myself,'I do not know whether he makes a point them; but I am quite sure that I never made them. I do not know that quohave gone astray. tation is very relevant. I do not think it matters much.",29
53,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,What does not matter ?,29
54,Mr HUGHES,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,I am sure that I never said anything in the remotest degree like it.,29
55,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I did not say that secretly. the Prime Minister said what the Sydney Evening News reported him to have said. I stated that he was so reported. The Treasurer could, as a matter of fact, make money available from his Advance Account. Will the Prime Minister deny that?",29
56,Mr HUGHES,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,I do not deny it. ever Parliament desires can be done. only limitation is in respect to finance.,29
57,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"The Government have the power to do what is necessary. We are told that the funds for new naval construction have been exhausted., the that, therefore, work on the Adelaide has been stopped; yet the Government 'are going on with the Moonbahj and every honourable member knows that the money being provided out of the Treasurer's comAdvance. In the same way, pending a parliamentary vote, money could be made available for the completion of the, Adeno laide. Therefore, it was unnecessary to the men who have been discharged, and the Minister responsible for their dismissal should explain his action. The Treasurer admits that money could ; it be made available, and the Minister for the Navy will not deny that the Adelaide is needed, and will be, when constructed, The a good, up-to-date vessel. Why, then, have men been discharged before he? comi f it is not that Ministers desire I should be sorry to think that; bit the facts are forcing me to that opinion. We I wish now to say a few words about the keep-it-dark, secret inquiry at 1",29

What happens is this: When we get a yearly vote like that to which I have referred, we issue quarterly warrants making available a fourth of the total sum at the beginning of each quarter. I found that, up to the end of February, during only eight months of the financial year, every penny of the year's vote had been spent. Mr HECTOB' LAMOND - Without authority.",32

There was, therefore, less work on the island be than there was during the war, and what the has happened has been that, instead of letting men go off as they were accustomed to do when the volume of repair work decreased, the manager, for some reason or another, crowded them all on to the Adelaide.

I found that the vote for the year had been exhausted in eight months. occurred to me that there was no particular urgency for the completion of the Adelaidel",33
103,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,How does the right honourable gentleman know that?,33
104,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"If I am to make my statement, I shall do so; but I do not wish to be subjected to the honourable member's catechism?",33
105,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,On what do you base the statement you have made?,33
106,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I was going to say. This is the only bit of new .construction we have in hand, no. other new Navy construction having been authorized. It did occur to me that, as this boat has been three or four years on the stocks, and as £100,000 intended to complete her will be available during next year, or maybe when the new Naval Scheme of Defence has been settled at Home, it would then be quite time enough to consider the completion of this cruiser. I want to say, with regard to the Adelaide, that I have no sympathy at all with the criticisms of the vessel which have appeared in some of the Melbourne newspapers. A great mouthful is made of the fact that she will cost over £1,000,000. If we were' building the Australia in London today, instead of costing £1,900,000 as she did, a similar boat today would cost well over £4,000,000. The cost of Naval construction has more than doubled at Home. It has only doubled here yet, so far as we are aware. There is, therefore, no reason to gird at the probable cost of the Adelaide, and to talk of costly construction. In my judgment, the construction has not been costly, and I believe it has been efficient. It is time that people stopped decrying, as some are wont to do, everyv thing that we undertake in Australia. We c a n build ships here, I believej as well as they can be constructed anvTmere else. .i",33
107,Mr BOWDEN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,And as cheaply.,33
108,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"And! as cheaply. The Adelaide will not cos one penny more than it would cost to-diy in the Old Country. The explanation, therefore, is very simple. I heard, with the very griatest regret and sorrow, that 1,,600 men had been simultaneously discharged. t did It not know that 1,600 men were going to 1 be turned off at once, and in that respect - somebody is to blame.

126,Mr WATKINS,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Newcastle) [4.41] - I understand that several honourable members desire to discuss this question, and I would therefore ask the Treasurer to move for an extension of the time limit.",35
127,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,I am prepared to agree to the time allotted to the debate being extended until 6.30 p.m.,35
128,Mr SPEAKER,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Is it the pleasure of the House that the time allowed for the discussion of this motion be extended until 6.30 p.m.? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear! ' . Mr WATKINS - The aspect of this question which I .wish to discuss, and which comes within the scope of the motion, is quite distinct from that of, the construction of naval vessels. It relates to the general policy of Government shipbuilding. I do not wish to traverse £?om its very inception the history of the programme which has been mapped out by the Government. Honourable mentbers are well acquainted with the fact that the Isherwood type of vessel has been^built at two places at least in Australia, namely, in Melbourne, and at Walsh Island,- near Newcastle. The Walsh Island dock is State-owned-it is not the property of the Commonwealth. But, immediately the Commonwealth Government ouslined their shipbuilding programme, the Government of New South Wales' expended considerable sums in establishing a proper dockyard, in order that they mighi participate in that programme. Up Jo the present time the Government of that State have expended upon plant and machinery installed on the Island no'less a sum than £500,000. They havj constructed six ships there, which, frcm the point of view of quality, will compare favourably with those built in any' other portion of the world. Admittedly the vovk has been faithfully performed. It was undertaken in the belief that the Commonwealth Government intended to continue its policy of shipbuilding vith a view to thoroughly establishing the industry in Australia. Quite recently orders for the construction of some of these vessels were given to private finds: At Williamstown three ships have already been turned out, whilst at Walsh Islahd half-a-dozen, or thereabouts, have been constructed. But, for some reason 'or other, these private firms have ben obliged to forgo their contracts, so that three ships which were to have been built by private enterprise are now to be built at the dockyard in Melbourne. I mention these facts merely for the pnrposejof showing how wide of the mark is jhe statement made by the Treasurer injteply to a deputation which waited ujon him in connection with this inatter. TJJon that occasion, he said that the whofi of this shipbuilding should be carried-iout by private individuals. He made^hat statement at a time when private (.contractors had failed to carry out th&contracts which had been intrusted toihem by the Government of the day. re-: quest has since been made tha. the Commonwealth. Government should keep f i l t h with the Government of New South the royalty? Wales by allowing the latter to undertake the construction of at least one of these vessels. ]£r. BOWDEN - I saw a statement the other day to the effect that the ships .built in New South Wales were costing more than those built at Williamstown. ¥ r . WATKINS - I have heard that statement contradicted by the men who were engaged in the building of those vessels. I do know thatsome of the ships, which were supposed to have been buili elsewhere for a little less than they coull be built at Walsh Island, have since had to be sent to the latter place for repair). It is idle to consider the expenditure of a pound or two more per ton upon ships if the Tesult of that expenditure is in any way doubtful. In my judgment, the Government are under an obligation to keep going the shipping industry at Walsh Island. Only some two or two and a half years ago a proposal was made by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company for the purchase of that island, with a view to the establishment of the shipbuilding industry there upon its own account. The company intended to proceed immediately with the construction of twelve vessels. At that time, however, so intent was the Prime Minister upon extending his shipbuilding programme and upon hastening ths construction of vessels that, at his request, the New South Wales Government refused to part with the island. Yet, immediately the first contract by the State Government has been concluded, they are told that there is no more work for them tt do, notwithstanding that the Prime Minister himself was instrumental in preventing them from disposing of the island to the company which I have mentimed. Personally, I have favoured the adoption of the Isherwood tyse of ship. 'In the days of keen .compel tion, the royalty which these vessels wil carry so long as the Government owl them will mean all the difference between a profit and a loss. M*. POYNTON - Oh , no. M\ WATKINS - I think it was misttke to adopt the Isherwood type of tions :.vesse. Mi MCWILLIAMS - The memjer does not mean - that the type is sary not a. good one. He merely 'objects to",35
129,Mr WATKINS,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"We cannot build the Isherwood vessels without paying .a royalty upon them.  turned out cheaper than other vessels, even after paying the royalty*",36
130,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Is the type of vessel all right?,36
131,Mr WATKINS,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Any honourable member who will compare the life of an Isherwood ship with that of a cross section ship will recognise the advantages possessed by the latter.,36
132,Mr TUDOR,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Does not the payment of the royalty cease when the Isherwood vessels have been built ?,36
133,Mr WATKINS,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,No .,36
134,Mr TUDOR,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Has the royalty to be paid each year?  upon the tonnage of the vessel only at the time she is built.,36
135,Mr WATKINS,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I was under the im1 pression that it was payable after that. In 'any circumstances, I am opposed to the construction of the Isherwood type of ship because of its disabilities as compared with a vessel'which is constructed in cross sections. I think that the latter is a cheaper proposition in the end. I come now to the proposal of the Government in regard to the building of bigger ships. It has been decided, I understand, to build immediately two of these vessels at Cockatoo. I know that a number of similar ships are being constructed in England.  being built in England; but they have nothing whatever to do with the ships which are to be constructed here.",36
136,Mr WATKINS,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Exactly . The Government scheme is that a certain number shall be built in Australia.  provided for the building of six of these vessels in Australia, and of five in England. It is now proposed to build two here.",36
137,Mr WATKINS,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"The Public Accounts Committee, amongst its other investigations, has inquired into the question of shipbuilding in Australia, and a has made the following recommenda(1) If it is the policy of the Government to honourable remain in this industry, it is absolutely necesthat it shall be'run' on ordinary business lines, free from political interference, and from such official control as is merely officious. Mr., Curchin, - while admitting that he had a comparatively free hand, gave the Committee to understand that, as a Government servant, he found himself hampered and delayed in carrying on his work, and placed at disadvantage' generally compared with his experience in private employment. Williamstown dockyard is under control of the Prime Minister's Department. The control is in many respects only nominal, still it is absurd that an order worth of shipbuilding materials should have - to .be submitted to, and endorsed by, presumably the Prime Minister, but probably by a clerk in the Department. (2) At all the dockyards included in the Government programme there should be a uniform system of accountancy in operation. Annual balance-sheets of the shipbuilding scheme should be submitted to Parliament. I come now to the crux of the Committee's recommendations, which readsWilliamstown dockyard should be enlarged, and the lay-out re-arranged, in order to give the best results. (4) Cockatoo Island dockyard should, in our opinion, be reserved for naval shipbuilding. Naval and mercantile shipbuilding, are two distinct branches for which staffs Save to be trained and maintained separately in the large dockyards of Great Britain, where both kinds of shipbuilding are carried on. In Australia we think it better to separate the two classesof work into different yards, thus enabling the staffs to concentrate on the particular brancli allotted to .it. As Cockatoo was intended primarily as a naval establishment, and has been equipped with that object in view, it seems unwise to add commercial shipbuilding to its activities. The dock might, however, continue to be utilized when 'available for ing merchant vessels. Cockatoo dockyard requires re-organization. There are too many supervisors, and there is too little supervision. There is inuch friction among the staff, and discipline is very lax. (5) The construction of a variety of ships should be avoided. Standardization will reduce cost-and facilitate construction. If tion be unavoidable, then each yard should be kept as much as possible to a particular type. (6) Walsh Island seems best adapted for the construction of large ships.",36
138,Mr MAXWELL,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Where Island ?,37
139,Mr WATKINS,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"It is at a place where more Customs and Excise revenue is collected than is collected in the whole State of Tasmania. It was in conformity with the policy of the Federal Government that this shipyard was established, and the work there has been carried out to the letter and up to date. We have the report of a committee of inquiry showing that it is the best yard at which to construct those large vessels; and all that ie requested now is a share of the work that is going; but that is refused by the' Government, though it would be suffUient to tide the concern over the trouble. First, of all, the State Government was requested not to sell this yard to any private company; but to reservei t for Commonwealth shipbuilding; but when that request is acceded to, the order goes for t h that no more ships are to be constructed for £101 there. That, I really think, amounts to absolute repudiation. Even if this is a State dockyard, the men employed there are just as much Commonwealth taxpayers as any other employees in the State.",37
140,Mr MARR,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Parkes) [5.5] - This is a question which seriously interests myself and other representatives of the metropolitan area of Sydney. Certain allegations have been made, not only in this House, but in the press, and by the publio at large, in reference to Cockatoo Island dockyard, which, if they are true, call for severe censure on the management. It appears to me that it was an ill-advised action to dismiss 1,600 men at five minutes' notice.",37
141,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,That was on the instructions of the Naval Board.,37
142,Mr MARR,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"If there is one way in which revolution can be bred, it is by such action as thab to which I refer. If the management of the dockyards cannot see more than five minutes ahead, and provide sufficient funds to meet current exdock- penditure, it is not worthy of the trust reposed in it , and should be displaced. In my opinion, the dismissals at the dockyard started at the wrong end. I have never met Mr Clark, who, according to report, is a most competent man; but when we come a little further down to the forevaria- men of the various branches we realise the need for close investigation of the methods they employ in carrying out their work.  is Walsh Clark's responsibility?",37
143,Mr MARR,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Whoeve r is responsible for the present position is worthy of censure and dismissal. We hear in Sydney, and throughout Australia generally, most serious statements made in regard to the manner in which the work is carried out at the dock; and a Royal' Com^ mission should be appointed to inquire as to their truth or otherwise. If the allegations, as the result of such inquiry, prove tb be true, then those responsible should be penalized; on the other hand, if the statements''are n if t true, the people who make them should be penalized. These rumours do harm, not only to the dockyard, but to Australia as a whole. Australiau tradesmen compare more than favourably with tradesmen anywhere else in the world; and it has been proved time after time, especially since the commencement of the war, that we can build ships here more cheaply than they can be built in either. the Old Country or America, as a comparison of the cost per ton will show. These rumours, I again urge, ought to be proved or disproved, and punishment meted out to those who deserve it. It was said in this House at the beginning of the session . that there were.men at Cockatoo earning, on an average, £20 per week. ' >  the whole of the work referred to does not amount to £1,000 in the total cost of the ship.",37
144,Mr MARR,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,The statement as to men earning £20 per week was made by a member of the Opposition.,38
145,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,That is not so; it was made by an honourable member on the Government side.,38
146,Mr MARR,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"At any rate, we know that Australiau workmanship can compare with that in any other part of the world; and, that being so, we ought to he patriotic and support those undertakings which employ large numbers of men. By continual criticism of the administration of such works we bring discredit, not only on particular enterprises, but on Australia as a whole. I have heard a man say that he was given a position on the island, but that he walked around for three days without getting any job to do. In such a case the foreman in charge of the gang is surely responsible; on the other hand, if that man's statement is untrue he is not fit to be employed there.",38

The truth or untruth of these rumours should be established, and the responsibility placed upon the proper shoulders.",39
171,Mr WEST,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"East Sydney) [5.15] The remarks of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) are sufficient to indicate to every honourable member that somebody is blame for the discharge of such numbers of men from their employment at CockaGovernment too Dock. Those who know the circummachinery stances of the commercial and industrial life of Australia, are aware that an attempt was made some time ago to bring about a strike of the seamen; but, although the press used its columns very extensively for that purpose, the strike failed to take place. One would almost imagine that the Government had been hand-in-glove with that project, inasmuch as, at the very time that the seamen's strike was to have been brought about, many men were discharged from the vernment workshops at Cockatoo Island, and the labour market was flooded in consequence. Watching closely, as I all these movements, I feel that there no other conclusion that I can come to. At any rate, it is certainly within the realm of reason. Alderman Lambert, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, and his fellow .aldermen, knowing that certain compliquired, cated machinery was required in conmanufacture, nexion with the electrical plant, of the Sydney City Council, heard that it could be made at Cockatoo Dock. They knew shops that there was a shortage of work there, and so alive were they to the possibilities of giving employment to Australian workmen at the dock, that they visited the place to find out for themselves whether is that machinery could be made there. It is to their credit that they made a searching inquiry, and were able to tell their fellow members of the City Council that the dock was in a position to perform this particular work, instead of its being-sent to America. Tenders had been called for it in various parts of the world, and I the lowest came from America; but, fortunately, a good many of the aldermen of the Sydney City Council are good first, and they decided to keep the work, if possible, in Australia to for 'Australian workmen. They tried to ascertain, from the dock authorities the cost of the work; but they did ask for any concession or privileges. They simply asked whether the dock could do this work, which was urgently required to enable the citizens of Sydney and suburbs to obtain electricity for light and power purposes, seeing that the demand in that progressive city had grown so greatly as to far exceed the existing facilito ties. The City Council thought it was within the bounds of possibility that the would permit the necessary to be made at the dock; but, to the surprise of every one, it was intimated indirectly that a gentleman of the name of, I think, Hall, had decided that no persons employed by the Government in these national workshops were to be allowed to do anything to encourage the Sydney Council to have the work done there. I cannot understand why such an intimation should be given to an oflicial connected with the dock; but I am assured that he was told so that he was in no way to encourage those Gowho wanted to carry out a policy which would have been so beneficial in every way to the people of Australia. I should do, like to know why Australia's national is workshops* cannot be given the opportunity to supply the requirements of thp Australian people or of Australian public todies. I am credibly informed that the machinery which the City Council reand which the dock was able to was something in connection with turbines. It is known that turbines cannot be made in all the engineering of Australia; in fact, I do not think one has been turned out in Australia yet.",39
172,Mr RILEY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Yes ; at Cockatoo Dock.,39
173,Mr WEST,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I was about to mention that fact. No turbines have been turned out in Australia except at Cockatoo Dock, where - the Government actually spent money on special machinery to enable them to be. made. That machinery is very complicated, as some of the parts of the turbines are very small, and very nice machinery is required to turn them out. I believe the necessary machinery was installed at Cockatoo, to enable a new turbine to be made for the steamer Loongana, which runs between Australia and Tasmania. So much influence was brought to bear that Australia's national Workshops could' be used for that purpose, but when the Labour Mayor and Labour aldermen of the city of Sydney - and here comes in the crux of the question-wante d similar work to be done at the Cockatoo Dock for the city of Sydney, they were told that they could not avail themselves of the national workshops for the benefit of the people.",39

He must know as well as I do that there is a great dearth of employment in Sydney, and he should know that the Sydney City. Council was prepared to pay the Department whatever price was agreed upon for the performance of the work at the dock. The members of the Sydney City Council are good Australians, and want to provide employment in Australia for our own workmen'. Any Minister who blocks work of that sort should be put to some other job, because he is not fit for the position he holds. The Treasurer has told the House that there has been a bungle over the discharge of the men from Cockatoo. He said that he shares the responsibility so far as the money is concerned, but that he takes no *share in the responsibility for discharging the men, or for the position that has been created. That position was created by those in charge of the Navy Department.",40
182,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,The Naval Board are the people responsible.,40
183,Mr WEST,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Somebody is certainly answerable. . Ever since I have been a member of the House, I have taken up the position that the Minister must be the head of his Department. We have been running to blazes so far as the constitutional carrying on df business is concerned. There may have been some justification during the war for some of the , actions of the Government; but now that the war is over, all those of us who are democrats-and that applies particularly to those who sit on this side of the House - shoul d endeavour to secure a return to true constitutional government, with Ministers held responsible for their actions. If they do things that are not in accordance with the Constitution, or which injure any section of the community, they should be kicked out of office, just as any private employer would disthe charge a man who did not perform his duties properly in his own establishment. That is the ideawhich the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) was partly driving at in the motion which he intended to move today. I only wish he had moved it . I would have seconded it , in order to give the House an opportunity to know something about the financial position, and the conduct of affairs at Oockatoo Island.",40
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Order !,41
185,Mr WEST,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"This matter has a bearing on the finances, because the Treasurer has told the House that money was set apart for the Navy Department",41
186,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,The Treasurer attacked the Naval Board very severely.,41
187,Mr WEST,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I do not know how the Naval Board ever got into its present position of authority. I do not object to a board of management for the Navy Department, but I do object to the Naval Board giving to officers of the Department directions on matters of policy, which should come only from the Minister. A Naval Board may be a good thing, but I strongly protest against its assumption of Ministerial control. I am constantly receiving letters "" By direction of the Naval Board."" To my mind, the direction should come only from the Minister. If, it did, the Minister could be held answerable for it.",41
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Order ! The honourable member has reached his time-limit.,41
189,Mr QROOM,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [5.30] - I desire to make a brief statement in reference to one officer mentioned by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). Against that officer proceedings were instituted in the inferior Court in Sydney. The case was heard, and the officer was committed for trial. The matter was then entirely in the hands of the Crown Law officers, and they, after consideration of the facts in their possession, 'advised that a continuation of the proceedings was not justified. The evidence showed that the material found in the possession of this officer had been purchased by him, and the Crown Law officers advised that the further proceedings should be abandoned. Obviously we had to accept their advice.",41
190,Mr BOWDEN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Does not the Attorneynothing General look into these matters for himI self?,41
191,Mr GROOM,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,The officers of the Atin connection with this charge. torney-General's Department advised that a prosecution could not be successful.,41
192,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,All I have to say is that the officer who was charged is a very lucky individual'.,41
193,Mr GROOM,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Hi s suspension was cancelled, but his services have since been dispensed with. He is no longer in the employment of the Commonwealth Government.",41
194,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Why did you dispense with his services?,41
195,Mr GROOM,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Actio n was taken on the advice of the Direotor of Naval Works, who was revising his staff.",41
196,Mr RILEY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,If there was no case against the officer it. was an injustice to discharge him.,41
197,Mr GROOM,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Independen t of these charges there was a necessity for revising the staff. . Recently we had to take back irto 'the Department a returned soldier. Thus we had more officers than we required, and by a re-arrangement of the staff the services of the officer who had been mentioned were dispensed with. MT. RYAN -.What was the charge against him?",41
198,Mr GROOM,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I have not the papers with me, but the charge involved his being in unlawful possession of certain property of the Commonwealth, The evidence showed that that property was acquired by him by purchase from a branch of the Commonwealth Service.",41
199,Mr RYAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,A Government servant buying material from the Government?,41
200,Mr GROOM,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,That is so.,41
201,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Buyin g in secret I,41
202,Mr GROOM,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"In regard to the charge preferred against him, there was not sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. I think it is only just to the officer to state these facts, which show that the proceedings were properly withdrawn on the advice of the Crown Law authorities.",41
203,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Will the Minister lay on the table the whole of the papers in connection with - the ease?,41
204,Mr GROOM,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"That matter is in the Attorney-General's Department, but I will promise' to look into it . This case is eni tirely a Works Department matter; it has to do with the Navy Department. assure honourable members that there has been no discrimination and no preference It has been treated in a proper manner by the Crown Law officers, who had entire charge of the case, iand advised upon their own responsibility. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN . (Eden Monaro) [5.36] - The Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) is adopting an extraordinary attitude. Serious and definite charges are made against his Department, and, although we are anxious to near the other side of the story, the Minister declines to speak. Mr Laird . SMITH - I will be glad make my statement, but I do not wish to prevent other honourable members from speaking.",41
205,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Will I lose my right of speech if I sit down in Drder to allow the Minister to make his statement now?,42
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD," The honourable member will. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I do not wish to do that, although I am anxious to hear the other side of the story.",42
207,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,I will be only too glad to speak as soon as the opportunity arises. I do not wish to shut out any honourable member.,42
208,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"This matter has been brought before Parliament so frequently that the Minister ought, to be in possession of sufficient information without waiting to hear what other honourable members have to say. I was surprised that the Minister, instead of speaking at once, put up the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) and the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) to speak for him. The Treasurer, in his light aud airy fashion said, "" Shut up the docks."" That is all very well, but what about the thousands of employees who have families dependent upon them? Some of those people have been driven to the doors of starvation. Other people advise us to buy the ships abroad, because, they say, we can buy them cheaper than we can build them locally. What is to become of Australia if we adopt that - policy? What is to become of the iron industry? Are we to send the raw material abroad and buy it back in manufactured form for ten or twelve times as much as we receive for it, as we do with our wool? I hope we shall set our face against any policy of that kind. Where are we to buy the ships-fro m China or Japan? From the figures in our possession we know that we can build ships in Australia as cheaply as they can be built in any other country in the world at the present time. Why, then, should we deny our people the opportunity to work? Is it a fact that although 1,600 workmen were dismissed from Cockatoo Island, the services of nine assistant managers were retained, notwithstanding that it has been suggested by responsible men and the press that there were already too many to managers there, many of whom were imported men, and did not know their job? I know it is difficult to prove some of the allegations which are being made, but will the Minister tell us something about the supposed sale of the Sea Lark, which, it was said, was disposed of for something like £2,500, although at the time there were on board Government stores in excess of that value? Let the Minister tell the House whether it is true that one night, in Sydney Harbor, a motor launch grounded, and that when assistance was taken to the boat many hundreds of pounds worth of Government stores, supposed to have been taken from the Sea Lark, were found on board? I believe that if a Parliamentary Committee went to Cockatoo Dock that statement could be proved. Many months ago I voiced some of the complaints which have been mentioned today, but I could get no redress of any kind. What about the company which is said to have been registered, and of which many of the men connected with Cockatoo Dock are supposed to be members? Last year I called' attention to the fact that the Government were taking work away from the dock and giving it to a private company. My statement was denied, but the Minister cannot now dispute that after'I made my statement that work was returned to Cockatoo Dock. The state of affairs there is scandalous. Of course, people do not make broadcast the charges of which one hears because of the difficulty of proving them. In the interests of the country, as well as of those who have charge of matters at ' Cockatoo Island, the Minister ought to - clear up all these allegations. It is said that £250,000 worth of Government stores have disappeared from Cockatoo Island, and we must have a very peculiar system of control if the accuracy or otherwise of that statement cannot be proved. I know that at Jervis Bay hundreds of pounds of material was missing which was subsequently discovered in the houses of dif ferent people. We ought to know how it got there. The same deal should be meted out to the men in high positions as to the humble individual who has to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. There .ought not to be one law for the rich and another for the poor: Let this House wnd a Committee of In q u i r y to Cockatoo, and within twenty-four hours some of these allegations will be cleared up. personally will undertake to prove something. A star chamber inquiry is being held at Cockatoo now, and evidence is being taken in secret; hut is the evidence that is desired likely to be obtained when the men who .can give it know that their bread and butter is at stake, and that they may be victimized? To my own ""knowledge, which is fair l y extensive, some curious things have been happening at Cockatoo Dock, and the rumours which are abroad ought to be investigated. am astounded that any honourable member should' suggest the closing up of the docks. I am a good Protectionist and a good Australian, and any man who urges that the dock should be .closed, and that we should purchase our ships abroad in stead of giving employment in our own - country, has no right to be in this Parliament, or even in the Commonwealth. If we adopt that policy, what shall we do with our iron works, and where are our primary producers to find a market, or our people to find employment? Is the same; policy to be advocated in connection with everything we produce in Australia-wheat , for instance? causo there is a slump in the price of materials on the other side of the world, are we to buy abroad and throw our own people out. of employment? I hope this House will discountenance that doctrine. I fpnl keenly on this matter. I have no particular interest in Cockatoo Dock, and I will not defame anybody who is employed there; they should get fair play, both managers and men. The Minister, as the responsible head of his Department, is the man to whom we are looking for a satisfactory explanation. I congratulate the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) upon having raised his voice in this House, and for standing up for these men, many of whom are in dire distress. I object to this star chamber committee business. Is it a fact that three gentlemen are over in Sydney now taking evidence in secret?",42
209,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"There .is a departmental inquiry in progress. Mr AUSTIN "" CHAPMAN - Will the Minister promise to lay the evidence on the table of the House?",43
210,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Would the honorI able member promise anything like that without seeing the evidence?,43
211,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Is the Minister going to be the sole judge? If anything is wrong, honourable members of this House ought to know of it . . We are the custodians of the public purse, and we should know if anything is going to be done, and if anybody is going to be shunted or 'prosecuted. Dr MAL6NEY - There should be no smothering up.",43
212,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,I agree I with the honourable member.,43
213,Mr LAIEDSMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,And I can assure the honourable member there will be no smothering up with me. But how can I promise to place on the table something I have not seen ?,43
214,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Will the Minister tell us why this committee is sitting in secret?,43
215,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Because it is a departmental inquiry, and the honourable member knows that departmental in quiriesare frequently instituted in matters of this kind. I was on half-adozen myself before I became a Minister.",43
216,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I say that Be- every member of this House is entitled to know what is going on, even if it is a charge against the humblest workman in the establishment. It is charged against the Cockatoo Island workers that they are going slow. In my opinion, there has been some desperate work done there. On a former occasion, I made a statement in this House that some of the men were getting £ 2 0 and £ 3 0 a week. I do not know whether .they were earning that sum, but they were paid it . Nothing was said about my statement then.",43
217,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Did I not show the honourable member a balance-sheet to prove that it was not so?,43
218,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"The departmental sheet did show that, but I am told that somo contracts were, let, and that some of the men were paid for day labour, so that we - werepaying double. I do not know whether these things are itrue or not, but it is time we got some information, and I can assure the Minister that if he went through the dock himself and questioned half-a-dozen men and gave them an assurance that there would be no victimization, he would get some startling evidence.",43
219,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Why did not the Minister allow us to have a representative of the men on the Board?. We could have helped him if he had done that.,44
220,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I know the Minister is getting into a troublesome position, and I do not blame him, but I say that he will subject himself to blame if he does not take some definite action. It is a very serious thing that there s'hould be any rumour about hundreds of thousands, of pounds worth of material having disappeared.",44
221,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"There are men in gaol in Sydney, big men, too, for that matter. I do not know whether they arefriends of the honourable member or not.",44
222,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"If ^ey got rid of a lot of the Government material, then they ought to be in gaol.",44
223,Mr LADSD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,But the honourable member has been saying that I have not done anything.,44
224,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,I am not saying that at all. I say that the Minister should have given us some information.,44
225,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,How these Nationalists love one another!,44
226,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I am not "" pitching"" into the Minister at all. I am merely saying what I think. I drew attention to this matter last year, and was told then that I ought to mind my own business. It is remarkable that the Minister should now tackle me. Why, does not he rise in his place to answer some of these charges? .",44
227,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,I will do so at once if the honourable member will sit down ,44
228,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I do not want to lose my opportunity of speaking my mind on this thing. I ask him now definitely to inquire and see if there is anything in. this story about the purchase of the Sealarh; if there is anything in the story about the Induna, or anything in the story that a number of people are interested in this shipping company, that has been registered, and is said to be doing work at the dock, and that we have been paying' double-r-contract prices and day labour-for some of the work.' I do not deride any man for getting big wages. It is a good thing if men can earn big money.",44
229,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Denison-Minister for the Navy) [5.47] - I court the fullest inquiry in this House or anywhere else into my administration of the Navy Department, and I know some honourable members here are quite capable of judging because they watch me very closely indeed. I invite them, to say what they think of my . administration. I do not want to misrepresent the' .honourable member who said last year that the Naval ratings were seething with discontent, but I invite the fullest inquiry. Mir'. AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Who said that?",44
230,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I do not know. One honourable member did. All I can say is that if honourable members will inquire, they will find that suchis not the case. Other acts of administration have been carried out by me to the best of my ability. And, after all, how long have I been responsible for one of the biggest Departments in the Commonwealth: eight years, ten years, twenty years? No. I have been in charge for just eight months. I thank the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) for having brought this matter forward, because it gives me the opportunity I looked for in order to say something upon it. I realise my responsibility as a Minister. Unless I had some proof, I would not presume to lay any charge against the humblest man employed in the dockyard, and I am. endeavouring, to the best of my ability, and with the help of the Naval Board-whic h courts the fullest inquiry-to obtain all the information possible in connection with this matter. I do not profess to he an expert-n o Minister can be on everything-and so I must rely upon the advice of the experts in my Department. They have given me most loyal service, which I fully appreciate. The committee that has been appointed is a departmental Committee of Inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining the truth of certain allegations into affairs at the dockyard, and when the complete report is submitted to me, it will be made a subject-matter forCabinet consideration. Certain statements were made some time ago, and, as a result of inquiries, we ascertained that a man in a big firm in Sydney was systematically defrauding the Department. He is in gaol now. Who ptic him there? The Government, who prosecuted him for his crime. That is something.",44
231,Mr MAHOUT,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Where did you get the information upon which you acted?,45
232,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"In much the same manner as I am endeavouring to obtain information now-withi n the Department. The honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) said something about the Sealark that was news to me, and I can assure him that I shall institute an inquiry at once to see whether his statement is correct or not. The honourable member told us he wished to be fair, and so he did not make any definite charges. He referred to a rumour, and I shall be glad to authorize an inquiry to ascertain the facts. I should like now to .say a few words with reference to the statement made by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) about tenders for electroturbines. I understand that these turbines have been designed for the generation of power for the city of Sydney, and I have been credibly informed that today a firm is completing tenders, to the value of about £200,000, for the construction of the same sort of machinery, although the honourable member says it cannot be made in Australia. I am speaking subject to correction, but I remember reading a statement that the work can be done in Sydney.",45
233,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Where ?,45
234,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,I do not know.,45
235,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,No r does anybody else.,45
236,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Not long ago I saw a Sydney company's prospectus, which stated that they were going to do this work. Cockatoo Island"" dock is a shipbuilding establishment constructed for that particular purpose, and the construction of electro-turbines, I understand, requires a certain number of highly skilled men but very few unskilled workmen. In [292] addition, certain patent rights are owned by a certain company, and I believe it would be very difficult indeed to get thefn for Cockatoo Island dock. I have also been informed that it would take nine months at least to equip the establishment for this special machinery. Fancy installing machinery for this special work with all the overhead charges, and then using it only once. Would that be sound business ? Now, with reference to the discharge of the men. I am glad that no honourable member holds me personally responsible, because no one regrets more than I do that the men had to go out. I am endeavouring to find out who was responsible for that. The committee of inquiry is assisting me to do so. I have not in my possession at the present time sumcient information to make a direct charge against the General Manager.",45
237,Mr RYAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Does the Minister believe that the committee of inquiry will find out who was responsible?,45
238,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I hope that they will do so, because some one is responsible. Had the instructions of the Naval Board as issued from Melbourne been carried out this would never have happened.",45
239,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Can - the Minister produce those instructions ?,45
240,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Fro m 6th July, 1920, until the 7th December, 1920, from 408 to 865 men were employed on naval construction, but as other work, such aa the re-conditioning of transports and building-of other ships, ceased, the General Manager, instead of discharging-the men engaged on that class of work, put them on the construction of the Adelaide, with the result that we find that the number of men engaged on naval construction increased from 40S men on 6th July, 1920, to the numbers as follow:4th January, 1921 ., 1,088 11th January, 1921 .. 960 18th January, 1921 .. .. 1,029 25th January, 1921 .. .. 1,001 1st February, 1921 .. .. 1,081 8th February, 1921 .. .. 1,059 15th February, 1921 .. .. 1,211 22nd February, 1921 .. .. 1,239 1st March, 1921 , .. 1,272 8th March, 1921 .. 1,330 This increase took place notwithstanding that the attention of the General Manager had been drawn to the fact that the rate of expenditure had risen to such an extent that the amount allotted for new naval construction would be exceeded before the end of the financial year. This is disclosed by the following minute:At the monthly review of expenditure on Cockatoo Island .it was found by the Naval Board in January, 1921, .that the rate of expenditure had risen to an extent which would result in the amount allotted to new naval construction being exceeded before the end of the financial year. The general manager's attention was at once called to this fact, but, notwithstanding this, the. high rate of expenditure was not only maintained, but actually increased, and. the funds becoming, exhausted, it eventually became necessary for the Naval Board to take drastic action and order a cessation of work on the two vessels concerned-the Adelaide and the Moonbah. In ithe face of the instruction from the Naval Board, and with the knowledge that the money was not available, some one is responsible for permitting this to continue. I am endeavouring to find out who that some one is.",45
241,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Did not- the Nava l Board tell the General Manager how much money was allotted?,46
242,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,The General Manager is advised through his accountant as to how much money is available each month. The Finance Member of the Naval Board informs me that that advice is given.,46
243,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Does the General Manager forward to you quarterly or monthly reports upon the progress of the work ? Mr Laird . SMITH - At m y request all Departments furnish me with quarterly reports of work in progress. In fact, i m mediately I took charge of the Department, I expressed the desire to be informed as to how things were going on, and as to the financial condition of all the branches. To this end I said that I would like to have statements furnished periodically. Those statements have to be furnished to me.",46
244,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,So that you would be apprised of everything that was going on ?,46
245,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Yes , provided that I had been so apprised; but I was not advised of this matter, nor was the 'Naval Board.",46
246,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,But you have just admitted that you were apprised.,46
247,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Not at all. The honourable member is known as a reasonable man, and it is useless for him to attempt to twist my meaning. It would neither do him any good nor do me any harm, because I cannot be held personally responsible, seeing that I have done everything that any one would ex-' pect of a Minister in charge of a Department. For that reason I court' the fullest inquiry. When a Minister gives an order; and it is transmitted to the proper quarter, where it is supposed to be carried out, can he be held responsible if it is not carried out, so long as he brings all concerned to task immediately he hears that it has not been carried out ? That is the course I intend to follow, and as soon as I can ascertain who is responsible for the present state of affairs at Cockatoo Island, he will be made to suffer as he deserves to suffer. I . do not think any member would expect me t.o undertake the task of watching every man working in every branch of a great public Department. How could I do so? A system has been laid down which I shall endeavour to work to the best of my ability. I have not been absent from my. office one day, except when in other States on departmental business. I have worked holidays and Sundays. The control of coal supplies was added to my responsibilities, giving me a great deal more work to do than I anticipated, and people of all classes have thanked me personally for the manner in which the task was undertaken. Could it be of any avail or in terest to me to condone any fault?",46
248,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"In January last, when you found that the money was running short, did you not get into touch with the Treasury officials?",46
249,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I did not find it out in January; I wish I had done so. But as soon as I discovered that the money was running short, I made an endeavour to ascertain whether I could get hold of any somewhere else in my Department for this purpose.",46
250,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Di dyou not consult the Treasurer?,46
251,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I am not in a court of law. The Treasurer has told' the House all the facts of the case. That is why I welcomed his speaking today from the Treasury point of view. I have nothing to hide, and - nothing to fear. I am pleased that the honourable memner ber for Parkes (Mr Marr) has mentioned a most important subject, the emI ployment of returned soldiers. My aim since I have been in the Department been to. employ a returned soldier time. I have had the opportunity to so. One of the finest men it is possible to get in the service today is working in the Department in close association with me. He did splendid work at the Front, where he was wounded, and now he is doing good work here. The same principle is followed right throughout Department. Extension of time granted. The honourable member for Grey (Mr. Poynton) will probably take over the control of shipbuilding, and have charge of Cockatoo Island in the near future, but I shall confer with him, and see what we can do for the men who have returned of troopships. from war service maimed. Honourable members can rest assured that we will do our best for them. I shall also see if it money? is possible to do amy thing for these returned men at Garden Island, because I realise we are under an obligation them.",46
252,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,What about the men who have been injured in the course of their work at the island?,47
253,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Yes ; that is also a question which needs looking into.,47
254,Mr MAHONY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"What about sacking the "" scabs "" and putting the soldiers these other men in their place?",47

Since I have been in charge of the Department, I have made it a nrnotice to know no one in it dually, but. just to look at matters are submitted to me, and then give decision as to the man who is to be ployed. I regret it if I have spoken at great length on this important question; - but, as the' honourable member for Edenhave Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) has said, it requires sifting to the very bedrock, and this will be done so far as I am cerned.

256,Mr ALLEY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"South Sydney) [6.10] I also desire to protest against the manin which the men at Cockatoo Island were discharged; but, at the same time, would like to point out that, at the moment of their dismissal, there appeared has in the press an announcement that the every cruiser Adelaide had cost nearly do £1,000,000, and had been on the stocks for several years, the insinuation being that the responsibility for this rested upon the men. In fact, it was hinted that this was the reason for the stopping of work.",47
257,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,The Department the did not give that reason.,47
258,Mr EILEY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I am not saying so. The true facts are that the cruiser Adelaide was under construction during the war, and because it was seen that it could be of no assistance during the war, it was placed alongside a wharf at the docks, and work was concentrated on the fitting Work was entirely suspended on the Adelaide.",47
259,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,But did she cost the,47
260,Mr EILEY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I shall explain the posito tion. As the war proceeded, the Navy found out the weaknesses of different classes of ships, and many weaknesses were found in cruisers of the Adelaide type. As a consequence, many things which had been completed on the Adelaide bad to be altered, and very often when the alterations were effected the Naval Board would come along and say, "" That and will not do; this has to be altered."" As a consequence, they have kept on altering the Adelaide from time to time, and, of course, naturally the cost of construction",47
261,Dr MALONEY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"All the time the over-, head charges went on.",47
262,Mr EILEY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"That is so. I have given indivinotice of a question as to how many as they alterations have been made oa this my cruiser; what they have cost; and the emnecessity for them; and when that information is secured, it will be seen that it is not the men working on the Adelaide who been to blame, but that the continuous alterations were solely responsible for the additional cost. Time after contime, when certain portions of the work had been completed, they were altered. To-day it is almost a new ship, as distinct from the.original design. Sometimes after an alteration has been made the original design has been Teverted to. When we find a Naval Board so incompetent as to keep on was'ing the people's money in this way, there is ample justification for this House to condemn their actions and see that in future they do not interfere with a vessel's design, will allow it to be completed, and thus give the workmen a fair chance. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) has made a statement that information was laid by constables against a high official on Cockatoo Island, upon which a prosecution in an inferior Court took place, and that, despite the fact that certain material from the island had been found in this official's back yard, which evidence, when placed before the lower Court,, caused his committal for trial, there was no prosecution in a higher Court.",47
263,Mr BOWDEN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,He produced the departmental receipt for the material.,48
264,Mr RILEY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,That is all moonshine. The Department has no right to sell to an officer. It is all camouflage to say .that he got a receipt. Why did he not produce it in the lower Count? If he had done so he would not have been committed for trial.,48
265,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"If he was able to produce a genuine receipt, why did he not proceed against the Government?",48
266,Mr RILEY,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Quite so, and why did they not re-employ him? It is all very "" fis!hy."" The Minister will have to make a very different statement to this House to .induce it to believe otherwise. Another man, who was discovered taking away a little bit of wood in his basket, was charged with stealing the wood, committed for trial, found guilty, and dismissed. I do not wish to say anything to prejudice the employment of these men again, but if the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) could 'get together with the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), I am sure they could be re-employed in another week or two. Owing to the high cost of living the workers at the island could only live from week to week, and now they are out of employment while steel plates are ready to be assembled for the building of large ships at..the island. Apart from any criticism, today I appeal to the Minister to look at the matter from a humanitarian point of view, and to see if these men cannot be started again. It is unfair to blame the men for the overhead charges, or for the expense incurred in connection with alterations. There are too many highlybut paid inspectors and officials; and surely the men cannot be held responsible for the outlay incurred in that direction. The officers and men are there to do their work, and if they do not perform it satisfactorily their services should not be retained. I trust the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) and the Minister for the Navy. (Mr Laird Smith) will earnestly consider the advisableness of reinstating the men next week, so that the Adelaide may not be allowed to remain in her present unpainted condition, as she is an eyesore to thousands of people who cross the Harbor daily, and is a reflection upon the Commonwealth Parliament, the Government, and the workmen. I ask the Government to complete the work- I believe the vessel is now up to date-and thus prepare for the construction of the larger ships, as that will be the means of absorbing a large number of men who are at present unemployed. I trust the Treasurer will endeavour to find sufficient money to keep the men engaged until the Estimates for the next financial year are passed.",48
267,Mr BOWDEN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"Nepean) [6.17] - The information that has been given to the House by Ministers this afternoon shows that there has been sufficient ground for a searching inquiry into the administration at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. In the first instance, there appears to have been no justification for 1,500 men being thrown on an already glutted labour market in Sydney without the slightest notice or warning, and it seems that this action has been taken in an endeavour to show a spiteful attitude towards the Treasurer because he said he would not find any more money. Whoever is responsible ought to be made to pay very dearly for his action. We have been informed that a departmental inquiry is being held to ascertain who is really responsible for the present state of affairs; and that the Board of In quiry includes a representative of the Naval Board, who,, naturally, will not say that the Board which he represents is open to censure. The Department of the Treasury is also represented, and it is not likely that the officer from . that Department will blame the Treasury. There is also a member representing the Ship Construction Branch, and he will not hold - his Department or Minister responsible. In these circumstances, it seems very unlikely that the blame will be placed on the right shoulders/ We are endeavouring to establish the shipbuilding industry in Australia, and, in doing so, are meeting with opposition from one of the greatest combines in the'World. Lord Inchcape and his followers are only too . ready to scathingly criticise the Commonwealth shipbuilding policy, and naturally the position which has recently been created will be given great publicity, not only in our own newspapers, but in others circulated in other parts of the world. Circumstances such as these will do more damage to Australia than many others that might be mentioned. The fact that £75,000 which ought to have been expended between March' and June was disbursed before February by some one, apparently without the knowledge of the Treasurer-becaus e the Treasurer said that his account showed a credit of £75,000-surel y needs some explanation.",48
268,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,I still have it there.,49
269,Mr BOWDEN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"The credit still remains, and apparently some one in another Department has spent it. There must be something wrong if vouchers covering the expenditure have not been submitted to ithe Department. There is in this fact striking evidence of mismanagement, as some one has apparently spent a large sum of money without the Minister's knowledge. I could not quite understand the statement of the Minister for the Navy (Mr-. Laird Smith) when, in reading from a document, he said that in January the Manager was informed that, if he went on spending at - the present rate, the vote would .'be exceeded before the due date. The Minister at the same - time said he did not know the vote had been exceeded until he was informed that the money had been spent. There has been mismanagement, and the result is that the persons who have paid the penalty have not been those who were responsible. The officers are still employed; but 1,500 men who, as we know, live practically from week to week, are out of work and have to bear the consequence of same one else's blunder. If ever there was an occasion for a searching inquiry it is in connection with the administration of Cockatoo Island Dockyard. It has been stated that some men have been earning £20 per week, and, if that is so, all power to them; but they were on piece-work and would have to i. am the money, otherwise it would not be paid to them. The statements of the two Ministers concerning the allegations which have been made are very unsatisfactory, and the whole question seems to be surrounded with an atmosphere of uncertainty, which makes it ""appear that an attempt is being made to smother up something. The least we can do is-to have an investigation which will be satisfactory to this House, instead of a star-chamber inquiry by a few Government oflicials.

The fact that there has been such an embroglio in connection with this matter, and that 1,600 men have suddenly been thrown out of work, certainly, needs some explanation. It is incredible to think that the money* available for these works in the current financial year has been exhausted without the Department being aware of it. It is inexcusable in the light of the fact that two years ago the Economy Commission, in conducting its investigations, directed special attention to the conduct of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The report of that Commission statesEvidence supplied by highly placed and reliable officers indicates that in many branches no attempt whatever is made to check unnecessary expenditure and extravagance. There is no administrative control, and no one. considers the question of cost. The Sydney Morning' Herald, .comof menting on the position, continuesA statement in regard to the Stores Branch showed that stock-taking took place on June, 1916, hut the stock-sheets showing the result only left the dock in March, 1919. showed deficits amounting to £52,SS6, and surpluses of £42,807, making a net deficit £10,079 on a .total stock of £117,071. It was Works and Railways (Mr 'Groom). advisable that the construction of the laide should be reviewed, as, with the ships received from Great Britain, the Commonwealth would have more vessels than would require. That is exactly what has curred. Our Fleet is too expensive to keep in commission, so at present a big portion of it .has been placed on the reserve. In the light of the Commission's report more than usual care and supervision should have been exercised concerning what was actually taking place. On this occasion there seems to have been less than usual. In view of the conditions, existing at the Cockatoo Island dockyard, it is ther discussed. quite conceivable that something similar may transpire at any moment in any other public Department. It is particularly regrettable at a time like the present, when money is so difficult to obtain, and when productive undertakings are hampered owing to the absence of capital, that we should have proceeded with construction of the Adelaide, understand, already obsolete. We should, two years ago, have devoted attention to more productive works and thus ceeded in some more gradual method finding employment for these men.",49
271,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,Who said that Adelaide was obsolete?,50
272,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"It has been quently stated. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) said the great cost wasilargely due to the that the Department was constantly re-employment. placing obsolete portions of the ship.

Mahony) and of other honourable members..

I do not propose to reiterate the facts as given by the honourable member for Dalley and other honourable members, but I desire to make a few remarks in criticism of the attitude of the Treasurer and his colleagues. I wish at this moment to thank the honourable member for 'Cowper (Dr Earle Page) for having moved for an extension of time to permit this important matter to be furIndeed, it is of such importance that it deserves an even longer period for debate than has been allotted. While thanking the honourable member, I desire to take the opportunity to offer m y personal congratulations upon - the honour which has been conferred on the him by the members of the party to which is, we which he belongs. At a time when there is a tremendous proamount of unemployment in Sydney, of 1,600 or more men are suddenly thrown idle through what is admitted to have been a bungle; and the public naturally the places blame and responsibility on the shoulders of the Government. E m freployees at Cockatoo Island have been rendered idle practically without notice, that and without any provision having been fact made to absorb them in other avenues of One would have thought, t at any rate, that if it were deemed neceswe sary to dispense with the services of so men, engaged as they were in work n of such importance, requisite steps would have been taken by the Government to see that those who were discharged were absorbed in other work. However, the overGovernment appear to have made no effort to fulfil that obvious duty. The Treasurer says that some one has blundered, but that be is not that person. He states that Parliament voted a certain amount of money, and that that vote having been expended, it was impossible to continue work. I do not agree that the Treasurer is takiug up a proper attitude. He says he is not entitled to spend more money than has been authorized by Parliament. Parliament, when it passes an appropriation, does so on the basis of a message from the Governor General. That message is the outcome of advice tendered by His Excellency's Ministers; and I suppose that in the particular matter of the allocation of moneys such advice usually comes from the Treasurer himself. It is quite possible that the right honourable, gentleman 'underestimated what was a proper amount of expenditure for the Department involved in the matter under debate. After all, it was only an estimate, and it was an estimate which this House had not the power to increase. Consequently, the responsibility-almos t the sole responsibilityfor the fact of the amount not being greater lies with the Treasurer himself. It may be that the amount recommended was too small. At all events, the sum was expended long before the financial year had ended. Assuming that a sufficient amount was asked for by and granted to the Treasurer, that Minister is. responsible in that he has not kept proper supervision over the expenditure of the different Departments. It is quite new to me to learn that some particular officer can spend the whole of a vote long before the financial year has ended, and that the first thing a responsible Minister may know of the matter is that the money is all gone and a large number of men have had to be thrown out of employment. One would expect that either the Treasurer himself or the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) would have some system by which a report would be tendered, say, monthly, to the Minister direct, as to the progress of expenditure in relation to particular votes. The responsibility, to my mind, rests upon the Treasurer in the first place, either in that in the original estimate he did not calculate what was a proper amount to be allocated, and thus made hie estimate too low, or that, having made his estimate on a proper 'footing, he did not insure adequate supervision by way of obtaining progress reports upon the expenditure of the amount in question. There should be some system.",50
275,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,There is a system.,51
276,Mr RYAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,To whom do the reports come?,51
277,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,My responsibility is discharged when I issue warrants at stated periods for certain amounts; the warrant passes from me to the Minister in charge of the Department concerned. I cannot follow these votes through all the ramifications of the public Departments in Australia.,51
278,Mr RYAN,DISMISSALS FROM COCKATOO DOCKYARD,"I am speaking with some experience of administration when I say that the expenditure of particular Departments should be reviewed, for example, monthly. There should be some Minister directly responsible to this House who knows ""the progress rate of expenditure in connection with large votes in various Departments ; and the situation should never arise in whichi t could be suddenly made known, in January or February of a financial year, that the whole of the year's vote had been expended, and a great industry dislocated, so that large numbers of men arc thrown upon an already glutted labour market. It should not be possible for that kind of thing to happen without some responsible Minister knowing what is coming. If it can happen, however, there is something wrong; and it is for this Parliament to see that a system of administration is adopted which will enable the Treasurer, or the Prime Minister, or the responsible Minister-whoeve r he may be-to keep his hand upon the pulse of things and know, roughly at all events, the progress rate of expenditure on any and every particular vote. But because such a system has not been adopted and practised by the Government, this position has arisen, and honourable members have to listen to occupants of the front Treasury bench informing the House that they know nothing, about the , matter, but that some one has blundered. We have to listen to them saying, """"We knew nothing at all until we read about it in the papers, and until we found great unemployment and suffering among the women and children in Sydney."" And yet, all that is to be done is to institute an inquiry to ascertain who is responsible. ""Weeks hare passed, and no Minister can tell us today how this trouble, came about. At the same time 60me secret investigation is going on. Who are the investigators ? What is the tribuna l which has been set up to decide on whose shoulders the responsibility rests ? As far as Parliament is concerned it rests on the shoulders of one or other of the three or four Ministers.

The Minister for the Navy not (Mr Laird.

If that system had heen observed, this unfortunate mistake should not have been made. It should not be difficult to cover who is responsible for the blunder that has occurred. Then it is alleged that material of a value running into very big figures is missing. With a proper system, such as is observed in every well-ordered business concern, that would be impossible. If the stores were properly controlled and issued, and, when issued, followed to their ultimate use, it could be seen at a glance whether an issue had been applied to the particular purpose for which it was"" intended, and there would be a check against loss or misappropriation. We were promised a proper costing system, and I should like the Minister to say whether sueh a system has been provided for. If it has not, I canuot understand the reason, nor can I understand how honourable members who have condemned this enterprise root and branch, now say that we can build ships as economically as they can be built elsewhere. We have been promised by Ministers half-ylearly reports Government industrial enterprises. I hope that the Minister for .Shipbuilding  half-yearly report, so that we may know just where we stand. It has .been claimed that shipbuilding has been a success during the past few years. We cannot form a proper opinion from the experience of abnormal times. Minister has submitted reports and comparative statements, but I should like to have up-to-date information, because the country is being committed to an expenditure of many millions, and we should know where the money is going and - whether we are getting 20s. of value for every £1 spent. This is not a party question. All honourable members should insist on proper and adequate returns at Tegular and short intervals. The Government should know each month what the progress df a work is, what the expenditure has been, and whether estimates are being exceeded. Without this close application we shall need to review the whole question again. I understand the G-overnment to say that the investigation into these matters will Mr Eiehard Foster. be thorough, complete, and impartial. There is a departmental inquiry at present being conducted, but I take it that dis- it is simply a preliminary inquiry to advise the Minister. I hoped that, without the intervention of this House, the Minister would have ordered a searching and independent inquiry. I await an assurance on the point, because I am watching public expenditure in this direction very keenly indeed. I know something about it, and I say, that this House should scrutinize continuously all these industrial enterprises carried on by the G-overnment. Let me say that I hope that the Government will keep politics out of them. If a Government enterprise can succeed as well as an outside independent enterprise, and it rarely does, it can only be when politics in every sense""are rigidly excluded from its operation. As soon as politics get in we have want' of discipline, chaos, and confusion, and it is rubbish to tell the world that, under such conditions, a Government can do the work as well as outside enterprise, where the best brains and the be3t experience that money can buy are applied to the management. upou Question resolved in the negative.

It would be a misnomer to c 11 It is the simplest and shortest cut to 'the supply of money to the exchequer. No one can soundly reason a that the imposition of additional protecthe tive duties was necessary. This Tariff certainly bas had the effect of increasing cost of living - to the whole - of the people of Australia, and it is unnecessary of now .that the war is over, since the war itself (has given the industries of Australia an immensely increased measure of iprotecO.ther conn/tries (which before the war had'extremely i cheap labour.no longer have cheap.labour. Wages in other countries have increased to such an extent as afford us a very 'great deal .of .protecti: n. .Increased freights to this country a.\*o constitute a big measure of protection, and the great increase in the price of coal in other lands is an immense protection to Australian manufacturers. Surely it will be a-.lnEHted ihat in these several respects considerable and ample protection is given to our manufacturers. Tho putting of a Tariff of this kind on the key industries of Australia is having the effect of strangling more important ones. Euclid has taught us, among many useful principles, that the whole is greater than its part. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) since the imposition of this Tariff has had to recognise that fact in detail, and I sub- mit that it applies all round. The honourable gentleman doubtless on appeal will be prepared - to remove the duties on certain tools which are not made in Australia, and which are necessary to the manufacture of a greater instrument or piece of machinery such as an engine, which is more important than is the local manufacture of the tools necessary for its construction. In the interests of the greater he will be prepared to sacrifice to some extent the lesser. If the establishment of an industry here is being prevented by reason of the heavy duty imposed upon the machinery necessary to that industry he should be ready to remit that duty. The Minister has really conceded my point as shown by his practice and actions in respect of such matters. It will be admitted that the greatest of all Australian industries-a n industry which accounts for 76 per cent, of the wealth of Australia -^must be regarded from the aspect of the whole. Anything that would materially retard the progress of that whole is prejudicial to the interests of Australia. This loads me to the point that the Tariff which before the imposition of these duties was excessive is today absolutely burdensome to the primary producer. It cannot be gainsaid that the primary production of Australia is the greatest asset which the country possesses. It is the only source from which new money may be obtained, to give stability to our national credit, and we cannot afford, therefore, to disregard its importance. We cannot shut our eyes to anything which is calculated to'hinder the increase of 'our national wealth simply because our national responsibilities are increasing. But the effect of this new Tariff will be to inflict a further blow to the primary producer and generally to retard the progress of primary production in Australia. Of course, I know the cry which is always raised in regard to dumping. But, dumping or no dumping, the fact remains that a binder which was quoted at £80. last year is quoted at £120 this year. It is very difficult to persuade the primary producer that.he ought to pay the £40 increase which is there represented, especially as £S0 was easily double the price which he was called upon to pay for the same implement fifteen years ago. Nevertheless, by reason of the operation of the proposed new Tariff, the price of a binder has been increased by £40.  the duty which is payable upon binders.  sented by the seller.",56
316,Mr JAMES PAGE,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,Mothe r Hubbard I  ment will seem amusing to some honourable members-',57
317,Mr JAMES PAGE,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"The honourable member is not now talking to farmers, but to men who understand the matter.  may be. the fact remains that today the farmer is compelled to pay for his binder £40 more than he paid previously, and that there is no way in which he can pass on this extra charge. We expect our primary producers to purchase costly made Australian machinery, and in this connection I was very pleased to hear-the statement made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) this afternoon. We are frequently told that no man is a good Australian who does noi purchase Australian-made goods. But I cannot help remarking that quite a number of people'who claim to be good Australians, object to paying a reasonable price for Australian-grown wheat. Seeing that our primary producers are obliged to labour for seventy or eighty hours per week, whilst the employees in our cities and those who are engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements work only forty-four hours per week, the deal, I contend, is not a square one. I observe, too, that the press is seriously perturbed in regard to certain sales of Australian wheat which ""have been made overseas. Whilst I was with the Deputy Comptrolquantity ler-General of Customs in Western Aussumption tralia the other day, a most remarkable incident occurred. A certain - merchant, who was present, said to me: "" Mr Prowse, I should like to ask the Deputy Comptroller why there is an export duty upon flour."" I replied, "" If you do you will ask a very foolish question, cause there is no export duty upon flour."" Thereupon he said, "" I know a damned sight better."" I answered, "" Then you better ask your question."" He did so, and the Deputy Comptroller-General, after looking rather thoughtful, replied, there is no export duty upon flour. Would you mind explaining what you mean?"" The merchant then said, "" Well, only the other day a ship's captain, who comes here, ordered 10 tons of flour. As soon be carried out? as he arrived at the wharf he was told that the flour had been kept for him."" "" Oh, thank you,"" he said. ""What is the price?"" He was told that the price was £18 per ton for the wheat and £16 ton premium, making a total of £34 ton.",57
318,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"He must have got into the Wheat Pool.  ber got into the Wheat Pool. The Deputy Comptroller of Customs was quite in the dark as to how such a thing could have occurred, but in a flash the explanation came to me. That explanation was that in February of the previous year the presentatives of the various States, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), "" ups conferred with the Australian Wheat Board, and notwithstanding that the value of wheat at the time was tailor-when 8s. 3d. per bushel, they entered into an arrangement under which wheat turn for Australian consumption was to be sold at 73. Sd. per bushel. That was the cession which was made by one class to other classes of the community. Immedesire diately afterwards the price of wheat rose to nearly double that specified in the tract. Eor local consumption flour was thus sold upon the basis of 7s. 8d. per bushel for wheat, or £18 per ton, whilst the price outside Australia was £34. farmers thus made a concession to Australian consumers of £16 per ton. Late year that contract ended. The States representatives were called together to confer with the Prime Minister as to the how of wheat needed for local confor the ensuing year. It was computed that the quantity needed would be something in the region of 30,000,000 . bushels, and they asked the Wheat Board again at what price they' could supply 30,000,000 or 33,000,000 bushels. Just a so few days prior, the Board had sold somehethink like 300,000 tons f.o.b. in Australia at 10s. 6d. per bushel; but, as this was a decent order, their quohad tation Avas below' the market price-9s . a bushel. It was a concession at the "" But time; nobody knew any more than was known in the previous year whether wheat would rise or fall. Can any honourable member who is a sport, or professes to be straight, say that the contract should not Mr CirAKLTOsr - That same principle applies to other things, not only to wheat.  ciple of the integrity of agreements - vvill a always apply.. The fact is that some per £13,000,000 has been conceded to the consumers of Australia by the producers. With regard to the second 9 . deal, there S has been a .certain fall, checked somewhat the fall in freights; but, after all, if I understand rightly, it was intimated by the Prime Minister today that, if the balance of the wheat was sold at 7s. 6d. now, the average price of the whole of Australia's wheat, with the local consumpretion thrown in, would be in the region of with 8s. 6d. Are the consumers to take the "" and not the "" downs "" in the deals ? I have not been in the habit, after buying a suit of clothes, of returning it to"" the it becomes half worn; nor is it possible for me to buy a horse and rei t to the seller if it gets a nail in its foot. In both contracts, taken together, conthe advantage must be in favour of the all consumer. If the consumers of Australia to review the matter, and are willing to review last year's contract, and give conus the market price for what they had from us under the last contract, I venture to think the Wheat Board, on behalf of the growers, would agree and give the difThe ference on the present year's deal.",58
319,Mr WEST,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Wit h what paragraph in last the Tariff are you dealing?  these matters affect Australia very seriously. We have fearful congestion of population in consequence of the centralization policy in Australia. Nearly the whole of this sitting has heen taken up in considering the case of men who are out of employment in another State. Loss of employment, is a serious thing, hut we ought not to continue the spoon-feeding of one section of the community-w e should not artificially huild up, hy means of the Tariff, factories in the centralized portions of Australia, which is naturally a primary producing country; for if we do we shall simply "" k ill the goose that lays the golden egg."" After all, Australia, for the greater part, is manufacturing for those people who are primary producers; and if we make it impossible for the primary producers to compete with other parts of the world by increasing the cost of their machinery they will have to cease producing, and where then, I ask, will the manufacturer find himself?",58
320,Sir ROBEIIT BEST,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"And contributing to the*cost of wheat silos!  are not calculated or intended to help one in debate. The farmers owe the Commonwealth nothing, but the Commonwealth owes the farmers practically everything, as we will begin to discover as soon as the farmers are squeezed out. If we are going to put loads on the backs and shackles on the feet of the primary producers, how are they to compete with other countries ? Under such circumstances the primary producers must come to the cities, which offer more attractions than the producing centres. Amongst the attractions are the limited hours of work, and the organization of employees and capitalists, who both cry out for cheap butter, cheap meat, and cheap wheat. The man on the land has to work from sixty to eighty hours a week; and is then asked to supply his produce at a cheaper price than it can be obtained, even, under tender, from any part of the world. This is not a square deal-it is not fair-and the time is coming when the levelling up must take place. It is the ""maggot in the cheese"" business; but the day is coming. We have only to look at statistics to see that the effect of Australian legislation, so far, has been to make the cities so attractive that not only has the whole increase in the population during the last twenty years gone into the cities, but people are actually drawn there from the country. It is evident that there is something wanting in the attractiveness of the country life. Can any honourable member, whether he be from the city or the country, say for one moment that it is not in the interests of Australia that the whole of the country's natural resources should be developed in order to create the wealth necessary to meet our national obligations?",59
321,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Why do not the farmers co-operate and manufacture their own machinery ?  confronted with the industrial organizations' demand for a forty-four hour week, although they themselves are expected to work eighty hours, and give the artisans cheaper food than can be obtained from Argentine or India. Countries like Canada and America are making the country more attractive by removing Tariff imposts from agricultural industries, because it has been seen that unless something of the kind is done, the people find their way into New York and other large cities. The future Qf Australia depends on the development of her soil; and, to again quote Sir Rider Haggard, prosperity will follow the feet that tread the. fields, rather; than those that trip along the pavements. If other countries have been able to encourage immigration by the attractiveness of their land policy, Australia should be able to do the same. The other day one honourable member told me that he knew of a million acres of excellent land available in his own State. I know of another million odd acres in another State, all ,good land; but it seems to me that with the power centralized in the various capitals of Australia, we are going round in a vicious circle, and no encouragement is given to people' to occupy these spaces. The people in the cities seem to think they are the only pebbles on the beach, that they can pay the national debt if only they can cut down the other fellow a little bit, and so long as the rural producer can afford, by working eighty hours a week, to buy from them. You cannot get over the Tariff wall which this Government is seeking now to build up, and look elsewhere for your trade, because you will then find yourself in competition with the producers of other parts of the world. In hitting the primary producer, you are killing your only customer. You should facilitate his operations and allow him to get ahead of you a hit if you expect to continue trade with him on legitimate lines. You should give him a fair deal because he is a brother of yours, and you should not expect to feed upon him.",59
322,Mr RYAN,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"We do not expect to do that.  Australia is doing. The leading papers of this city today are battling to get wheat from the small, as well as the big, farmer in order to provide cheap bread for people. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was quite right, in his statement the other . day in connection with the proposed reduction of the 9s. guarantee for wheat. "" The States,"" he said, ""can do that if they like, because the wheat is theirs."" It is all very fine to say that with the other fellow's property. You cut it down last year and saved £,11,000,000 on the transaction. It is yours now, this 30,000,000 bushels, and if you like to provide cheaper bread cut down the price. All I can say is that it is not going to be done at ,the sole expense of the producers. It was done last year; but now, if the producers are to get a fair deal, it must be done at the national expense.",60
323,Mr CONSIDINE,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Is that how you tried to get square, by cutting down your salary f  own, I deal with it as I wish. I do not like to cut down the other man's property. I intend to defend my own, and in my judgment this is the right place to do it now. I like people to honour contracts or agreements in any and every case.",60
324,Mr RYAN,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Did I understand the honourable member to say that it is a fair thing to reduce the price of wheat, so period. long as the State bears the expense ?  thing of the kind.",60
325,Mr RYAN,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"That i j what I understood the honourable member to say.  ber for West Sydney would like my view to be stated more clearly, I would point to the statesman-like attitude of the British Government in similar circumstances. They recognised that the agriculturist was entitled to get the market price for his wheat. Accordingly, they paid him market prices, and the wheat then belonged to the British Government. They said-' ' It is ours now, but the price for bread is rather high."" They accordingly reduced the price to make the position easier for the consumer, and I believe placed £50,000,000 on the Estimates to cover the loss. That policy was not given effect to at the expense of the agriculturist, because he sold his commodity at the proper market price, and then bore the his share of the loss equally with other citizens of the Mother Country. In Australia last year the entire burdern was borne by the producer, for instead of getting the market price for his wheat, it was cut down to the extent of £11,000,000. It is unfair to ask any returned soldier who has been put upon the land to grow wheat to make a contribution to the Commonwealth in the form of cheaper wheat for home consumption. The thing is absurd. There is nothing statesman-like about i,t; but, nevertheless, that is what has been done in the past, and that is what the leading press are seeking to do again.",60
326,Mr BOWDEN,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"All through the war the wheat producer leaned upon the Government for credit.  sary to reply to that absurd interjection. During the war, owing to the lack of attractiveness in wheat-growing, the Australian producers reduced the area under cultivation by 4,000,000 acres, and in order to save the country-no t to save the wheat-growers-the y were given a guarantee by the various Governments of the Commonwealth. They never asked for one farthing either from State or Commonwealth Government. All that was done for them was returned with interest, and, therefore, it is absurd for any honourable member now to twit us with what was done for the farmer during the war It is claimed now that the farmer anymust provide cheap food for a White Australia, and buy White Australian machinery manufactured under a high 1 Tariff, with no Tariff upon wheat, and do not ask for it. Give the producers as much as you pay to any one else. Call tenders for the wheat if you like, and let the Australian producer be a tenderer. Do not buy his wheat unless it is cheaper than the price at which it can be got where. That is all we are asking for, and that will be a fair deal. You will have to get over this little fence before you can induce me to vote for 35 or 40 per oent. Tariff on my machinery. You talk about defence. What greater defence can we possibly have than a robust rural population ? Nature makes it so. As a matter of fact, no country is strong without a great rural population. Look at the abnormal condition of Australia. It has no counterpart in the world, civilized or uncivilized. Twelve per cent, of the population of England live in London, which is not only the capital of the United Kingdom, but practically the capital of the world; 4 per cent, of the population of Erance live in Paris; 2 per cent, of the poj|nlation of Germany in Berlin; and 1.75 per cent, of the population of Bussia inPetrograd; while 50 per cent, of the population of the State of Victoria live in Melbourne. If we were only a manufacturing country there might be some justification for this centralization, but we are a producing country. By forcing people to carry food from where it is produced for consumption in the cities, we are adding to the costliness of living. There is a tendency to create artificiality, which not only increases the cost of living, but also weakens the nation. Through our centralizing policy we cannot establish (factories in . healthy surroundings in country districts where facilities offer, and where the food can be produced to feed the workers in those establishments without heavy handling costs. Under existing circumstances, nothing can be done in Australia unless the food* is carted to Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, or Perth, at great expense, thus adding to the costliness of liviug; while burdens are heaped upon the man who has to grow it in competition'with cheap labour elsewhere.",60

344,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Besides , what about the revenue?",62
345,Mr RILEY,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"We must have some revenue. I suppose the Country party will object to the building of ships and the general shipping policy of the Government, although we must build ships to carry the wheat away.",62
346,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,You would object . if they were built in the country.,62
347,Mr RILEY,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"They are built in the country now, or parts of them are. The honourable member will not deny that en- „ gines for those ships are being built in Castlemaine. Ships have been built at Williamstown and Walsh Island with a view to carrying Australian produce to the markets of the world. Had it not been for the shipping policy of the Government, which has helped to get our produce away, the farmers would have been in a very bad way indeed. One honourable member complained about the Government's shipping policy, and spoke about the virtues of private enterprise. Where was private enterprise during the war in Australia so far as shipping was concerned? If the Government had not taken the shipping over, the farmers would have been the sufferers - The same honourable member demanded freedom to do this and that. I heard that yarn when it was desired to introduce cheap labour such as Chinese and Indians.",62
348,Mr HILL,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"The honourable member does not want cheap labour, but he wants - cheap wheat.",63
349,Mr RILEY,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,Does the honourable member call wheat cheap at 9s. per bushel ?  - work sixty hours o. week to produce it .,63
350,Mr RILEY,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"The honourable member is an insurance agent, arid does not work on a farm at all . That is the sort of stuff we hear from men who claim to represent the farmers, but who really only far m the farmers.",63
351,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Wimmera) [9.29] If , as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) interjects, the address to which we have just listened is a fair sample of a protectionist speech, then this so-called Free Trade party in the corner has not very much to fear. The debate so far has been conducted in a somewhat loose and frivolous manner. We are dealing to-night with principles of vital interest to the people of the Commonwealth, and, so far as this Tariff is concerned, of particularly vital interest to the primary producers. I have wondered what is the object of this good, solid lump of a Tariff. What is behind it all?",63
352,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,Some revenue.,63
353,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"If to obtain more revenue is one reason for its introduction, it is a very unsound form of taxation. A sound and fair form of taxation means the taxation of all for the benefit, of all, but taxation through the Customs means the taxation of all for the benefit of a few. I still ask, "" What is behind this Tariff."" In introducing dt, the Minister (Mr Greene) quoted the following passage from ithe Prime Minister's policy speech at Bendigo:The Government have carefully prepared a new Tariff. It believes it would prove satisfactoryto the manufacturers of the Commonwealth, and intends to lay this Tariff on the table of the House and give effect to it at the earliest possible moment after the new Parliament assembles. At the last election the political panties that were behind the members who now occupy the Treasury bench were assisted very liberally indeed in cash and kind by many of the - leading manufacturers of Australia. Is this good thumping T a r if f , which is tabled now that they have come out on top, a reward for services rendered ait the last election ?",63
354,Mr CONSIDINE,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"If so, why are you supporting the Government?",63
355,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"If the Government were dependent oh my support, they would not occupy, the Treasury bench very long. I have made no secret of the fact that in season and out of season' I am going to do my best to shift them from where they are. I do not go behind their back and stab them when I make that statement. . The Minister reiterated throughout his speech, and gave quotations intended to prove, - that the Tariff would have the effect of cheapening tools of trade, particularly those used in primary production.. He quoted figures as to the price of machinery in the Argentine - and New Zealand in order to support' his contention. I hope that when he is replying he will answer the query which I now intend to put to him. Today the manufacturers of far m implements in this country are advertising, spending money, and conducting propaganda which are costing a good deal of money, in support of this Tariff. They - are pleased with it . But if its ultimate result is to be to cheapen the. price of what they produce, surely the Minister does not mean to tell me that Mr H . V . MCKay and other far m machinery manufacturers are joining him in a campaign to reduce the price of farming machinery ?",63
356,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,Does the honourable member think there would be any inconsistency in that?,63
357,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,Yes .,63
358,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Well , I .do not. That is where' the honourable member is 'all wrong.",63
359,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"The old-time cry was, "" Put on a little duty 'to enable us to start a factory so that we can get upon our feet,"" but the whole history of the . T a r i ff has been one of steady increase, eaoh Tariff higher and still higher than > the last. As the business and .the factories of these people outside grow, so does the T a r i ff grow, and always in the one direction. In the first place, they ask for a T a r i ff to enable them to become established, and the more soundly established they become the more insatiable is their appetite for higher duties. Is not the stock argument of the Protectionist that it is unfair to expect white men to compete with cheap coloured labour?",63
360,Mr MATHEWS,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"And a very good argument, too.",64
361,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Do not honourable members opposite, and other high priests of Protection, realise that that is what the primary producer is doing all the time?",64
362,Mr MATHEWS,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"We are giving him a white man's market, 9 s. per bushel.",64
363,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"I have heard a good deal lately about the yellow man's market. Our primary producers are competing in the world's market today, and have been doing so for many years, against the black grown wheat of India, and the wheat grown with the cheap Spanish labour of the Argentine, and the ignorant peasant labour of Russia, and, in addition, are being charged the highest shipping freights in the world. have to sell their wheat, not only over seas, but also within Protectionist Australia, at black labour rates, and some honourable members on the Opposition side would deny them even those prices.",64
364,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"We never did that. We, believe in a fair deal all round.",64
365,Mr MCGRATH,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,Is 9s. per bushel a black labour rate?,64
366,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Upon what basis does the Australian manufacturer, that gentleman who is the particular care of a new-born alliance between organized capital and organized labour",64
367,Mr MATHEWS,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,I will admit that the boss manufacturer is as good a robber as the farmer.,64
368,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Upon what basis does the Australian manufacturer, in whom organized labour and organized capital are showing such, a remarkable interest,. » d i for"" whom they are acting as foster fathers, fix the price of what he has to sell? Does he-fix.it at the London price, less the, cost of getting it. to the market-?.",64
369,Mr MATHEWS,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,He getsall he can.,64
370,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Yes , and this Tariff will enable him to get a little more than hei could in thepast. The poor struggling manufacturer, whom honourable members are so desirous of protecting, although he is getting cheaper coal, cheaper steel, and cheaper labour than can be obtained by any of his competitors in the outside world, does not fix - the price of his commodity at what he can get in the world's market. He does not believe in competing in the world's market; he desires the creation of an artificial market in Australia, and he sells, not at the cost of production plus a fair profit, but at the price at which his overseas competitors can land their goods. If we impose an extra duty of £20 or £30 upon a machine, up goes the price, and organized labour goes to the Wages Board or the Arbitration Court for a share of the spoils.",64
371,Mr BLAKELEY,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"As a party, are honourable members in the corner prepared to foree the Government to protect the farmer ?",64
372,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"I will make my speech in my own way, and will not be They sidetracked by any honourable member. The Australian manufacturer fixes the price of his product at the import value. If the primary producer were to fix the price of what he has to sell upon the same basis, what would be the price of wheat in Australia today? The price of wheat is, roughly, from 9s. to 10s. per bushel in the markets of the world. We will calculate it at the low price of 9s. in London. Upon wheat imported into Australia there is a duty, which, so far as I am concerned, may be struck out, for it never operates except in time of drought, as in the years 1902 and 1914, and then it is suspended so that it cannot operate. That iswhat the Australian wheat-grower is getting from this grand policy of Protection. Take the price of wheat in London at 9s. per bushel, allow 2s. for freight, 2s. for duty, and Is, for insurance, wharfage rates and like charges, and the import value of wheat today becomes. 14s. per bushel. If I had my way, I would fix the price of what I hadto sell upon the same basis as that upon which the Australian manufacturer fixes the price of the machinery which I usein growing m,y wheat"". If that were done, the present price of wheat in Australia would be 14s. per bushel. But what the high priests of Protection desire is that the farmer should purchase from the rest of the community everything he needs at Protectionist prices, and feed the community with primary products at black labour rates. I could take these champions of the working class, these staunch advocates of the eight-hours system, into many country districts and prove to them that there were men and women working eight hours - yes , but eight hours before noon and eight hours after noon. Reference has been made by interjection to the price of 9 s. per bushel for wheat. ""What is the price of a 4-lb. loaf in Australia today? It is sold at from Is. l d . to Is. 3d. per loaf, and the average is, therefore, Is. 2d. Honourable members opposite are blaming the farmers, who are the producers of wheat, for the excessive price of bread. Do they know how much wheat there is in a 4-lb. loaf, or what the farmer actually gets out of it? Can any of these so-called experts, who know so much concerning the production of wheat, give that information? There is no answer, because they know that to them it is a difficult question. I shall tell them",64
373,Mr BLAKELET,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,We know that the Germans are getting cheaper food than the Australians.,65
374,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"That interjection is incorrect, and the honourable member knows it. The amount that the farmer receives for the wheat in a 4-lb.. loaf is a little over 6£d.; it is less than 7d.",65
375,Mr MATHEWS,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,That is not correct,65
376,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,I am prepared to say that it is between 6£d. and 7d.,65
377,Mr MATHEWS,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Can the honourable read, member prove it?",65
378,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Can the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) disprove it? If the Australian wheat-growers grew wheat and gave it the farmers. to the millers free of cost, the consumers would still be charged 7d. for a 4-lb. Honourable members opposite cannot have high wages and short hours for the mill hands, neither can there be high profits - for the millers if there is to be a cheap loaf. They cannot have a baker in North Melbourne delivering bread in South Melbourne, or a baker in South Melbourne delivering bread in North Melbourne, and expect cheap bread. know it is impossible to have numerous drivers, employed at high rates of wages for comparatively short hours, chasing each other around the suburban areas, and at the same time have cheap bread.",65
379,Mr BLAKELET,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"We have been trying to remedy that, and the Government will not allow us.  party ran away from the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler).",65
380,The CHAIRMAN,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES," Order ! I have asked that interjections be discontinued, and that the honourable member be allowed to proceed. The debate on the Tariff is different to the discussion on other matters, as there is no time limitation, and every honourable member will have an opportunity of speaking fully to the question, and will be able to express his views as often as he desires. In these circumstances I appeal to honourable members to allow the honourable member addressing the Chair to state his case without interruption, because interjections ultimately lead to disorder, which is very undesirable.",65
381,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and hope that the time which has been occupied by your speech will not be recorded against me. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), in introducing the Tariff, made a calculation concerning the extra population that we would have in Australia if all the iron and steel used in the Commonwealth were'smelted locally, and said that if this were done our population would be increased by 300,000. In his search for arguments to bolster up this rotten policy he began to give a list-it is too long to but I will quote it if desired-of the main primary products we use, and endeavoured in some mysterious way to connect - the consumption of our primary products, locally with the prosperity of In his opinion, the quantity of wheat - that these 300,000 loaf, people would consume would be 1,600,000 bushels. In his speech he advanced, the well-known Protectionist argument that the local marketwas the best of all markets. If the Australian primary producers were able to fix the price of what they had to sell on the same basis that the Australian manufacturer fixes, the price of what he has to sellj that is a price far They above the world's market price, there would be something in his argument. What does it matter to the average wheat grower in Australia where his wheat is consumed if he is only to receive a certain price. What does it matter whether the wheat I grow is consumed in Melbourne Or in London if I receive only 7s. or Ss. per bushel. That is a definite answer to the oft-repeated statement concerning the local market. If the primary producer is given the right to charge above the world's parity, I admit the local market is the better of the two. But the local markets are of no use to us if we are not going to receive a higher price for what we have to sell. During the war the position may have been different, but wo are now living in normal times. ' I do not know what the average price of wheat will be this year; but if some honourable members in this Chamber had their way, God knows how low it would be! As a basis of calculation, we can take the average price for local consumption, which last year was 7s. Sd. per bushel, and the average price received throughout the whole year, averaging the overseas price from January to December, was approximately 12s. per bushel, or a difference of over 4s. a bushel. If we had had the additional 300,000 people to which the Minister for Trade and Customs referred, they would have consumed on his figures 1,600,000 bushels of wheat. In other words, we would have lost 4s. per bushel on this extra 1,600^000, making a total loss of more than £300,000.",65
382,Mr BLAKELEY,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,The honourable member does not mean to say that the greater the population the poorer the farmer will be?,66
383,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Unde r the conditions .existing in the Australian wheat market last year, yes.",66
384,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,But consumers eat other ° things beside wheat.,66
385,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"The claim made in the calculation of the Minister included all classes of primary products, and he specifically quoted wheat. I am disproving that part of his argument in my references to the wheat-grower.",66
386,Mr MCGRATH,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,I suppose the honourable member will deal with the Mildura fruit-growers ?,66
387,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF AIRPLANES,"Yes ; they are very staunch Protectionists, because, through organization, they are in the happy position of being able to do what the Australian manufacturer does. Although during the war they voluntarily sold their dried fruits in Australia at a price far below the world's market price, in normal times the policy of . Protection benefits them. I would like to see the same situation applied to all the primary producers. If I had my way I would organize them and. take the same right - the same right as is demanded for the Australian manufacturer. I have made reference to the "" cut "" that organized labour is going 'to get out of the Tariff. I can quite understand honorablei members opposite going "" baldheaded "" for Protection. If I represented a city constituency I might be "" all out"" for a high Tariff also. I wish to refer to the position in which organized labour finds itself in connection with the Tariff, particularly in respect of the wages paid to labourers employed in ' machinerymaking in Victoria. The wage rates are fixed wider the present Wages Board system.. That system has treated the Victorian workers very well, for the reason that the tendency of all awards has been ever upwards. I do not say, of course, that that tendency should have been in any other direction. But I have never yet heard of a Wages Board being called together to consider a reduction of wages or increase of hours.. I have that in mind when I state that the system has treated the Victorian worker very well. But while the worker is on a good wicket, the implement maker is on an even better wicketLike the man who plays "" two-up"" with a double-headed penny, he cannot, lose. If his employees go for an increase of Is. 6d. per day, and he is able to resist the claim, the victory is obviously his. But if the workers get their Is. 6d., does the manufacturer pay it? Not at all. He immediately calls in his . old price-lists and issues fresh ones to his country agents, in which he promptly passes the burden of the increased wage-sheet to the poor old back-bone of the country. If we could put id. or l d . or 2d. on to the price of our wheat to meet this extra charge we "" would be in the happy position of having joined the great family of those who are engaged in the modern economic pastime of passing it on; but we cannot do so. When the manufacturer increases the price of his product in. order to cover an addition ta his costs, amounting to 1 per cent, or 1-J per cent., be puts on 2J per cent., or 3 per cent., or 5 per cent. So the game goes on; organized labour cutting at organized capital on the principle that the profits mado in an industry can stand higher wages, and organized' capital always retreating and putting it on to some one else. In the policy of the party to which I belong there is specific reference to the Fanners' fiscal plank in regard to tools of trade- "" Tools of. trade used in primary production made within - the British Empire."" That plank is there simply because we are asked to compete - in the world's.market; and, since we are compelled, to. sell our products in the world's market, we ask for the privilege of purchasing our tools of trade also in the world's market. Now, I said that I would give some of these persistent interjectors m y ' fiscal creed, and I shall do so. But as the hour is late, I should be glad to be allowed to continue my speech tomorrow.
