NA ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1994 Cognate bills: NA AND COMPANIES BILL 1994 AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 December, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the bill be now read a second time.",11
5,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES," Mr Speaker, it is good to see you in the chair while this important legislation is being debated. When the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) was making his second reading speech on these bills yesterday, he made the comment that they represent something of a landmark in the history of Commonwealth financial administration. It was very true and very correct of the minister to say that, because they replace the Audit Act 1901. Probably no more important legislation can ever be debated in this place than that relflting to financial accountability. The public rightly expects and deserves public accountability to be the highest priority of members of the parliament and of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is certainly a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to comment on this package of legislation which will replace the Audit Act 1901. This legislation will form a cornerstone of the Commonwealth's system of financial accountability and will set in place the financial arrangements to see the Commonwealth into the next century. As you, Mr Speaker, would be aware, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which I am pleased to have the opportunity to chair, has been closely involved in the consultative process, culmithat, nating in the government amendments that have been proposed to the bills. Yesterday, during the debate on this legisla the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) in particular made some rather interesting comments revolving around a lot of the recommendations from our committee. The committee's report No. 331 was the result of this legislation having been referred to us. I think that, in itself, is another landmark. Legislation is now being referred to committees of parliament. This was the first legislation that was referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and it is also the most important legislation, as I said, we will ever debate. In that report we came up with some 39 recommendations. Understandably, and probably in some ways we are a little disappointed, the government has not accepted all our recommendations, but it certainly has accepted a lot of them. I think something like 70 per cent to 75 per cent of them. Thirty-five recommendations refer particularly to these bills and another four refer to the Audit Committee of Parliament, which is a separate matter in itself but I will comment on it later. I am particularly pleased that a lot of those recommendations have been picked up, while,at the same time, I am a little disappointed that some of the other ones have not been accepted. I think we need to bear in mind the process that we go through in referring bills to committees. I would encourage it as much as we can. At the end of the day, we have better legislation now than that which we started with. When the minister first referred this to the committee, his comments were pretty important. He said: As I have indicated, virtually by implication in the things that I have been saying, the government is not so proud of its authorship in this regard that it is going to take umbrage at getting additional advice from any sources and we look forward to the consultative processes yet in hand. Similarly, I would suggest that our committee is not the custodian of all wisdom either. We have had the opportunity to look through this legislation. I do not think it would be expected that all our recommendations would be accepted. The government has obviously gone through them and considered them in depth and has come back with the amendments that it has put up. The government has put forward 42 amendments to the three pieces of legislation. The government has instigated some of the amendments itself. They have come out of some of the findings of, and people's contributions to, our committee rather than coming from the recommendations. I think that is a pretty important aspect that has come across. I would like to turn to some of the amendments that the opposition has put forward. I believe all our recommendations are important, but I would like to reflect on the ones that have not been accepted by the government-that is, the appointment of the Auditor General and the Audit Committee of Parliament. In relation to the appointment of the Audit Committee of Parliament, we wanted greater involvement by the parliament through the Public Accounts Committee. Instead of having consultation between the minister, the Leader of the Opposition or his nominee and the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, we felt that it would be better to seek the full role of the Public Accounts Committee. I do not think that was meant as a sleight against me. I supported it quite strongly. I thought that having the collective wisdom of the whole committee was better than just having my own individual views as a chairperson. I felt that would have been helpful. Whilst we suggested that the minister should seek the approval of the Leader of the Opposition and the Public Accounts Committee, perhaps the minister should consult with the Leader of the Opposition first and then seek the approval of the Public Accounts Committee. We have come up with that position mainly because annual reporting guidelines are approved, as you may be aware, Mr Speaker, by the Public Accounts Committee; there is a formal approval process whereby the Prime Minister refers those guidelines to the Public Accounts Committee for its formal approval. We take that particular duty of the Public Accounts Committee very seriously in the processes that we go through to ensure that those guidelines meet the requirements of the parliament. There has never been a big problem with that process. We saw a similarity between the role of the Public Accounts Committee and that proposed for the Audit Committee. That was important to our committee. Notwithstanding that, the government has not rejected our recommendation completely out of hand; it has gone a bit further. The formation of a separate Audit Committee of Parliament is included in the motion before the Senate. The motion provides that the chairpersons of the Audit Committee will be you, Mr Speaker, and the President of the Senate. That is one of our recommendations that the government has picked up, and it is important. If we are to have a separate Audit Committee, the chair of that committee should also be consulted on the appointment of the Auditor-General. I know that gives you a big burden to carry, Mr Speaker, but I am sure you can handle it and that it will not be a problem for you. However, I feel it is important to give that status to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee of Parliament is a very important committee. It should be treated accordingly and given a very high status in this place-and I am sure it will be under your guidance and that of the President. One of the essential issues to which we referred in our report No. 296 back in 1989 was that there should be an audit committee of parliament. The current Public Accounts Committee did not recommend a separate audit committee of the parliament but believed that a name change to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to include the word 'audit' would have been a more appropriate course. Given the number of committees in the parliament now and the duties of members participating in those committees, it was important from our point of view that there not be too many duplications of committees. The Public Accounts Committee, Mr Speaker, as you well know, takes its duties very seriously. I believe that the committee has always been held in extremely high regard, and I think that is indicated by the amendments before us wherein the government has accepted a great number of our recommendations. Such is the seriousness, importance status of our committee. We believe that the JCPA could have adequately fulfilled that role. However, the government believes that those powers should be separated. I believe that comes very much out of the British model, but the situation somewhat different in Britain. We did have the opportunity to speak to the Comptroller and Auditor-General of the UK. We did not visit him; he visited us, and we took that opportunity to discuss these aspects with him. Given the size of the British parliament compared to the size of our parliament, there is probably a greater need for a separate committee there. Also, in the British House Commons there are 650 members compared of the 147 members in this place. Another fundamental difference is that the equivalent of the JCPA in the British parliament is chaired by a member of the opposition. That is quite different from what occurs here. However, aspects of the historicial situation in the. House of Commons have been picked up in this legislation. Nevertheless, I respect the government's views. Through the processes, we have argued what should be done. My colleague the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) highlighted those views when he spoke yesterday. A lot of reports come before the parliament that we as members of parliament participate in the compilation of, and it is the case that you cannot always get your own way. We accept the democratic and party processes we have in this place. I was a little disappointed yesterday when the member for Mitchell, who spoke after the member for Charlton, attacked the member for Charlton and suggested that he should cross the floor and vote to support amendments put forward by the opposition that pick up some of the recommendations the government has not accepted. That is an absolute nonsense. When the member for Forrest was speaking yesterday, he did not allude to that even though he was a bit critical of the process with this legislation. The member for Forrest-along with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and me-was a member and of the committee which was involved with report No. 296. If people have their name on a report and things do not go their way, will they have to cross the floor to reflect their views? That would mean we would have to deal with amendments individually. If we took that course of action we would have to is go through 42 amendments, which would be rather unworkable and not be a smart way to go. I was a bit disappointed when the member for Mitchell chose to attack. the member for Charlton because he spoke very passionately on this legislation. The member for Charlton has played a very strong role, and even when our report was tabled here he spoke very extensively to it. I just wanted to make that of point because it was rather unfortunate. I turn now to some of the amendments proposed by the opposition. I will not go through the FMA Bill and the CAC Bill; it is to the Auditor-General Bill that most of the opposition's amendments are proposed. I want to make a few comments about the Audit Committee because the opposition's amendment does not seem to meet the importance of the Audit Committee of Parliament. As I said earlier, we as a committee, and as a parliament, should see the real importance of this Audit Committee of Parliament. The government sees it as very important and believes the Presiding Officers should chair it as they will give it that extra status. That is a matter I have already dealt with. I am somewhat' confused with the amendment that the member for Forrest has put forward. He suggests in his amendment that the JCPA should be the audit committee of parliament. We dQ not necessarily have great difficulty with that because it is what we originally recommended in report No. 331. Under the heading of 'Sectional committees', proposed new clause 56 states: Section 9 of the Principal Act is amended by important. inserting the following· subsection after subsection (1): ""(2) As soon as practicable after the commencerather ment of the first session of each Parliament, the Committee must appoint a Sectional Committee, to be known as the Audit Committee, consisting of 9 of its members to perform the duties set out in paragraphs 8(1)(da)8(1)(dt).'."". I do not think that fulfils the importance that our committee put on this. We suggested that the size of the JCPA be extended by one committee wanted. person-from 15 to 16-to accommodate the minor parties in the parliament. In that way, everyone would have the opportunity to participate. Traditiqnally, a committee such the JCPA has members from the government and opposition only and not necessarily from the minor parties. That fact is an important one'that I think the Democrats in the other place particularly would have alluded to. Under the proposal, we recommend that the formation of the JCPA Audit Committee, as it would become known-a sectional committee of the JCPAcommittee. would lessen the importance of the Audit Committee of Parliament. I cannot come to terms with this particular amendment the legislation opposition is proposing because it would lessen the importance of the Audit Commitaudit tee. The essential things we wanted were a future. name change of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to an audit committee and separate meetings when it resides as an audit commitwhich tee. If the committee met as a separate audit committee, it would give it the status it rightly deserves as an extremely important committee. The opposition wants to form some sort of sectional committee with nine members. I of assume the figure of nine came from the ment proposed audit committee that Senator Ray's notice of motion in the other place seeks establish. It is proposed that it will have members, so I assume that is where the magic figure of nine came from. The member for works Forrest failed to explain that to the House, so he might like to do so at a later. stage. The opposition has also picked up the duties of the audit committee proposed in Senator Ray's notice of motion in the Senate. That is I have always felt that the Audit Committee of Parliament should be a statutory committee than just a committee that is formed every parliament. That is one of the things that the government should have looked at. It may wish to consider that at a later stage. That is pretty important. I am at a bit of a loss as to why the opposition would have proposed that course of action. I do not think it picks up the requirements that our own Overall, I believe the government has responded very positively to report No. 296. It has been around since 1989. Whilst it has as been around for a long time--'the Audit Act has been around since 1901-report No. 296 has been an important report, and our latest report is equally as important in the development of this legislation. This is important legislation. The amendments that the government has put forward are important. The government has picked up so many of the recommendations of our Notwithstanding the areas about which I have expressed concern, I think overall the parliament will be better for this at the .end of the day. Our committee is a strong supporter of the role of the office, and that will continue in the I want to turn quickly to the FMA Bill. The government has picked up a couple of points have not stemmed from our committee recommendations. That shows the intent of the government in responding so positively to it. The importance of committees looking at legislation before it comes to this place has been demonstrated in this exercise. It is one the more innovative things that this parliahas taken on board. I believe alllegislation should be able to go through the same to process. Recently, the Public Accounts Comnine mittee visited our counterparts in New Zealand. The same process happens there and it very effectively. It is a smaller parliament by a long shot, but the process works very effectively. Our Main Committee has helped us too. I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate and support the legislation. As I said, even though it does not pick up all our recommendations, it has in the main picked up many of them, and I think the legislation is better for it. I look forward to the continuing debate on this legislation in this place and the other place. I also look forward to hearing the comments of our colleagues on the other side of the House in the course of this debate.",15
6,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I would like to support the remarks of the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). I wish to speak to the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and the Auditor-General Bill in my capacity as vice-chairman of that committee. It was a unique experience to have government legislation of such importance referred to our committee. We gave the bills thorough examination. We called for submissions from the public, from government agencies and from the Department of Finance. When these submissions were received by the committee, we had public hearings and people were given an opportunity to express their views. As a consequence of that committee process the JCPA came up with report No. 331 and we now have stronger legislation. The committee made recommendations to the government. I think it has taken on board, either wholly or partially, something like 32 of the 39 recommendations the committee made. It was a learning process for the opposition, members of the committee, members of the government and government agencies. Those involved in drafting the bills, which were introduced into the parliament by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), found out more about the bills through the committee pro-ess. They realised that the bills could be improved so they took on board, as I said, 32 of the 39 recommendations. The opposition will be moving a number of amendments to this legislation. These amendments ask the government to adopt those recommendations which it has not adopted so far. I will concentrate today on the Auditor General Bill. The Audit Act 1901 is being replaced by this package of three bills. Consequently, these three bills are probably the most important bills to come into this House for quite a long time. The purpose of the bills is twofold: firstly, modernisation and, secondly, accountability. In relation to modernisation it was determined' that we needed to update procedures to comply with modem accounting practices, such as accrual accounting, and update the legislation to take into account rapid technology and technological change. Perhaps the experiences of the 1980s, both in the private sector and with the various governments across Australia, created the demand for this legislation. The demanq has come not so much from the government but from the people. The Public Accounts Committee report No. 296 was entitled The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament. It was not an ally of the government or the executive; it was an ally of the people and the parliament. Because of the experiences of the 1980s, the people are demanding that taxpayer contributions are spent in three ways: efficiently, wisely and, most importantly, legally. They also demand that they apply equally to all people. . It has been the experience worldwide, not just in Australia, that people question the judgment and capacity of politicians to handle the public's money. This has been the experience in the UK and the USA and many other countries. At home, the question of accountability brought down quite a few governments. In Queensland, we saw the spectacle of inquiries into corruption and the misuse of public money which brought down a government. It took that sort of pressure in Queensland to establish a public accounts committee, which was non-existent for many years. We had the experience of the State Bank of South Australia and WA Inc., and some people questioneq the Hawke government's contribution of $100 million to Ansett to prop it up during the pilots strike. We had the member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) lose her portfolio earlier this year because of sporting grants. We had the Auditor-General present to the parliament a critical report on ANL, and that has been closely looked at by the government and by the opposition. There is no way to achieve efficient, legal and wise use of public funds without a strong, independent Auditor-General. What do we mean by independent; independent of - hat? I believe the Auditor-General should be independent of the government and the executive. It is well known that the Auditor General has had a long standing dispute with the executive arm of government. That is not just the present audit office; perhaps it goes as far back as 1901. When I consider what the Auditor-General told our committee he needed to achieve this independence, on balance I am inclined to come down on his side rather than the side of the government and the executive. Yesterday, the Minister for Finance, in the censure motion on the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), held up a bunch of papers to our side and said, 'You can't say things and you can't do things without us knowing now because of the parliamentary database, because of technology.' After the censure motion, I went back to my office and decided to access. the parliamentary database. I keyed in 'Centenary House'. As we know, Centenary House is the building which houses the Auditor-General. I could not bring into the chamber all the references that came from the database. I have found some interesting articles that show where the Auditor-General. could be seen to have his independence compromised. I will quote from a speech made by the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) in October 1993. In it he talked about the Auditor General and office space. When you hear this, ask yourself: can we honestly say that the Auditor-General is free from political or executive direction, or interference? The member for Higgins said: The Australian Property Group of the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services negotiated a lease for his officethat is the Auditor-Generalto establish premises at a building ... known to the Auditor-General as a Lend Lease building. What he did not know was that the Australian Property Group was negotiating a lease to a building which would be owned by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Property Group negotiated that lease with the owner, which turned out to be the Australian Labor Party, on terms which included a nine per cent rent increase every year for 15 years. That is a pretty good deal. It goes on: Comparable leases in Canberra provide for a one per cent inflation based increase over that period. The Department of Finance believes that the rental payment, a nine per cent increase every year for 15 years, is out of the ballpark, out of the grandstand, and even out of the car park as far as Canberra is concerned. It has said that in relation to commercial property it should be only one per cent per annum, therefore the Australian National Audit Office will be given an increase of only one per cent per annum . . . to rental for the duration of the lease. The result is obvious. The audit office is locked into a lease, which escalates at nine per cent per annum, but will be funded only for increased rent at one per cent per annum. As the Auditor-General has stated in hearings of the Senate estimates committeeas well as the PACthis leaves the Auditor-General with no other choice but to reduce staff to pay the rent. He has stated that by 1996 the office will be in a totally untenable position and will be unable to carry out its functions properly. The function of scrutinising government and looking after taxpayers' money will now be run down in order that the Auditor General can make lease payments, which are uncommercial, to the Australian Labor Party. I believe that action compromises the independence of the Auditor-General. In looking up other references to Centenary Househonourable members will not believe this one-I found a question on notice from my colleague the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, upon notice, the following question: (1) Did the CSIRO conduct a moth count for the National Capital Planning Authority at York Park, Canberra ... It goes on: (2) What is the estimated cost of the actions . . . only The answer to that question on notice produced a reference to Centenary House, the building owned by the Labor Party and leased by the Auditor-General. It stated: A further study in 1993-94 is foreshadowed at an estimated cost of $5,000. The proposed grassland translocation will be undertaken as part of future landscape works on York Park. The protective fence was erected in 1992 by Civil and Civic as part of the construction of Centenary House. I will not make an accusation but ask the question: was the landscaping and fencing of Centenary House carried out through a grant from CSIRO? Was it an improper use of government funds, with the beneficiary being the Australian Labor Party, under the pretext of counting moths? I cannot see the relationship. As I have said, I come down on the side of the Auditor-General. I want to look at four areas of the Auditor General Bill. Clauses 14 and 15 allow the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of Commonwealth authorities and companies, except GBEs or their subsidiaries. The Auditor-General may conduct a performance audit of a GBE if both houses of parliament request the audit or if the responsible minister requests the audit. In evidence to the JCPA, the Auditor-General said he believes he should have the mandate to conduct performance audits of any Commonwealth entity, including GBEs, at any time. The JCPA recommended that the Auditor-General may conduct a performance audit of a GBE if both houses of parliament request the audit; second, if the responsible minister requests the audit; or, third, if an audit committee of parliament requests the audit. That recommendation is based on the principle that it is important that there be easier mechanisms by which parliament can directly request the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs. The government rejected the JCPA recommendations. Clauses 14 and 15 remain unchanged. I tum to the second area of concern to the Auditor-General. The bill said that the Auditor-General is to be appointed by the Governor General on the advice of. the minister. Before making a recommendation to the Governor General, the minister must consult the finance minister, a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition and the Chairman of the JCPA. The Auditor-General wants greater parliamentary involvement in the selection process-'parliamentary' meaning both sides and minority parties. Perhaps this would avoid his being compromised by being locked into a commitment to pay rent to the Australian Labor Party. The JCPA recommended that, before making a recommendation to the Governor General, the minister must seek the approval of, as distinct from consultation with, the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives or his or her nominee, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and an Audit Committee of Parliament. I tum to the government amendments. The reference to the Audit Committee of Parliament has been accepted. The finance minister is still to be consulted. The Leader of the Opposition, the Chairman of the JCPA and the chairperson of the Audit Committee do not have the right of approval requested by the committee. The minister will still need only to consult them. I tum to the third area of concern. There is no reference in the Auditor-General Bill to the Audit Committee. A separate Audit Committee is to be established under a notice of motion moved by Senator Robert Ray. As the member for Oxley mentioned, this was a major area of concern. We felt that the Audit Committee, like the JCPA, which is one of the few statutory committees, should also be e.stablished by statute, not by a resolution of the House. The government rejected the recommendations of the PAC. It made reference to the Audit Committee in the Auditor General Bill and is to be consulted on appointment of the Auditor-General and Independent Auditor. The fourth area of concern was staff terms and conditions of the ANAO. The bill said that the ANAO is to be a statutory organisation and that staff are to be employed under the Public Service Act 1922. The Auditor General wanted, in terms of independence and to attract the type of person who can conduct proper auditing work in today's modem times, the freedom to set, the terms and conditions of staff to reflect the competitive market conditions. The JCPA recommended that the Auditor-General have freedom to set the terms and conditions of staff, with a proviso that the terms and conditions be consistent with industrial relations standards. The government rejected the recommendations. The staff will still be employed under the Public Service Act. I feel that these bills are good. They will bring auditing and accountability into the 20th century. It will protect the public purse. However, I feel that, if these four areas bills had been addressed by the government, that protection would have been more adequately provided. (Time expired)",19
7,Mr VAILE,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I want to open my comments on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill and cognate bills that we are debating this morning in a positive manner. It certainly has been an interesting exercise for me, as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, to have had the opportunity to scrutinise government legislation on its way through the legislative process in this parliament between the first and second readings and to have been a party to report No. 331 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which made some 39-odd recommendations to the minister with regard to changes we sought to the three bills. The government maintains the chair of that committee and has a majority on that committee, but it has given members of the opposition on that committee the opportunity to scrutinise government legislation and to have a positive input into changes that we saw as being necessary in an attempt to improve the government's legislation. The government has opted to take up a number-probably 75 per cent-of the committee's recommendations, but four very important recommendations have been rejected by the government. I will concentrate my comments today on those recommendations. The committee took evidence from a number of different authorities, including GBEs that fall under the FMA Bill and GBEs that fall under the CAC Bill. There were probably a couple of central elements that came through in the comments that were made. The government had embarked on this consultative process as far as the parliament was concerned. The parliament, through the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, had had ample opportunity to scrutinise the legislation that had been drafted by the Department of Finance and PM&C, I think. One critical comment made by a number of the GBEs was that there was not enough consultation on that side of the exercise. I do not know how effective the bills will be after enactment. We hope they will be very effecin the tive because the government in Australia today is going down this road of commercialisation and corporatisation of a lot of government activities. A lot of the directors of these authorities made the point that they would have appreciated a bit more consultation and a bit more input into the drafting of the bills. I do not know whether that comes from the fact that they also were a bit concerned that some clauses in the bills are going to move them more in line with commercial directors under the Corporations Law-which we all agree with. When drafting a bill such as this, if you spend more time in the consultation period before implementation, there will be a far shorter dispute period after the event. I do not know what the outcome is going to be, but a number of GBEs and representatives commented to that effect. We received a lot of submissions and took a lot of evidence from different organisations that are going to be the subject of these bills when they are enacted. So in future, the government and the public servants in the departments might take that comment on board. It has been proven time and time again that, in a process of reform and change, if you spend more time on the consultative process before enactment, any disputation period after the event will be much shorter. I will briefly formally outline what the bills are about. The Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994-the FMA Billforms part of a package of three bills. The other bills in the package are the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and the Auditor-General Bill. They all replace the Audit Act of 1901. The FMA Bill seeks to provide a regulatory framework for Commonwealth instrumentalities which financially are agents of the Commonwealth, that is, broadly speaking, those bodies which do not own their funds and operate squarely within the provisions of sections 81 and 83 of the constitution. Agencies covered by the FMA Bill include executive departments, parliamentary departments and many state authorities. The FMA Bill specifies the responsibilities and powers Minister for Finance, revises the Commonwealth's fund accounting structure, modernises the accounting system, prescribes rules for the control and management of public property, outlines the powers and responsibilities of chief executives of Commonwealth agencies, provides for the preparation of monthly statements of fund's transaction and the audit of financial statements by Commonwealth agencies. In April 1989, the parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts presented its report No. 269, which we have already heard about this morning, called The Auditor General: Ally of the people and parliamentreform of the Australian Audit Office. That report recommended that the Audit Act be repealed and replaced with more modem and flexible financial management. This recommendation was accepted by the government in November 1989. Interestingly enough, although the government accepted report No. 269 from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, some elements of that report concerning the Auditor-General Act still have not been addressed. We will come to that a bit later on. The FMA Bill was introduced on 29 June 1994 by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and referred, on his motion, to the JCPA for review, with an advisory report to be presented by 23 August-which, as we know, came later on. From that point on, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has spent a great deal of time talking to the departmental officers that have been involved in the drafting of these bills, as well as to a lot of those Commonwealth authorities that are going to be affected by the bills. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, otherwise known as the CAC Bill, is the second of the three bills that we are debating this morning. Broadly, the CAC Bill will provide a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for directors of Commonwealth authorities and establish standards of conduct for executive officers. It is much the same as the FMA Bill, but it deals with organisations or government bodies that basically own their own money, and the of the Commonwealth is a shareholder in their activity. From the perspective of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the third bill, the Auditor-General Bill, is probably the most important of the three bills. The CAC Bill and the FMA Bill are going to give government business enterprises accounting responsibilities as if they were out there in the commercial world under the Corporations Law. That is fine; we agree with all those things. We were looking to get from the government a little bit more independence for the Auditor General. . The Auditor-General Bill establishes the Office of the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia and defines the terms and conditions for appointment to that office. The Auditor-General is appointed for a single maximum term of seven years; a government amendment is seeking to make that a minimum of five years and a maximum of seven years. I will shortly compare some of these more important aspects with what the JCPA recommended. Prior to advising the Governor General on the appointment of a new Auditor-General, the responsible minister must consult with the Minister for Finance, a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, and the chairperson of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Part 4 of the bill deals with the main functions and powers of the Auditor-General. This part sets out in broad terms the mandate and reporting responsibilities of the Auditor General to conduct financial statement and performance audits of Commonwealth agencies and companies. In addition to statutory audit reports of financial statements, other reports may contain specific information which the Auditor-General considers should be brought before the parliament. While the Auditor-General is empowered to carry out financial audits of GBEs, the bill does not allow GBEs to be performance audited. The government argues that under its GBE reforms the bottom line is the important issue and GBEs will still be responsible to ministers. This ignores the fact that GBEs are still public entities and the Auditor-General is simply the mechanism by which parliament is kept informed of the operations of government bodies. The government is effectively arguing that GBEs should generally be exempt from parliamentary scrutiny of performance. This is not an acceptable position. The JCPA recommended that the relevant clauses should be amended to allow an audit committee of the JCPA, which we will discuss a bit later on, to request audits of GBEs. The Auditor-General also argued that the Auditor-General should be allowed to show proposed reports to anyone who was thought to have a special interest. The JCPA agreed and recommended an appropriate amendment, with disclosure of these reports prohibited. That is a very important element as a third stage of what we are trying to do here. In report No. 331, the JCPA states: As the Department of Finance explained: The government has decided to exclude GBEs on the basis that under its GBE refonns the emphasis is on the bottom line. That is all good and well. But the government will say to a GBE: 'This year we want a seven per cent net return.' That is okay; that means that the GBE is given exact parameters to work to. That is where we have to end up. It does not matter if we can do it better; this is all we have to produce for the government. If we can do it better, if we can produce more efficiencies, we have a bit more fat to do this, that and the other thing. I do not believe that it provides enough scrutiny. However, the accounting bodies argue that while GBEs may be accountable to their minister under this proposal, they are not accountable to their shareholders-the public. In taking evidence and in debating these issues at all stages we talk about the shareholders being the Commonwealth. That is all good and well. That sounds like a single entity. But the shareholders are the people of Australia, the taxpayers of Australia. Every single time. I get on my feet in this parliament I point out to the government and to anybody who is listening that the shareholders are the people of Australia. The people who own the assets that the government is seIling today are the taxpayers of Australia. It is not the executive, it is not the members on the government benches and it is not this parliament-it is the taxpayers of Australia. That is what is pointed out by the accounting bodies. They say they are not accountable to the shareholders-the public. Entities that use or manage public resources must be held accountable to the public. Unlike shareholders of a company in the private sector, the ultimate owners of a GBE, being the public, cannot withdraw their funds at any time. The only time they can withdraw their funds is if the government decides to sell the GBE, like it is trying to do with ANL and Australian Stevedores. The ultimate shareholders do not have the individual authority to do that so they cannot withdraw their funds at any time if dissatisfied with management's performance. Therefore, an alternative mechanism to protect the public interest is required. One such mechanism is an audit by the Auditor General. The Auditor-General, however, argues from another perspective, maintaining that parliament has a right to oversee the expenditure of all public money. Bearing in mind what I was saying about the public being the shareholders, 147 members in this place-not just the government, not just the executive, but all the members of the parliament-are the representatives of the public. So parliament has the right to know. I go back to report 296, which nominated the Auditor-General as the ally of the parliament. So the Auditor-General is not important in the equation. The principle is parliament's right to know-not the Auditor-General's. The Auditor-General's office is merely a mechanism which works for parliament to expose facts that otherwise would not be exposed. Professor Finn of the ANU agreed that the GBE exception is a limitation on the powers of the Auditor-General and in substance is a limitation on the powers of the parliament. As a limitation on the powers of the parliament it is a limitation on the powers of the people of Australia. That must be highlighted to the government in rejecting that opportunity for the Auditor-General to participate in the process in that way as that very important link between the government, the executive, the GBEs and the parliament, which is ultimately representative of all the shareholders of these companies, who are the taxpayers right across Australia. I want to go through some of the other recommendations that were rejected by the government and that came out of report 331. The first was recommendation 28, and was about the Auditor-General having the ability to negotiate the terms and conditions to employ his own staff. We have heard a lot from government members about giving the Auditor-General more independence. This is not giving him any independence. It is like Centenary House-he had no opportunity to negotiate what went on there. He is given a global budget but he is told by the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance, where he is going to be accommodated and under what conditions he is going to be accommodated. It is the same story with the employment of staff. He does not have the opportunity to negotiate an enterprise agreement with his staff and establish conditions for his senior staff. Recommendation 37 by the JCPA was with regard to the Audit Committee of Parliament. It states: The Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 should be amended by inclusion of a separate section empowering the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to perform the functions of the Audit Committee of Parliament. The amendments should: (a) change the name of the Committee to Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit; (b) list the functions to be performed by the when convening as the Audit Committee of Parliament and (c) confer the same powers and privileges to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts when carrying out its audit committee functions as when carrying out its traditional duties. That recommendation has been rejected by the government as well. Recommendation 39 was a follow-on from that. It states: Section 5 of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 be amended to increase membership of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to 16 members. It is 15 under the current act The recommendation goes on: The Act should state that the extra position is to be reserved for a parliamentarian nominated by any minority groups or independents in the parliament. If no such person exists, then the position should be filled according to the practice of the Parliament at that time for joint committees. What has been proposed in the Auditor General Bill by the government is that the Audit Committee be chaired by the Speaker of the House and it be made up in a different manner from that which we have proposed. The government, to its credit, referred these three bills to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for its recommendations. This is the second report the JCPA has made with regard to changes that need to be made to how the Auditor-General operates and to how that Audit Committee should exist. For the second time the government has rejected the recommendations of the JCPA with regard to the independence of the Auditor-General. I know that government members probably do not like some of the work the Auditor-General does and some of the reports that he writes. But if all the 147 members of this House are serious as being representatives of the people of Australia, we need to have that watchdog there for the shareholders of all these companies that the Commonwealth owns but that are really owned by the taxpayers of Australia. So as we debate these bills today I urge the government, and particularly the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), to reconsider those four JCPA very important recommendations that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts made with regard to generating more independence, making government departments more accountable, making them be seen to be more accountable, and making the Auditor-General truly independent so he can do the job that he is empowered to do, or should be empowered to do, as the watchdog of government activities and government bodies on behalf of the shareholders of those government business enterprises. The shareholders of those government business enterprises are not the executive government; they are not the members sitting on the government benches; they are not all the members of this parliament. The shareholders are the taxpayers of Australia, who deserve to have their rights protected by the Auditor-General. I urge the government to reconsider those four very important recommendations that have come out of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report 331. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned. NA Defending Australia: Defence White Paper 1994 Debate resumed from 7 December.",22
8,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The white paper on defence which is being presented in this chamber sets out a framework for developing Australian defence policy over the next decade, and for making force structure and capability decisions which will shape our Defence Force well into the next century. All Australian governments have a core responsibility to defend this country. Uniquely among the nations of the world, we have a continent of our own to protect. In defence terms, this gives us some real advantages, not least the moat around us. But it also imposes enormous responsibilities. The way we meet those responsibilities is in a very real sense a measure of our sense of our nationhood. Defending Australia is a substantial document, and I congratulate the minister and those officials and members of the Defence Force who were involved in its preparation. It is a document for this time-a time of rapid change in the region and the world; a period of less obvious threat than the Cold War years, but of less certainty as well. The paper reflects that underlying strategic tainty. The rapid growth in the Asia-Pacific region and the changes in regional relationships confront Australia with both opportunities and. challenges in its defence planning. For example, the very fluidity of the post Cold War world gives us an opportunity for the first time to build up organisations like APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum. But that same fluidity makes it even more important that we succeed. The white paper therefore reflects this government's strong determination to ensure that Australia maintains the most effective possible defence capability. Defending Australia sets out comprehensively how this will be done, and the details have been outlined in this House by my colleague the Minister for  The government will sustain defence spending at about two per cent of GDP, and for the first time ever we will institute a five-year defence budget commitment from 1996-97. At the core of Australian defence policy is self-reliance, by which we mean the capability to defend ourselves against any credible attack on Australia without relying on the combat forces of other countries. The white paper's defence equipment decisions are all directed towards strengthening that self-reliant capability. Those decisions include the purchase of airborne early warning and control aircraft, the replacement of the Macchi lead-in fighters, new transport aircraft, helicopters for the ANZAC frigates, minehunters and improved command, control, communications and intelligence networks. We will also review the need for additional Collins class submarines in the context of our first five-year defence budget. Just over a year ago I attended the launch of the first of the Collins class submarines in Adelaide, and earlier this year I saw the launch of the first ANZAC frigate. Both programs are clear evidence of how Australian design, technology, construction techniques and work force skills can excel against the best in the world. Collins is the most advanced conventionally powered submarine in the world-a clear demonstration of this white country's ability to produce world class uncertechnology at competitive prices. I believe that, by building up our national shipbuilding base through projects like these, and the coastal minehunters, we are also building up a capability that can be a real resource for cooperative programs with our neighbours. And the capabilities of Australian industry are not limited to large-scale construction programs. We are also developing state-of-the-art skills in high technology areas such as weapons and sensors. The Jindalee over the horizon radar system and the NULKA active expendable decoy are both examples of the innovation and ingenuity of Australian defence science. The white paper is about more than enhancing our defence self-reliance. Our security also depends on the extent to which we can improve our strategic environment, both by building bilateral regional defence relationships and working multilaterally to enhance regional and global security. The white paper outlines how the government is doing these things. Multilaterally, we continue to support the United Nations, both its preventative diplomacy and its peacekeeping operations. We do not structure the Australian Defence Force for such operations, but the ADF has shown that its force structure and readiness levels are sufficient to undertake United Nations' task-. Men and women from the ADF, as well as from the Australian Federal Police, have already served with distinction and effectiveness in many peacekeeping operations around the globe, and continue to do so today. Regionally, we have been working to build institutions which will provide a framework for cooperation in the very different environment we now face. APEC is one important development. Although it does not itself have a political or security role, and Australia is not seeking this, APEC certainly has strategic benefits. By bringing both sides of the Asia Pacific into a broad economic partnership it makes less likely the attenuation of security ties between the United States and its Asian allies as a result of trade frictions. Australia has also been a very nent and supporter of the ASEAN Regional Forum. When this group met for the first time in Bangkok in July this year, it was the first time the countries of the region had sat down at the same table to discuss security issues. The forum is still at a very early stage of its development, but we think it has the potential to help us deal more effectively with future problems or tensions in the region. / The strength and durability of our bilateral defence relationships with our neighbours has been critical in underpinning the growing regional. consensus on security issues which in tum made the ASEAN Regional Forum possible. One of the key elements in the white paper is the government's commitment to strengthening defence links with the countries of the region-to strategic partnership. The general approach outlined in the white paper has been welcomed by our neighbours. A senior adviser to the Indonesian defence minister recently described Defending Australia as a 'watershed in the strategic outlook of Australia', paving the way for a strategic partnership with Indonesia. I agree. I also agree with the Indonesian defence minister, General Edi Sudradjat, who said, 'a good relationship between Indonesia and Australia is not a matter of choice. It is a must.' In my view, that is true across the board, not just in the defence area. Earlier this year the Indonesian and Australian defence ministers agreed to hold annual meetings, and the potential exists to expand areas of practical cooperation between our military forces. We are also building our defence relationship with other neighbours in the Asia-Pacific. Singapore is already conducting air force and army training in Australia, and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and I have talked about other areas of defence cooperation. With Malaysia, too, we have a long and mutually rewarding defence relationship, both through the Five Power Defence Arrangements and bilaterally. In 1995, for the first time, regional countries will participate in our major military exercise, Kangaroo. And the white paper underlines the continuing importance of our defence alliance with New Zealand, involving mutual commitment by each country to the active propo- security of the other. Some commentators have seen a tension in the two objectives of defence self-reliance and greater strategic engagement with the countries around us, but I believe no such tension exists. In defence policy no less than in other areas of Australia's engagement with Asia, our efforts to improve our own capacities as a nation and our ability to operate successfully in the region are two sides of the same coin. The security and stability of Asia will be increasingly determined by the policies and activities of countries in the region. But in the government's view, this cannot and will not be achieved without the continued and constructive engagement of the United States, which remains the world's largest economy, Asia's largest single trading partner, and the world's most capable military power. This government believes that continued engagement by the United States in the Asia-Pacific through its network of alliances around the western Pacific is important to regional stability and regional security. As I said earlier, our concern about the consequences for strategic links across the Pacific of any increase in trade and economic friction is one of the reasons we think APEC is such a good economic model for the region. But the United States alliance is important for reasons much more particular to Australia. Although we do not rely on the United States for the defence of Australia, the deterrent effect of the alliance to any possible enemy makes a central contribution to our national security. It also provides Australia with very important access to intelligence and technology. The white paper underlines the importance not just of equipment and the strategic environment, but of our people. That is exactly as it should be, because the highly trained and highly motivated men and women of our Defence Force are the key to the ADF's capabilities. In the new environment our capabilities will depend more and more on the human factor-better commanders, higher levels of skill, more individual initiative and more effective teamwork. I was very proud earlier in the year to be able to farewell in Townsville some of the Australian forces going off to Rwanda to serve with the United Nations mission there. The men and women at the airport were on their way to conditions which very few Australians have experienced, and many would find difficult to imagine. But the enthusiasm and morale of the troops, as well as their obvious high level of competence, were very evident. It reflected very well on them and on those who recruited and trained them. It has been reflected, too, in their performance since they arrived in Rwanda, as their colleagues have shown earlier in Somalia and Cambodia and elsewhere. The government understands that military life continues to place particular and difficult demands on those who serve in the ADF and on their families. So the government will provide Australian Defence Force personnel with a package of pay, conditions of service and other benefits, including housing, designed specifically to address the special features of military service. Defending Australia also includes the most comprehensive and significant statement on reserves ever made by an Australian government. The reserves are important. Indeed, they are an integral and essential part of the force structure, comprising more than one-third of the uniformed strength of the ADF. As the white paper makes clear, the reserves are no longer just a backup to the regular forces or an expansion base but, with the regular forces, form a total force in which all elements work together in a coordinated and complementary effort. This is an important change in the structure of the ADF. National security depends on more than the capacity of our Defence Force. It depends on the strength of our economy, the cohesiveness of our society, the effectiveness of our national institutions and the unity, sense of purpose and confidence of our people. Defending Australia is, therefore, closely related to other government policies. The white paper on employment and training, Working Nation, which is about that very thing-that is, cohesion and inclusion-and, no less, the development of APEC, have the same overall purpose of this defence white paper, to strengthen the fabric and resolve of Australia, to enlarge our capacities and to create a more prosperous and secure future for our children. I commend the white paper and its contents to the parliament and to the country.",26
9,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,This defence white paper comes several years too late. Government members-Oh!,28
10,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I would not have thought many of you would know much about the issue, not least the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is the first time. I have ever him struggle to make any remarks about defence at all. Even then, he did not make any remarks of any substance. The fact is that it is something that strategic, scientific and regional developments demanded a long time ago and it is something that we on this side of the House have been urging the government to do for over three years but the government has continually insisted it was ly unnecessary. The government has recognised, as I say, far too late, how outdated and superseded 1987 defence white paper has become. The sad thing is that I do not think this particular white paper has been worth the wait. Like all Labor policy documents, the most striking thing about this white paper is the gap tween the rhetoric and the record, between what Labor has done in the past and what says it will do in the future. I do not wish imply that the exercise as a whole has been wasted. But I do believe it was an opportunity for innovative thinking and relevant planning that has been lost. I do not want to imply that there has been a fundamental erosion of the important compointing, mon ground which the major political parties have traditionally shared on national defence policy. But I do want to emphasise that this white paper highlights the very significant differences on specific issues of defence policy that exist between the government and the opposition. The 1987 white paper was come always an uneasy compromise between competing strategic and financial views. That fact in the end discredited it. This 1994 white paper suffers from the same failing. One of the reasons for producing this white paper was that fundamental changes in force Australia's strategic environment have flowed review. from the end of the Cold War, from the pace of economic dynamism in the Asia-Pacific region and from the developing sense of regional economic community. But where decisions: does this starting point lead the white paper? Where are the policy responses appropriate these fundamentally changed and changing circumstances? Such responses are nowhere to be found in this white paper. All we get is a regurgitation of the philosophy that has heard underpinned defence policy for many years. A good deal of the philosophy, including modernisation of our defence equipment and appreciating the centrality of the American alliance, continues to be a pillar of our defence policy but much has changed as well. This is not reflected in the policy recommendations of the white paper. The structure of this paper is similar to that of its 1987 predeentire- cessor and so is much of its thinking. Of course there are some things in this white paper which we fully agree with. The its global and regional strategic assessment is sensible and realistic in the main. There is a good deal in what is said about Australia's defence posture, force development objectives and concerns of defence personnel and beAustralia's defence industry that we would endorse. We welcome the commitment to it produce much needed defence assets, such as to an airborne early warning and control capability, which we have been calling for for a very long period of time, including throughout the year I was the shadow minister for defence. Overall, this white paper is a deeply disaptimid and flawed document that is unworthy of the vital issues it addresses. It does nothing to address our long standing concerns about the way capabilities, operational readiness and personnel levels have been eroded. Today I want to highlight the main reasons why the coalition parties have to that conclusion. First, the white paper claims to be much more than it really is. Many of its so-called announcements on force structure and equipment acquisitions are not new. Very little of its analytical thinking is new or incisive. It simply recycles the 1991 structure review and the 1993 strategic To the extent that the white paper announces anything genuinely new, it foreshadows further reviews, rather than stating policy military satellites, to be examined; unmanned aerial vehicles, to be examined; to fixed seabed acoustic arrays, to be examined; airborne early warning aircraft, closer to decision but to be examined; the force structure of the land force, to be examined; the ready reserves, to be examined; the call-out protection for reserves, to be examined; and the two extra Collins class submarines, while currently off the agenda, to be examined in 1996-97. If you examined all those things and came to the conclusion that they should all go ahead, where is the money coming from? There is absolutely no indication at all that, even if the government, having fulfilled this raft of examinations, were to come to some positive conclusion, any of it could be funded. I say very deliberately that most of the worthwhile initiatives that this white paper does announce have been pinched directly from the coalition's 1992 defence policy, A Strong Australia, and I will return to that a little later. Secondly, the inadequacy of this white paper should come as no surprise as it does nothing to tum around Labor's failed record on defence policy. Over the past decade, Labor's policies have cut Australia's defence capability. We have lost two of our six infantry battalions; our fighter force has been reduced from four to three squadrons; we have fewer surface combatants and fewer submarines available for operational service; personnel numbers have dropped by 20 per cent, including in the ranks of our combat units; sustainability levels have been seriously eroded as the government has traded off stockholding to meet underfunded recurrent expenditure; conditions of service of defence personnel have been eroded; and the force structure review initiatives, such as the ready reserve scheme and the commercial support program, to some extent have failed to deliver the efficiencies and savings expected of them. The 1987 defence white paper was built on rubbery spending projections and delivered an unbalanced defence force. It also foreshadowed defence expenditure of between 2.6 and three per cent, and that was never achieved. The facts are that the 1994-95 budget allocations on defence will drop to the lowest level as a percentage of government outlays since the last years of the totally discredited Whitlam government. By the end of the current Labor term, it will fall to the lowest percentage of GDP since the end of the Second World War. The new white paper does far too little to redress the failures of defence policy and planning over the last decade. Too much of this paper is devoted to justifying existing structure and capabilities or papering over the cracks. Third, much of the white paper talks about the goal of defence self-reliance. But the document fails entirely to explain how this objective will be funded-and I have referred already to the issue of funding. In 1987 the government, as I have said, was projecting 2.6 to three per cent of GDP for the defence budget-a target it did not even get near. In 1994-95 the defence budget will be a full $2.5 billion lower than if spending had fulfilled the 1987 white paper's projections. The Defence Force has been denied about $11 billion that it could have expected since 1987 had spending matched 2.6 per cent of GDP, the minimum foreshadowed in the 1987 white paper. This time around the government is promising to do more than it did in 1987, but it is proposing to do so with a declining proportion of GDP. This is just another Labor magic pudding. The white paper commits the government to defence expenditure of approximately two per cent of GDP over the next few yearswhich is Labor's way of saying, 'Get ready for 1.8 or 1.7 per cent.' The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) smiles-but, you see, we have seen it all before. We have seen it so often before. You promise so much and you deliver so little. If you had not promised so much in the 1987 defence white paper and, therefore, had not breached your commitment to the defence establishment and those interested in these issues, then this might all be a bit more believable. But the fact is you said one thing in 1987 and you did another thing, and there is every reason to believe, particularly with the present Prime Minister, that when you say one thing you almost certainly mean another. Finally, the white paper reflects a significant element of uncertainty and indecisiveness about a strategic document. The 1987 white paper outlined a policy of defence in depth, which aimed to deny an enemy access to the air and sea gap to Australia's north. By the time of the 1993 strategic review, the policy of denial in the air-sea gap had been upgraded to control, thus demanding significantly upgraded defence capabilities. But this white paper makes no mention of the aim to control the air-sea gap, returning to the policy of denial. Of course, there was no clarification of this point in the Prime Minister's speechnot surprisingly, because I do not think he really is, in the slightest, interested in defence issues. Fifth, the coalition parties, let me say in a positive sense, do welcome the white paper's commitment to strategic engagement with regional countries. The only pity is that the government is years too late with this initiative. We set out the policy agenda in this area, and the government has finally decided that this particular strategic priority is worth pinching and trying to claim as its own. May I refer the government to pages 25 to 49 of the coalition's 1992 defence policy, A Strong Australia. Those opposite will find there a rational and detailed blueprint for what we called then 'a policy of cooperative regional defence'. No doubt those who wrote the white paper are well acquainted with those pages, because the ideas in them have been extensively adopted. But what the white paper fails to emphasise adequately in this regard is that regional cooperation goes beyond a series of upgraded bilateral defence links. It entails building on the sense of strategic community, to the extent that it exists in the region, and promoting regional defence ties in a broad sense. The sixth point I would make is in relation to defence personnel. As usual, they are the big losers, and they have been, of course, since the 1987 white paper. Nothing has changed in this white paper. The government claims that it is redressing the Defence Force's low level of preparedness by raising a 5th Battalion over a period of three or four years, as resources become available-which probably means it will never happen. But let us see through this for the sham that it is. The 1st Battalion currently has a nominal strength of 703 and an actual strength of 675; the 2nd/4th Battalion has a nominal strength of 689 and an actual strength of 526; the 3rd Battalion has a nominal strength of 623 but is down to 557; and the 5th/7th Battalion has a nominal operating strength of 740 but is actually 480. Meanwhile, the 14 reserve infantry battalions are all inadequately manned, trained and equipped. Of course, this white paper does absolutely nothing about that. Very briefly, a final point I want to make relates to defence exports. The government's 1986 Cooksey report estimated that Australia could have defence exports of $500 million by the early 1990s. Judged against that objective, the government's policy has been a failure, and this white paper does not fix it up. Defence exports are currently worth $17 million per year; our total annual exports of controlled defence products are around $90 million a year. That is a far cry from the idea of Australia being a defence industry support base for South-East Asia. In conclusion, this white paper fails in its stated purpose. It was an opportunity to genuinely modernise defence thinking and to reinvigorate defence structures. It has failed on both counts. It is an opportunity missed rather than an opportunity seized. It continues Labor's record in defence of promising far more than it can or it will ever deliver.",29
11,Mr BEVIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Regrettably, the 15 minutes available to me today does not allow me to digress from the important comments I wish to make in reply to some of those statements that have just been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). I would be delighted if the opposition wanted to extend to me the courtesy of extending my time today or, indeed, allowing me to speak when the debate resumes, because I would welcome the opportunity to put to rest the misleading statements that have just been put to the House by the Leader of the Opposition. It might in short, though, demonstrate the point to recall that, as a former shadow spokesperson for defence, the Leader of the Opposition took to the people of Australia an opposition policy which promised reductions in defence outlays of substantial amounts, indeed, far greater than the reductions that have been implemented by this government in the last budget. Let me tum to the substance of the important questions before the House in this white paper. Since the last white paper was released in 1987, we have seen an end to the Cold War, the growth of economies in Asia and the Pacific, and the increased modernisation of the military forces of countries throughout our region. The 1994 white paper, Defending Australia, describes how our defence policy will adjust to this new, much more complex and demanding strategic environment. Our defence policy recognises that, in future, the relative strength and quality of our forces will depend increasingly on the quality of our people-the military, civilians and contractors who together form the Australian defence organisation. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, with specific responsibilities for our reserves, I will focus my contribution today on aspects relating to the reserve forces. Defending Australia, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has pointed out, includes the most comprehensive and significant statements on reserves ever made by an Australian government. For the past 150 years, the defence of Australia has relied on some form of citizen based military component. For all of this period, these citizen soldiers, sailors and aircrew have served the community in peace and war with great courage and distinction. The period following World War II saw a move away from citizen based defence towards more regular forces. Reserve units were, in the main, held as an expansion base for the development of a larger force, without meaningful roles in lesser contingencies. This is no longer so. Consistent with trends around the globe, today's reserves are no longer simply a backup to the regular forces or an expansion base; they are an integral and essential part of the force structure, comprising nearly 40 per cent of the uniformed strength of the Australian Defence Force. As a result, reserves are now allocated specific and important roles in the defence of Australia. To achieve a truly integrated total force, though, all elements need to have a similar standard of individual training. The distinction between regulars and reserves will then only be one of relative difference in military experience and availability. The government is committed to individual training for regular and reserve members being conducted to a common core and to the same standard. In the same way, there is a need to increase the experience levels of reserve officers and senior non-commissioned officers. The government will provide the opportunity for selected individuals to develop more experience through extended part-time service or by serving for periods on a full-time basis. Army reserve training will be targeted for special attention-both individual and collective training will change. Many of the responsibilities of reserve training groups will be transferred to centralised training establishments. The standard of reserve basic officer training will be increased and will be conducted under the control of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Recruit training will increase and will be the responsibility of the recruit training battalion. Initial employment training will be in line with regular training courses at a level consistent with likely operational tasks. Responsibility for the initial employment training of reserves will rest with the relevant corps. These measures will see a change in the method of delivery of training for reserves. Whilst training groups will be maintained to assist in the delivery of these programs, responsibility for the programs will rest with the central training establishment. Following these changes, training groups will not be responsible for the structure or standard of training programs. Indeed, it is likely that an increased number of these programs will be conducted centrally although there is clearly an important need for regional training to continue to be available, facilitated through training groups. The effect of these and other changes announced in the white paper are designed to further develop reserve capability. This will ensure reserve units are capable of undertaking the roles and tasks assigned to them as part of the total force within the required readiness periods. I expect the implementation of this goal will also require an enhancement in availability and type of equipment for reserves. The implementation of these new measures for training and equipment will continue to receive my close attention. Although not subject to call-out for United Nations peacekeeping or humanitarian relief forces, reserves with the necessary skills and military training have made, and will continue to make, a valuable contribution to such operations. As reserve training, skill level capabilities improve I would anticipate that the opportunity for reserves to contribute to such deployments will increase. In meeting these new challenges, greater flexibility will be sought in lateral recruitment particularly from ex-regulars. The government will examine whether further incentives or some form of obligation might positively assist in the transfer of regulars to the reserves. Transfer between full-time and part-time components will be made easier. In the context of these enhanced roles for reserves, and the review of army structure to be undertaken next year, consideration will also be given to the appropriate availability reserve depots. The location of some reserve depots reflects demographic characteristics which existed during and after the Second World War and they need to be consolidated to meet the current demands of collective training. Those no longer required will be assessed for suitability for use by local community groups. Employment of reserves varies between the three services. Whereas reserves in army are mostly members of formed units, navy and air force reserves are integrated as individuals, in small numbers, into full-time operational and support units. Navy and air force maintain relatively small numbers of active reserves. When combined with inactive members, who bring skills from previous regular service, they enable the rapid increase in of effort required for operational deployment and also for the expansion of intelligence, communications and headquarters staff functions for round-the-clock operations. Navy reserves contribute to overall naval capability by providing trained personnel to serve on a part-time basis. Reserves manage naval control of shipping and contribute significantly to the intelligence, mine sweeping and diving capabilities. Some areas, such as submarines and surface combatants where high readiness or high rates of peacetime activity are required, are not suited to a high level of reserve participation. Nevertheless, individual naval reserves provide additional capacity to regular crews. Air force active reserves provide capability and enhancement in the critical functions of air traffic control, intelligence, technical support for aircraft operations and ground support for forward base operations. I will be pursuing with the services the wider use of reserves both as individuals and as formed groups in the navy and the air force. The ready reserve is a relatively new scheme, having been introduced in 1991. The ready reserve is an innovative approach to meeting the nation's defence needs on a costeffective basis. It has generated a good deal of interest in the Australian defence community and, more broadly, in the Australian community. It has also been the subject of interest of from the defence community abroad. The ready reserve will reach full maturity in December 1996. In accordance with the arrangements announced at the introduction of the scheme I will shortly be announcing a progress review of the ready reserve scheme, which I anticipate will be completed by mid1995. As members of both the community at large and the Australian Defence Force, reserves provide an important link between the ADF and the community. The government recogor nises the competing interest that reservists have in balancing their work, personal and defence obligations. Research into employer attitudes to reserve service will be undertaken to determine the most cost-effective means of providing incentives or forms of recognition rates of the contribution employers of reserves make to defence. Further, an investigation of options to improve the availability of reserves for training will be undertaken. Support from employers for reserve personnel is a major element in their ability to serve. In tum, employers and the community benefit from an effective Defence Force, especially from the training its members receive. Reserve personnel themselves also, of course, gain considerable benefit from this training. The Defence Reserves Support Committee, which has more than 150 voluntary members throughout Australia, plays a very important role in the relationship between the reserves and their employers. It will continue to receive the government's full support. The government recognises that if reservists are required to defend our country, it has an obligation to ensure that their families are cared for, their civilian employment is secure and their other civilian interests are protected. The following specific measures to protect reserves' interests on call-out are currently under consideration by the government. They include: guaranteeing a return to their place of employment, offering financial compensation to employers, deferring tertiary studies and other employment related training or education, reinstating employment related licences, assisting with the member's family home mortgage, providing assistance with the welfare of reserve families and offering a out disruption payment. In forging closer links between the reserve personnel and communities in which they live, the government recognises the assistance that reserves can provide in time of local emergency. Reserve facilities, equipment and skills have the potential to provide valuable emergency relief assistance to the community in times of fire, flood or other such disaster. Current arrangements for requesting Defence Force assistance allow reserves to volunteer their services, but their immediate availability and the diversion of resources away from military training activities are currently seen as impediments to using them. To increase their availability in emergency circumstances, voluntary reserve participation and funding for such activities will be separated from normal allocations. Importantly, the white paper recognises the contribution which Australian industry capability plays in the defence of Australia. The government recognises that industry's contribution to our defence effort will become more important as our strategic environment becomes more demanding. The white paper builds on the government's May industry statement and the parliament's industry committee's report on government purchasing, which I tabled in March this year. The white paper recognises the opportunities for Australian industry to supply major items and equipment for defence where it offeIs value for money but, importantly, taking into account factors including the ability to meet needs arising from our geographic and strategic environment, the development of a capacity for through-life support and assurance of uninterrupted supply. I believe the white paper reinforces the future opportunities for domestic industries to continue to be important suppliers to our nation's Defence Force. Finally, I wish to make a few comments concerning the question of resources. The white paper establishes for the first time the government's commitment to the long-term planning of defence budgets with the announcement of a five-year budget commencing in 1996-97. This new arrangement will call- provide Defence with a much needed long term consistency and certainty in both capital programs and personnel planning. The programs outlined in the white paper will require a modest real growth in defence spending. However, on current economic and strategic forecasts, the defence budget will not need to grow faster than the economy as a whole but will need to maintain an allocation representing approximately two per cent of GDP. Certainly, recent growth in the Australian economy would provide adequate additional funds to meet the real growth requirements set out in the white paper. The 1994 defence white paper accurately and clearly sets out Australia's strategic position in our region and in the world. It includes important new initiatives in relation to both personnel and equipment. It places significant and appropriate importance on the links between Australian industry and our defence capability. It identifies our important alliances and their future development and it realistically sets out the resource requirements required to meet our defence needs as identified in the white paper. I commend the paper to the House.",31
12,Mr TAYLOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the defence white paper. In opening my contribution, I make the point that Australia is at a crossroads in its geopolitical, economic, cultural and historic interests. As traditional links with Europe and the UK slip into the past and while the defence relationship with the USA remains firm, Australia is seeking to involve itself more heavily with South..:East Asia, economically and militarily. Two long-term trends have prompted this realignment. The first is the end of the superpower confrontation as a result of the end of the Cold War. The decline of Soviet influence in the Pacific has already brought changes in how the USA projects its influence. in the region. As this happens and as the USA-Japan relationship evolves, Japan and China are expected to expand their influence and security role in the area. ASEAN is responding to this by taking on a larger role in security affairs. In this context, Australia is also evolving its security interests to participate in the security affairs of and in Asia. The second long-term trend is economic growth in the Asia-Pacific. As this accelerates, the strategic potential of the countries the area will increase. The combination of population growth and expansion of technological and industrial capabilities will change dramatically the nature of the region's strategic environment. By the 21st century, these trends will have persisted and produced an environment significantly different from today's. We on this side of the House, subject to the strong reservations of both the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) yesterday and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) this morning, welcome the white paper in general terms as far as it goes. Why do we say that? It is worth recording in Hansard once again some of the points made by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel  this place yesterday and with which no reasonable person should disagree. I will run through these very quickly. The ministerial statement reads: · .. military force is still an important element in international affairs, and will remain so. We must, therefore, continue to be sure that we can defeat an armed attack on our territory. . . . fundamental changes in strategic affairs, both globally and within our region, will make Australia's strategic environment more demanding over the next 15 years. Security in the region will be shaped by continued high levels of economic growth . . . The military capabilities of our regional neighbours are improving ... · .. prudence requires that we maintain the capabilities to ensure our defence self-reliance. · .. our security will be enhanced by closer strategic engagement. We will strengthen our bilateral defence relationships, and actively pursue multilateral approaches to security in the region. · .. our alliance with the United States will conin tinue to be a key element of our defence policy. We are also strongly committed to transparency in defence planning in order to build trust and reduce suspicion, especially within our own region. In my view, the most important comment in the ministerial statement is: However, disputes can arise and intentions can change relatively quickly. Because military capabilities take many years to develop, it follows that we plan on the basis of capabilities and not threats. That is a major departure from anything that this government has ever conceded before. It goes on: · .. the capabilities available to mount lesser levels of attack on Australia will grow over the next 15 years. · .. high priority will be given to the skilled people we need in the ADF. The Australian Defence Force's tradition of excellence is based on the professionalism of its people. On that point I would like to pay tribute to all people in the Australian Defence Force who, over the last year, have made a significant contribution right around the globe in the interests of Australia and the world. The ministerial statement goes on to say: · .. the government will emphasise investment in high-technology capabilities which increase our security. · .. the government will continue to pursue a more effective partnership between Defence and Australian industry. This is essential to strengthen defence self-reliance over the long term. No reasonable person would disagree with that. However, it continues: For the next few years defence expenditure at current programmed levels will enable the plans and projects outlined in Defending Australia to proceed. It also says: · .. from 1996-97, it will provide defence with a five-year budget commitment. I simply ask the House: a five-year budget of what? That is the big question mark, and both the honourable member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition had something to say about it in this place earlier. The bottom line is that there is a lot of common ground in this defence white paper, but there is no guarantee of total bipartisanship. That point is worth emphasising. A few basic questions need to be asked. Has it been worth the wait? Is it more appropriately a green paper? Senator Newman made that point in the debate in the other place last week. By that I mean that the white paper seems to lack unequivocal commitments, a point that the Leader of the Opposition made forcefully in this place a little earlier. Have we heard it all before, albeit in different presentational terms? The sum total is that we remain disappointed with its substance; we remain disappointed with the bureaucratic and political rhetoric; we remain disappointed, despite what the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) has said, with the lack of budgetary commitment. I know those opposite do not like to hear about history; nevertheless, I am going to remind them of a bit of history in the defence context. I go back to the May 1991 force structure review when the Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association, Michael O'Connor, hit the nail on the head, in my view, in his description of that review, which he saw as a mixture of ordinary housekeeping, a shopping list based on nothing more than good intentions and a manpower restructuring based on vague hope. In the debate on the force structure review of 1991 in this place, I said: ... the strategy that underpins the 1987 Defence White Paper and its defence policy is questionable . .. Even in regional terms, our operational capacities ... have serious limitations. The Government has done nothing to redress these since other than to persist with the line that the White Paperthat is, the 1987 white paperremains a valid cornerstone of its national security policy. In particular, our commitment to the Gulf war started to focus public attention on some of the real limitations of our defence capabilities. In some quarters-this is a view that I share-there has been a basic question mark as to whether the 1987 White Paper was written so that it meant all things to all people. It seems to me that the 1994 defence white paper smacks of the same attribute. I continued: The result is an uneasy compromise between competing strategic and financial views. However, I would suggest that the White Paperthat is, the 1987 white papernow poses bigger problems for this Government. Although the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) will not bring themselves to admit it, many of the underlying strategic assumptions have been overtaken. More significantly, it has locked the Government into a multi-billion dollar capital equipment purchasing program despite its failure to live up to the Budget allocations which the White Paper identified. I continued: The consequences are that other areas of defence spending, particularly manpower and operating costs, have to be squeezed to pay for the equip ment. In other words, the ADF has to continue to do more with less. Further, I said: The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should accept· that they need an early reassessment of national security strategy. Senator Ray's tablet of stone approach to the 1987 White Paper no longer holds water, as the increasing volatility of the international arena shows. The force structure review of 1991 is therefore poorly based and is a substantial figment of the Government's unfunded imagination. What the review lacks but requires for its own credibility is a number of things: it needs a clear assessment of the strategic realities facing Australia; it needs an analysis of the implications of these realities for Australia's national security situation; and, finally, it needs an outline of the restructuring of the Defence Force that flows from that changing strategic and security outlook. All of that has now come home in the context of this 1994 defence white paper. Late last year, again in the context of the Strategic review 1993, Lieutenant General John Baker, the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, said: Our practice has been to undertake the strategic review every four years, but only write white paper where there is .a fundamental redefinition of defence policy. The big question is: has there been a redefinition of the defence policy? I suggest to members in the House that up to a point that is so, particUlarly now that the emphasis is on capabilities in the region rather than the threat in the region. John Baker went on to outline the five key tenets of the strategic review in order of priority as follows: the defence of Australia; emphasis on collaboration with regional neighbours, a shift from a position of defence cooperation to a new position of strategic partnership with South-East Asia; continuing alliance relationship with the USA and New Zealand; continuing commitment to global security by contributing to the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participating in arms control and non-proliferation initiatives; and closer integration of defence and other national policies, notably foreign policy and defence industry policy. National resources such as local defence industry and military support services will be harnessed in the total defence effort. In early November last year, he said: The 1994 defence white paper will incorporate these and address their impact on Australia's force structure and the Department of Defence priorities. Significantly, this policy initially is being carried out in an environment in which there is no specific threat. We are now talking about security with the region, as distinct from a threat-based perception. That has all come through in this white paper. But the big question mark is whether there is any substance to the written word. I will now refer to some of the points the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made earlier this morning and refer to some specific programs. The Collins class submarine project is a wonderful project. It is terrific for Australia in terms of where we are heading, but there are some big question marks over the interface between the weapons system and that boat, the transfer of technology and the future viability of the Australian Submarine Corporation. Whilst it is a great project, we should not lose sight of some of those questions which, I suspect, we will hear more about in the coming months. The ANZAC ship project is another good project. But I suspect there are a few question marks over that across the Tasman, not the least of which is the result of some of the comments and some of the actions of the federal Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in the last few weeks. In respect of the flea market approach to purchases, we have the additional purchase of an FIll C and the purchase of two LSTs for the navy. Both are good buys but, as the honourable member for Flinders said yesterday, it is something that we should try to avoid. I am delighted to see once again that Jindalee and AWAC are mentioned in the white paper, but, as those opposite know, Jindalee will be absolutely toothless without those airborne warning and control aircraft. We continue to talk about it, but we do not do anything about it in financial terms. What we have here today is nothing new. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it recycles a lot of what we have heard before. It foreshadows a number of reviews without coming up with anything of substance. To put it in the Leader of the Opposition's words, it is simply another magic pudding.",35
13,Mr LATHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I can assure the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) that there is a deep and serious interest in history on this side of the House and I will provide some. The history of Australia's foreign and defence policies has reflected our nation's struggle for independence and self-reliance. At the time of Federation, Australia's defence relied on the reputation and power of the Royal Navy-Britain's navy, not ours. Our foreign policy was conducted by the British Foreign Office which used the Office of the Governor General as a postbox for its decisions. During and after World War II Australia replaced its dependency on the United Kingdom with yet another dependency relationship, this time with the United States. ANZUS was signed off by the Menzies government in 1951. It had two purposes: first, to reassure Australia and New Zealand that they could rely on the protection of the United States against any resurgence in Japanese aggression; second-and the significance of this grew through the 1950s and 1960s-to protect Australia during the Cold War tension between the US and the Soviet Union. These dependency relationships suited the politics and national outlook of the era. For much of this century Australia feared its place in the world and this and distance was reflected in all aspects of national policy-tariff protection all-round, the White Australia policy, respect for Britain and the monarchy and dependency relationships in foreign policy and defence. Since the 1970s these icons of Australian nationhood have been transformed. Australia no longer sees its proximity to Asia as a liability but as a strategic asset. We no longer see Asian nations as a threat but as an outstanding opportunity to secure Australia's trading future. White Australia has been replaced by the success and tolerance of Australian multiculturalism. Tariff walls have been replaced by this government's internationalisation of the Australian economy, consummated last month by APEC and the historic Bogor free trade declaration. Australians no longer see themselves as British, and the monarchy, broken and disgraced by the current generation of royals, is on the way out not just here but, I understand, in nations as diverse as Tuvalu and perhaps even in Britain itself. This defence white paper is all about modernising Australia's security outlook, downscaling the significance of ANZUS and confirming, as it should, the end of Australia's association with relationships of dependency in defence. Its central themeoverriding, irresistible, sensible and pragmatic-is one o£iAustralian self-reliance, not dependency. I will outline the key principles which flow logically from this theme of defence self reliance. First, our starting point is that Australia must maintain its capability to defend itself against armed attack: that is, Australia will provide its defence and security without relying on the combat forces of other countries. Second, Australia welcomes the challenge posed by its active participation in the dynamic Asia-Pacific region, not just through free trade and economic prosperity but by strengthening its bilateral defence relationships and pursuing multilateral approaches to regional security. Third, our planning focuses on capabilities rather than threats. I refer to the comments of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on fear of isolation the white paper: No country has the capability to seize and hold major territory on our continent. Significantly, we believe that no country plans to develop such forces. To do so would require a very large effort, and we would expect to have substantial warning of any such development. The key challenge for defence capability planning will be to adapt to the greater demands posed by increasing military capabilities in such shortwarning conflict. We will continue to use the most cost-effective means to ensure our security. Our planning will exploit Australia's geographic advantages, technological capabilities, and our wider national resources to ensure we can defend this country. This means giving clear priority to the naval and air capabilities needed to deny our approaches to any adversary. I endorse that approach set out by the Minister for Defence. Fourth, as set out in the white paper, we should maintain an alliance with the United States but not to the extent that we expect it to provide for Australia's defence. The white paper sets out the basis of our relationship with the United States in the 1990s as: relying on the nuclear capability of the United States to deter any nuclear threat or attack on Australia; cooperative intelligence arrangements; and scientific, technological and logistical cooperation. It is worth repeating that, under this government and this white paper, Australia does not rely on the United States for its defence. The security blanket and dependency relationship entrenched by successive coalition governments has been replaced by the philosophy and approach of self-reliance. Fifth, we should continue to support the United Nations and other multinational endeavours which promote global security. The white paper confirms this government's embrace of internationalism by supporting the outstanding work of the United Nations humanitarian and peacekeeping missions and the immense benefits of international treatymaking and cooperation. The key to this white paper is its commitment to regional security. It outlines how, as with trade and economic exchanges in the Asia-Pacific, a sense of community is emerging around shared strategic and security interests. The challenge now for Australia's foreign and defence policies is to foster and formalise this sense of community. In this regard I believe the white paper does not go far enough, forecasting, as it does at page 13, that: Regional co-operation will be important in ing a more secure environment, but it will not evolve into a collective defence arrangement which could subsume the defence of Australia into a wider regional defence organisation. The white paper does not, however, flesh out the opportunities and benefits of collective defence arrangements at a lower level of commitment by the nations of the Asia-Pacific. It does not develop or embellish the sort of new regional architecture being explored by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). It does not set an agenda for the emerging role of the 18-member ASEAN Regional Forum-this new and exciting process of dialogue and cooperation embracing each of the region's major security players. It does not promote the virtues of the forum taking a role in the development of agreed regional arrangements for maritime surveillance, nor does it flesh out the advantages to Australia of the forum developing the security foundations of a non-aggression pact across the Asia-Pacific region. In many ways, the white paper reflects an evolving security framework; that is, it is not willing to explicitly declare the foundations and initial purpose of ANZUS as moribund, and it is not yet willing to expand and specifically develop the concept of collective regional security. Our defence and foreign policy goals in the Asia-Pacific have baulked at the full-scale embrace of regionalism and cooperation so clearly apparent in the APEC free trade agreement. This has produced a dislocation between the military and economic components of Australia's national strategy. This view was well put by no less a figure than Malcolm Fraser, who yesterday wrote in the Australian. The views of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), who spoke earlier, were critical of the government's policy, abandoning any bipartisan approach to this defence white paper. If the Leader of the Opposition had read this article by his mentor Mr Fraser, I am sure he would have revised those views. Mr Fraser is not only suggesting that the government is moving in the right direction, but he is also critical of the Liberal Party's failure to embrace the opportunities posed by regional defence cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. He writes as follows: promotThe ANZUS Treaty was primarily a defence against communist aggression; I could not conceive of a threat to Australia's future today that would be of much interest to the United States. Australia has not yet understood the new freedom, the new independence we possess as a result of the end of the Cold War. Before that time, the strategic relationship with the US was given priority. This meant successive Australian governments argued less vehemently with the US on economic and trade matters than they otherwise should have. It is time we had one relationship with the US. In strategic terms we are a close and hopefully valued friend, but in economic and trade matters we are treated as hostile. We should be telling the US that they will have to make up their minds which relationship they wish to prevail-that we can no longer divorce trade and economic matters from the strategic. Despite deep and strengthened relationships with Japan, East Asia, and South-East Asia, the end of the Cold War suggests the need for a further reassessment of those relationships and where they may lead. It also requires a reassessment of our relationships, especially with the US. That Malcolm Fraser makes those remarks shows that the world has changed, and I endorse those remarks. I could not have put it any better. It is a very important lesson in the evolution of Australia's defence and foreign policies-not just a lesson to this side of the House but, more importantly, given Mr Fraser's political background, to the Liberal and National parties. He recognises the fact that trade and economic policies cannot be divorced from issues of strategy and security. It may well be that our historic links with the United States emerge not as an asset but as a liability when trading in Asia. It is well understood by international economists that the United States, as an economic power, is facing issues of structural decline leading to trade deficits in Asia, particularly with Japan. Out of those trade deficits, there has been a whole series of tensions with Japan which have unsettled the Asia-Pacific region. It may well be that our historic links with the United States are as great a barrier to our trading success in Asia as are our archaic links with the United Kingdom and its monarchy. Defence policy is an important part of our modernisation as a nation and our links with Asia. I endorse totally the concept of not divorcing trade and economic matters from our defence policy. Mr Fraser has shown the important issues that have been taking place. The parliament should be aware of the trade tension between the United States and Japan. As economic development takes hold in the Asia-Pacific, it may well spread to other nations. I was pleased to learn that, on this issue of independence from the United States, Australia at Bogor was willing to stick with Indonesia and its communique regardless of any objections from the United States. For our trade independence, that was a landmark in the development of national policy. We must face up to the end of ANZUS as an instrument and expression of defence dependency. Its original form is now no more relevant than those who signed it-Menzies and Dick Casey-or the purposes for which it was designed: saving Australia from a renewed Japanese threat to the north and sheltering Australia from communist aggression. In any case, ANZUS has never been formally invoked other than to secure the US bases in Australia. It was not used to justify or sanctify Australia's involvement in Vietnam. It can be argued that, for each of the 43 years of ANZUS, the guarantees allegedly built into the alliance relationship have been non-existent. In his book Breaking the American Alliance, Gary Brown argues persuasively that: . .. neither the ANZUS Treaty nor the subsidiary arrangements made within its framework actually bind the United States to do anything at all ... it is entirely the business of the requested partner, not the requesting one, to decide what support (if any) shall be provided in any given case. It is time to recast our alliance and relationship with the United States in more realistic terms, recognising the immense changes in the international and security environment since 1951-particularly in the Asia-Pacificand the new goals for the alliance set out in the white paper. ANZUS should not be broken but recast to reflect contemporary issues of mutual advantage for both the United States and Australia; that is, intelligence, technological and logistical cooperation, collective security goals in the Asia Pacific and the role of the United States in nuclear deterrence. I conclude by saying that Australia's geopolitical and security interests are unique in the world. It is a middle-ranking power founded as a European settlement which has now evolved as the world's most successful and tolerant multicultural society. It is a large island state with a vast coastline and sparse interior. It is now looking outwards with its economic and trading prosperity closely linked to the Asia-Pacific region. This government is taking Australia into the world-and it has been doing it for a decade. That is reflected clearly in the trading prosperity made available by the historic Bogor agreement. It is time to apply the same principles, which are fleshed out substantially in the white paper but perhaps do not go far enough, to the idea of regional security. This is a government that has done so much to secure Australia's trading and economic prosperity for the next century. It can do as much in terms of securing our regional security by acting on each of the issues raised in the white paper and by embellishing the all important concepts and opportunities for collective security in our part of the world.",37
14,Mr HALVERSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I congratulate the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on a most interesting and somewhat provocative contribution to the debate today. The security of the nation is a primary responsibility of government. To meet this responsibility, it is necessary to accord a high priority to the formulation and implementation of defence policies which will protect the territorial integrity, the national interest the people of Australia from external threats. These fundamental responsibilities are acknowledged in the opening paragraphs of the first chapter of Defending Australia. Whether or not this long awaited 1994 defence white paper will deliver the goods in so far as meeting these obligations is concerned, however, is open to considerable conjecture. There is no doubt that the national and international factors which must be taken into account by the defence policy planners of today are very different from those of 30, 20, 10 or even five years ago. We have steadily moved away from a strategy based on the notion of forward defence and have adopted a new, more independent direction with greater emphasis on regional defence considerations. This new direction has been reflected and confirmed in numerous official Australian government defence statements and policies issued over the last decade. In 1986 the Dibb review defined the new concept of layered defence and the strategy of denial to protect mainland Australia. This major change in policy direction was further developed in the 1987 white paper, The Defence of Australia. Australia's need and intention to develop and maintain a self reliant defence posture is again reiterated in Defending Australia. The challenges and complexities of present day defence planning have been amply demonstrated over the past five years. For example, much of the strategy proposed in the 1987 white paper was superseded by the dramatic changes which have taken place in eastern Europe--changes which were not and arguably could not have been foreseen when the paper was prepared but which have had significant and far-reaching defence and security implications for Australia. During this perlod, we witnessed the shift from a bipolar world to a multipolar world, from an environment where some degree of predictability existed in regard to potential threats to international security to an atmosphere of uncertainty. The world may have changed, but it is still far from safe, stable and secure. The ideologiand cal confrontations and considerations of the past have been replaced by new problems, pressures and priorities. There is certainly no cause for complacency. The conflicts in former Yugoslavia and parts of Africa, continuing tensions in the Middle East and Cambodia, the precarious political and economic position in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the widespread instability in South America, the real and potential threats posed by ethnic and religious differences in many developed and developing countries and the increasing call for the United Nations to intervene in internal confrontations all bear testimony to the volatility of the current international situation. The decline in the global superpower rivalry has increased the emphasis on regional and national issues and political structures, and the importance of emerging regional alliances. The impact of the collapse of the Soviet Union, together with the reduction in the direct US military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, has already had and will continue to have; a substantial effect on regional security; For this reason and others, an essential future requirement for the security of Australia and its territories is the development and maintenance of a self-reliant defence capability, underpinned by cooperative defence alliances and security arrangements with friendly nations. The increasing significance of and requirement for enhanced regional security and defence arrangements has reinforced the need for Australia to continue concentrating on establishing strong relationships within the Asia-Pacific region. Our nation represents a responsible, independent and stabilising influence within the Asia-Pacific region. However, we have not easily or readily been accepted by some of our regional neighbours. Perhaps one reason for this is that in the past, naturally, we tended to concentrate on existing relationships with our traditional British, European and American friends instead of establishing new relationships within our immediate region. We have therefore been perceived as a regional onlooker rather than a regional participant. Australia now recognises and accepts the need for strong regional relationships and we should focus our endeavours on building them. This change of focus must continue as Australia's security and economic future lies with the Asia-Pacific region. The coalition initiated and strongly supports the concept of cooperative regional defence. This involves a range of initiatives aimed at increasing regional defence cooperation and interaction in all areas, from multinational exercises and military training and personnel exchanges to defence industry joint ventures to building improved economic and environmental links with our regional neighbours. It is aimed at complementing rather than replacing Australia's existing network of regional security alliances. It is encouraging to see the present ment acknowledging the correctness of this approach and following our lead in regard to some of these matters. The development of this regional cooperative approach to defence and security will not be easy. Obviously, other nations in the Asia-Pacific region have different priorities and perceptions in regard to their national security interests, and there are territorial disputes which are still to be resolved. Of particular concern to the present and future security of the Asia-Pacific region are the tensions which persist in Korea, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, southern Africa, Malaysia and New Caledonia. However, it is generally accepted that these current and/or potential confrontations are of a localised nature and do not pose a direct military threat to Australian territory in the foreseeable future. There is considerable evidence to suggest that the favourable strategic environment Australia currently enjoys will continue in the long term. Our geographical isolation is one factor quoted in support of this theory. Another factor is that Australia has no immediate and, in all probability, no future strategic interests in the possession of any other nation's territory. However, just as there is a significant difference between military capability and intent, there is also a significant difference between a readily identifiable immediate or potential security risk and the total and permanent absence of any risk whatsoever. We would be most unwise to assume that, because no threat exists today, no threat will exist tomorrow. Lower level contingencies may arise, possibly without any warning or at very short notice, and Australia must be prepared for unlikely but nonetheless possible changes or developments which may adversely affect the stability of our region and, consequently, our own security. Despite the current popularity and wide acceptance of the no foreseeable threat theory, there are important arguments against this supposition. The military history books are bursting with examples of unexpected events which led to unanticipated contingencies, often with disastrous consequences. We need only remember govern Australia's northern reaches in 1939 and 1940. However, it is reasonable to accept the notion that we are currently in a more advantageous position from a security viewpoint than many other nations, including some of our regional neighbours. In the absence of any immediately or readily identifiable military threat, the definition of national security, the factors affecting it and the means of achieving it have become much broader. Economic, trade and environmental issues and concerns now have to be taken into account in defining security interests. As a middle power, Australia must continue to play a fundamental role in facilitating greater cooperation and communication within the Asia-Pacific region but, at the same time, we must pursue a broad regional security agenda based on a realistic assessment of our actual regional defence capability. There is no doubt that the larger Asia-Pacific powers, most notably the PRC, India, Japan, Korea and Indonesia, will continue to modernise and build their defence capability and increase their defence readiness as they endeavour to increase their role and influence in the conduct of regional security matters. The release in February 1994 of the strategic review was the first major step in adapting Australia's defence and strategic policies to take account of the changed regional and global security environment following the end of the Cold War. It examined the development and challenges which would affect, and proposed short-term policies for, Australia's defence and security over the next three to five years. The second step is this white paper, which takes a longer term view and defines Australia's security strategies and defence policy directives into the next century. Whilst particular elements of these official government defence and security statements have received a degree of bipartisan political support, there is a continuing and increasing concern in regard to the obvious and unacceptable deterioration in Australia's defence capability over the past 11 years. The Labor government's funding priorities have resulted in severe cuts to defence and defence related expenditures and, as a consequence, there has been a dramatic decrease in personnel, equipment and other essential resources. The Australian Deforce Force has been seriously weakened by years of inappropriate and insufficient funding, and its capability to carry out its primary function has now declined to a very critical and precarious level. Labor's approach to defence funding, both historically and now, has been quite accurately and appropriately described as 'champagne taste on a beer drinker's income'. Its policy objectives have generated unrealistic and impossible expectations, and it is hardly surprising that it has been unable to meet the funding demands. Under Labor, expenditure on defence has reached lower relative levels than ever before. During the period 1983-84 to 1993-94, defence spending was reduced from 2.6 per cent to 2.3 per cent of GDP. The latest white paper promises yet further reductions, with defence spending for the medium term set at just two per cent of GDP-the lowest level for more than 50 years. The ADF is already in a lamentable state. Permanent force numbers have plummeted to around 60,000, with further reductions imminent. ADF readiness has declined. Cuts to personnel, training, equipment, and other resources have reached a point where morale has suffered almost irreparable damage; and experience and skill levels within all three services have been demonstrably impaired. The Regular Army has been weakened by having two of its_ six infantry battalions eliminated and replaced with a costly and flawed ready reserve program. This latest white paper proposes that one of these battalions will be re-formed over the next three to four years, but only by cribbing manpower and resources from other areas. The general reserves are likewise suffering from inadequate structures, uncertain directions, imprecise roles and inadequate training resources. None of these problems are adequately addressed in this white paper. The defence of our nation should be a matter of paramount concern to all Australians. It is, however, an unfortunate fact that community interest and concern about defence and security issues largely depend on community perceptions about the nature and immediacy of any potential or identifiable threat. Over recent years the security of Australia has, to a considerable extent, been forgotten and/or neglected, and national defence has been replaced on the political agenda by economic and social issues. Community understanding of our security needs and public support for, and participation in, Australia's defence effort are fundamental and essential ingredients if we are to achieve and sustain the required and appropriate level of government expenditure on defence portfolio matters. In particular, we must act to increase community awareness of the importance of national defence and security and of the fact that we must be ready and able to defend Australia should the need arise. The coalition accepts and supports our nation's need for a strong, viable and ongoing defence capability, but we are not convinced that the government shares our commitment in this regard. We acknowledge that Australia must have a clearly defined and contemporary defence strategy, including a comprehensive policy to create a more proficient and productive defence bureaucracy and ensure a more operationally capable Defence Force. Our attitude to these matters is in stark contrast the Labor government's underfunded and fragmented efforts over the past decade, which have left Australia vulnerable in the event of any unforeseen contingency. As we approach the next century, the primary task of those charged with the responsibility of defending Australia must be to review and rebuild our current defence policy so that it will reflect and be responsive to Australia's future defence and security needs and interests. To date, many of these requirements have not been fulfilled. Finally, we delude ourselves if we believe the world today is, and will continue to be, a better and safer place. The fact remains that we live in a dangerous, unstable and rapidly shrinking international environment, where tenuous efforts at peace are overshadowed by simmering political and social unrest, and where the uneven division of scarce resources will continue to test universal goodwill. While the fate of the world continues to depend on human nature-as it always will the potential for conflict remains. We must always be ready-and ensure we have the means-to defend our nation, our beliefs and those things that we hold dear. To this end, the latest long awaited defence white paper which should have promised so much has, unfortunately, delivered so little.",41
15,Mr LES SCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of Defending Australia, the defence white paper 1994. Having a large military base at the Amberley air force base in my electorate, I am always very aware and conscious of the needs of those personnel and their families and of the ability and the commitment of those personnel to defend Australia. I always welcome an opportunity to put on record my appreciation for their commitment to the Defence Force. I also put on record my appreciation to those in my electorate at large, who play a very active role in our community. For example, when the Commander of the air force base at Amberley, Air Commodore Rogers, left recently to be promoted, he was given a civic farewell. I wish him well in his new role, as I wish the person who has taken over to from him well. It is important that we acknowledge the work that these people do. Our defence people have always shown a great commitment. They have managed to grasp and take great advantage of the new technology that is available in this very modem world where technology is the name of the game. We can be very proud of our Defence Force people and of our defence facilities. This paper is one of the most thorough plans that has been devised for Australia's defence, and it will lay the groundwork for the Australian Defence Force well into the next century. Planning is important, and that is what this paper is all about. It is a rational and carefully planned response to the changing geostrategic situation in the world and, more particularly, in the Asia-Pacific region, which is the important area for us. Defending Australia places primary emphasis on the need for the ADF to foster a culture of professionalism and to adapt to the need to employ high-tech defence equipment, which is the way we have been moving for some time. We particularly saw that in the Gulf War situation. On our TV screens we saw the importance of high-tech defence equipment. It is a changing world, and that is the key to the modem battlefield. Perhaps the most welcome news in this paper, and certainly one of the most constructive elements of any defence plan in recent history, is the commitment by the government to a five-year budget allocation to defence, which I am sure will be welcomed by senior people in the Australian Defence Force. That includes a commitment of two per cent of GDP. That can be criticised, but I suggest that our defence people do things more efficiently today than they ever have before. They too realise that the dollar can go only so far; they have been very conscious of that. That is quite evident from my dealings with people in the Defence Force, particularly those at the very senior level. There have been commentators, such as Michael O'Connor in Monday's Australian, who have raised some initial concerns that two per cent is a bit on the low side. But, as he said in his article, assuming four per cent real growth in GDP, a five-year budget will mean that in 1994 dollars defence will get an increase of some $400 million annually. That is assuming a four per cent growth rate but, as we all know-and as we will keep reminding those opposite-the economy is actually growing faster than that, at 6.4 per cent. Although the government will move responsibly to sustain and control this growth, it will remain at a steady rate, high enough to give a real increase to defence under a five-year budget plan. Not only will the five-year budget lead to an increase in defence spending but also it will give the ADF the long term funding certainty that such an important and large organisation needs to successfully carry out its forward planning. The ADF is a huge organisation and it needs to be able to plan in this way. So that is how seriously the government views defence-a real commitment to the security of this country. But what about those opposite? Another point Mr O'Connor made in that article is that the five-year budget requires a corresponding commitment from the opposition both in the Senate and in the extremely unlikely event that it were ever to win government. Day by day that becomes less likely, which is a good thing for Australia. Given this week's showing by the opposition leadership, how can Australians be sure that those opposite are prepared to show the political will required to sustain this defence program? The defence program needs a bipartisan approach. I call on members opposite to , partIcIpate in that approach. I know from dealing with our defence people that they see the need for that type of approach. They are not involved in the political arena, of course, but they see the need for the whole parliament to have a strong commitment to our ongoing defence program. A five-year plan like this gives us an opportunity to pick up on that approach. The white paper is a response to the changing nature of the global security environment, now that the Cold War is over and the threat from the Soviet Union has virtually disappeared. Simultaneously the security situation in our own region has become more fluid and to some extent less predictable. The withdrawal of the Soviet Union from the major theatres in which it was involved has coincided with an almost unprecedented expansion in the economic growth of the countries in the Asia-Pacific, particularly the ASEAN nations. This will, over time, result in some long-term trends that have the potential to affect our strategic environment, and it is for this contingency that Defending Australia was written. This ASEAN economic growth has been accompanied by expanding military capabilities throughout Asia. Whilst there are no perceived threats, nor are there any potential ones in the foreseeable future, the government is planning the future of Australian defence with the capabilities required to meet these expanding military capabilities in the event of a major change in the regional strategic and political environment. This is perhaps the most important aspect of the white paper-planning to improve Australia's capacity, in terms of our personnel and equipment policies, to repel any likely attack upon our territory. This is a difficult process to plan for, given the fluid nature of the military situation in this region and the tendency for military capacities to change fairly rapidly, particularly with the greater availability of arms on the global market following the reductions in both the US and Eastern bloc defence forces. This makes it even more important for Australia to initiate policies that will reduce the potential for a military threat. The white paper stresses the importance of partnership with the countries of our region in all areas-economic, social and military. The Bogor summit is a good example of the economic prosperity that will be delivered to the APEC nations as a result of partnership and cooperation. The same can be said of military cooperation. That partnership is important at all levels, no matter what we are dealing with-on the economic side, the social side and the military side. Only last week the Public Accounts Committee, which I chair, visited New Zealand, our very near neighbour and good friend. I missed what my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) said earlier but I am sure he would have picked up on this. My colleagues and I had the opportunity to speak to defence people in New Zealand. The spirit of cooperation that exists is very important to both our countries. The goodwill which we found existed between our departments was notable. We spoke to officers at a very senior level in the defence force in New Zealand. We had a lengthy discussion about the ANZAC frigates, which are of mutual interest to us. It was valuable to be able to discuss those things because the relationship between our two countries through CER, in particular, and on the military side and the cooperation that exists between our two countries are essential for our ongoing prosperity. I have had the opportunity to visit countries such as Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Tonga, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. Some of those places-in the South Pacific, particularly-see Australia and New Zealand as very important in developing and maintaining a stable environment in the region. New Zealand plays a key part in that, particularly with those islands to its north, such as Western Samoa and Tonga. This is all part of partnership and cooperation between the two countries. We have to be careful that we are not seen in any way as some sort of Big Brother but rather that we operate on the basis of a partnership. I am sure that is the way most of us think. We ought to develop and prosper that partnership and the cooperation that exists. Fortunately, we are a reasonably large country in terms of the South Pacific nations. They look to us for leadership and, fortunately, that leadership has been shown by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) not only today but also earlier in the week with the ministerial statement on APEC. In South-East Asia our defence activities will place greater emphasis on partnership with the countries of the region to encourage a more secure, strategic environment by encouraging regular dialogue between countries. The more we do that the better. My colleagues in this place always take the opportunity to develop good relationships when we have the opportunity to meet visiting friends and delegations from other countries. We should put a big emphasis on our local region. Australia's defence relationship with Indonesia is our most important in South-East Asia. The white paper says that close consultation with Indonesia on strategic and defence issues will grow in importance over the coming years. With a huge near neighbour like Indonesia we can develop trade and other relationships. We can be friends, and that is important for us. Similarly, the white paper says that the existing bilateral defence relationships with Singapore and Malaysia will continue to be regarded as very important. In my own electorate of Oxley the Royal Singaporean Air Force has planes at Amberley. It has already made some preliminary approaches to the government to locate a permanent advanced jet training school at a RAAF base in Australia. One of its preferred sites is Amberley because of its location and all the infrastructure that is already there. It is probably logical in some ways, even though some concern has been expressed about an increase in noise levels in the suburban areas. That is something we would need to be mindful of. We are looking at that aspect. Given the infrastructure, however, Amberley seems to be the preferred site. The latest I have on the situation is that we are awaiting a further response from Singapore. The project will involve several hundred RAAF personnel and their families moving into the electorate, in the Ipswich area. While there are still many issues to be resolved, they will be addressed through the appropriate channels. The project is evidence of the level of cooperation that already exists between Australia and some of our regional defence partners. Australia will continue to encourage the constructive involvement of Vietnam and Laos in the security affairs of the region. In Cambodia we will maintain a defence relationship with the new government and provide modest levels of assistance to help reform and modernise its armed forces. Another good aspect of the white paper the very serious attempt to encourage Australhave Ian industry development in defence policy, which is evident, both for Australia Zealand, in the ANZAC frigates. This is consistent with broader government policies which have already encouraged efficient production and work practices and internaspecific tionally competitive and export oriented Australian manufacturing and services. In 1994-95 some 80 per cent of defence expendifour ture on facilities, equipment, goods and services will be spent in Australia. This percentage, which represents a major increase over the last decade, results from the high levels of Australian industry involvement in ago. major defence equipment projects like the Collins class submarines, another example of what Australians can do at the high-tech level. Other major defence equipment projects are the ANZAC frigates, the PC3 Orion and YAREN avionics upgrades, in my own government electorate. The latter has been a very importinitial ant initiative in developing industry in this country. These projects increased the share capital equipment expenditure in Australia from 25 per cent in 1984-85 to 64 per cent 1994-95. The white paper Defending Australia is an excellent initiative. I congratulate the Minister for Defence on his presentation, and the people who have assisted him in bringing this oceans. paper before the parliament. It needs bipartisan support which I encourage from members opposite. Once again, I put on the record my congratulations to my local defence people for the work they are doing in supporting. the Defence Force of Australia.",44
16,Mr CONNOLLY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The opening paragraph to the Defendmade ing Australia white paper probably says it in terms of the conventional responsibility of government to look after the maintenance of the defence of the nation. It states: The Government has a fundamental responsibility to ensure Australia's defence. It meets this responsibility by ensuring that we can prevent or defeat the use of armed force against us. I think it is rather cryptic that those comments should be in the introductory paragraph when the reality is that, over the last decade, it has is been the policies of this government which in many respects significantly reduced Australia's defence capability and preparedand New ness. The record speaks for itself. We have lost two of our six infantry battalions and it is proposed in this white paper that, over the next few years-without any date, I should add-our defence preparedness will be increased by one battalion. Our fighter fbrce has been reduced from to three squadrons, although some second-hand aircraft have been purchased from the United States. In real terms we have fewer surface combat craft available to the Royal Australian Navy than we had a decade Although we are in the process of developing the Collins class submarine-and the first one is now doing sea trials-the paper is less the than generous in suggesting how far the will be prepared to go beyond the contract, which was to provide for six new submarines. So, while the capability of of those submarines will undoubtedly be of a much higher order than the current fleet, the in question really is going to be: will there be enough submarines ordered well enough in advance to give us that all-round naval capacity so essential to a nation surrounded by sea? We must have some control of our sea lanes across both the Indian and Pacific Personnel numbers have dropped by some 20 per cent, and implications of that are covered in the white paper. A recruitment document put out by the army 'Your career in a smaller army- puts greater emphasis on technology at the expense of basic manpower. various circumstances, a case can be that high technology is now one of the all mainstays of a correctly rounded military force. The fact that our numbers are so low, especially in the army and the navy, demonstrates difficulties that the navy, for example, has in obtaining sufficient crew for its submarines and the obvious difficulties that the army has in maintaining even a semblance of a satisfactory basis for its existing battalions, not to mention the obvious problems it will have under current circumstances to obtain sufficient manpower for the additional battalion proposed in the white paper. Consequently, conditions of service for defence personnel have also been eroded. We had a paper from the government only three years ago explaining how there was going be a considerable change in the force structure and that would result in a diminution in manpower in various elements of the defence structure. In the last few weeks, however, we have seen a turnaround. There is now almost a panic in the defence forces claiming that there is now a shortage of trained manpower, of a career progression and of a sufficient flow of officer recruits and candidates coming through the system. Clearly that is for two reasons: firstly, the awareness by serving officers of a very limited career prospect. Therefore, many of them, now that the recession, hopefully, is behind us, are looking for greener pastures. Secondly, there is an effect on the quality of recruitment as well as the numbers of recruits because of the alternatives available to young men and women in the Australian private sector. The other issue worth noting in the context of recent policy is the establishment of the ready reserve scheme. We are told in the white paper that, despite the complaints and fears which were voiced by our respective shadow ministers for defence in this place and in the Senate over recent years, the government pushed ahead with the establishment of the ready reserve. We warned the government that there were going to be problems, and now it is admitting that those problems exist and, consequently, it has announced a further investigation into the effectiveness of the scheme. The related scheme, which is in a wider context, particularly with its involvement in the private sector, is the commercial support program, which again, regrettably, has in many respects failed to deliver the efficiencies and the savings which were heralded of it long before the event. Consequently, we have our concerns about this document. In many respects it is a weak document. In many respects it is little more than an attempt to excuse the government for its failures over recent years while at the same time trying to make much of the fact that so many promises of change are contained in it. These changes mayor may not ultimately be seen, but they are skated over in the document as reviews, investigations and examinations-in fact, the list is almost endless. The government's record on the adequate funding of defence again does not take very close examination. It was foreshadowed in the previous defence paper-this was back in 1987-that defence expenditure would be between 2.6 and three per cent of GDP. It can be demonstrated from examination of the statistics that the budget allocations in this financial year will in fact be lower than for the last year of the Whitlam government. The government would claim that, with the end of the Cold War, the whole strategic environment in which Australia finds itself has so changed that there is no threat in the foreseeable future and there is no nation in our region capable or apparently politically willing to enter into a war-like situation with Australia. All I can to say to that is that I sincerely hope the government is right. One of the great lessons through history has been that it takes much longer to gird a nation's loins for battle-to use the language of Winston Churchill-than it does to plan sufficiently in advance to make sure that, in the event of a threat, you are ready for it to a significant degree. Every time this nation has been caught out, it has been because governments of the day-sadly, including the Labor Party leading up to the Second World War-have supported a policy of disarmament and have not been prepared to face up to the clouds appearing on the horizon. While the white paper does so little to redress the failures of defence policy in the past, the question really has to be asked: is it adequately planning for the future? As I have said, the 1987 white paper was inaccurate in terms of its projections on defence budgeting. It projected 2.6 to three per cent of gross domestic product and it never got anywhere near it. In 1994-95 it is now $2.5 billion lower in defence terms than the 1987 white paper promised. Consequently, if you add up those shortfalls since 1987, it effectively means that the Defence Force has been cut in budgetary terms by no less than $11 billiona significant sum of money. The only commitment the white paper makes in terms of the future, and it is the sort of commitment that it made in the previous documents, is that the level of defence expenditure will be 'approximately' - a wonderful word for politicians to use-two per cent of gross domestic product over the next few years. Two per cent could perhaps vary from three per cent to one per cent and they will still call it 'approximate'. The government also claims that, whatever the outcome of defence expenditure, it is not really a problem because we are going to have economic growth and, of course, economic growth in real terms will result in a real increase in defence expenditure. Amen to that. Let us hope the government is right. The sad fact is that the rises and falls of the economic cycle in recent decades should be telling any government one salient story: that the peaks and the troughs are getting closer together. Therefore, the difficulties of running an effective financial long-term projection over at least five years, which you must do for defence purposes, is something I believe the government has not been adequately able to achieve. The evidence of the last 11 years, in all its white papers, promises and commitments, has that one salient link-that is, they were all significantly below what was initially intended for them. Putting it quite simply, you cannot have defence on the cheap. It costs money to be prepared. It costs money to have men and women who are prepared to dedicate their lives in the service of Australia. It costs money to have the best equipment to support those people in the most critical work of supporting the nation. When I saw in the white paper the government's commitments to the future, I could not help but ask that I rather interesting question about Napoleon. When Napoleon had a general who caused him difficulties-and often that occurred, especially during his Russian campaign when they froze to death in the snows of the Siberian winter-his response invariably was: if he is complaining, give him another medal. It is fair to say that this government in recent years has produced more new medals than any government in Australia's history. That may give people a warm inner glow. People who have given service to the nation expect to be honoured; they expect to be respected. But let there be no doubt that a chest full of medals is neither an excuse nor a substitute for giving soldiers the best possible technological support and training you can because in the moment of battle it is the quality of the equipment they are supplied with and the quality of the training they have had which, in so many cases, will be the difference between life and death. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that medals under those circumstances are no substitute-none whatsoever-for the reality of a government taking the matter much more seriously than it has in the past. It is interesting to note the lists of items which are in the white paper as being subject to review. They are, for example, military satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, fixed seabed acoustic arrays, AWACs-something we have been asking the government to introduce for years-the structural land force, the ready reserves, the two Collins class submarines, which may yet be added to the basic fleet structure; and so the list goes on. What I notice is not there is the capacity for Australia to be able to project its military force into the region which we know to be our primary defence responsibility and interest, namely, the south-west Pacific region leading up to the mainland of Asia. There is one area in which I do support the government's proposals, and that is closer links with our regional partners, notably Indonesia. It is worth noting that Singapore, for example, has' been training its forces, especially its air force, in Australia for some time. That is a very useful method of maintaining close links with that nation, especially when being so small it has very real limitations on the capacity of its air force to operate in a training environment. Sharing training with our neighbours helps them to understand us. It certainly' helps our personnel to understand them. That can, in time, as those officers on both sides increase in rank and stature in their respective forces, create precisely the atmosphere of peace, consultation and the capacity to work together which is fundamental to those situations. Those of us who have had any relationship with defence training arrangements, as I did before I came into parliament, remember only too well that possibly the most important example of all was the defence forces of Indonesia. Going back to the days of the Sukarno regime, a significant number of its officers were trained in the Soviet Union. There were two groups of officers: those which came through the United States system and those which came through the Russian system. For a long time there was a degree of friction in that relationship. The military philosophy was different. (Time expired)",47
17,Mr TUCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I thank the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, for extending this debate on my behalf. As the shadow minister, I would have been higher up the list had it not been for the fact that I have been attending the Defence Force Academy graduation ceremony this morning, along with the Minister for Defence  extremely impressive parade of young people, of whom we can all be very proud. Unfortunately for them, it rained throughout the entire parade, for which I was extremely sorry. Over the last month or so I have been raising a number of questions relative to recruitment and manning in the services. As shadow minister in that area, it is a matter of considerable concern to me. As I hope I have demonstrated throughout my involvement as shadow minister for veterans' affairs-and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) thanked me the other day for the cooperation I have provided-I hope I can continue in this role. I do not want in these very serious areas to be playing politics at a ridiculous level. Consequently, I have put some fairly low level questions to the minister, and the minister has responded according to the advice he has received from his department. I am not, therefore, arguing at this point in time that he has misled the House in any of the remarks he has made. Nevertheless, when it comes to the defence of our country, when it comes to public safety, one's responsibilities are easy to see. I am hopeful that some of the remarks I make today will cause the minister to question some of the advice he is apparently receiving. I want to address a special area of manning, which is the issue I have been addressingthat is, the numbers and the ability to deliver proper services of air traffic controllers. The interesting thing is that the minister, for instance, informed me on 3 November by way of letter in response to a question: At the outset, let me say that I am advised in very strong terms by Air Force that the current staffing level of the air traffic control function is satisfactory in terms of providing safe and effective control of airspace . . . If I can just go back a moment, I would imagine that of all people employed by government the people less likely to leak would be the armed services. They have a genuine commitment to what they are doing. When they start to leak, I think it has to be a message to government that something is seriously afoot. I was able to send that letter I received from the minister to a very senior officer, who replied. I want to read some of the comments. In the beginning, under 'Introduction', he says: I refer to the letter from the Hon. Gary Punch MP dated 3 November 1994 in which he replies to your Questions Without Notice of 18 October 1994 regarding air traffic controllers in the RAAF. He goes on: Primarily. the letter is an official fabrication which uses inaccurate and out of date statistics to prove a point. The present day realities no longer represent the picture in his letter. I shall begin by discussing the contentious statements in the letter which you sent and then detail some of the peripheral issues . . . He goes on, under the heading 'Current Staffing Levels within ATC': Manning within the RAAF ATC is now approaching a critical stage. Despite the return to Australia of the air traffic controllers (ATCOs) who served in Somalia and other UN posts, there are insufficient numbers of qualified controllers to man the various controlling positions at the Bases. Such is the parlous state of this category that an urgent meeting was convened on the 4th of November this year at Air Force Office in Canberra (see Annex A attached)which is the minutes of that meetingto discuss means by which ATC services and manning problems could be addressed. At the time of writing this report to you, the Minutes of this meeting had not been released. However, I am aware that the Minutes (written by a member from the Directorate of Personnel Officers-Air Force . . . in which the postings, promotion and career paths of officers are managed) of the meeting were not considered to be a true reflection . . . In other words, people at the very top were trying to rewrite the history of that particular meeting. It goes on: There is an expectation that in the next fiscal year, the RAAF will lose upwards of 24 controllers who will join Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). I will detail in later paragraphs the reasons for the dissatisfaction within the RAAF. CAA is currently recruiting personnel to undertake both the short term, and the long term (two years) ATC courses. Discussions with my senior counterparts in CAA reveal that CAA is also desperately short of controllers, hence their recruiting campaign. I am to understand that CAA is keen to recruit 24 trainees per year . . . He goes on: Interestingly, at the top of page 2 in Punch's letter, there is an acknowledgment of possible 'fluctuations' in manning of RAAF controllers. In the letter he goes on to say that the air force has increased its recruiting and training rate of ATCOs-air traffic controllers. He then says: Ironically, it was at the 4NOV meeting where the issue of recruiting ATCOs was discussed at length. The issue of how best to attract potential controllers into the RAAF is not without difficulties. Consider the differences in salaries . . . He then has a subnote, which states in p'art: Currently, an approach controller at Mascot or Melbourne would expect to receive a salary, inclusive of penalty rates, of close to $70,000 pa. The military counterpart would be of flight lieutenant rank and would have a gross salary of approx. $40,000 pa. He goes on and explains those disparities in salaries. He then says: One of the initiatives discussed at the 4NOV meeting in Canberra to help reduce manning shortfalls is to recall many of the trained controllers who are currently employed 'out of category' (OOC). I shall attempt to provide a brief explanation of what is entailed in OOC employment. Senior flight lieutenants or squadron leaders within ATC are oftentimes given the opportunity to 'broaden their career path' by being selected to undertake employment in other fields. They are employed in a wide range of duties from administration, materiel divisions to working with DPO-AF as an example. However, whilst many of these officers will be recalled to the control environment, they· will be required to have refresher training and undertake rigid rating exams to re-qualify as active controllers. That sounds infinitely sensible to me. He continues: Despite the denials which may emanate to the contrary, many of these controllers will have been away from active controlling for a long period and may well experience significant difficulty in attaining the required standards of control. It is not unrealistic to believe that many will not be able to cope with the demands of a system in which they have not been a practising part of for several years. The minister, in his reply to me yesterday, said that they were just going to click these p-ople back into operations. Another contentious issue in the minister's letter is that which relates to MTAF. The minister in his letter pointed out that they were using control in many areas known as MTAF. He says: Be assured in the strongest possible terms, MTAF was only accepted as a last resort from within the RAAF. The introduction of this system into the military came about only when there were insufficient numbers of controllers to meet the operational demands at the Bases. The Air Headquarters at Glenbrook NSW vehemently rejected military ATC moves to introduce this method of procedure. Despite the paucity of available controllers to undertake out of hours operations, seniors in the Air Headquarters continued to insist that military aircraft should not operate from airfields without the assistance of ATC. This situation reached a crisis point several months past when the Pearce Base rejected a proposed series of out of hours movements of Air Headquarters aircraft-based on nothing more than the critical manning situation which existed at the Pearce ATC section. Reluctantly, permission was granted by Air Headquarters to allow the aircraft to operate using the MTAF procedures. The system is now widely accepted! Contrary to how the Minister views MTAF being , . . . a high level of safety without air traffic control' the system is certainly not without danger. MTAF is a basis used in commercial operations where there is no air traffic control, but you tell everybody where you are on the radio. We are talking about aircraft now in the air force that do 1,000 kilometres an hour and are specifically designed to be as unobservable as possible. Of course, the pilots have little tiny windows, and they cannot see much either. He continues: Considering the speed at which many of the military aircraft fly, a radio transmission by the pilot stating his call sign, type of aircraft, position and his intentions are of little consequence to another pilot flying in the same proximity in an aircraft of considerably less performance capability. Undeniably, the high performance military aircraft which oftentimes have restrictive cockpit vision capability require positive control and that can only be provided by air traffic control . . . MTAF has only been introduced at military establishments because of the existing shortfalls in manning-despite whatever reassurances emanate from Canberra to the contrary. Military controllers have always accepted the requirement to be on duty for aircraft operations. Even in the case of single aircraft movement . . . However, when manning cuts at the bases reduced controller numbers, it became unmanageable to roster controllers for out of hours movements. MTAF was accepted as a means by which flying operations could be sustained-but without the need of ATC. In discussing controller numbers and how bases can be manned, we should address a new initiative which was discussed on 4 NOV-priority manning. Both the Training Command in Melbourne (responsible for ATC and operations at East Sale (VIC) and Pearce (WA)) have been required to nominate those Bases at which priority manning should be afforded. In the case of the Darwin Base (which belongs to Air Headquarters)and in Darwin the RAAF provides all commercial air traffic controlManning has been increased to 100 per cent. The Senior Air Traffic Controller (SATCO) became frustrated at the number of unsuccessful attempts he had made to have his manning deficiencies addressed. He issued a NOTAM (notice to airmen) stating in effect that due to manning constraints within his Section-aircraft could expect delays and consequently, they were instructed to carry additional fuel. We are talking now of commercial aircraft coming in from overseas. He continues: QANTAS was outraged and complained to the Minister for Defenceso apparently he must know something about all thisat the cost that this requirement would have on their operations into and out of Darwin. The Minister immediately responded by ordering Darwin's ATC manning to be raised to 100 per cent-despite that controllers had to be taken from other Bases which were already short in manpower. Effectively, it was the scenario of 'robbing Peter to pay Paul'. I am still quoting from the letter from a very senior RAAF officer. He then says: In this latest case of prioritising within the Training Command Bases, the School of Air Traffic Control (SATC) at East Sale is to be manned to one hundred per cent: Pearcein my statewill also be high on this priority list ... There is a good reason for that: the minister has just been over there opening the new training facility for the Singaporean air force; it now trains at Pearce, Western Australia. There have been government to government discussions between the Singapore government and the Australian government about us not keeping our side of the bargain, which of course included providing adequate air traffic control to its trainee pilots. Unfortunately, I am going to run out of time, but let me just touch on this: SATC has to be fully manned if the expected numbers of controllers are going to be trained in the next several years. There will be a concentrated effort in graduating students from a Basic ATC Course. However, the benefits of this training will not be fully achieved until those controllers have undertaken the advanced course (some two to three years following graduation from the initial course). So we are talking of a period of up to four years before people can be left on their own and be adequately capable of controlling the sky for which they would be responsible. He continues: There are already considerable concerns being raised at the flying bases at the prospect of losing controllers to make up the shortfalls at Pearce and SATe. Undoubtedly, further cuts to air traffic control services must be anticipated until the shortfalls in the manning situation eases. Perhaps the most significant effect on manning has stemmed from the series of reviews on manpower undertaken within the ADF. There is so much of this that I will just go to the conclusion. He says: The response to Minister Punch's letter contains out of date information and figures which belie the real situation. The play on statistics has long been a way in which the truth can be hidden. In this letter, the same can be said for the situation governing the numbers of qualified RAAF controllers who are currently in the field providing services. You will note that this number is substantially less than 'the number of air traffic controllers in the RAAF'. Recruiting, if successful, will not produce the first fully rated and operational controllers before three years. Prioritized manning at several of the bases can only be achieved by taking personnel from other ATe sections . . . Dissatisfaction amongst many of the controllers stems from their professional concerns that manpower reductions have led to reductions in supervision, poor quality control of their rating standards and an expected demand for quality services which their numbers are having difficulty in providing. Most controllers are appalled at their prospects of a worthwhile career in the RAAF. The government must address these issues. It is no good just having the minister coming in here and saying, 'I am advised of this' and, 'I am advised of that.' I beg him to make his own inquiries. I beg him to find out what is going on before we have the situation that occurred in the civilian sector, where people were killed. The minister tried to play this down, but we have already been advised that in the Willi am town area a commuter aircraft entered restricted airspace while two Macchis were in the area firing guns. Luckily, no-one was hit. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Tickner) adjourned. NA ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1994· Cognate bills: NA AND COMPANIES BILL 1994 AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",50
18,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I rise to speak to these bills having been a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which produced report No. 296, entitled The Auditor-General: ally of the people and the parliament. It was a report which I and others on that committee-and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is sitting across the table from me, was the chair at that time-produced after long and serious investigation. The report we produced recommended that the Auditor-General should be properly recognised as the linchpin for proper accountability and that he should be a link between the people and the parliament. Accountability is something that must constantly be talked about in this place because, again and again, from my perspective, accountability standards are dropping. The focal point of report No. 296 was the need for the Auditor-General to be free of the power of the executive. At the present time, the resources of the Auditor-General come from the executive and, in a very real sense, the government of the day or the executive of the day has the power to curtail the functions of the Auditor-General by curtailing the amount of funding that is made available to him and to his office. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts looked at precedents around the world. It said that the Auditor-General should be freed from the control of the executive and that a committee of the parliament should be established. In report No. 296, the JCPA recommended that that committee should be chaired by a Presiding Officer and that it should be a separate committee which would oversight the amount of money made available to the Auditor-General. In report No. 331, which was brought down later by the Public Accounts Committee, of which I was no longer a member-and, indeed, neither was the minister-there was a change and it was recommended that the JCPA could conduct that function itself. The concept of the need for an audit committee is a very important one. With the legislation rejecting the recommenda-ions made by both report No. 296 and report No. 331, the audit committee is not to be enshrined in legislation. Instead it is to be appointed by resolution-a resolution we have yet to see. The very important appointment of the Auditor-General himself, rather than being in accordance with the JCPA recommendation-that is, approved by the Leader of the Opposition and the chairman of the audit committee-is now merely to be by consultation. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), in his speech on the second reading motion, said that the coalition will be moving an amendment in that area. It is a very important and fundamental point. On that question of consultation, it is not very hard to see how easily lip-service could be given to that concept so that it has no real meaning at all. The second of the most important principles underlying the recommendations of the JCPA was that the Auditor-General should have confirmed, once and for all, his mandate to audit all government departments and instrumentalities, including GBEs. It was our intention that that mandate should include not only financial statement audits but also performance and efficiency audits. It is pleasing to see that the mandate has been enshrined in legislation, across the board, for financial statements. It is exceedingly disappointing to see that the Auditor General does not have the right to do efficiency audits of GBEs and other instrumentalities. With the practice of corporatisation, and with more and more activities of government being pushed off the balance sheet, the need for scrutiny and accountability has grown, not lessened. There must always be different standards for the public sector and the private sector. They are not the same. In the private sector, an individual may choose to invest his or her money as he or she sees fit. If that person does not like what the chosen company is doing, he or she may pull the money out and put it somewhere else. In the public sector there is no such right. Money is acquired compulsorily, by way of taxation, and is invested and spent according to government policy of the day. A taxpayer has no say on how that money is used. The checks and balances that exist in the private sector simply do not exist in the public sector, and that strict demarcation needs to be adhered to. The Auditor-General, the official officer of the parliament, as we like to think of him-the ally of the people in the parliament-needs to be able to carry out his audit function in terms not only of financial statements but of efficiency audits as well.",53
19,Mr COBB,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,An impartial judge.,54
20,Mrs BISHOP,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"He should be an impartial judge. If, in fact, the only way in which an efficiency audit can be done is by the minister asking for it to be done or by a resolution of both houses, it effectively will never be done. I vividly remember speaking about the need for audits and investigations of various functions of government instrumentalities to be carried out, and the power for the Auditor General to carry out his task so that the JCPA could look at the resulting audit and look at th- question simply was not there. A fourth important point underlying those reports was the need for the Auditor-General to have the ability to employ staff at market rates-in other words, to be freed from the obligation to employ under the Public Service Act. The reason for this was very simple. The work of the Auditor-General is becoming more and more complex and complicated, and he needs to have the very best people at his disposal. He needs to be able to go to the market and employ people, in the service of the parliament, to enable the best auditing function to be carried out. Saying that the Auditor-General does not have that power means that, again, his function is being constrained. When the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) spoke to these bills, he mentioned that the AuditorGenera1's office was to become a statutory authority. He said it was a 'symbolic' move. That was the right word to use. It is indeed symbolic: it is window dressing. Unless the Auditor-General is given the power to go outside to the market to choose the best people to come and do those audits, symbolic is what the change will be. When we talk about the office of the Auditor-General, we have to make a distinction between the people who man that office and the rest of the Public Service. Many in the Public Service consider that the Auditor General is the enemy. Yet, as we have said in that title to report 296, he is the ally of the people and the parliament; he is the man whom we depend upon to give us information which we then as members of parliament can use to see whether or not there is correct expenditure and true accountability and in turn be accountable to the public, the people who vote for us. While I was on the Public Accounts Committee we had several important inquiries. One was the result of a public servant telling us that he had lied to an estimates committee. The Public Accounts Committee inquiry that ensued came up with the most remarkable result that the members of the Public Accounts Committee had to write a recommendation that when people become public servants they must be informed that they are actually subject to the constitution and acts parliament, including the Audit Act. It was amazing to hear evidence that there were public servants who thought they were somehow not subject to the law of the land. To stress the importance of accountability at every turn is important. When I look at the bills that have come before us and I see the recommendations that have not been followed, I can only say that this legislation that has been introduced must be only step one because, until the important principles that underlie the very fabric upon which the Auditor-General can truly be seen to be independent of the executive, we are not giving the Auditor-General the power that he needs to carry out the function that we require of him. I take just a few minutes to mention the question of Centenary House. The problem with Centenary House remains precisely the same after the inquiry has been carried out as it was before the inquiry. The problem is twofold. Firstly, we have the Auditor-General as a tenant of a political party. If people choose to go through the debates, they will see that I point-d out again and again that the Auditor-General must also be seen to be above any suggestion of influence. For the Auditor-General to be a tenant of any political party, to me, is abhorrent. Secondly, the Auditor-General's tenancy has been used as a mechanism to transfer a total of $86 million out of the taxpayers' pockets into the pocket of the Australian Labor Party. Despite our strict disclosure laws, an advantage is given to one particular party-that being the Labor Party-through a lease by the government, a Labor Party government. I find that an absolute disgrace and' believe it will remain a disgrace. In speaking to this legislation today, I can only express my' sincere' disappointment that the specific recommendations concerning those four aspects that I have raised have not been followed. These recommendations included the appointment of the Auditor General; the creation by way of legislation of an audit committee and the functions which it should have to free the Auditor-General and his office from the executive arm of governof ment; the mandate for audits to extend to performance audits; and the ability to employ people in accordance with the dictates of the market and thus give the best people to the office of Auditor-General. There are other areas in the other two bills which also give me cause for concern but only because of the basic statement that I made at the beginning of my speech-that there is a distinction between accountability for the public sector and accountability for the private sector. So I regard these bills as only step one. I think there is a lot more to be done to ensure that our Auditor-General is truly an' ally of the people and the parliament.",54
21,Mr ROCHER,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"As has already been mentioned, these three bills currently before the House are intended to replace the Audit Act 1901, the principal act. The bills are the Auditor-General Bill 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994. They are of immense importance because they set out to give legislative effect to changes to financial management in the public sector. The Auditor-General Bill 1994 creates an office of Auditor-General. It spells out the powers and functions of this office and is supposed to guarantee an independent role for the Auditor-General. This bill has been the cause of most of the controversy surrounding the total proposals. The present Auditor General, Mr J.C. Taylor, has been critical of the Auditor-General Bill 1994 for several reasons. These criticisms flowed on from and largely reinforced the recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the JCPA, in its report 296 entitled The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament. I will return to examine some of the recommendations contained in the report later. The Financial Management and Accountability Bill is concerned with regulatory accounting and an accountability framework for dealing with the management of Commonwealth property and money. It deals with the finances of departments and government agencies. It also applies to Commonwealth statutory bodies which do not have legal ownership and control over their finances and property. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill introduces a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for Commonwealth authorities and sets out the standards of conduct for executive officers. These new standards aim to require authorities to adopt standards comparable with those set out in the Corporations Law, amongst other things. This bill will also provide a single of requirements to ensure wholly owned Commonwealth companies keep ministers and the parliament properly informed on their activities. The three bills come at a time when there are many changes occurring in the public sector, such as a continuing move towards the introduction of accrual based accounting throughout the public sector, increased interest in accountability of governmtlnt, increased financial independence of departments. and agencies, devolution of responsiQilities and a growing interest in program efficiency audits. All these developments and more have come from the inadequacies in the existing act, the principal act, as they became increasingly more apparent. This is especially so in terms of the operation of the Australian National Audit Office. There is no doubt that the Auditor-General plays a critical role in furthering the aim of accountability in relation to government programs and that accountability is designed to stem from and to the parliament. To date, the functions of audit and review have largely been conducted by the Auditor General through the ANAO, although I should say that the ANAO is not the sole agency by which programs receive necessary scrutiny. Senate estimates committees play a useful role, as do other means of inquiry, such as those conducted by various parliamentary committees, whistleblowers, freedom of information requests and, last but not least, questions on notice in this House. All these types of inquiry play a significant role, although some are more important and others, such as freedom of information requests, tum out in most instances to be a bureaucratic and futile exercise. However, I will get to that again later. The Australian National Audit Office, fortunately, does not suffer the sorts of limitations that are placed upon members of parliament who seek information, because the ANAO has a right and a duty to examine government programs to ensure that they operate appropriately. Of late we have seen several reports by the Auditor-General which have demonstrated Labor's lack of administraset tive ability. The report into the community, cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program, which became known as the sports rorts report, was one of the best because it showed that this government will stoop to anything to maintain its tenuous grasp on power. No-one will ever forget the pathetic figure of the member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) trying to cover up her deliberate attempts at pork-barrelling in the run-up to the 1993 election, and in the process misleading the parliament",55
22,Mr COBB,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,Defended by the Prime Minister.,56
23,Mr ROCHER,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"And defended by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The program was conducted with the full knowledge of the Prime Minister. Fortunately, the Auditor General was able to examine this program and expose the gross misuse of public funds by the member for Canberra on behalf of Labor. Other reports by the Auditor-General which have received substantial amounts of publicity are those examining the Child Support Agency and the Australian government credit card scams. These reports were damning of shoddy administrative procedures. No matter how successful the Auditor General has been, limitations to his powers and operational ability do exist. The ANAO is subject to a lack of resources and consequently cannot perform at a level that is necessary to achieve a satisfactory number of audits. Several inhibiting factors have been brought to light in the JCPA report No. 296. The ANAO can only undertake efficiency audits of government programs with an expenditure in excess of $10 million once every 40 years. This means that most of those programs will never receive an efficiency audit. This is an absolute disgrace, with program managers and ministers being able to rort some programs in the knowledge that they will suffer an efficiency audit only if they are extremely unlucky. While the number of agencies and statutory authorities has increased markedly-for statutory authorities the number has increased since 1977-78 from under 100 to be now more than 200-and the total number of financial transactions has increased rapidly, the dollar amount spent on audit office wages and salaries has not increased since 1978-79. In fact, at the time of the publishing of the JCPA report, the amount spent on salaries had fallen from $20.8 million to $20.6 million, and that is not adjusted for inflation. Funding actually did increase in the late 1980s, but these moneys were mainly used to equip the ANAO with a new computing system. The fact remains that the resources gi ven to the ANAO are not sufficient for it to operate at a level that might be otherwise reasonably expected. , The JCPA found that it was inconclusive whether ANAO had sufficient resources for financial and compliance audits, but it found the resources for efficiency audits were totally inadequate. Of the many recommendations made in the JCPA report, three are central to giving the ANAO the necessary muscle to perform to its best in the public interest. These are: providing the Auditor-General with the unfettered authority to undertake performance audits on all Commonwealth owned and controlled agencies, companies, et cetera; the establishment by law of an audit committee to oversee the annual estimates of the ANAO, and this committee could be constituted by the JCPA; and the parliament establishing the ANAO as a statutory authority with the power to set terms and conditions of employment for staff, including salary levels, and ensuring that the parliament shall bear the cost of all financial statement audits. There are very good reasons for these recommendations, which have been spelt out by both the JCPA and the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General should be able to undertake audits on all Commonwealth agencies and wholly owned companies to strengthen their public accountability and to maximise the flow of financial information available to ministers and, most importantly, to the parliament. This is essential so that the parliament makes sound laws that affect Commonwealth companies and to maintain the executive government's accountability to the parliament. The proposal to establish an Audit Committee of the Parliament and to have the ANAO's annual estimates overseen by such a committee is important to ensuring the independence of the Auditor-General from political pressure. The Auditor-General should report to the parliament and should be accountable only to the people's elected representatives. The independence of the Auditor-General from the pressures of an incumbent government is essential to establishing a worthwhile audit, especially program efficiency audits. Currently, it is the Department of Finance, the DOF; which advises the government on the resources to be made available to the ANAO. This is also an obvious inhibitor to the independence of the ANAO. It is no surprise that the efficiency audits have not been conducted by the Auditor General on programs administered by the Department of Finance, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Treasury. No doubt the Auditor General and his staff would be highly reluctant to engage in efficiency audits in such key departments if they believed they could not report without fear or favour and a negative report could result in a reduction of resources. That is why the ANAO should be dependent only on the proposed committee and, through it, the parliament for the resources needed to employ staff and to operate effectively. The recommendation that the ANAO should become a statutory authority and be able to set the terms and conditions of employed staff is a proposal of great merit. In recent years it has been very difficult for the ANAO to hold on to experienced staff. Better packages are on offer in the private sector, with the money differential continuing to widen. This is especially so in the area of computer audits, where there is a shortage of skilled people and the private sector easily outbids the ANAO. If the Auditor-General is going to attract high calibre staff and is going to retain them, the ANAO must be able to set out its own conditions for the employment of staff. The operations of the ANAO are too important for any government to be tying the Auditor-General's hands behind his back. It is unfortunate that the ANAO suffers a lack of resources to conduct more widespread efficiency audits. The reports that I have already mentioned are no doubt just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to poor program administration and, in some cases, the downright abuse of programs to further the government's re-election plans. Of late, in-house program reviews have been growing in popularity amongst departments and agencies. Such reviews make sense if only to assess whether program objectives are being met and to measure and oversee progress· being made with continuing programs. Unfortunately, when it comes to fundamental reviews which examine the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of a program, in-house reviews are usually a complete waste of time. To date, program evaluations that are written internally do little more than present a flowery review of performance. Internal reviews are conducted only to substantiate the amount of money being expended on programs and to develop a rationale for greater funding in the next budget. It is difficult for departmental officers to evaluate their own department's programs without fear or favour and still hope to have a career in the same department. That is a disgrace. Recently, it has come to my attention that an internal review of the Department of Tourism's role in the 1992 Seville expo was written earlier this year but is still to see the light of day. The department claims the report is not yet finalised. It is, but the department refuses to circulate the report because it is so damning. This is an example of an in-house review which is objective-a rare report indeed. However, the chances are that it will never see the light of day. The fact remains that if reports that examine the worth of programs are to be of any real use to the agency they relate to, or to other agencies, they should be publicly available and would best be written by the ANAO. The Department of Tourism also has a program, called the forest ecotourism program, for which grants for the 1992-93 financial year were targeted towards marginal Labor electorates. Apparently, senior officers were first asked to divvy up the proposalsthe loot-according to electorate, but they refused. Their reasoning was that the request was too political and not in keeping with the role of public servants. Junior officers were then ordered to divvy up the proposals according to electorates. This they did, with the majority of grants going towards marginal Labor seats. If the information I have received is accurate, this program in the 1992-93 year was as corrupt as the sports rorts affair. This program has never experienced an efficiency audit and is a classic example of why programs need more intensive scrutiny from, the Auditor General. I mentioned earlier that there are other means by which programs receive scrutiny, such as estimates committees, questions on notice and freedom of information procedures. If freedom of information is to play a worthwhile role, it needs to be greatly reformed. It is a travesty that those who take a keen interest in the operations of government programs are unable to access documents that detail the performance of the programs. By way of an example, I requested information from the Department of Industrial Relations that related to its reviews and evaluations of the workplace reform program and the best practice program. The department obviously fears accountability. As a result, has quoted me a fee of $4,960 to gain access to certain relevant documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. If a member of parliament has difficulties in accessing such information by means of freedom of information laws, due to the cost and administrative hassles, what chance do others have? Then there are departments and agencies which refuse to provide requested documents, in flagrant breach of the act. Few citizens would have the patience or financial resources to pursue these departments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, as they are able to, or to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The behaviour of many departments in dealing with FOI requests is nothing less than obstructionist. They do not want to be held accountable by the people of Australia, who provide the taxes which fund their programs. Ultimately, the purpose of the For act is facilitate access to information, not to find new ways to withhold that information. Accountability of the government to the Australian people and parliament is essential and of paramount importance. To make this accountability meaningful, the Auditor-General must be given the powers and independence to carry out efficiency audits in the whole of the Commonwealth sector, including wholly Commonwealth owned companies. As such, the government should accept the coalition's amendments. The government should also change the Freedom of Information Act to ensure a right to information, with . departments having to substantiate fully their reasons for not providing requested information.

""(4) If another Act (either expressly or by implication) requires or permits an amount to be transferred from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Fund, then the Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated for the transfer by force of this subsection (unless the contrary intention appears in that other Act)."" As foreshadowed in the second reading speeches to the Financial Management and Accountability Bill and cognate bills, the government has proposed a number of amendments to those bills. I present the explanatory memoranda and notes on those proposals. There are three proposed amendments, the to first of which I have just moved to the Financial Management Accountability Bill, 19 to the Auditor-General Bill and 20 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill. Of these 42 proposals, 21 arise directly from recommendations of the JCPA through its report 331. The remainder arise from issues that were brought to attention by submissions and evidence given by various persons to the JCPA as part of its process of reviewing the bills. In all respects the referral· of the bills to the JCPA for examination has been a most valuable exercise. The government decided not to accept only seven of the JCPA's 35 recommendations relating to these bills. Those seven relate to the Auditor-General Bill. Two relate to the role of the proposed Audit Committee of Parliament, in respect of commissioning performance audits; two relate to the formalities of the role of the executive in advising the Governor General on the appointments of the Auditor-General and the independent auditor; two relate to the disclosure of sensitive information; and one relates to the conditions of service of staff of the ANAO. The government will be responding formally to JCPA report 331 in due course. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 20.

25,Mr SNOWDON,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (2.20 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 contains the amendments announced by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) on 6 April 1994. These amendments inject much needed flexibility into the administration of the scheme and close an emerging loophole where some people were avoiding their child support obligations, again placing responsibility for the financial support of their children onto the Commonwealth. These twin objectives have been achieved by increasing the administrative role of the CSA in some areas, extending the rights of parents to enter into private payment arrangements, ensuring private child support agreements entered into by DSS clients provide adequate levels of child support, and aligning the child support presumptions of parentage with those in the Family Law Act 1975. 1. Presumptions of parentage The bill brings the presumptions of parentage in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 into line with the presumptions used in the Family Law Act 1975. Currently, the child support presumptions are limited to those where some documentary evidence exists as a basis for the presumption-for example, a child born during marriage. This bill also allows the registrar to be satisfied that a man is a parent of a child where: that child was born to a woman married to that man within 10 months after their marriage has been annulled; that child was born to a woman who was married to that man, separated from him, resumed cohabitation for not more than three months and separated again, and that child was born within 10 months after cohabitation ended and after the dissolution of their marriage; or that child was born to a woman who cohabited with that man for a period of at least six months and this period included the time 10 months before the birth. Aligning the child support presumptions of parentage with those of the Family Law Act will streamline the administrative arrangements in place between the Child Support Agency and the Department of Social Security. Currently, many custodial parents who apply for child support are required to obtain a birth certificate or a statutory declaration from the father. This can take months, and causes needless hardship to children and custodial parents deprived of support. during this period. It can also create substantial arrears of child support for the non-custodial parent when the necessary proof is obtained, causing his or her liability to be backdated to the time the application was made. The administrative delays associated with obtaining this paperwork have contributed to significant criticism of the scheme. This amendment will largely remove this problem. 2. Child Support Agreements A study conducted by the Department of Social Security has indicated that 80 per cent of agreements registered with the Child Support Agency are for amounts less than formula assessment. On average, these agreements are for 50 per cent less than the formula assessment. This has the effect of transferring responsibility for the financial support of the children to the Commonwealth. To remedy this emerging loophole in the interaction between child support and social security legislation, the bill requires the registrar to accept child support agreements for custodial parents receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance when these agreements meet the Department of Social Security's requirement that the custodial parent take reasonable action to obtain maintenance. Parents will remain free to negotiate agreements that contain a mixture of periodic, nonperiodic and capitalised maintenance. However, if the custodial parent is receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance the combined value of cash and non-cash components in the agreement must provide adequate levels of child support. 3. Non-enforcement of certain Stage 1 cases The bill provides for the non-enforcement of amounts of maintenance payable under a stage 1 court order or court registered agreement in two circumstances: firstly, when a non-custodial parent's income from all sources is not more than the maximum rate of single pension and they are in receipt of an income tested pen.sion, benefit or allowance-in practice this will usually be when the non-custodial parent is unemployed or unable to be employed through, for example, a serious illness; and . secondly, when a child has left the ongoing care of the custodial parent. In the case of a non-custodial parent's income falling below the threshold amount, may apply to the registrar to not terms of a court. order or court registered agreement. Checks will be undertaken with the Department of Social Security to ensure the non-custodian's income is below this threshold and, if verified, the amounts specian fied in the order will no longer be collected by the Child Support Agency. The non-enforcement period will generally be from the date of the non-custodian's application although the registrar will have discretion to back-date the start of this enforcement period to the date the person first qualified under this income test. However, the non-enforcement period will not earlier than the day on which child support was last collected. This will prevent overpayfreedom ments of child support being made to custodiments al parents and the subsequent hardship children and custodial parents that could occur through recovery of this overpayment. Similarly, if a child leaves the ongoing of a person named in a stage 1 court order court registered agreement, the registrar will, where both parents elect, no longer enforce fails, the terms of the order or agreement as they apply to that child. Temporary absences, including normal access time and temporary short-term changes to access arrangements, will be ignored. Further, a child at boarding school will not be deemed to have left the care of the custodial parent. It is not the rears. intention of this amendment to allow noncustodial parents to obtain credits against their liability for each and every day they care for their children. The parents must agree in writing that a substantive change in care occurred and that it is likely to be ongoing. It is important to note that the court or court registered agreement will not changed as a result of this amendment. This amendment merely gives the registrar the ability to not enforce certain amounts for the periods involved. No debt accrues to the Commonwealth during these periods. It will always remain open to either party to have order varied or for the custodial parent to enforce amounts in his or her own right. This amendment simply gives the registrar the ability to not enforce a registered liability for he or she the period involved. enforce the 4. Private collection The bill extends the rights of custodial parents in receipt of an income tested pension, benefit or allowance to collect child support privately. Newly registered clients receiving income tested pension, benefit or allowance may, under the current law, elect, at the outset, to receive child support payments privately. Large numbers make that election and the agency becomes involved in colleca tion for these clients only when private nonarrangements fail. However, once the agency does become involved in collection for these clients, they are not able to subsequently elect commence for private collection. The amendment will introduce greater for parents to make private arrangefor payment. The choice will be availto able to custodial parents where the noncustodial parent has a good payment record; that is, when there are no arrears outstanding care at the date of election and all payments have or been made on time for the six-month period before the election. If a private arrangement the custodial parent will be able to elect, once again, to have the liability enforced by the Child Support Agency. The registrar will be able to collect three months of arrears upon application for CSA enforcement. In exceptional circumstances, the registrar will be able to collect up to nine months of arIt appears almost certain that this bill will not be debated by the Senate this year. As a result, the government wishes to introduce an amendment, the effect of which is to delay has the commencement of these provisions from 1 January 1995 to the date of royal assent. order The government also wishes to introduce be another minor amendment to the provisions that I have just outlined for the collection of arrears in certain circumstances. It ensures that where an application for arrears is for a period of up to nine months but there are no exceptional circumstances, any arrears out the standing for the period of the most recent three months will be registered for collection without the need for a payee to lodge another application for the shorter period. The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated contains a more detailed explanation of the provisions of the bill. I also table the amendment together with a supplementary explanatory memorandum explaining the amendments. I commend the bill, as amended, to the House.  are debating the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. After the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, I hope that next year the minister and I will be facing off across the table debating quite a few more child support amendment bills-that is, of course, if he is actually still the minister. It is impossible to approach this debate with anything other than mixed feelings. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill will provide some relief to some clients of the Child Support Agency, which is why the coalition is not opposing the legislation. But, at the same time, we are all aware that many others will continue to suffer under an uncaring, inefficient and inflexible agencyan agency that has had its faults made very clear this week. That is why we are proposing an amendment to the bill. Today's bill implements the legislative requirements of the reforms to the Child Support Agency, announced in April by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). Bandaid measures is a good old cliche of Australian politics. This bill is casualty war treatment. Now that the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues has given us a full diagnosis of the CSA's problems, we look forward to seeing the legislation that will really reform the Child Support Agency. It is rather convenient for the Assistant Treasurer to have a bill like this around at the moment. I suspect the Assistant Treasurer imagines he will be able to counter criticism in the report by pointing to this bill and the changes he has already announced; You can almost imagine the press release his staff have already drafted: 'Reform already under way, minister responds'. I suppose it is an argument but, when we look at the enormous problems the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues identified, it is hardly convincing. It is even less convincing when we look at the way the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) have treated the. report. The ministers have savaged its findings to such an extent that the member for  ordinary step of issuing a media release saying that he is happy to debate the report and its recommendations with the ministers at any time and any place. If we can take today's bill as an indication of support for reform of the CSA, there is little evidence that much more will be coming from the Assistant Treasurer or the Minister for Social Security. The member for Chifley has already been forced to make a personal explanation in the House defending his committee's report against criticism from the ministers in his own party. Yesterday's release from the member for Chifley shows the fight is growing. Not only have the relations between the ministers and the member for Chifley completely broken down but also it appears that the ministers have decided to protect their reputations and their departments by scorning the wholesale changes recommended in the report. A record number of people made submissions to the CSA inquiry. The government must not ignore them, especially as many of the comments and recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues are particularly relevant to today's debate. The committee has told us that different CSA officers have used different administrative procedures. It has found that some CSA administrative practices actually conflict with the child support legislation. CSA review procedures have been strongly condemned. It has been suggested that, as review officers are not accountable to the Child Support Registrar, there is a lack of consistency in decision making. As decisions are not published, there is no precedent to follow. So parties do not have the ability to predict. what may happen in their situation, causing uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the review system. The committee was scathing of many of the CSA's administrative procedures, claiming it was unacceptable that the CSA had not been able to rectify the inadequacies of its service delivery. It pointed out that CSA staff had regularly been rude to clients; been unhelpful or biased; made personal judgments about clients and their circumstances; refused to give reasons for decisions; told clients anything to get them off the phone; and made entirely inappropriate remarks such as, 'You'd be better off on the dole.' Mr Charles interjecting confirms my statements. There have been suggestions that CSA staff do not adequately understand the requirements of the Privacy Act and have disclosed personal information without authorisation. It has been claimed that CSA staff have interpreted court orders incorrectly and have incorrectly registered applications to courts. This legislation proposes. changes that will give CSA staff greater discretionary powers. In the past, the high number of complaints to the ombudsman and findings like those published a few months ago by the Auditor General have suggested that agency staff do not necessarily have the skills to make the sensitive and responsible decisions their work entails. The government must make sure that CSA officers are up to· the job if this legislation is to deliver any of the desired results. The government must make sure that staff have the comprehensive training they need to effectively manage the issues this legislation raises. The first part of the bill deals with presumption of parentage. Under the current legislation, the registrar is able to accept that a particular man is the father of a child only under certain provisions. The bill will extend the current provisions to include those that exist in the Family Law Act 1975, making it easier for mothers to provide proof of parentage. This is expected to result in faster approval of applications for child support and earlier commencement dates. I need not say how desirable this would be when we consider that the certain family law issues committee found that, rather than taking the targeted eight weeks, it took an average of more than 20 weeks for custodians to receive the first payment. This is also likely to benefit the non-custodial parent, who will be less likely to receive a large arrears bill consisting of back payments from the date of application when child support commences. However, now that there is an avenue for presumption of parenthood which is independent of the father, there is also a possibility that disputes may arise when the registrar-in other words, agency staff-will be required to make a decision on which case will be upheld. Review of these will be available only through the Family Court. Given the stress and anxiety parents and children could suffer over these decisions if they are forced to contest them in court, I sincerely hope the CSA will be able to handle these matters adequately. The second proposed change aims to close a loophole that has allowed some parents to abuse the welfare system. As the child support legislation has no jurisdiction over private agreements, parents with registered agreements where the custodial parent has received a minimal amount of child support are picking up the balance of their income from social security. The Social Security Act 1991 already gives the .DSS power to refuse sole parent benefits if it believes custodial parents have not made reasonable efforts to receive maintenance. The new rules will require that custodial parents who receive the sole parent pension or family payments take reasonable action to ensure that they are receiving adequate maintenance and provide the mechanism whereby the CSA and DSS can determine this. . Custodial parents refused applications under these regulations will be able to appeal against a decision by Social Security through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the AAT. A decision by the CSA may be appealed only through the Family Court. Again, while supporting this measure, the coalition is concerned about the CSA's ability to fulfil its administrative responsibilities. I have already mentioned the difficulties and strain involved in appealing to the Family Court. The third part of the bill tackles some of the inflexible regulations that stage 1 parents endure when they try to alter their support agreement through the Family Court. Up until now, the CSA has been required to strictly follow court orders, even when clients' circumstances change. This legislation will allow the CSA a degree of discretion in enforcing court orders when the non-custodial parent's income falls below a certain threshold or if a child leaves the care of a custodial parent. In the first case, payers will be able to apply for a temporary waiver and, in the latter, both parents will need to make an agreement and either party may resolve to continue to have payments enforced at a later date. Court orders will remain unchanged and parents will need to apply to the courts if they wish to make an alteration to the agreement itself. I wish to raise two concerns about these provisions. As I said earlier, the CSA has a poor administrative record. Many parents are understandably wary of its activities and of decisions made by its staff. We have already heard this week how the CSA has refused to give reasons for decisions and has failed to provide clients with adequate information on their rights and obligations. If the agency to ensure that its clients are aware of these new freedoms, parents will not use them, defeating the purpose of this legislation. At the same time, the CSA will need to be vigilant and ensure that payers who apply for waivers do not surreptitiously recommence without their knowledge. Given the agency's poor record of enforcement, there is a clear need to make sure this does not occur. The final change proposed today is an amendment to the Child Support Act that will allow Social Security clients the option of receiving payments either through the CSA or privately. Under the current legislation payees who have chosen to be paid through the CSA cannot have a private agreement. The bill will allow parents to have private agreements where payments have been regular, along with the right to return to agency collection if payments become irregular, offering clients greater flexibility. Later in this debate I will be moving an amendment to this bill condemning the government for its handling of the CSA. The demands for services we put on our governments and the standards of financial and administrative accountability we require of them makes bureaucracy a necessity in our society. But this bureaucracy must work. It must remember that it exists to serve its clients only. In a democracy, when a bureaucracy that has been put in place to meet the demands of a section of the community, which have been considered worthy of attention and support by the government, does not work, the ethos of that democracy is undermined. The CSA must be responsive to clients and accountable to the parliament. My office is handling one particularly egregious case which provides the perfect illustration of how the CSA actually works. The minister might like to hear how the CSA appears to be supporting contempt of court. An individual awarded custody of two children by an order of the Family Court has had one child illegally removed by the ex-spouse. The Child Support Agency is now determining whether the child support paid to that first individual fails should now be reduced. The CSA reasons that that first individual now does not have the responsibility for the daily care of the child. The most bungling of old Eastern bloc officials at their most bitingly satirist could not have produced such a scenario. It is a disgrace that such a situation should exist. Since the CSA was founded, the government has shown a complete lack of sensitivity to the problem it tries to alleviate. Parental separation is one of the most distressing and stressful experiences. It might be thought that special consideration to this point might be paid as a matter of course. The opposite has happened. The Child Support Agency is one of the most unprofessional sectors of government. When the ombudsman handed down his annual report a few weeks ago I pointed out that the CSA, with 300,000 active cases, had generated 2,451 complaints. Social Security, with five million clients, only generated less than a thousand more. For a long time the government has claimed that the only people complaining about the CSA was a well-organised minority of noncustodial parents. The sorts of complaints and concerns raised about the CSA should have disproved this myth long ago. The child support formula is a cause for concern and should be examined, but there is a huge variety of other problems raised about the CSA. I will give just one example of the sorts of complexities we are dealing with. The committee found that a child support determination event occurs if a liable parent ceases to be a resident of Australia and it recommended that the registrar be empowered to obtain a court order stopping a liable parent from leaving Australia until appropriate arrangements had been made for the payment of child support. But what action could the government take or would it take in the case of non-custodial parents who are posted overseas by their employers not by their choice? The CSA's review system leaves much to be desired. Social Security and DEET have a four-step appeal mode where the client can appeal to the original decision maker, to the local manager, to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Student Assistance Review Tribunal and, finally, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Child Support Agency clients can only appeal to an authorised review officer of the CSA and then to the Family Court, or, in the case of stage 1 parents, to the Family Court in the first instance. The cost of court action is an obvious barrier to many people seeking to have a review. When the Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues set up a hotline, which attracted 150,000 calls, the myth I spoke of earlier was put to rest. The committee's report has totally exposed the CSA. It should be a matter of shame for the Assistant Treasurer that he and the Minister for Social Security are now punishing the member for Chifley for telling the truth. The committee's report should not have been news. The CSA has been under fire for many years. Criticisms have come from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Auditor General, the parliament and the many support groups that exist to help clients who have been poorly treated by the agency. The government likes to claim that it is responsible for spreading the notion of child support and responsibility for children. This is not the case. All reasonable Australians accept the idea of child support. What they do not accept is poor and insensitive administration. This is what the CSA has offered to too many of its clients. The reforms we are debating today should have been already introduced. All the ministerial spin doctoring cannot overrule the fact that the most controversial elements of the scheme throughout i-s history-the formula and tougher measures for enforcing payments-have not been dealt with. The problems of the CSA will not go away. They cannot be obscured. This week has made this clear. It is also clear that these faults have been obvious for some time. The government should be condemned for not tackling them earlier. For that reason, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) its deleterious handling of the provision of child support maintenance for both custodial and non-custodial parents; (2) its continued failure to address the significant deficiencies of the operation of the Child Support Agency; (3) its prevarication in taking action to reform child support maintenance in this country to ensure it is fair and equitable to all parties"". The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill should be acknowledged as a start on the job of reforming the CSA. But this week the CSA stands condemned. The government that has allowed it to reach such a state should be condemned, too.",66

27,Ms DEAHM,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"The welfare of children is a topic that I do not think anyone would disagree is extremely important. This government is well aware that the welfare of children is a very important issue, because it brought in the child support system, it has advanced the number of childhad care centres which have been developed in this country, it has introduced fee relief and it has introduced the child-care cash rebate. has also entered into a great number of packages for families-more recently the home child-care allowance and, shortly, the parenting allowance. I think nation from the opposition about this government's commitment to child care and child welfare is ill founded. I will come later to the issue of the admindiscussed istration of the Child Support Agency, but child support scheme was brought in for some very good reasons. Those of us who rememwhere ber the old days of guilt in divorce-when couple divorced there had to be a guilty party and we saw the ludicrous situation of people being set up or deliberately setting themselves up in order to provide a case for a divorcechildren, will remember that children were seen either and access. as a prize or as something to be taken away from parents as a punishment for their part a divorce. I am very pleased that family law legislation-more recently the Family Law Reform Bill-has gone a long way to chanchildren ging this system. I think it is that whole of custody and access and of payment of child support that has given rise to so many of the problems that so many of us as local members encounter every day in our electorate offices. I had a letter only the other day from who was extremely bitter. He was venting his spleen against women parliamentarians. saw us as a bunch of nasty little feminists who had messed up his life by bringing in the child support system and no guilt in divorce. I wrote back and said, 'I am sure that my sisters here would be flattered to think we so much power because we are in small minority.' He was triggered into writing this letter after I sent out my regular newsletter and talked about the affirmative action plans the Australian Labor Party. He condemned me for supporting that because it would mean more nasty feminists coming into this place and doing more to mess up his life. Initially, I felt angry and then a great deal of sympathy because I realised that he was reacting to the situation in his life. He told me that his wife walked out on him. He felt that she was the guilty party and ought to have been punished as far as the divorce was concerned. He It thought she should not have been given custody of the children because she was the guilty party. We need to change those attitudes, and they will not change just by chanthat any condemges in legislation. Some honourable members may remember the speech I gave in this place a while ago about Shere Hite's report on the family. I how the family is evolving, how we the are gradually moving away from the patriarchal family where the father is the boss, the boys grow up to be tough and the a girls grow up to be homemakers. I think part of that whole psychological framework of our society has given rise to situations that end up in some nasty divorces and battles over including the whole issue of custody The Family Law Reform Bill is taking in away the terms 'custody' and 'access'. We are now looking at parenting agreements. I think parents should accept responsibility for their regardless of where they are living issue and whether it is temporary or permanent. Both parents have a responsibility to look after and care for their children. I know that all members in this place have had a number of constituents come to see them complaining a man about the Child Support Agency. Some of those complaints are justified, and some of He them are not justified. Amongst the not justified complaints are those where noncustodial parents say, 'I don't have custody of the children. I don't get access to the children because my spouse won't let me, even though had the court has given me access. Therefore, why such a should I pay child support?' I feel very sad that they do not have access, but access is a totally different issue from child support. With this reform bill, I hope we in will now be able to address the issue of access. Payment should not be conditional on access. The children still have to eat, be clothed and go to·school whether or not they are seeing one parent, two parents or neither. They still have need to be cared for. Therefore, child payment is justified. The issue of having child support taken out of the pay of non-custodial parents at source is also said to be humiliating. I agree that it probably can be quite humiliating, but they are generally cases where it has not been agreed by both sides that a private arrangement should be made. Let us face it: we brought in the child support system because so many non-custodial parents were getting away with not paying for their children. It is all very well for the Family Court to say, 'This parent will have custody. This parent will pay X amount,' but in some cases that is not happening. The burden was then falling on the social security system, on the government and on you and me as taxpayers. Therefore, the child support system was brought in.  had quite a bit to say about the administration of the Child Support Agency. I think anyone who disagreed with its past record has probably been living on the moon for a length of time. The administration certainly has been very difficult and deficient, but I do not agree with his ongoing criticisms. The report brought down by the honourable member for  other day will go a long way towards fixing that. The minister responsible had already taken moves to fix a lot of the problems. The kinds of problems that have been brought to my attention are long delays in getting phones answered and getting responses back, getting a letter one day saying a person is in arrears and another the next day to say that he is in credit. I think they have been quite unjustified. I am sure every local member worth his salt in this place has done much to help those people: I had one case involving a non-custodial parent, the father, who had since remarried. His former wife decided to return to the UK and take the children with her. The judge in the Family Court agreed that was possible. The judgment was that his child support payments would be reduced by the equivalent of the cost of economy return air fares for the children to visit him in Australia or for him to visit them in the UK. He worked out that this would totally wipe out his child support payment. The Child Support Agency said, 'We can't do anything about a court order. Why don't you claim the money back afterwards?' He said, 'What hope have I got of claiming it back from the UK when it has already been spent?' He and his new wife came to me out of frustration. I am not blowing my own trumpet here, but what I am about to say shows that it has to take local members to get these things fixed. The man's new wife said that she went to the agency and said, 'I am going to my local member about this.' The woman at the agency asked her, 'Is that Maggie?' She said 'Yes' and the woman said, 'Oh God.' So I apparently have something of a reputation for kicking heads in the Child Support Agency. I am pleased to say that within a week that situation was fixed. The court order was honoured and the man was able to resume his life, even though he obviously missed his children, who were then taken out of the country. I do not think it would serve a great purpose to catalogue the number of complaints that we have received, because we have all received a great number of them. I do not think we should be clouded by the dispute about some of the statistics in the member for Chifley's report. The issue is that there has been a problem, and that problem will now be fixed. I commend the member for Chifley and the members of his committee on that report; it was a true example of consultative planning, consultative government. Too often in this place, because we sit in here as elected members, we think that we have the right to go ahead with what we think is right, and we do not often enough go out and consult those that we represent. I have the statistics here somewhere; I know there were thousands of phone calls on an open line over only a couple of days. The complaints ranged wide ly. There were many complaints from men who felt that they were paying too much-and we have all had those complaints. There were the ones, as I described earlier, who thought they ought not to be paying at all because they did not get access to their children. Women complained that their former husbands were misrepresenting their income in order that the amount they paid was less than what they should have paid. There were a huge number of complaints and a huge number of written submissions, and I know that a good number of those came from my electorate. The member for Chifley's committee has achieved something that will be very much welcomed by a lot of people out there in the community. This bill is fairly straightforward. It aims to provide more flexibility in the child support system. One way it does that is by aligning the child support presumptions of parentage with those in the Family Law Act. It is ridiculous to have one system for one act and a different one for another. The parentage assumptions have been a lot tighter with the Child Support Agency. Some custodial parents-women-have even had to wait until DNA tests have been done in order to prove parentage. This can take an awful long time. It can tie up courts and a whole lot of bureaucracies while waiting to find out whether or not a particular person is the parent. So that is one measure that will go a long way in helping us. The bill introduces a measure whereby the social security system will now be able to make sure that those who are entering into private payments will not be paid at less than the formula assessment. Social Security will not simply be making up the deficit in cases where the formula is not being met. I reiterate that the welfare of children is paramount in this legislation. The assurance that both parents take full responsibility for looking after children, whether it is for their health, their welfare or their education is extremely important. I commend the government for introducing the child support system and for all the other measures that we have put forward to care for children in our soci ety.",73

29,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer to the minister's comments yesterday that the decision of the Reserve Bank not to raise interest rates this week was 'sensible and sound economic management'. As there had been no public announcement of any decision by the Reserve Bank one way or the other, how are you in a: position to make any statement about the decision?

37,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was talking to the ACTU about commitments it was making to securing traineeships next year, which it made. As for the question as to how I knew, I got a message at the end of the meeting from a journalist waiting outside, through my media adviser, that the Reserve Bank had made a decision and that when I came out to report on the meeting she would be asking that question. The question that she asked, which was not the question put to air on The World Today-and I am happy to provide the tape to you so you can hear it-was: what do you say about the decision of the Reserve Bank today not to increase interest rates? I responded to that question and my answer is on the record. NA",75
38,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from Estonia led by the President. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Unemployment",76
39,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer the minister to the employment data released earlier today. What progress is being made in creating jobs? How does today's data compare with past employment data?",76
40,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The news today on the jobs front is good again: 30,000 new jobs have been created in the last month-a 40,000 full time increase and a 10,000 reduction in part-time work. These figures today confirm the unmistakable trend that this government is presiding over in seeing unemployment fall. The achievement of this government on the employment front is quite remarkable: 434,000 jobs have been created since we were re-elected, that is, 87 per cent of the target, 87 per cent of our commitment, in only 20 months. One year ago the seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment was 11 per cent. Today it is 9.3 per cent. But if we go to the trend figures-because these are the important ones; they show the consistency-we can see a fall in the trend rate of unemployment every month for the last 15 months. It now stands at 9.2 per cent. Two out of three of the jobs created in the last 12 months have been full time jobs. I acknowledge that, at 9.3 per cent, the unemployment rate is still too high, but what has to be acknowledged is the important progress we have made. We made a commitment as a .government to get unemployment down. We did not say we would do it overnight but that we would make a real effort to get it down. These figures demonstrate that we are making remarkable progress to date. The reason the unemployment rate went up this month, despite that increase in jobs, was that it was influenced by the participation rate, which went up 0.3 per cent. This reflects a healthy labour market. It reflects the fact that at the same time as demand for labour is increasing so is the supply. It shows the flexibility and mobility in our labour force and it also, I might add, helps in ensuring that with the growth we can help contain the wage pressures. It is not just the participation rate that this economy has had to deal with over the last decade. Our population growth has been second only to Turkey in growth amongst the OECD countries. It has been twice the OECD average. So, if we take the combination of the population growth, the participation growth and increases in the labour force, we have to create more jobs than other countries to get the unemployment rate down. In the period between 1983 and 1991 Australia has been growing jobs faster than any other OECD country and it is still producing them at three times the OECD average. The figures to date are confirmation of the trend. I notice the shadow minister for employment put out a statement today talking about 'Keating's unemployment trap'. He made this observation: There are still more unemployed people today at 820,000 then there were at the peak of the last recession-1983-at 730,000. On the face of it, that is right. But do we know what the labour force was at that time? It was a labour force of seven million. Dr Kemp-We are talking about the number of people who are out of jobs.",76
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Goldstein is not entitled to debate the issue.,76
42,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today it is 8.8 million. It seems to me that the shadow minister, who prides himself on his intellectual and academic background, ought to be honest in the way in which these figures are presented. This government is honouring its promises. This government is making inroads to unemployment that the opposition could never have made. This government is achieving what people said could not be achieved and it will continue with that task. Interest Rates",77
43,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed the to the Treasurer. Is it the case that the serve Bank yesterday decided not to raise interest rates?

50,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House as to the extent of the tax cuts inhad volved in reduced tariffs since the tariff reduction program began in 1988? What further tax cuts are expected to flow from tariff reductions in the next couple of years and what other advantages have flowed on to the economy through this tariff reduction process?,77

53,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you still here? Are you still with us?,77
54,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This tariff reduction program which was decided upon in 1988 and reinforced in 1991,77
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minster So and the Leader of the Opposition are not nothing. helping the Treasurer.,77
56,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition is making it plain that he wants to be noticedto let us know he is still here, that he is still with us.",77
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume you seat, Prime Minister. There is no point of order. Mr Costello-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. You have repeatedly said in this chamber that frivolous points of order will not be tolerated. That was a frivolous point of and you should let the Prime Minister",77
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I said there was no point of order and there was not.,77
59,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, the tariff reduction program, which started in 1988 and reinforced in 1991, reduces tariffs generally to five per cent by 1996-97, and there is a more graduated program for cars, textiles, Tariffs clothing and footwear to the year 2000. This year the tax cut, compared with keeping tariffs where they would otherwise have been there not been this program, represents a cut in revenue of $3.7 billion, or a 3Y2 per cent cut in tax. That is what the tax cut represents this year. By 1996-97, this per annum tax cut will have increased to $6 billion. So it is obviously a very substantial factor in terms of taxes being paid by the Australian people. The cumulative cost to revenue since 1988 will be around $17 billion by 1996-97. So this tariff reduction program represents a substantial ongoing program of increasing tax cuts which flows through to taxpayers the form of cheaper clothing, cheaper cars, cheaper consumer durables and so on. It also reduces the cost of many inputs to industry. It is not just reduced prices for imports which are important for Australians; this has the double banger effect of forcing Australian produced goods to have lower prices than would otherwise be the case. So we see those prices also being lower. That gives the consumers a very substantial benefit. A good example of that is in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. The price of TCF products has increased by five per cent less than the CPI over the five years of the tariff reduction program up to 1992-93. Since this program began, the average nominal nite of tariff on manufacturing has fallen from 9.5 per cent to 5.4 per cent this year. But the manufacturing industry as a whole has been adversely affected; indeed, it is growing quite strongly. In the last 12 months to the September quarter, we saw manufacturing production increase by 12.2 per cent, which is clearly very strong growth. Manufacturing exports, terms of volume, have increased 2Y2 times since the mid-1980s and manufacturing confidence is close to the highest levels in years. Clearly, this tariff reduction program has not had a damaging effect on our manupeople facturing industries; rather it has galvanised them into vastly improved performance and has been of great benefit to Ian people through lower prices and a much more vibrant sector of the economy whi-h is also producing considerable exports. The Industry Commission has estimated that the 1991 reforms which extended the tariff reform process would reduce the underlying inflation by just under two per cent and increase the GDP growth by 0.4 Clearly, this whole program is very beneficial to the Australian people. It is an ongoing program of very substantial tax cuts which should not be overlooked. It is producing lower prices for consumer goods, reducing the rate of inflation, producing a more dynamic manufacturing industry with much improved export capability and giving us higher growth. That is being evidenced in the very high rates in of growth of GDP we are now experiencing. Interest Rates",77
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Given that the Reserve Bank board is not scheduled to meet again until next year, can the Australian public safely assume they will not be slugged with another interest rate increase before Christmas, or is it simply the case that you are callously waiting until next week to slug them after the House has risen?",78
61,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said before, it is up to the Reserve Bank to announce anything, if it has anything to announce. That is a matter for the Governor of the Reserve Bank. If he wants to announce anything, he should do it. Mr Costello-Well, you tell us.",78

So the of Australia are much better off under these policies. All of that should be of great comfort to them as they contemplate Christall of the Australmas this year. But what will not be so comforting to them is the knowledge that the opposition will be contemplating, over this Christmas, all of the horrendous things it has in mind for them as part of its deficit reduction program through expenditure cuts.

If that is not the case, then presumably the opposition does not intend to reduce the deficit, because it does not think you should do it in any other way. Yet it constantly tells us we should be reducing the deficit, says that it should be by way of reducing government expenditure and then wants to run away from any suggestion that it might do anything nasty to the Australian people. It would not be in anything like the Fightback cuts again-of course not. How else is it going to reduce the deficit if it is not going to use reductions in government expenditure?

101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise to speak to the point of order. It would greatly assist the objective that the Leader of the House has , mind if you stopped the Prime Minister in using remarks like 'turkey' in relation to the Leader of the Opposition.",81

105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Calwell-thank you! The Leader of the House has raised a point which I think has some validity, in that the sort of question that was asked here goes to something which should concern us all. I would ask people to listen to the answer.",81
106,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Only 40 per cent can name the two federal houses of parliament; only 24 per cent know that senators are selected on a state-wide basis; only 33 per cent have some knowledge of the rights 'and responsibilities of citizens; 60 per cent have a total lack of knowledge about how the constitution can be changed, despite having voted in referendums. This disturbing lack of knowledge about our institutions presumably translates into less respect for them than most of us would think is healthy in a democracyand I might say less pride in them too.",81
107,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about your behaviour?,81
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Moore!,81
109,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If we believe that the strength of our society and our success in the future depend on the quality of our democracy, we as a people need to understand our democratic institutions and to have a sense of their history and the ideals on which they are based. Mr Reith-Talk about sickening.",81
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,81
111,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Without this understanding, it is very hard to participate in our civic life. So long as this is the case, it is difficult to claim that Australia is in the truest sense a genuinely inclusive society. Mr Reith-I have been very quiet but I tell you I am getting sick of this.",81
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Flinders is stretching it. Mr Reith-Well, the way he goes on is sickening.",81

114,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I therefore strongly endorse",82
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Just one moment, Prime Minister. Mr Abbott- Mr SPEAKER ",82
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When you get the call! The member for Warringah on a point of order. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. When the Prime Minister is not being abusive, he is actually making a ministerial statement. Should he not make a ministerial statement at the appropriate time",82
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat. The Prime Minister is entirely in order. Mr Abbott-so it can properly be debated in this House?,82
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat.,82
119,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I therefore strongly endorse the group's view that civics education should be the mortar that holds together the bricks of our contemporary multicultural Australia and that it should rank with mathematics and English as a priority for school education. I have accepted the expert group's recommendation that interested parties be given three months to comment on the report's findings and recommendations before the government considers implementing the measures. Many of the recommendations are within the responsibility of state and territory governments, and I have written to all premiers and chief ministers inviting them to comment. They were fully consulted in the preparation of the report, as were the leaders of parties at the federal level. I welcome the spirit of commitment and bipartisanship to the report, which is an exceptionally good one, as even a cursory examination of it will reveal. The nature of the report and its recommendations go to the heart of the cohesion of our society and its future. I take this opportunity to thank the authors of the report: Professor Stuart Macintyre, the Ernest Scott Professor of History at the University of Melbourne; Dr Ken Boston, Director-General of School Education in New South Wales; and Ms Susan Pascoe, Coordinating Chairperson (Policy) at the Catholic Education Office in Melbourne. They have all done us a very great service. It is a very readable report; it is an exceptionally good one. The fact that such· a body of educationalists has suggested that we rank civics education along with mathematics and English demonstrates their underlying concern and the priority they put upon the nature of this education. Let me again thank the group and commend its report to the House and to the country. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",82
120,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Did the Prime Minister, as claimed in the Bulletin, argue before cabinet in March 1989 that the third runway should be fully operational from both directions, not only from the south over Botany Bay, and that the east-west runway be made virtually redundant, one result of which being that the development of Badgerys Creek to international standard could be put back to 2010 and beyond? Did he make reference to this matter again today at his press conference? Is it true, as the Bulletin this week said, that if the residents of Drummoyne, Leichhardt, Botany, Hunters Hill, Lewisham, Haberfield, Marrickville and dozens of other Sydney suburbs want to know who is to blame they need look no further than their Prime Minister for the current shambles?",82
121,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One thing for sure is that Mr Laurie Oakes is not the Ernest Scott Professor of History to whom I just referred a moment ago. If you rely upon garbled versions of cabinet meetings years ago, then you are relying upon a very rotten stick.",82
122,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You cannot talk about Laurie Brereton like that.,82
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Bennelong has already been warned.,82
124,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The fact is that the Leader of the National Party made his position very clear when he said: Any further delay in deciding on a third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life,82
125,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you going to answer the question?,83
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor!,83
127,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He continued: as well as economic insanity. The loss of life point went to the intersection of the two runways. Exactly! Now you are up stating that if other people share that view there is something wrong with them. Mr Moore-What has this to do with it?,83
128,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are in a state. On 13 August 1991 there was an incident where a Thai Airways DC 10 almost collided with an Ansett A320 Airbus. I will read a Sydney Morning Herald report of the day. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",83
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does the Leader of the National Party wish to make a point of order on this? Mr Tim Fischer-I do. In clear-cut terms my question focused on the north-south runway and the additional third runway. The particular dimension which the Prime Minister now turns to is irrelevant to the question. I ask you to direct him to answer the specific question.,83
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not know whether what the Prime Minister is about to say is goingMr Downer-We do. We heard it in the press conference.,83
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not, so you are one up on me. As far as I am concerned, the Prime Minister is in order.",83
132,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You mean you were looking in? Mr Tim Fischer-On TV.,83
133,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Aren't you sweet!,83
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister-will come to the answer.,83
135,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How considerate. The aviation editor of the Sydney Morning Herald said , on 13 August 1991: Simultaneous landings are standard on the two main runways at Sydney Airport when two planes land at once and with one stopping short of the intersection to allow the other plane to land safely. In other words, the system works only by one stopping short to let the other come through; otherwise one collects the other. That was the problem here. Under the simops operation, the key point is that only pilots who use Kingsford Smith often are licensed to use the eastwest runway. This is not true of international pilots. As a consequence, this near miss involved a laden",83
136,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Because you could not put them onto that runway.,83
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor!,83
138,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A laden Thai Airways DClO came within 33 feet of colliding ,with an Ansett A320 Airbus and the two of them would have picked up a Qantas 747 on the threshold and the whole lot would have slid into the overseas terminal. Opposition members-Oh! Go on!",83
139,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the truth. This is what I have been advised. Could you imagine the hand wringing on the other side. Like most people in public life, I know that the intersecting runways are a cause of exceptional danger. As the Minister for Transport and I made clear today at our press conference, obviously a parallel runway system is far safer for the people of Sydney and for the air travellers than any intersecting runway could ever be. This comes from the Leader of the National Party, who urges the building of the third runway because not to do so could mean loss of life. In other words, he is pointing to the very problem that he now wants to, in some way, make a political point about. The insincerity and hypocrisy of this are manifest. Is it any wonder when one looks at the National Party and goes through the National Party people that we findMr Tim Fischer-Can you find it?",83
140,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are all here. We have had the current spokesperson on transport in favour of the runway. We have had the former Leader of the National Party in New South Wales in favour of the runway and we have had quotations from Mr Jull, the then shadow tourism minister. Mrs Bishop-- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order relating to standing order 81, which requires that no member may digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion. The question under discussion is the remarks of the Prime Minister in cabinet. I refer you to your statement, which you referred me to earlier this week. On 26 May last year you said that it was going to be your practice to allow ministers to speak on matters where they do not exercise direct control and to make references that are brief to opposition attitude where appropriate. You went on to say that you would be looking to ministers to be more relevant than they had been before and that you would be asking them to wind up their answers. This is your interpretation of other people's rulings and I ask you to apply your own interpretations of those rulings and wind this man up. Government members-Wind him up!",83
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Those on my right. I would like to rule on the point of order raised by the honourable member for Mackellar. I am pleased that she went and had a look at the comment I made last year. The Prime Minister was asked a question about a specific matter relevant to a parallel runway at Sydney airport. He was asked about a Bulletin article and he was asked about issues surrounding that. Mr Downer-No, he wasn't.",84
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think he was. The Prime Minister is answering that question and, as has been suggested by the member for Mackellar, is, I think at this stage, contrasting opposition attitudes.",84
143,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a long way from the Senate to the House of Representatives. It is not just across the corridor, is it? The statement of then shadow National Party minister for transport, Mr Charles Blunt, said: Charles Blunt today launched a petition campaign to add to the mounting community pressure on the Hawke government to build a third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. It goes on and on. As a consequence, references by the coalition about the value of leaving intersecting runways obtained, while the Leader of the National Party calls it unsafe and a risk to life, have all the hypocrisy in the world about them. I make the point I made the other day: 180,000 people were affected by airport noise at Mascot. That is now reduced to 90,000 and, as a result of today's measures, that will be reduced substantially again as aircraft get greater height, as we oblige them to take off from the end of the seaward runway and as we reduce the spread between the routes they might take. As these changes come into place and as we accelerate the noise abatement program, those who were subject for years to the same route will find that there is a noise reduction and that the noise amelioration measures will have an impact. But we will have a much safer airport for the travelling public and for ' the community in the area of metropolitan Sydney surrounding the airport. Safety, efficiency and compatibility are the three issues here, and the government is seeking to get the three issues as right as it possibly can. Urban and Regional Development",84
144,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies tabled a major report in 1992 on patterns of urban settlement. Could the minister inform the House of how the government is responding to the major recommendations contained in the report?,84
145,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I commend to the House this report, which was an extremely important report that laid the basis for a whole range of reforms. Australia is a very urbanised country and, in terms of politics, it is important that the national government see its role in terms of not only urban policy but also regional policy. Since that report was published, we have seen the creation of the Department of Housing and Regional Development with responsibility for policy in line with that report. We have seen 26 area strategies developed as part of the better cities program around Australia. We are developing a new regional development program, which will mean that regions across Australia will maximise their economic input to the Australian economy and increasingly, as regional organisations get under way, we are going to see a very significant impact in that way. Arising out of this report, the government has been. pursuing an urban and regional review, which will report in the early part of next year. We have seen the Prime Minister's task force on urban design, which also will be considered by the government and responded to in the very near future. I want to refer briefly to the committee that wrote that report, particularly the member for Lalor and the member for Petrie, who both made a very significant response to the development of policy in this area. I table the government's response to the report. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport """,84
146,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the Prime Minister admit that he was the person responsible for persuading cabinet in 1989 to virtually close the east-west runway and make the new north-south runway at Mascot airport fully operational from both directions? Did the Prime Minister do this because the noise impact on marginal Labor seats would be beneficial whilst redirecting flights either over Liberal held seats to their disadvantage, or over safe Labor seats? Will the Prime Minister admit that this involvement in the development of the third runway has been motivated by no more than grubby party political reasons?",85
147,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Aircraft taking off from the north of Sydney, which is the cause of people's angst, must go across Labor electorates before they cross the first coalition held electorate, the electorate of Bennelong. What did the member for Bennelong have to say about this phenomenon? He said: Q. Do you think the government will go for the third runway, Mr Howard? A. I think they probably will now. I hope they do. They should have gone for it 6Yz years ago. There is an overwhelming case for doing it. I grew up under the flight paths of the St George area, know something about the politics of the area. And I have always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on local residents. Government members-Oh!",85
148,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is our little mate, honest John. He then went on to say: The great bulk of the rest of them are only mildly affected. In any event, they bought their houses knowing full well that they were under the flight paths. Oh, sym-pa-thetic! He went on to say: I think the case for it on general interest grounds is absolutely overwhelming. He went on and on. The point that the Leader of the Opposition makes is that, in some way, I, amongst others, in a cabinet meeting that went for a couple of days, on a consideration that went for a couple of years in reality, was motivated in my role in cabinet--one amo,ngst many-to see aircraft fly over coalition held seats, when the first coalition seat the planes actually flew over was that of the member for Bennelong. The member for Bennelong has made it quite clear that he was inviting them· to come. He was out there with the flags giving them directions from Boronia Park. There was a question years ago about who was up in Boronia Park giving the signs, and it was always a mystery. We now know that it was the member for Bennelong. He is multiskilled. ,With Sydney being the gateway to Australia in terms of the tourist industry, with the Olympic Games coming in the year 2000, where the bulk of the air traffic is coming, with a 60 per cent increase in air traffic coming from the success of the government's deregulatory policies, you would think that at least one major public decision could be taken without this silly political nonsense from the opposition, which has supported this all the way through. John Fahey wonders why he is doing badly. It is because members of the public know that they cannot even rely upon him to see into place the very airport he bragged about at the Olympics. When Mr Samaranch came, I heard Mr Fahey telling 'him, 'Yes, we'll have the third runway operating. We'll have all this and I aircraft capacity. We'll have so many thou.. sand hotel rooms greater than Barcelona.' Here he is now, a head of government; putting as in the Sydney Morning Herald demeaning himself, making himself look dishonest. Is it any wonder the public says, 'Thank God somebody is getting some progress around here; things are actually happening. We are getting a major facility, with the federal government doing its very best to see it come into place on the best terms and conditions possible for residents'? The residents of the areas of Sydney affected by the airport want action. They want decisions. They want to be relieved of the noise. They want the noise reduced. They want the government to introduce this change. They want a safe airport. The government announced the amelioration measures and then, today, the further measures: directing aircraft to keep the spread of their operations-the fanning off the end of the eastwest runway approach path; sending the aircraft to the back of the seaward runway. to get greater height before they reach built-up areas; putting penalties on companies which infringe those regulations; and extending the amelioration measures. All of these changes come from the package introduced by my colleague the Minister for Transport in the cabinet room today. What a massive change this is: from the system of runways which has operated for 20 years, we have seen a new system come into place, with three or four weeks of transitional changes, getting it back to capacity. The minister deserves the commendation of members on this side of the House-of all members-for a job well done in getting that change into place. Mr Tim Fischer-The silence is telling.",85
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,86
150,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I commend today's decisions. Those people in Sydney who are affected will be less affected-even the ones the member for Bennelong was beckoning years ago, who had permanent exposure for 20-odd years to the northern approach on take-off from the north-south runway. There will now be much more height for a jumbo jet-about another 750 feet of separation between housing and that aircraft. There will now be an average separation of 1,500 feet over Drummoyne; that will rise to around 2,200 feet. Other categories of lighter jet aircraft will be at 4,000 to 5,000 feet before they reach the member for Bennelong's electorate. So I am sure the member for Bennelong will not join with the Leader of the National Party and the Leader of the Opposition in the hypocrisy we have heard from both of them this afternoon. Budget Surplus",86
151,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen claims that the budget could be returned to surplus virtually overnight? What measures would be required to achieve this? What are the government's intentions in regard to this matter?,86
152,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have noticed a few commentators saying in the press recently that the government should cut heavily into outlaysMr 'nIckey-So did Bernie Fraser.,86
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor! Mr 'nIckey-You may as well.,86
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I did.,86
155,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not only is the level of taxation in Australia lower than that in all other OECD countries-with the exception of Turkey-but the level of outlays is amongst the lowest in the OECD. Indeed, only Japan and the United States have lower levels. Dr Kemp-What will you do about tax rates?",86
156,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Goldstein!,86
157,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, it astonishes me that those on the other side who have ready access to the figures should go around the country saying that we should cut savagely into outlays. That is what they have been saying. You have to ask: what do they want? They have an outlay share to GDP now which is amongst the lowest in the world, with only Japan and the US below us, and the shadow Treasurer is running around saying that we should cut $11.7 billion from the budget. Mr Costello-That's a lie; you know that is a lie.",86
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,87
159,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition perjured himself in the House the other day by saying, 'I didn't say at any stageMr Costello-Come on! .Opposition members-Withdraw! Withdraw!",87

163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister might resume his seat for just one moment. The member for O'Connor was probably first to the dispatch box. Were you raising a point of order? Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, the point of order was to demand that that remark be withdrawn under the standing orders. It is an outrageous remark. But, if it is to stand, I would welcome the opportunity to respond in kind.",87
164,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister may have been provoked by an interjection from the Opposition members-Oh! Withdraw!,87
165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have not heard me yet. Order! It is your question time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition indeed used language which in this place in the past has been considered to be unparliamentary by other Speakers and which I have been forced to ensure is withdrawn. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister are given special status. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has reminded me of this on a couple of occasions. I again appeal to all members, in terms of their response in this place, to be careful of their language. Opposition members-Withdraw! With draw! Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I think it would be entirely appropriate for you to insist the Prime Minister withdraw; otherwise you are setting new standards for parliamentary behaviour and language. Let me say, on behalf of the coalition, that you should not fear the Prime Minister; you should stand up to him and force him to withdraw, and not feel that you will lose your job if you stand up to him. We will vote for you. But the Prime Minister should be made to withdraw.",87
166,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. This is about the fourth time the Leader of the Opposition has challenged the veracity of your rulings and argued about your integrity in the chair. Frankly, he has to get out of cowards' castle; start moving motions before he does it again. Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",87
167,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He should withdraw.,87
168,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Just a minute. Mr Thckey-I gather now that the word 'perjured' is to be acceptable terminology.,87
169,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I have not said that yet. Go on. Mr Thckey-I want your ruling on that, simply because I would like to know.",87
170,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was quite obviously trying to give the hint to both sides about that. I did call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to order in respect of a comment that he interjected. I will ask him to withdraw, and I will then ask the Prime Minister to draw. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did interject that that was a lie. It was clearly audible. I ask him to withdraw. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order- 1gave a personal explimation on this the other day. I set out the facts; they are the facts that stand.",87
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, no. We are dealing with now. I ask you to withdraw. Mr Costello-If you ask me to withdraw other comments, I do so.",87
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Prime Minister also to withdraw his comments.,87
173,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will withdraw. But let me just make this clear: in the House on 6 December the deputy leader, quoting himself, said: I didn't say at any stage that you'd cut Government expenditure by eleven point seven billion dollars Yet, on ABC Radio's Daybreak program on 30 November 1994, Pru Goward asked: I'll just put it once more. What does the Opposition think should be the cut in the budget deficit? PETER COSTELLO-Well, Pm, it's got to be greater than $11.7 billion this year, and it's be greater than the deficit next year. My case rests. Mr Costello-Is that it?",88
174,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is caught out telling fibs. There is the record. Where would $11. 7 billion cut come from? It is more the entire budget allocation for defence. his right hand. Oddly enough, $11.7 billion is precisely the cost of the whole aged care pension system. er. If you abolished assistance to families absolutely, you would save $10.4 billion. removed assistance to the unemployed, you would save $10.3 billion. You would certainly save $11 billion by abolishing Medicare. If you do not want to do it in one hit by knocking out age pensions or support for the unemployed or Medicare, you could have a tail-for instance: abolishing veterans, industry assistance for the agricultuI ral, mining and manufacturing industries, funding for universities. The opposition says it is opposed to middle-class welfare. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under the standing orders, question time is an opportunity for ministers to tell the truth about the government, not to tell lies about the opposition. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that the Prime Minister's behaviour is bringing this House into disrepute.",88
175,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member will resume his .seat. The Prime Minister was· asked a· question about deficit reduction and he is· answering that question. I remind the member for Warringah, ag-n, about his particular penchant for tiling points of order. He wants to be very, very careful..",88
176,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The claim from the opposition is about middle-class welfare. Does it refer to age pensions, when about 75 per cent of aged people receive them? Is that middle-class welfare-75 per cent? Are family payments middle-class welfare when about 80 per cent of families receive them? Is Medicare, which has universal coverage, or school education, which all young people are entitled to, middle-class welfare? You cannot run round this country talking about an $11 billion to $12 billion reduction in the budget deficit without facing the consequences of it. got to You cannot get up here and ask questions about interest rates and taxes without coming clean with your own policies. As the Treasurerindicated earlier, the Leader of the Opposition is going home with a list of measures, which he will be considering over the Christan mas period, as well as the list of members than and their phone numbers, which he keeps at Mr Costello-You are a champion deceiv",88
177,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy If you Leader of the Opposition!,88
178,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets up and says in the House, 'I didn't say at any stage that you would cut government spending by $11.7 cockbillion,' we know then what Mr Kennett pensions for meant when he. said: have every reason to be concerned about the and integrity of that camp. He was referring, of course, to the role of the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the integrity of that camp. So, too, do we. Wage Claims",88
179,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Whenever it is suggested that your government is facilitating growing inequality in Australia, you mount the stump and evoke the imagery of the true believers. If it is true that your government remains committed to working· men and women· why, at a time when profits are at record levels, do you refuse to accept the rea-onable wage claims of the Transport Workers Union? Why do you allow the Minister for Industrial Relations to sool employers. onto the unions when the ACTU condemns him for it? Is the real truth that, as the former Treasurer, John Dawkins, claimed in July this year, it is the Business Council of Australia and not the unions that is the dominant influence on the Labor Party?",88
180,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rarely go to Business Council functions. I made that clear the other day. Maybe the honourable gentleman was not listening when the Treasurer gave his answer earlier. We have had a four per cent increase in real incomes per capita in the last 12 months. That is what he said-a four percentage point increase in real incomes per capita in the last 12 months. Try to find any other Western society that has had a four per cent real increase in incomes per capita over the last 12 months. Do you know why we have had that increase? It is because as nominal wages have risen with productivity and inflation has declined, the real income of Australians has risen. That is the lesson for anybody who was around in the 1980s and 1970s and who knows that high inflation robbed Australian families and Australian workers of their savings and their purchasing power and put big mortgages on them. The economic management of the government, which has taken average inflation rates from 10 per cent under the hopeless, feckless, incompetent opposition we now have-the then government-to an inflation rate of under two per cent, is why real incomes are rising. It is not only real incomes that are rising; employment is also rising. So there is a rise not only in incomes per capita but also in the number of people in households in work. Household disposable income, as distinct from per capita income, is rising sharply as a consequence. That is because of the maintenance of the government's anti-inflationary policies, inflationary performance, and the productivity arrangements. The answer to the honourable member is that there are short-term gains for people thinking en masse. They can go out and secure high nominal wage increases to find them taken away a month later by higher inflation. That is why the government has been urging responsible outcomes. But we are certainly not urging-I share this view with the honourable member-a higher level of profit share in the economy, which is already beyond any historical precedent. Why would we? If profits go higher than where they are now they will be claimed back by the work force. And of course they should be, because there is just no case for a profit share way beyond any level in our historical experience. So now as we see greater volumes occurring in the recovery on top of the profits which already exist, the profit share is bound to rise. That will be shared under enterprise bargaining with workers through higher real wages. But that will come by way of productivity. It will be enhanced by the greater level of plant and equipment investment, because we are talking here about factor productivity-not labour productivity-which is coming from plant, equipment and labour productivity. With a 29 per cent increase in plant and equipment investment coming through this last 12 months we are going to see a greater rise in productivity, and the workers are entitled to share in it. If they are not entitled to get a wage increase now, when are they entitled to get a wage increase? We are talking about a wage increase the economy can afford, whereas the other side of the House wants to drive young people down to $3 an hour, rip away at people on incomes under $20,000 and build a profit share. Why ordinary coves like the member for Bennelong, who came not from the landed gentry-he was not born with a cutlery service in his mouth-would be out there urging that we rip the guts out of low income workers' incomes at the height of these sorts of profits is beyond me. That sort of spite is completely beyond me. But that is not the position of the questioner; he does not hold that position. But he must understand that, were we to go back to high levels of inflation, Australian workers would be the first to suffer because the people who have paid most the price of high infla:' tion in Australia in the last 20 years have been the work force of this country. That is why the ACTU and the leadership of the ACTU have had such an anti-inflationary cast to their policy. '",89
181,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The unemployed. The ACTU could not care less about the unemployed.,90
182,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bennelong says the ACTU could not care less about the unemployed.,90
183,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The unemployed, it doesn't.",90
184,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Bennelong!,90
185,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The whole essence of the accord was to restrain the top end power of the ACro through the 1980s to bring up the bottom end with the family allowance supplement, more employment, supplementary payments to low paid workers and the like, and occupational superannuation to the low paid as well as those on high incomes .. The very essence of the policy was to support employment and better incomes for Australian workers. The questioner shares that objective with the government and I am glad he does. We have nothing in common, either of us, with the coalition on this point. Mr MCGauran-He is a Labor rat.",90
186,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Even if he is, at least he understands this point: there is no point in ripping away at workers' salaries while the profit share continues to rise. Nor is there point in watching inflation jump up out of the bottle again and ripping away at Australian workers' incomes. That is why the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Treasurer, I and others are concerned about the wage settlements. We want workers to see real increases in incomes, as the Treasurer demonstrated at question time, but ones which the economy can broadly afford. Pay TV",90
187,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Communications and the Arts advise what action has been taken to fulfil the government's commitment to allow the ABC to participate in pay TV? What steps are being taken to provide safeguards on the program content of the new service?,90
188,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have today allocated the twochannel satellite pay TV licence, commonly known as licence C, to a subsidiary of the ABC. This allocation fulfils the government's commitment to allow the ABC to participate in pay TV on the basis that it is a sensible commercial arrangement and one that has a structure that minimises any detriment to the ABC's free-to-air services. The government has provided a start-up grant of $12.5 million to meet the initial capital costs of the ABC being involved in pay TV. The ABC has advised me that it plans to launch the service in the early part of next year. The ABC has also told me that it plans to have one channel devoted to news, continuing the ABC's provision of high quality news and current affairs, and a second channel which will provide a mixture of children's, drama and other programs, such as the arts and light entertainment. In consultation with the ABC I have put a licence condition on the licence granted to the ABC's subsidiary. This licence condition will require a significant level of Australian programming. This will be a very key feature of the services provided by licence C in the ABC and it reflects the public commitment of the ABC to continue to provide high quality Australian programming. The view the government has put forward that the ABC has the right to explore its any opportunities in pay TV can be contrasted with the many views that have been expressed by the opposition over the last few years. Changing and multifaceted views of the opposition are not just restricted to the third runway in Sydney. At one stage we had the opposition spokesman demand that the ABC be given a licence. Then it condemned the government for actually giving the ABC that licence and then it claimed that the ABC's involvement in pay TV has in some way compromised the independence of the ABC.",90
189,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are flexible.,90
190,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition certainly is into flexibility, as the Assistant Treasurer says. There has been some media coverage today of a report which the Australian Broadcasting Authority released yesterday, which followed some extensive research undertaken by the ABA on the views and attitudes of the Australian community on whether R-rated material should be available on pay TV. There was one unfortunate headline-put on by one of the subeditors, no dc;mbt-in the Sydney Morning Herald that disturbed me. It ran the report under the headline 'Pay TV porn plan backed'. The government has made it very clear all along that it will not allow under any circumstances X-rated programs on pay television. I am sure that is the strong view of people on both sides of the House. R-rated programs will be available only if parliament agrees, and that will only happen if there are resolutions carried by both houses. Even if parliament does approve of R-rated material being on pay TV, the legislation requires that that material be able to be restricted by parents by the use of PIN numbers or smart cards. The ABA's research has shown that most parents indicate that they will be likely to use such devices to ensure that they can protect their children. These important safeguards go to an important object of the Broadcasting Services Act-to ensure that the community places a high priority on the protection of children. I expect the parliament will have a chance to debate this issue in both houses once we have had a chance to read the ABA's report and once we have had a chance to see the Senate select committee's report on community standards when it becomes available. It is currently expected in the new year. Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations",90
191,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of his earlier remark in question time that the performance of the Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations has been 'a job well done'. Should a minister who has caused chaos in aviation safety be allowed to continue in his post, or is that 'a job well done'? Should a minister whose incompetence has made Sydney airport a nightmare in terms of both its efficiency and the massive increases in aircraft noise it has imposed upon tens of thousands of Sydneysiders be allowed to continue in his post, or is that a 'job well done'? Should a minister whose industrial relations legislation has led to total confusion, the victimisation of businesses and increases in industrial disputation be allowed to continue in his post? Should a minister who has 10,st tens of millions of dollars in taxpayers' money over the ANL debacle be allowed to continue in his post? Why was it that the member for Canberra was required to resign because of her failure to fulfil proper standards of ministerial accountability, yet the Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations gets off scot-free? Is your failure to uphold proper standards of ministerial accountability little more than a pay-off to the ballot box motorbike rider?",91
192,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The only person named today in an editorial in a major newspaper who was urged to resign his position was the Leader of the Opposition, in the Sydney Morning Herald. I noticed a letter to the editor in the Australian just recently said: Last week I cancelled my membership of the Liberal Party SA division. Since the 1993 election, I have viewed the party with embarrassment and consternation. Since Downer's ascendancy to the leadership, my concerns turned to mistrust and dread. And now John Howard. May God save the Liberal Party. Owen MCKevett Tanunda South Australia",91
193,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,91
194,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know the pressure is on the Leader of the Opposition to resign. Mr Staley, who did very poorly with his assault on Sir Andrew Grimwade over the better part of a decade, is now trying to remove the Leader of the Opposition and trying to recruit Mr Robin Gray, the former Tasmanian Premier, to lead the Liberal Party. I have so much material here, I do not know whereMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 145, this is utterly irrelevant. The Prime Minister is treating this parliament with complete contempt. You ought to instruct him to give relevant, not irrelevant, answers. He is treating you with contempt, Mr Speaker.",91
195,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Several questions which the Leader of the Opposition put to the Prime Minister went to responsibility. I think the Prime Minister was probably noting down the content of those questions. It sounded like a warm-up to the MPI. I invite the Prime Minister to come to the substance of the question.,91
196,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was about the position of a minister and whether he should be retained. I was saying that the only issue in public debate this day in the newspapers is the retention of my dear friend over there. I will finish this part of the answer on this point: Mr Staley is trying to inveigle Mr Gray to be the leader. A report in the Tasmanian Advertiser said that the bribery royal commission has found that Liberal leader Mr Robin Gray acted improperly and was deceitful, dishonest and evasive. Yet Mr Staley, snatching again, is out there trying to recruit him.",92

198,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order!,92
199,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition asked me about air safety; did not the minister cause it? Answer: no, he did not. He was sworn in as Minister for Transport not all that long ago. As any member of the House knows, questions of the design of safety measures, and pilot error, which occurs perpetually, are beyond the capacity of any regulatory authority to prevent. The key question is: how did the minister act? Answer: promptly, to fund a whole new regime of air safety regulations, including the establishment of a new authorityMr MCGauran-So it is his predecessor's fault.",92
200,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gippsland!,92
201,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"beyond the CAA to go and manage it. He asked me about the airport. The airport was in the course of being built when the minister was sworn in as Minister for Transport. Again, what has he done? He has acted quickly to try to bring back to some order the transitional problems of a massive shift in the air traffic arrangements over Sydney over a transitional period, to stream and narrow the stream and reduce the fan of take-offs, to increase the height of aircraft, to make changes toMr MCGauran-Put him back on his surfboard.",92
202,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Drder! I warn the member for Gippsland!,92
203,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"introduce quickly a noise amelioration package, which would lead any in the world, I think, and now further to introduce it over three years and not 10 years. That is what the minister did. It is a matter of fact that the Minister for Transport at the time opposed the building of the third runway. He is now the minister and it has been opened. He has acted quickly to try to resolve the problem. The Leader of the Opposition went on to talk about victimisation of business with a profit share beyond any historical precedent and to talk about some industrial disputes, for a system that the opposition has urged forever-enterprise bargaining, bargaining in the marketplace.",92
204,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, that is a revelation. Well, well.",92

206,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Bennelong I know is excited about that.,92

208,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,92
209,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So you are actually invoking the need for a US style process of negotiation with, possibly, strikes that come with it-and when they come, you want me to fire the minister. Really, you are in trouble. Mr Downer-Fire him; fire him!",92
210,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are in real trouble. I made references earlier to the Christmas turkey-and he is in trouble over here. The question is: will we see him back? I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper and say that we wish him well as we wave him goodbye. NA,92

215,Mr COSTELLO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was, again, at misrepresentation in question time todayMr Downer-As he is every day.",93
216,Mr COSTELLO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"knowing full well that what he was saying was false. The Prime Minister claims that I have called for $11.7 billion worth of spending cuts, something I have never done. He referred to an interview with Pm Goward, which was on 30 November 1994. I confess it was not the most elegant of language. But most certainly it is clear that I did not at any stage call for $11.7 billion worth of expenditure cuts. What I said was, 'Plainly, they've got to try to get back a lower deficit and they've got to try to get into surplus.' I referred to the fact that the government had missed the One Nation statement by $41 billion",93
217,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Now you are debating the point. You have shown where you have been,93
218,Mr COSTELLO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,No. I am taking you through it. I have to show you the transcript.,93

252,Mr TIM FISCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During question time, in respect of Mascot airport, a number of issues were discussed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his answers. I want to clarify for the benefit of the House that I have advocated east of the intersection limited safe operation of the east-west runway; in fact, east of the intersection and east of taxiway crossover point. That is an entirely different concept from the one the Prime Minister referred to.",94

256,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,94
257,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During question time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) quoted accurately-for a change-from an interview, which I gave on the Mike Carlton program on 21 March 1989, in which I expressed support for the construction of the third runway. I have never denied the fact that I have expressed that support. What the Prime Minister sought to do was· to contrast that support with the criticism that I have offered of the way in which the government intends to victimise people who live in Liberal held seats. There is no inconsistency in asking for fair and equal treatment",94
258,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order: this is a matter of personal explanation; it is not a debating point. He has now said that the Prime Minister accurately quoted him in the course of his remarks, and the rest of the material is a debating point. If he wishes to debate it, there are all sorts of mechanisms in the House to do so. This ain't one of them.",94
259,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The Leader of the House has made a valid point, and you have been here long enough to know that. Where have you been misrepresented?",94
260,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I acknowledge that the quotation from 1989 was correct. That is not an issue.,94
261,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Where have you been misrepresented?,94
262,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,He claimed that my criticism of the government's policy on noise control was inconsistent with supporting a third runway. What I object to is victimisation of people who live in Liberal electorates.,94
263,Mr CADMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",94

266,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,94
267,Mr CADMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I refer the House to page 4224 of yesterday's Hansard and remarks made by the member for Wills (Mr Cleary). He said: To think that the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) would run down to the dispatch box and condemn the Minister for Transport ... I would say that he has created inconveniences, losses, delays and other disruptions, but I would not seek to condemn",94

271,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! Yesterday the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) raised as a possible question of privilege the availability of bills presented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous). The honourable member stated that the bills had not been made available to members of the opposition but, the honourable member claimed, earlier in the day they had been made available to members of the press, or the media. The honourable member said that she had attended a briefing earlier in the day but had not been given copies of the bills. I have no involvement in the processes engaged in by ministers in respect of legislation before its introduction. It may be that, on occasions, copies of draft or settled bills are provided to shadow ministers before the bills are presented to the House. The extent and nature of any consultation or briefing engaged in by ministers in respect of bills is a matter for the judgment of each minister. In my opinion, there has been no. prima facie evidence that an issue of privilege or contempt is involved in the points made by the honourable member for Mackellar yesterday. These matters are rather matters of practice and arrangements in respect of legislation. If the facts are as alleged there may have been some discourtesy, but that is another matter.",95
272,Mrs BISHOP,PRIVILEGE,"'-- Mr Speaker, I seek clarification. The fact of the matter is that the legislation was made available by the minister's office to the press gallery. When I specifically asked for the legislation at the briefing, I was told it would not be made available to anyone under any circumstances prior to the tabling of those bills in the parliament Is it a question of contempt? Is there a convention here that in fact legislation ought not to be made available prior to it being tabled as reports of committees are? I think it is a very serious point because it is more than discourtesy. It is far more than discourtesy; it is a matter of proper respect being paid to the parliament, as distinct from the distinction that was made that it was somehow more important to give legislation to the press gallery rather than to the parliament. It was not a question of members of the opposition; it was of any member of parliament.",95
273,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I have listened with interest to the honourable member, and again I refer her to my statement. Having not held such a position where I might have been entrusted to give copies of bills to. anybody, I do not know what the procedure actually is. Certainly, on what I have ascertained by looking at past practice, there is no prima facie case which would want me to seek any suggestion of privilege being breached or whatever. But I do say to the honourable member that in fact it is probably discourteous and it is something which ministers should look at. AUDITOR-GENERAVS REPORTS.",95

A Tale of Three Cities-Review of the Auditor General's Efficiency Audit of the Australian Taxation Office: Taxpayers in Unincorporated Businesses The Government welcomed the tabling in November 1988 of the Committee's Report. As the Committee noted on page 25 of its report, the then Australian Audit Office (AAO) found that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) had already taken action on the key matters of concern to the AAO by the time the Efficiency Audit commenced. The Government is pleased that the Committee was able to agree with the complimentary assessment by the AAO and also that the considerable efforts made by the ATO to improve its performance were recognised. The Government agrees with all of the observations made by the Committee in its report. In particular, the Committee's clear endorsement of the benefits of a high integrity taxpayer idfmtiI fication system was welcomed. The passage of the Tax File Number (TFN) legislation enabled the ATO to more effectively identify tax evaders-a matter which received particular attention by the AAO in this Efficiency Audit. The TFN legislation has fostered a climate more conducive to voluntary compliance with the tax laws. In addition, the ATO's Modernisation program is enabling more efficient and effective identification and actioning of non compliance. The Committee also noted the importance of developing more effective case selection techniques and the value of systematically targeting particular industries for audits. Bearing in mind the need to make more effective use of audit resources in the unincorporated and small business sectors, the ATO implemented an enhanced program of audit projects. The program focuses on non-compliance and its measurement in targeted industries and on specific issues and for particular types of income. As the Committee suggested, these projects not only detect and measure non-compliance in a more systematic way but also foster voluntary compliance through publicity at appropriate stages and through working with appropriate industry associations. The Committee commented favourably on the high degree of co-operation evident between the AAO and ATO throughout the Efficiency Audit. The Committee can be assured that this co-operation has continued and will be a feature of future audits. A Taxing Review-Review of Six Efficiency Audits of the Australian Taxation Office The Government's response will be tabled in due course. COMMUNITY AFFAIRS (House Standing) Australia's international health programs The Government's response is expected to be tabled in the Autumn sittings 1995. CORPORATIONS AND SECURITIES (Joint Statutory) Differential voting shares and the Australian Stock Exchange The Attorney-General appointed an expert panel to undertake an inquiry into differential voting shares and the Australian Stock Exchange in December 1993. The panel reported to the Attorney-General on 28 February 1994. The Attorney-General publicly released the panel's report on 20 March 1994 and he made the report available for purchase in AGPS bookshops. The Close Corporations Act 1989 The Government's response is expected to be tabled during the Spring sittings 1994. ELECTORAL MATTERS (Joint Standing) Ready or not: refining the process for election '93 Counting the vote on election night The Government is finalising a combined response to these Reports and expects to table a response early in the Autumn sittings 1995.

INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (House Standing) Australian government purchasing policies: Buying our future-first report About a third of the Committee's recommendations were dealt with in the White Paper on Employment and Growth, brought down by the Government in May 1994, and the full Government response is expected to be tabled shortly. Undersold Overseas? Tourism and the Export Market Development Grants Scheme The recommendations of the parliamentary inquiry were taken into account in the subsequent evaluation of the entire Export Market Development Grants Scheme, the results of which were considered in the 1994 Budget context. The Budget decision granted single tourism operators eligibility to the Scheme however this was at the grant rate of 25 per cent. No further reply required. The Shipbuilding Industry: In the wake of the Bounty No further reply required. The Government's consideration of the recommendations of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee The Shipbuilding Industry: In the Wake of the Bounty has been overtaken by improvements in the environment for industry development since June 1992 when the report was tabled. In particular, the closer integration of policies on training, building of competitive firms and trade policies set in process by the Government's May 1994 White Paper ""Working Nation"" has addressed many of the report's recommendations. As the proposal for a feasibility study into a large shipbuilding project at Port Kembla lapsed in 1993, the key Recommendation 1 is no longer current. Since the Committee's report was tabled, there have been significant changes in the industry's approach to its future development. The Australian Shipbuilders' Association is strengthening its strategic planning processes with a view to long term improvements in competitiveness. A strategic plan has been prepared for the industry incorporating a vision to the year 2001 of $1 billion in exports by that year. An upgraded secretariat will focus on key .areas such as marketing, innovation in production and design, alliances, linkages (for example with supplier industries) and the development of networks as well as relations with Government. The White Paper initiatives on networking will support this Association's work. The White Paper incorporated the results of wide ranging reviews of R&D, export development, access to finance and skill development programs sought in the Committee's recommendations. In general and with the exception of Recommendation I, the recommendations of the report have now been incorporated in DIST, DEET, EPIC, Austrade and Defence programs and policies. NA (House Standing) Clearer Commonwealth Law: report of the inquiry into legislative drafting by the Commonwealth The Government's response is to be included in the Justice Statement, which is expected to be released early in 1995. Australian Law in Antarctica The report has raised several complex issues and in formulating the Government's response it has been necessary to undertake extensive consultation with a number of Ministers. Some of these issues have been addressed and consultation is continuing on the remaining issues. A response will be tabled as soon as possible. LONG TERM STRATEGIES (House Standing) Patterns of Urban Settlement-consolidating the future? The Government's response is expected to be tabled before the end of the Spring sittings 1994. Australia as an Information Society: the role of libraries/information networks A response to the report was delayed due to the need to consider the issues in the light of the Government's cultural policy statement, Creative Nation, which was released on 18 October 1994. It is proposed that a response will be tabled in the first half of 1995. MIGRATION (Joint Standing) Asylum, border control and detention Final response tabled 22 September 1994. Conditional migrant entry: the health rules The Government is finalising a response to the complex policy and related issues raised by this report.

282,Mr DOWNER,PAPERS,"We have now come to the end of the parliamentary year. This is the last opportunity for there to be a debate of this kind in this chamber in 1994. What we can say about this year is what we can say about so many years of a Labor government in power. It is a year of a government which has exercised power without values. When the history of this government is written-it will have to be written fairly soon-it will be called 'Power without values' and it will subtitled the 'True deceivers'. The whole theme of deceit and defrauding the Australian public is the theme that has through everything this government has been doing in the course of this year.. That is particularly true of the latter part of this year-the last month or so. There is no better example of that than the performance of the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) insists on dethey fending that man and refusing to do what should obviously do and that is dismiss the minister for complete and utter incompetence. After all, the member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) was dismissed from her portfolio for misleading and defrauding Australian taxpaylegislation, ers in relation to the expenditure of some million. Mr Costello--The sports rorts.",100
283,Mr DOWNER,PAPERS,"The sports rorts affair was small beer compared with the damage that has been caused by the Minister for Transport and Industrial Relations. When you look at the list of things he has done to Australians you find Line debacle. that it is a list of shame. He has created chaos in relation to aviation safety and there are something like six separate inquiries under way at the moment in that area. Yet for some reason or other the Prime Minister seems think he is doing a good job. Not only is he the minister who is responBrereton sible for massive increases in aircraft noise over Sydney but also he is the man who on 28 July signed off a minute saying that he knew where the increases in noise would and where the flight paths would be and then later went and told the Marrickville a completely different story. In other words, he totally misled and, I believe, deliberately misled the people of Sydney about the impact of the third runway and it is he and the Prime Minister who are responsible above all for pain that is being felt by the people of Sydthat. ney. The increases in· delays at Sydney airport and the enormous inefficiencies surrounding that airport have become a matter of international embarrassment to Australia. Again, it is the Minister for Transport who is responbe sible for the total incompetence surrounding the affairs at Sydney airport. Something like 91 per cent of all Ansett flights in and out of run Sydney are delayed. Ansett Airlines has received something like 30,000 complaints. In the area of industrial relations, we have seen backflips, reversals of policy, cave-ins to the trade union leadership and a change to the industrial relations legislation which has given the trade unions special privileges, even greater privileges than they had before, and have taken advantage of that. They have he taken advantage of that by now increasing very substantially the level of industrial disputation. As we move towards Christmas, Australians are going to suffer the consequences of changes in industrial relations done at the behest of the trade $30 union movement, which will lead to substantial increases in industrial disputation. The minister is totally responsible-there is no way for him to scurry out of this-for the debacle surrounding the Australian National Line. He has simply lost tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars over the Australian National The Prime Minister insists that this is a minister who is doing a good job. He is doing a good job, yet all the evidence is indisputto ably there that this is a minister who has brought great damage to this country. How could it be? Is it just a coincidence that Mr just happens to be the minister in the portfolio which has seen a deterioration in aviation safety, a scandal surrounding Sydney airport, increases in industrial disputation and be another scandal surrounding the Australian National Line? Is that bad luck? Is that just a Council coincidence? Do not be absurd. It is patently obvious that the only reason this incompetent minister will not be sacked is that he is part of the Prime Minister's royal the family. There is absolutely no dispute about The fact is that the Prime Minister and the .' Minister for Transport go back a long way-way back to the Blaxland pre-selection.",101
284,Mr HOWARD,PAPERS,That murky night in 1969.,101
285,Mr DOWNER,PAPERS,"That murky night in 1969 when Laurie rushed off on his motor bike with a ballot box riding pillion. The fact is that he is being defended by the man who is now Prime Minister for favours given. This is just another illustration of the point that, throughout its life, this government has exercised power without values. Concepts of ministerial responsibility go out the window, they do not matter. The need to ensure the parliament is treated with proper respect, that standing orders are properly. upheld and that fundamental institutions like question time conducted with at least a modicum of dignity are out the window. The government does not want that any more, it does not suit the Labor Party. It does not matter what the consequences for public respect of this institution may be, that is the end of it. When it comes to integrity there is no person who has more to answer for than the Prime Minister of this country. We have this absolute debacle surrounding Sydney airport, and who was the real architect of the particu- with it. lar decision that was made back in 1989? The man who is responsible for all that is happening today at Sydney airport is the Prime Minister of this country. It was he who persuaded the cabinet to cast aside the proposals which, for example, the Fraser government had accepted to build a third runway but for the take-offs and landings to come from the south. The Prime Minister said, 'No, it does not matter about the people, we will make sure that we maximise economic efficiency regardless of the social cost.' That was never going to matter, so there would be takeoffs and landings over the northern suburbs of Sydney. The consequences of that are there for all to see. It was the Prime Minister who persuaded the cabinet to accept that particular proposal and it is he who is ultimately responis sible for all that has happened at Sydney airport. Now we have a new plan which was announced today. There was glittering publicity, press conferences were held and promises were made, but at the end of the day we will still find thousands upon thousands of people in Sydney who will have their lives disrupted, their lives destroyed in many respects, by the changes to the flight patterns brought about by the actions of the Prime Minister of this country. Never let that be forgotten. All this stuff about who favoured a third runway or who did not is not the point. The point is the flight paths the aircraft use. Mr Beazley interjecting",102
286,Mr DOWNER,PAPERS,"You know that. You were the Minister for Aviation. You will continually refuse to accept that there is a total difference between what the Fraser governare ment proposed and what you people have done. The then Minister for Aviation, Wal Fife, explained his case very clearly on the PM program last night. The fact is that you have made some changes today, but the people of Sydney will remain inconvenienced by the actions of the Prime Minister. It is typical of the Labor Party to treat the public in this contemptuous way. The more deceit you throw out, the more you think you can get away with. It does not matter what the truth is; you say it and hope you get away Look at the way you defrauded the people at the last federal election. Today you are arguing that there must be tax increases. At the last election you not only said you opposed the GST but also said there would be no increases in sales tax and fuel tax. In fact, the Prime Minister said on 19 November that there would be no increases in tax at all, yet since then you have increased taxes by billions of dollars. Now you are planning still further increases in tax. The whole thing is a complete sham. You promised two tranches of l-a-w tax cuts at the last election. The second tranche was to begin-when was it to begin, do you remember?-on 1 January 1996. It was there in legislation. It could not be moved. L-i-e: that what it was. Of course it was abandoned. Then in the 1993 budget you said, 'We might have that second tranche of tax cuts in 1998.' Now when you are asked, 'Are you going to have the second tranche of tax cuts in 1998?' you say, 'Probably not now. We don't think we will.' No-one will ever again believe anything you say. If you said that it was raining outside, people would automatically assume that the sun was shining. If you said that it was night, we would automatically assume that it was day. You are the people who have brought deceit to this parliament and deceit to the system of government in the country. When it comes to economic management, you are indeed the true deceivers. There is a constant boast about how well everything is going-that there aren't any problems, that you have the most perfect coincidence of economic circumstances in 20 years, or whatever the boast happens to be. The fact is that you have just about blown up this economy. You have just about blown it up in the same way you did in the 1980s. Boom-bust: that is what you get from Labor. When we said in 1993 that you were on a spending spree that would have made John Maynard Keynes spin in his grave, you went out and argued that the budgetary settings were perfect. In May 1994 you said that the fiscal settings were fine. You said that they were absolutely perfect. What are you saying now? You are saying now that they are wrong. You are saying, 'Sorry, we got it all wrong. We didn't mean any of that. We promised we wouldn't increase taxes, but now we have to increase taxes.' You said that the size of the deficit was fine. You have realised now that you are burning the economy down. You have overheated the economy. The Prime Minister admitted that yesterday. No amount of interjections will take you away from the fact that even the leader of your government admits that you have badly mismanaged the economy and that you are now once more going to have to deceive the Australian people by moving back towards higher taxes. You cannot, of course, cut spending. That is what you always say. You say, 'It is impossible to cut spending.' Yet in the three years to 1994-95 you happen to have increased Commonwealth spending by 21 per cent. But you still cannot cut spending! Next year you are increasing spending by another $7 billion, but you say, 'It has to be done. We just have to remain on our spending spree. We can't afford to offend any of our special interest groups, the delicate coalition of interests that we have knitted together in the Labor Party. We cannot afford to do any of that. It does not matter about the public. We will just come up with a new line of deceit.' That says a great deal about the quality of this government. A Prime Minister who called people who called for a smaller deficit 'deficit daleks' two weeks ago is this week a deficit dalek himself. Doctor Who perhaps? Doctor Who-would-ever-believe-him? Who would ever believe the man who is sitting at the controls of the Tardis without a compass and without a map? This is a man who makes progress by deceit and has brought on this country great hardship. The Australian public will not forgive a man who in such a callous way has deceived them for so long. Power without values. That is going to be the epitaph of this government. They will be known as the true deceivers because deceit has been the central component of this government's activity. (Time expired)",102
287,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) is neither a prophet nor a prit?st, nor is he a moralist. He has not in his public record any capacity to stand up in this chamber and sling epithets like that at the government-that it is a government without values. Mr Costello-You have, I suppose.",103
288,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"I am not slinging the epithets. Governing any country is a hard, tough business for people who have a bit of experience and can stay in the kitchen with the heat, but the opposition leader ain't one of those people. He is disappearing out the door now on the off-chance that a bit of heat might start in the course of the 15 minutes. He has his tail between the legs and is out the door. He might understand something about heat around Christmas time from his colleagues. Personally, I hope he doesn't. Personally, I hope he sticks around and learns during the next few years in his leadership of the opposition. I cannot see the opposition ending up going to anybody else because, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said the other day, the problem is not with the jockey in the Liberal Party; it is with the horse. The Leader of the Opposition stood up and said at his first press conference, 'I was born in the Liberal Party.' I am proud to say that I was born in Australia. By saying that he was born in the Liberal Party, as he did on that occasion, he defined himself as a person born in a party now without ideas and without an attitude as to how you govern a countrya bunch of meretricious players in these debates. Every single item that the opposition leader presented as a reason the Prime Minister, the government, and an individual minister ought to be censured is a position that the opposition at some point of time adopted and which it now wishes to walk back from. As somebody who has actually held the employment, education and training portfolio, I think one of the most extraordinary statements made by the opposition leader was an accusation that this government was not prepared to introduce cuts, was not prepared to take some degree of hard decision. Every single proposition for a saving that we put forward, and that I put forward when I was a minister in the Department of Employment, Education and Training-they have gone through the chamber at a very slow pace over the last couple of years-has been rejected by the opposition in the Senate where there is the capacity to stop the government spending and the capacity to stop the government cutting. Every single cut we have put forward was rejected. This deficit we now confront is $650 million higher as a result of those efforts, among others, than it might have been had the opposition not pursued those positions. Those in the opposition always have a reason for why they ought not to vote for the propositions: it might be a bit inequitable here; it might cause a bit of hardship there; what about the rural sector somewhere elsewhatever. What they do not seem to comprehend-I thought the Prime Minister spelt it out for them in question time in words of one syllable-is that you do not actually cut spending without cutting something that is going to somebody. It is. not possible to do it any other way. Those opposite talk about values, but they stand up in this place and criticise the governtion. ment on that front. Then, when they are asked a reasonable question by the press as to what they would do, they talk in generalities, not specifics, and claim that they will never have to arrive at specifics. They come to a million different conclusions. Yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) accused the Prime Minister of course, getting to values, of being a liar when the Prime Minister had the temerity, in his view, to come into this place and say that he had called for an $11.7 billion cut in the deficit. That was a spectacular claim-there is no question about that-but it goes to how the opposition behaves itself in public. It talks about values, but it has a view for everybody in the public that asks them a question. Those in the opposition operate out there in the public as though nobody runs media monitoring services, as tbough nothing actually gets back to government ministers about what they are saying. They run a million contradictory policies out there, misleading the public, and then get in here and give us a lecture on values. Here is what the Prime Minister was alleged to have lied about. I will go through every single word of the question and answer. The transcript states: PRU GOWARD: I'll just put it once more. There is an alert sign there: 'I'll just put it once more. The question on the deficit is coming again. This is an opportunity for you to say what you think.' She asks: What does the Opposition think should be the cut in the budget deficit? PETER COSTELLO: Well, Pm, it's got to be greater than $11.7 billion this year, and it's got to be greater than the deficit next year. There were no lies from the Prime Minister. I would have thought anybody could comprehend what was stated by the opposition spokesperson. But what the opposition spokesperson wants to do is slip-slide out there for the Pru Goward show and have a bit of a word out there. He thinks, 'There might be a few deficit daleks out there who want to hear from me.' When he rocks into this parliament and says something different, he thinks he is upholding values of high integrity. That is the Deputy Leader of the Opposi We all know about the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to values. The very reason his leadership is in trouble after such a blinding start is precisely this: over those early months of leadership, there was a persistent pattern of discussion whereby he repeatedly contradicted himself in public and appeared to play to one audience as opposed to another. That is why he is in trouble. He is not in trouble because there is an insatiable desire out there to vote Labor. He is not in trouble because people do not like young people around the place as potential leaders. He is in trouble for one reason and one reason only: he destroyed his credibility in the first few months he was in office by the positions he put on values, oddly enough. Politics is a tough game. Sometimes you have to change your opinions on things. There is no doubt about that. Sometimes you get better information, and you do your level best to explain yourself to the public. When you have a personal record like that of the opposiunlucky tion leader, you cannot rock into this place and make claims about your opponents that are really more applicable to yourself without suffering some embarrassment. The opposition leader went on to talk about the runway. I feel a degree of sorrow for him here because he is speaking in ignorance, as opposed to being deliberately misleading. When the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and other people came out and spoke in favour of a third runway at Sydney airport in 1989 or 1990, they were not talking about Wal Fife's runway. They had the benefit of seeing environmental impact studies and the government's plans. They knew exactly what the government proposed for that third runway. It is no good claiming, as the Leader of the Opposition does, that somehow or other their claim in 1989 or 1990-remember that we are talking about integrity-was a suggestion to the government of the day to do their version of the runway, not its version of the runway. That is not what they said. They said, 'Do your version of the runway, and do it real quick.' That was their position. He cannot come in here and claim, as he seems to do in his remarks, to uphold the highest values of integrity when what they were always arguing for was the proposition that they originally put. Let me correct one other matter. The opposition leader made some assumptions, and again I think he was speaking in ignorance rather than being deliberately misleading. On the first point, he was being deliberately misleading. On this point, he is in ignorance. He said that the proposition they put forward would have runway take-offs and landings only to the south. That is a truly miraculous conclusion. The only reason planes take off to the north at all-remember that one of those runways has been there for yonks and is still operating-is because of Sydney's wind systems. It happens to be, and still is the case, that the majority of take-offs occur to the south. Those that take off to the north run to only 20 or 30 per cent, but that is high. Here the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has been with the gods, as opposed to planning, in that over the last few weeks he has confronted the time of the year when the wind system operates to produce the maximum take-offs to the north. But that is high. So the opposition leader came in full of integrity but was purely ignorant. Opposition members came up with some absurd notion yesterday and came up with it again today. Do they think that Wal Fife, decent and great human being though he might have been, had such a connection with the maker that he could pray up a nonnortherly wind direction for 100 per cent of the time? Do they really think Wal was capable of that? The maker, though I am sure he is both beloved of Wal and loves him dearly, will not deliver that outcome for him or anybody else in Sydney. If Wal was arguing that, he was deeply misled as to where he was going. Now we come to the position on the eastwest runway. Opposition members can make an argument that they are a bit worried about safety issues. They can make an argument that they can run prop jets on half the runway. But what they then have to explain to the people of Sydney is that all that does is increase capacity on the main runways for heavy jets. That is the net effect. The Leader of the National Party, in the time convenient to present honest pictures about what was going on at Sydney airport, was able to say that the reason for doing that was to increase that capacity. He feels that it will help commuters in the country get into Sydney. What opposition members cannot do, and what they are trying to do, is go out and tell the. public that this would offer relief to people in the north. If anything, it will make life worse. There is no question about that. Make your point, but do not claim that it is achieving something else that it is not going to do. You have had a minister getting to grips with the environmental issues that have to be confronted by somebody who will keep those runways operating effectively. He cannot avoid it, nor escape it. By and large, the impact of that has been to dramatically reduce the number of people badly affected by aircraft noise in the Sydney area, and that ought to be welcomed by both government and opposition. By and large, the new routes and the measures that have been outlined by Minister Brereton will decrease significantly the impact of aircraft movement over the north of city, but it will not stop it. It never would have. No proposition could be put forward that would stop that. If you are going to put in the parallel runway, that is the inevitable conclusion. The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is delighted that the Prime Minister accurately quoted him today. The Prime Minister pointed out that, as far as the member was concerned, flights were welcome over his part of the city, that they would create no problems and therefore the government ought not stint on proceeding with the runway. What the opposition loves to do on the deficit, the runway and any other political leadership issue that comes up is to hide behind whatever the government is doing. No matter what their position is, no matter what their record is, members of the opposition want to criticise the government of the day. I remember their comments on the budget a year or so ago. They said that the government had grievously overestimated the amount of investment in the business community. They thought the government's views on the numbers by which unemployment would come down were hopelessly out of whack and that it would come down at a much slower rate. That is their record as predictors of where we were headed as far as this economy was concerned. They are neither priests nor, in this instance, prophets. They have been totally inaccurate on every prediction that they have put forward for the Australian economy. They have only one characteristic that we can commonly attribute to them: no matter what guise they might appear in, no matter what statements that they might pervade, they are gloom sayers and doomsayers. They do their level best to depress any opportunity. In that, they are an immature opposition. As the Prime Minister pointed out, there is a plethora of newspaper comment now on the opposition leader. If nothing else would convince you that the time has come, that performance by the Leader of the Opposition would do it now. 'Time is up for Mr Downer,' said the Sydney Morning Herald this morning. 'Downer is a dead duck,' said Laurie Oakes the other week. You will find a plethora of analysis of that around the place. As I said, I do not think there is any point in rolling him. The problem is not him; the problem is the lot of them. The problem is not curable, short of 10 years more of internal scouring to try to get together an attitude to this nation that makes them fit for government.",103
289,Mr TIM FISCHER,PAPERS,"This matter of public importance is all about an arrogant Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and an incompetent government. It was manifested by the arrogance of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who was at the dispatch box a moment ago. He chose to ignore the question of prime ministerial integrity. We chose to remember the Prime Minister's advocacy of a consumption tax in 1985 at great length at the tax summit. We chose to remind you of that, the fuel tax increases and other taxation lies which the Prime Minister has advanced. The Leader of the House then chose to tum to the question of the Mascot runway. An option which has not been fully canvassed in the debate this week relates to limited operation on the east-west runway, east of the intersection, east of the crossover taxiway, which would provide a degree of relief. It is a falsehood for the minister who is just departing to argue that that is not the case. There is no doubt at all that shifting some of the aircraft take-offs to the eastern portion of the east-west runway will make more efficient the operation of the parallel north-south runways and, with that, ease the burden on the people of Sydney. I commend the Leader of the Opposition for clearly and surgically exposing this government's manifest incompetence and absolute hypocrisy. The case is absolutely clear at the end of this 1994 session of parliament: this government simply has to go. We have a Prime Minister who is an arrogant embarrassment to this nation, and a government of incompetent ministers who are simply not up to the mark. The chief culprit is, of course, the minister for disasters, the minister for screaming jets, the minister for scuttling the sale of national assets like ANL, the minister for Christmas strikes, the minister who must be sacked: Laurie Brereton-the minister for chaos. I would like to concentrate on the hypocrisy, arrogance and incredible double standards of this government, the Hades, if you like. I want to start matching the rhetoric with the outcomes, matching the words with the results. Firstly, there is the APEC agreement. It is well known that the federal coalition has consistently supported the APEC organisation and, indeed, much of it has flowed out of Bogor, but we have a more realistic approach to that which has flowed out of Bogor. It seems that the Prime Minister has caught the Bogor fever. I refer the House to Greg Sheridan, as I did the other day, and to other commentators in that regard. The Prime Minister, after all the rhetoric, cannot even give us a clear statement as to whether the market liberalisation provisions of the Bogor declaration are ultimately discriminatory or non-discriminatory. He cannot yet even spell out where the ultimate objective with tariff reduction is to end. Is it to be per cent? Is he going to join the 'Captain Zero Club', or is it to be zero to 5 per cent? Negligible is the more appropriate description and definition. Simply put, the rhetoric just does not match the outcome. The whole thrust of the Prime Minister's APEC rhetoric is about Australian exporters going gang busters in the APEC region. Do honourable members know what the outcome is? Despite all the wind from the Prime Minister, Australia is actually losing its market share in the APEC region. In 1985 Australian imports in the APEC region represented 4.09 per cent of the market. In 1992 that figure fell to 3.22 per cent and, in 1993, to 3.06 per cent. We face a falling market share in the APEC region. We face falling market share in many other regions of the world. That shows the real circumstance with regard to our trading performance. There is all this glorious rhetoric from the Prime Minister when in fact Australia is losing its market share. When we look at the Air New Zealand fiasco, we realise that the outcome is in total contradiction to the rhetoric. Here we have a Prime Minister sprouting on about free trade-after being a protectionist by degrees at the last election and during the last sittings of parliament-whilst refusing, as he has now, Air New Zealand access to the Australian domestic aviation market for the most grubby and base of protectionist motives. And he did not even have the courage to take the matter to cabinet or caucus. Back in August 1992 the Australian and New Zealand transport ministers signed a memorandum of understanding which this government simply ignored this year; it completely reversed its position for no truly explicable reason. The result is that, despite all the rhetoric about APEC and a single aviation market between Australia and New Zealand, we have a government which has made a decision which is going to daIT),age Australia's national interests, especially 'the interests of the tourism industry in south-east Queensland. It is ignoring the fact that Ansett and Qantas have been operating domestic services in New Zealand for a period of time. zero This really is a case where Australia should go back, do its homework and get it right. What is more chilling this particular day examine the ramification, the knock-on effect, of this Keating-Brereton decision against Air New Zealand and against Australia's national interest. I thank the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) for bringing to my attention the plight of one particular company-Lyco. It is the sort of company that everyone on both sides of this parliament should be encouraging to get on with the job of exporting. I will honourable members what has happened to Lyco. Lyco's executive, Garry Lyons, says that Lyco exports hydraulic equipment to New Zealand, in accordance with the best of all we want to flow out of the CER agreeand ment-some $1Y2 million a year. Lyco has some four people pushing exports from Ballarat to New Zealand and trying to create a market in New Zealand against some pretty stiff competition from elsewhere in the Pacific Rim. Garry Lyons has said this day to my staff that Lyco's people in New Zealand are being shunned. Anti-Australian comment after comment is being made. People are not able to complete business deals in the circumaged stances. The ultimate comment-I quote exactly what they are being told-is this: 'Hope we can trust you better than your government.' That is what the Kiwis are and saying to the representatives of Lyco in New Zealand. They are saying, 'Hope we can trust you-Lyco, Ballarat-generating exports to New Zealand, better than we can trust the Australian government.' If honourable memThat bers want to verify it with Garry Lyons, can ring him on (053) 492 505. They will have absolute verification of that. This points to the sadness that Garry Lyons faces as he goes about generating exports from Australia to New Zealand and has the ground away from him by the actions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Let us look at what is happening in Thaiprivilege land, an Australian market which I visited last week on the way back from the Middle East. I made a working visit to Israel; to the Gaza; to the Sinai, to see Australian troops; to Jordan; to Lebanon; and then I came back is to through Thailand. What did I find in Thailand? I found absolute agony over the remarks made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the follow-up remarks made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the follow-up remarks made by the Prime Minister with regard to the alleged conduct of the Thai army as it seeks to close off infiltration along the border between Thailand and Cambodia. We have yet another situation where the government's complacentell cy and arrogance has made it so much harder for our exporters. The issue of poverty is a real one. The gap between the rich and the poor is getting wider wider. The Prime Minister talks about reaching back and picking up those who are not well off in the community. The words sound good; the outcome is different. The outcome is that 1.8 million Australians are living in poverty. The outcome is that, in the International Year of the Family, which is about to end and which has been hijacked by just about every minority group you can think of, almost 19 per cent of Australia's children under 15-about 704,000 children-live in a family with no breadwinner. That is a chilling circumstance. It is one which I think puts this Christmas into true sad perspective and it is one which, after 11 or 12 years, this government has much to answer for. Throughout the whole of that decade-plus of the federal Labor government, the gap between rich and poor has got greater. is why this government is a fraudulent they government. This government cannot be trusted. This government is incompetent. The great tragedy is that average Australians-not Labor's elite-are the ones copping it in the neck, and for that this government stands taken deservedly condemned.",106
290,Mr TANNER,PAPERS,"Melbourne) (5.09 p.m.)This is a matter of public importance conceived in desperation, gestated in frustration and those' of us who have had the dubious of witnessing its birth have been able to see that it is swaddled in hypocrisy . and mendacity. Again we have seen the failure of the opposition to introduce substantive issues in debate in this place. Again we have seen no alternative vision on any of the issues that have even been touched upon. And again we have seen no searching critique or analysis about the issues that are before this nation. It is getting such that I might have to have a chat with a few of my mates in the Left and put up some propositions about taking over the MPIs because the opposition makes no valuable use of MPIs in this place at all. All we have seen again is facile epithets, slogans and rhetoric-no substance. We have heard references to the ANL situation. What we have not heard is alternative policy. What we have not heard is what the opposition's position is on the future for Australia in the shipping industry. And why? Because it is divided, because some people in the opposition think that ANL should be let go to the wall; others think that it should be propped up. We have heard about the CAA, but once again we have not heard anything about the opposition's policy on air safety. Its basic proposition on this, as on many other things, is simply blanket deregulation, which obviously would lead to far greater air safety problems than anything we have experienced recently. We have also heard about problems with the third runway in Sydney from those who have been in this place for many years-the prime champions of a new runway at Sydney airport. What we are listening to-and I perhaps used the wrong simile in commencing my comments-is the. last gasp of a dying leadership. Let us consider some of the specifics in the charges. The real problem with ANL is not so much anything particular the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has done; it is a fact that ANL has been allowed to die a slow, lingering near death over more than 30 years of conservative government stewardship with gross undercapitalisation and a failure to reassess necessary changes in direction. So, in 1983, this government inherited an organisation that had chronic problems. In spite of major capital injections, those problems continue. What has really hit home in the last couple of years have been changes in the world market for shipping. The break-up of the Soviet Union and changing economic policy in China have meant that the shipping services are being dumped like never before in an international market and we are suffering a glut. Those are the sorts of factors we need to debate in this House. Those are the sorts of issues of substance that need to be considered in a debate of this nature. There are clear signs of problems with the Civil Aviation Authority. The minister has done the right thing in instituting inquiries. The opposition wants to convict those involved, shoot them and then ask questions later. The government has bitten the bullet on the issue of the third runway-an issue that successive governments have failed to deal with. The government has bitten the bullet on the issue of air services to Sydney, unlike the Liberal Party when it was in government. Now that there are some consequential problems the government is seeking to address those problems. We have not heard one item of detail from the opposition about how it would have addressed the difficulties-just a lot of abuse, a lot of epithets, a lot of phoney crocodile tears about its great concern for inner suburban working class residents and the problems they are suffering. It reminds me of what Jeff Kennett is doing. There is no such concern from the Liberal Party in Victoria for people in my electorate who are going to be victims of freeway extensions, who are going to have their health and the health of their children threatened by far greater emissions of particulates and other pollutants from vehicle emissions in their areas. So the opposition has one rule for when it is in here, one rule for when it is in opposition and one rule for when it is in government. We hear about interest rates and taxes. Yes, there are macro-economic issues that the government has to face. Yes, there are some problems, problems that are partly as a result of the success that the government has had in getting growth going again. But it is a matter for legitimate debate in this place as to how these issues should be addressed, how the economic recovery should be calmed and should be sustained. Interest rates, though, are still relatively low compared with where they have been. Housing affordability is still at record levels and the deficit reduction strategy is ahead of schedule. If we believe the opposition on these issues, we would now be in the middle of a double-dip recession. Remember the double-dip recession? Unemployment would be higher. Long-term unemployment would not be dropping anywhere near as dramatically as it is. Business investment would not be up 22 per cent. Our deficit strategy would be in tatters. There would be lower taxes, higher spending and a lower deficit, magically. If the opposition has any credibility on these issues all we have to do is look back at what it has said and compare it with the record to get a sense of what has been going on. I thought it was interesting today in the contribution of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in particular but also in that of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) that they felt obliged to raise things that occurred in 1968: the Blaxland preselection and things that occurred in 1985-namely, the tax summit. They were so light on for evidence and for examples about supposed failure of ministerial responsibility they had to go back that far to matters that had occurred when the people concerned, in one case, were not even ministers, not even members of this place. So we see, in effect, a theme of hypocrisy, a thread of hypocrisy, running all the way through the opposition's position. It is perhaps a little understandable from an opposition that is led by somebody who, in the previous leadership ballot prior to the one in which he was successful, managed to convince both camps that he had supported both of them. There is so little content in the matter of public importance put forward by the opposition today that we have to look at its credentials. Opposition members are coming in here lecturing us on leadership standards, on how ministers should behave. We perhaps should ask ourselves: are they leading by example? Can we perhaps look to the Leader of the Opposition for some shining inspiration about how leaders of governments should behave, about how leadership should be conducted? Let us have a look at leadership of the opposition to see what example is being set for those of us who are in government and perhaps how the opposition would be in government. We would have one former leader drifting around the place asking people or having his stooges ask people, 'How are you seeing things?' and saying, 'Oh, no. I am not going to challenge. I believe in the Churchill definition of loyalty to the leader'-in other words, be loyal to them until there is a chance of knocking them off. 'I will give loyalty to my leader in the same way that he gave loyalty to other leaders. I am not challenging for the leadership today. Not at this meeting.' We had another former leader wandering around at private functions announcing that he was going to form a new party with 15 members. I think he got his estimate of the number of potential members a bit wrong-by about 14-but, still, it was pretty extraordinary stuff. Then we have the Senate leader seeking, quite legitimately, to come down to this place to follow in the footsteps of many other honourable members, such as the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) there, who cannot win preselection because his own leader's supporters, part of a factional brawl within the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party, cannot get it for him. And opposition members have the hide to sit over there and lecture us about the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and preselection battles within the Queensland branch of our party! Yet we are sitting here at the moment when half of their members in the Western Australian branch are under threat of preselection defeat, including some in marginal seats. That is great leadership for you; that is real inspirational stuff! That is the sort of stuff that we over here should be taking some notice of-about how to run government, about ministerial standards and the like. Then you have the great search across the length and breadth of the nation for the inspirational leader to come in here and save the day. So, even though opposition members have a leader and even though they are all desperately committed to him, people such as the federal President of the Liberal Party are out there talking to Robin Gray-Robin Gray, for God's sake-somebody who has been found by one of his own royal commissions to have acted dishonestly and deceitfully. He is seen as a possible Liberal saviour to come in here. Jeff Kennett, Nick Greiner, and so the list goes on. My near namesake Lindsay Thompson must be sitting back at home in Melbourne waiting for the call if this sort of stuff is any guide. Robin Gray-I ask you! Is it any wonder that we have been in office in this place for nearly 12 years? Mr O'Keefe-Have you done John Elliott yet? He was also on the list",108
291,Mr TANNER,PAPERS,"John Elliott is a bit passe now. He has got one or two problems that even they recognise. Is it any wonder that we have been in office for 12 years? Is it any wonder that in spite of that we are still ahead in the polls? Is it any wonder that the Leader of the Opposition is down to 14 per cent approval in some polls? It shows that even big slabs of loyal Liberal voters think he is hopeless. Is it any wonder that when he comes in here to make his contribution to this MPI debate today we have sitting up here about a dozen members of the National Party laughing amongst themselves, talking and clearly taking no notice whatsoever 6f what he is saying? I say this to the opposition: if you want to come in here and lecture us about ministerial standards, do so when you have some substance in your contribution. Do so when you have got some policies and do so when you have demonstrated that you have some leadership capacity yourselves, when you can lead by example and show us how Australia should be governed. At the moment the biggest problem this government has is the possible threat of complacency because we are so little under pressure from you and so little under pressure from any alternative set of scenarios or policies that we might get too complacent and then problems might start emerging.

294,Mr SAWFORD,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I present the reports of the Committee of Privileges in connection with the matters referred to the committee by the House on 9 June and 27 June 1994, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",116
295,Mr SAWFORD,PRIVILEGE,"by leave--':'The report I have just presented follows the consideration by the committee of a complaint raised by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). On 8 June 1994, the honourable member complained about writs which had been served on a Mr Ayden Cross and a Mr R. Ellems. Mr R. Ellems was the signatory of a statutory declaration which had been provided to the honourable member for Kennedy and from which the honourable member had read in the course of a speech in the House. The honourable member for Kennedy stated that the issuing of the writs in question constituted a prima facie case of contempt and that the action would interfere improperly with ·his ability to do his job. The Speaker allowed precedence to a motion which was agreed in the following terms: SENATE The question of whether the serving of defamation writs on Mr Roland John Ellems and Mr Ayden  interference in the honourable member for Kennedy's performance of his duties as a member of the House. In the course of its inquiry, the committee received written communications from Mr Laurance and the honourable member for Kennedy. In addition, the honourable member for Kennedy appeared before the committee on 1 September. Having considered all the information available to it, the committee has concluded that no evidence has been produced to it which would establish that Mr Report Laurance's actions in initiating action against Messrs Cross and Ellems amounted to or were intended or likely to amount to improper interference in the free performance by the honourable member for Kennedy of his duties as a member. The actions of the honourable member for Kennedy in this matter have also been considered. As the committee notes in its report, allegations of wrongdoing are often made to members of parliament. As members, we enjoy very special rights, which are greater than those enjoyed by ordinary citizens. The privilege of freedom of speech is the greatest of these, but its very significance is such, where the reputation or welfare of persons may be an issue, that it should be used judiciously. If a member is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to disclose such allegations, the committee believes that the member should make all reasonable inquiries as to the truth of the allegations. The raising of a matter in full detail in the House is only one of the options available. Some members have questioned the judgment exhibited by the honourable member for Kennedy in his use of the privilege of freedom of speech to divulge as he did and to rely so heavily on the allegations contained"" in Mr Ellems's statutory declaration. The committee notes, however, that in the final analysis it is for each member to resolve whether or not it is in the public interest to raise such a matter in the House and his or her actions will be judged accordingly. In light of its conclusions, the committee has found that a contempt was not committed in respect of the initiation of the action complained of against Mr A. Cross and Mr R. Ellems. The second report that I have just presented follows the consideration by the committee of a resolution of the House on 26 June 1994. The reference followed the introduction in the Senate of a private senator's bill by Senator Kernot which, in tum, followed the dispute that had arisen between the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in relation to the print media and the government over the production of documents concerning Foreign Investment Review Board decisions. The committee invited submissions {rom members of the pUblic, members of the House and persons who had made submissions to the Senate Committee of Privileges. The committee concluded that the evidence available did not establish that it would be desirable for legislation to be enacted to transfer to the Federal Court responsibility to adjudicate in respect of claims for public interest immunity made in response to orders of a House or a parliamentary committee for the production of information or documents.

296,Mr HORNE,COMMITTEES,I present the 18th report of the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report,117
297,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's report titled The use of the coat of arms: armed with national pride, a report of the inquiry into the use of the Commonwealth coat of arms, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed. "" Mr MELHAM-by leave-I am pleased to table the report of the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the use of the Commonwealth coat of arms. This report is a review of the use of the coat of arms which was granted to the Commonwealth in 1912 by royal warrant. There are two main aspects of the inquiry. First, the committee examined whether authorised use of the coat of arms should include both official Commonwealth use and non-Commonwealth use. Second, the committee assessed whether specific legislation is needed to protect the coat of arms. On the first point, we have concluded that, in principle, the coat of arms should be available to be used not only for official Commonwealth use but also for limited nonCommonwealth use. Authorised non-. Commonwealth use may include display of the arms on the dress uniforms of national representative sportspersons. Such use has been authorised in the past, and the committee considers that this type of use should be able to continue. The committee also considers that the arms should be available to be used for other non-official purposes. In particular, the comn:tittee considers that it would be appropriate to authorise the use of the arms for the commemoration of special events taking place within Australia. The 1988 Australian bicentenary is an example of a suitable occasion in the past where commemorative souvenirs bearing the coat of arms were authorised to be produced. The centenary of Federation is one future occasion where the authorisation of such commemorative souvenirs would also be appropriate. The committee does not, however, recommend that the coat of arms should be widely and indiscriminately used. In all cases,where determining whether non-Commonwealth use should be authorised, the status of the coat of arms as the pre-eminent Australian national symbol should be preserved. For this reason, the committee recommended that the Minister for Administrative Services have a discretion to approve requests to use the coat of arms. The committee also made recommendations requiring the minister, in exercising that discretion, to take account of the need to protect the dignity and status of the arms. The committee recognises that one reason for the popularity of the coat of arms with potential users is that the arms are an attractive national symbol that is distinctively Australian. For those intending users whose applications to use the arms are not successful, the committee has suggested that an alternative symbol be created in the form of a badge. A badge used in this context is a technical term for a symbol often based on a coat of arms. This will provide an opportunity for the development of another distinctively Australian national symbol, one which will be able to be more widely used than the coat of arms. With regard to the second aspect of this inquiry, the committee considers that the coat of arms is a revered national symbol in which Australians take pride. To protect the arms, the committee recommends that specific legislation be enacted. The legislation proposed in this report is to be comprehensive in its protection of the coat of arms. It is to include provisions that prohibit the importation of items bearing the coat of arms, unless such imports are authorised by the minister. The proposed legislation is also to provide for penalties which are able to be imposed on any person found guilty of unauthorised use of the arms. The implementation of our recommendations will provide guidance in the development of a management system for the coat of arms, which should ensure both certainty and flexibility in the administration of the management of the coat of arms. Finally, I acknowledge the work of the committee secretariat. The committee secretary, Judy Middlebrook, the subcommittee secretary, Claressa Surtees, and the other staff, Kelly Williams and Gemma Searles, all made significant contributions to the inquiry and. the report. On behalf of the committee and the parliament, I thank them.",117
298,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I was pleased that we received this reference in regard to the Australian coat of arms. The report, entitled The use of the coat of arms-armed with national pride, is a comprehensive report on the simple use of the Australian symbol which is a fine combination of heraldic expression and patriotism. The committee has decided that the main use of the coat of arms should continue to be the identification of Commonwealth property and the mark of Commonwealth authoritythat is, on official documents, communications and the like. It is not for use on uniforms, it would not be an identification that would be used for souvenirs, but it would be a stamp of official recognition of Commonwealth authority. This posed a problem for us because many people came to the committee saying, 'We like the Australian coat of arms. It is a very fine expression symbolising all the elements of Australia, with the kangaroo and emu, and then the six badges of the various states incorporated on the shield at the centre and covered at the top by the seven pointed star.' The committee decided-for uniforms, identification, souvenirs; for all of the various purposes that people mentioned to us as being the reason they wanted to use the Australian coat of arms-that a badge should be develployed oped, that there should be a national competiparts tion and an Australian badge of a suitable type designed and that the Commonwealth Australia should then allow the fairly free use of Commonwealth badge to be used in many of the ways that people would want to use the coat of arms. I endorse the recommendations. The comin mittee proposes that the Minister for Administhe trative Services have ultimate discretion approve requests for the use of the coat· arms so there is government and ministerial control of the processes and so that the importation of goods is controlled. The minister then can prevent the entry into activities, Australia, through the customs process, of material bearing the coat of arms if it has not been approved. The discrete use of this emblem will continue to provide pride and prestigious expression of the feelings that Australians have for their nation. To have the coat of arms in the Senate and above the Speaker's chair in this chamber is a suitable way to have the arms displayed representing the nation, the Commonwealth Australia. I am delighted to have been part of this report. I am very pleased with the result of the inquiry. I want also to thank the chairman of the committee, the members, and who participated. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee  Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report, incorporating a minority report, tled Australia s participation in peacekeeping, together with the minutes of proceedings evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.  inquire into Australia's participation in peacekeeping was given to the committee in· July 1993, following a dramatic increase in Australia's. contribution to peacekeeping missions. In March of that year 2,012 Australian Defence Force personnel had been dein a range of missions in troubled of the world. It was clear to the committee that further requests would be made to by the United Nations for assistance. the This 'was subsequently borne out by the request for a contingent to be sent to Rwanda. The terms of reference for this inquiry focus on the Australian Defence Force. Very early the inquiry, however, it became evident to committee that peacekeeping could no to longer be planned, developed and carried out of as an almost exclusively military activity. Peacekeeping increasingly involves civilian organisations. Post-Cold War peacekeeping encompasses non-traditional peace support such as facilitating elections, assisting in law and order and providing humanitarian relief. These are often essential prerequisites to achieving longer term political and a focus of economic stability. Governments need to give as much consideration to rehabilitation and reconstruction as they do to deployment. While the military will undoubtedly continue to play a signifiof cant role in peacekeeping, it is likely that longer term success will depend to a very large extent on civilian organisations, such as the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Electoral Commission and a wide range of those non-government· organisations. The overwhelming conclusion of this inquiry is that the nature of peacekeeping in the post-Cold War world has changed so Report· dramatically that a quite fundamentally different approach must be taken to peaceFirstly, the committee believes that, if peacekeeping is to succeed in bringing about global peace and stability, an integrated entiplan must be devised cooperatively by the various components of each mission. This and means that civilian organisations must be brought into the planning of peacekeeping operations at an early stage. Secondly, and most importantly, long-term strategic goals are integral to peacekeeping missions. No longer does it necessarily suffice to bring adversaries to the negotiating table. Experience in Somalia and Cambodia has demonstrated in different ways that the establishment of conditions to ensure ongoing peace and stability after the peacekeepers have withdrawn may be critical to the success of such missions. Amongst other things, this report reflects the committee's concern with the problems that are continuing to be met by the United Nations headquarters in New York in planning for and conducting peacekeeping operations. While reform of the UN is the responsibility of its 184 members, the committee believes that it is incumbent upon countries, such as Australia, that have considerable expertise and experience in peacekeeping to take a leading role in the reform process. Therefore, the report makes a number of recommendations to this end. A major concern arising from this inquiry was the extent to which the deployment of signallers to Cambodia, and the battalion group to Somalia, had an impact on the capacity of the Australian Defence Force to carry out its normal activities for the defence of Australia. The committee found that the deployment of signallers to Cambodia affected the ability of the divisional signal regiment to provide communications within Australia. This had ramifications for training. Moreover, the commitment of the force to Somalia for four months stretched the resources of the ADF beyond acceptable limits. The committee believes that Australia's participation in peacekeeping has revealed serious weaknesses in Australia's combat capability. The committee did not accept the view that only four regular battalions, supplemented by the ready reserve, were the right balance for the Australian Army and, therefore, canvassed this issue throughout the inquiry. Indeed, the committee was gratified to find that a number of proposals that it had canvassed during the inquiry were reflected in the defence white paper. The committee wholeheartedly endorses the decision to create a 5th Regular Infantry Battalion. The committee recommends, however, that this be established within two years. The committee had been somewhat critical of the publication by the Department of Defence of its view that an average base of 200 peacekeepers was an appropriate level of contribution. The committee was pleased to note that, according to the white paper, Defence now prefers not to set numerical targets for the level of forces committed to the United Nations. The committee also notes that Defence is examining ways to ensure the UN maximises the benefit from Australian participation in peacekeeping. To this end, the committee recommends that a peacekeeping institute be established to provide training for Australian and regional personnel involved in peacekeeping, including civilian participants. Among other things, such an institute would develop cooperation with regional defence forces and civilian institutions involved in peacekeeping and would serve as a focus of information and expertise in Australia. The committee believes that an Australian peacekeeping institute would strengthen Australia's contribution to international peacekeeping. Let me make it clear that, whatever concerns the committee has had concerning defence capability, they do not extend to our peacekeepers. Indeed, the committee is proud of the way in which Australian serving men and women have performed their duties in the course of deployment on peacekeeping missions. Their professionalism and zeal for their tasks has been impressive and is recognised internationally. We found that our own very high opinion of our peacekeepers is widely shared by the people of Australia. I wish to record the committee members' sincere appreciation for the untiring efforts of our committee secretary, Gillian Gould. Gillian not only performed to her own very high standards but sadly had to contend with a very personal loss during this inquiry. I also wish to acknowledge the contribution of Alan Tebb, from the Department of Defence, as ,well as the support staff from the secretariat. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the deputy chairman of the committee, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I thank all the members of the defence subcommittee for their interest and contribution to the committee and, in particular, to the exercising of reference from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). I commend this report to the House and its 50-odd recommendations.",118
299,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I commend the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member  remarks he has just made. I would also like to extend to the secretary of the committee, Ms Gillian Gould, not only congratulations on the report but also sympathy for the loss she suffered during the preparation of the report. Nonetheless, she really has made a great contribution to the report and all of us recognise that it is a complex field. The fact that we finished with 50 recommendations rather endorses that fact. We need to understand that, in dealing with a report of this character, it is very complementary to the white paper on defence that has just been tabled in the House. Indeed, several of our recommendations, in part, were picked up by the white paper. For example, the chairman of the committee referred to the 5th Regular Infantry Battalion. There is no doubt that had this committee report come out earlier we might have been able to claim the credit. But, from our point of view, we can see the need for a 5th Regular Infantry Battalion with the increasing obligations for peacekeeping and have suggested that it should be initiated within the next two years. We hope that the government can adopt that because there have been enormous pressures put on the force structure during the time we have had commitments to peacekeeping. Sadly, they have not all been met because of the nature and circumstances of other demands on the forces. In my view, it is important that we do have a capacity to maintain that peacekeeping effort. There are a number of matters to which the chairman did not refer, and I will identify a couple of them. One was our concern about the stresses of peacekeeping on those who serve and also on the families of those who serve. Unfortunately, there is also a fallout in the nature and character of any military commitment. It is of concern to us that, this unfortunately, many who serve abroad return stressed. We were told of some problems as a result of the commitment in Somalia, and we are certainly aware of pressures on the families. We commend to the government those recommendations that pick that up. It is no use looking at the overall national good without recognising the impact on the individuals concerned. We have made a number of recommendations in respect of future training, and they in particular are something the government should also pick up. For example, recommendation 50 recommends an Australian peacekeeping institute be established within the Australian Defence Studies Centre. We see the problems of trying to look at the diversity of peacekeeping such that we need to look at how Australia can best be involved. While the numbers may be down at the moment, without doubt there are far too many flash points around the world. While the United Nations, the European Community and NATO seem so inept in the former Yugoslavia situation, there are other situations where I believe peacekeeping has been very effective. We in Australia should do all we can to assist towards success. There are too many instances around the world where, without the commitment of the United Nations, undoubtedly not only would there be further inhumanity to man but also there would be quite significant abuses of power and situations where, particularly, ethnic divisions threaten the continuity of world peace. We have picked that up and believe that, as far as Australia is concerned, we should therefore maintain our peacekeeping effort. I am disappointed that peacekeeping has not been accepted as part of the force structure objectives of government in the white paper. I see advantages in that, particularly at a time when it seems the government is intent on downsizing numerically the number of the services. I commend the report to the government and to the Australian public. Australia has every reason to be very proud of the role it has played. I believe that, if the government picks up these recommendations, our contribution in the future will be even more distinguished.",121

301,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 31 January 1995, at 12.30 p.m., unless otherwise called together by Mr Speaker or, event of Mr Speaker being unavailable, by the Deputy Speaker. This is the traditional motion by which at the end of each year those on both sides of the chamber who have some responsibility give their thanks to all those who have been great contributors to the affairs and the running of the parliament in the course of the year. It is also an opportunity to place on record appreciation of colleagues who may be about to retire or who may assist particularly in the running of the House. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated that he wants to come in and give his own personal thoughts on this, and he will no doubt do so fairly shortly. Whilst he is coming down, it presents me with an opportunity to give my thanks. I must say that these are a little less dramatic than the valedictories of last year. As I recollect, last year John Dawkins resigned. He took up a much better life than that which is led by most of us in this place. He certainly looks very healthy. He has done very well indeed. There is nothing so dramatic for the government to announce in the course of these valedictories. There· are a few people I want to thank. I would firstly like to thank those on our side who assist me most vigorously in the running of the House. I refer in particular to the Chief Government Whip, Leo MCLeay, who has had some new responsibilities thrust upon him. No doubt in his contribution to the valedictory debate he would like to say something about the functioning of the second chamber. He now has two whips assisting him-Ted Grace and Rod Sawford. They have had some elevation during the year to provide that assistance. The second running of the House combined with a three-session parliament has made a miraculous contribution to the conduct of affairs in this place. I do not think members realise how much. We have operated this session without a guillotine. The reason we are able to operate this session without the guillotine is unquestionably the presence of the second chamber. Something like 30 or 40 bills are now considered in that chamber, all of which require a few hours discussion in the because there are people in the House with specific interests in them. It often all adds up .. to about 100 to 150 hours worth of debate that we would have had in this place. That has virtually been removed from the chamber into the second chamber and is conducted at much more leisure there. This has had a very substantial and beneficial impact. But it requires a bit of work, and that work is done by the whips. I thank them for that as well as for the many services they perform in the chamber. I want to thank you, Mr Speaker, and your deputies, Harry Jenkins and Allan Rocher. You have to conduct affairs in this House in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. You do the very best you can. You prevail against the best endeavours of members of the chamber to frustrate your capacity to carry out your duties. I must say that you do that particularly well. I want to thank our caucus members on this side of the House who have made such a contribution in debates during the year and who, in their long suffering, have had difficulties imposed upon them by the House organisation. I want to pay a personal tribute to two other groups of people. The first group includes the Clerk of the House, Lyn Barlin, the Deputy Clerk of the House, Ian Harris, the assistant clerks, the Serjeant-at-Arms and all the staff of the House of Representatives. It is usually this time of the year. that their mettle is truly tested, but it is tested pretty solidly throughout the course of the year. They are great protectors of the interests of the House of Representatives, more than most members of the House realise. They do a particularly fine job. They run one of the great democratic chambers of the world and are justifiably proud of the function they perform. I want to thank a second group; that is, PLO. I thank Anna Clendinning and her assistants-Ann-Louise Crotty, Ruth Adam, Lynn Irby and Andrew Jenson. From the government side, they really keep the House crumbling along very effectively indeed. We on both sides of the House are all aware of the debt that we owe them for the work that they do. I want to thank my personal staff in that regard. In terms of the activities of the House, I thank John O'Callaghan. He has recently rejoined my staff and does a particularly effective job in terms of the running of the parliament. I select only him from my staff, who work long hours and very satisfactorily, because of the function that he performs here in this chamber. I thank too the Hansard staff for the job they do and the members of the Sound and Vision Office. It is a time of the year when we can thank and wish all the best of the season to the attendants who look after us in this chamber, the catering staff who look after us outside this chamber, the maintenance and ground workers, the cleaners and the staff generally of parliament. This is an enormous factory when it all boils down to it. The dimensions of it are physically huge. The number of personnel who keep us servicedfrom the library, from the Joint House Department and from all the divisions of the operation of the parliament-are an extraordinary phalanx indeed. There are not that many of us, and we are a very small tip of a very big iceberg for whom this parliament forms a, substantial part of our lives. I think all of us want to thank our families. I know I thank mine. They are long suffering. This is not a profession which sits easily with , family life and they bear a terrible burden. They will get a little piece of us over the next few weeks-not as much as they would have once had because we sit earlier and earlier these days, but at least this is the time of the year that goes to them. Finally, I want to thank John Howard and his deputies on the opposition side of the House. He is a very experienced parliamentarian, one of the most experienced in the chamber. He graces it as an opposition spokesman and as an organiser of opposition business. He is well assisted both in the National Party and in the Liberal Party. I thank them all for the contribution they make to the running of the chamber. I would like to wish all members all the best for Christmas and the new year.",122
302,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to join the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in extending my thanks to so many people for the proper functioning of the parliament throughout the year. I particularly want to thank Lyn Barlin and his colleagues. Lyn is an immaculately independent and fair Clerk of the House. He is a real professional. He has been of enormous help to me and to my staff. To him and all of his colleagues I extend my thanks. I join the Leader of the House in thanking the parliamentary staff, the attendants, Hansard and the people responsible for the broadcasts. Mr Speaker, I would also like to thank you. I know on occasions we have had the odd exchange. I think both of us share one of a number of passions. I think we both quite like the game of rugby league. You have played perhaps later on in life a more active role in the game than I have but it is a fairly vigorous game. On occasions, I think exchanges here have had some of the elements of a great rugby league clash. I thank you for your great decency. I believe that you mean well. I wish you, your wife and family a very enjoyable Christmas and, in a personal sense, a very happy new year. I would also like to say how much I have enjoyed being Kim Beazley's opposite number. I know this is a terrible thing to say of one's politicalMr Downer-Don't say anything positive.",123
303,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I will be very careful, Alexander. I know one has to be very circumspect. I like Kim Beazley. I assure you that I am not campaigning for Carmen Lawrence nor am I campaigning for the Minister for Communications (Mr Lee) or any of the other prospective numero unos in the Labor Party when I say that. He is a person, as I am, who respects this institution. The real dividing line in this place in a sense is not down the centre, but rather between those people who have a feel for the parliament and those who do not. There are many opposite who have a feel for the parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a feel for the parliament. He has had a go at me once or twice-I understand that-and I have had a go at him once or twice. The Leader of the House has a great feel for the parliament. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has a feel for the parliament. He comes from a family that has a deep commitment to the Westminster system. I think it is a terrific institution. I know has a lot of warts and a lot of failings and I know all of us have, on occasions, had to contend with those people who wag their fingers at us at either branch meetings or local functions and say, 'I wish you would all behave better and stop behaving like school children.' I still think the best response is it is far better that we assault each other with words rather than assault each other with fists. That is really what the parliamentary institution is all about. It has been a very interesting parliamentary year in one way or another. I am looking forward to next year. I am absolutely certain that there is going to be a change of government next year in this country. I am absolutely certain of that. All of us on this side of the House are looking forward to it with enormous interest. I would like to, once again, extend my thanks to Anna Clendinning, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer. She made my life a lot easier when I first assumed this position last year: She was of unfailing courtesy and help to my office. My staff frequently say what an enormously helpful person she is. I extend my thanks to the parliamentary staff. I extend my thanks to all of my colleagues and particularly to Alexander, the Leader of the Opposition, Peter, the deputy leader, Bob Halverson, the member for Casey apd Chief Opposition Whip and-to a person who plays a very significant role in the operations of the coalition-Betty-Ann Daly, the chief clerk to the opposition whip. She knows where a lot of bodies are buried so far as the opposition is concerned. Without her we would not function all that efficiently. To all of you, I hope you have a very happy Christmas. I hope that for those millions of Australians for whom Christmas is a time of particular sanctity it will once again be a source of hope and encouragement to them. I hope the whole nation has a happy and peaceful time. I rarely agree with the Prime Minister, but I have to say that I want the cricket to be on the front pages of the newspapers in January. As far as I am concerned, I have got that first it week of January marked out. I will be spending every day of it at the Sydney Cricket Ground looking forward to Australia beating the daylights out of the poms.",124
304,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Once again, I think it is a time to reflect on the past year and to anticipate the next and to thank those who have helped us keep the parliament functioning over the past year or so. It has been traditional, but nevertheless genuine on the part of all of us, to acknowledge the high professional standards of the Clerk of the House, Lyn Barlin, and the Deputy Clerk of the House, Ian Harris-who are with us now. I thank them and their colleagues for doing a tough job. They do not have a functional department in the sense that they do not have a big program delivery service such as Social Security or Defence, but the job that is done, the precision with which it is done and the importance of getting it right matters a great deal to the way the country functions. They have been in the departmental sense, because of the bureaucratic snobbery, somewhat overlooked, but not by us. We thank them for their contributions and the smooth functioning of this place. I add my thanks, as already offered by others, to the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Anna Clendinning, and her staff-Ann-Louise Crotty, Ruth Adam, Lynn Irby and Andrew Jenson. They program the business of this place with skill and I thank them very much for their work. I think we all appreciate that. I would like to thank the Chief Government Whip, Leo MCLeay, and his ever reliable deputies-Ted Grace and Rod Sawford. I thank them mainly for not losing a division on us during the year. Mr Downer-And asking the dorothy dix questions.",124
305,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"And occasionally asking the dorothy dix questions. From the perspective of this side of the chamber, they do a wonder job managing people and doing the count. Just as important is the Leader of the House. Kim Beazley has done a tremendous job over the course of the year. He is up there answering MPls at a minute's notice or censure motions when they are moved, but, most particularly, managing the business and keeping an eye on the government's business agenda and the affairs of the parliament. We thank him most sincerely for as in the last couple of years he has worn the burden of the finance minister's job which is high on paper and a difficult grind. To do job and to do this job too is something that we on this side of House especially appreciate. The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) complimented him by saying that he liked him. I suppose we mostly like him too-not always.",125
306,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Don't get too charitable.,125
307,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"No, I will not. Professionalism demands that one keeps one's guard up in these things-and I will. Nevertheless, the place does function well. I think the Leader of the House and the member for Bennelong have worked well together on managing the parliament's business and we all appreciate that. We thank them for their civility and courtesy to one other and to us. At the centre of the parliament are the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker: Stephen Martin, Harry Jenkins and Allan Rocher. They, too, do a good job at ensuring we get through our work. It is a great burden, of course, for the Speaker in our system of government to be sitting in the central cockpit of our national politics. Adjudicating the game, day in day out, is hard. You must in the end earn some enmity amongst people, and I am sure speakers take it to heart. The thing to know is not to take it too much to heart. We say that most especially also to the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker, who also carry the burden when the Speaker is not in the chair and, of course, when the Speaker is abroad. We thank the three of them for their forbearance and their humour. The House has adopted various new procedures this year. The Main Committee has played, I think, an important role in spreading the legislation load more evenly across the sittings. I think that has worked; I think most people think that has worked. The rostered question time, I think, has ensured that members have the opportunity to question all the ministers rather than, perhaps, there being a concentration on the Prime Minister and Treasurer and the other ministers in the control portfolios. I think this is a major that, particularly improvement. The others who assist us in our general task in the parliament are the Hansard staff, that recording our words of wisdom and often knocking them into shape, and the Sound and Vision Office people, ensuring our words and images are beamed through the building. We used to have this very stylised coverage of the parliament through sound and vision covering only questioners and answerers. I think they are getting a little more used to it-better at it perhaps. They now have a clientele upstairs. I am quite sure that the producers of the three or four networks keep telling them what they want and that keeps changing the product. I do not know. Mr Tim Fischer-Even covering press conferences.",125
308,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"They are covering press conferences and everything else. So far so good. They are one media group I have never had to put a call through to. But, if they get too accommodating to Oakes and Milne and others, I will. I believe that only so much should go upstairs and that is all. Of course, we have all recognised the functions carried out by the press gallery-that mighty group of people who sit above· us. I think that is enough said about them. The staff of the Parliamentary Library plays a very important role in informing the rank and file members of this place. I remember when I first came here, when the library was perhaps in its infancy in terms of the developbench· ment of members' services. It was of great use to me, and I am sure to most members, to have that facility and to be able to go there and get support, which you do not perhaps normally have in the general infrastructure that members are provided with. I think they have developed and maintained considerable expertise and we thank all of them. I also express my thanks to the switchboard staff, Marlene and her coworkers Margaret, Pam, Ann and Gaylene. I know things are quite happy there. One does not remember ministers' office numbers but I do remember the Parliament House switchboard number, so I am a caller on occasions-many, many occasions. Yesterday there was a lot of mirth on the end of the line and I had to wait for the mirth to settle before we got connected. At least they are a happy band. That means that, at least, someone is getting served properly along the way as a consequence. ' I want to thank the other people who work here who make life pleasant for us and maintain these surroundings-the gardeners, the cleaners, the painters and others we do not see so much in the corridors but whom we would miss if their work ceased. Those of us who lived in the old buildingJohn Howard amongst them-will notice that there was a bit of a change coming up here. This chamber does not have the atmosphere of the old building, I think. People do sit too far away. When I was on the new and permanent Parliament House committee for seven long years, one of the things I wanted to do away with was this table and the books which, of course, we never refer to, or, if we were to have a table, to narrow it so that the members would sit closer together and it would be not so much a word and sentence throwing chamber but a debating chamber. We have been set up with a lot of space, facility and amenity, but I wonder whether we have missed a bit along the way. I think we might have. In the British House of Commons ministers can put their heels on the table. You often see it. That means they are a lot closer than is the case here. I always thought it was a good thing for the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to sit along the front rather than at the table. I was not particularly enamoured of sitting at the table here, but now I end up with so many notes I need a bit of space to put them down. I actually think it is probably worth hanging onto it. The chamber lacks a bit. . The other thing is that members do not have natural points of congregation in the building. Therefore, life is a bit more lonely here than it was in the old building. You can do without running into the odd joumo at every comer, I know-we have at least s-ved ourselves that-but you do not run mto anyone else much either. You have your splendid isolation in, admittedly, a very spacious room-that is a help--but I think we could probably do something over time to make the building a little more amenable, more interesting, to have places where people could congregate and feel like at least you belong to the main game, which - ou do n?t quite, I think, here. I do not thmk that IS good. We thank all those people that keep the thing going-the gardeners, the cleaners, the painters, et cetera-because the grounds are nice, the place is pleasant and it is well looked after. We appreciate that. Then of course, there are those who guard us and feed us and keep us travelling. That is important to all of us. The transport officers have been part and parcel of every member:s existence. We thank the staff of the cafeterIa for their commitment to us as well. A few people thanked their families, and I am thinking here of the families of all of us involved in this institution. It makes a very big demand on us and on our families with long and irregular hours. I hope the hours are better now. I think they are. Rising at 6 o'clock on Thursday night has made a difference, as has finishing at 8 o'clock. They are sensible hours. When I first came here-this is not a commentary on the coalition particularly but just a fact of life of the way it used to bewe would sometimes sit through until 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the morning. Often I would go back to the Hotel Kurrajong in daylight to have a shower and have breakfast and come back. We instituted the 11 o'clock rule in 1972 and from there we have now gone to 8 o'clock at night and the back to back four-day weeks rather than, in my day, three days on for three weeks out of four. It is now two four-day weeks back to back with people rising at 6 o'clock on Thursdays, which lets many members get home when they would not otherwise be able to. That means another night at home with the family, et cetera. In this International Year of the Family, I think it is appropriate that we extend our best wishes and gratitude to the families of those who work here. I say briefly-I will not burden the House too long-that we are here for a purpose, all of us. The purpose is, of course, to keep the country growing, prospering and moving. I can assure you that I am delighted by the fact that the economy is growing in the way that it is, at six per cent, and that we have had job growth of 430,000 since April 1993. In fact, jobs have been created at the rate of 700 a day in the last 12 months, which is a lot. The fall in unemployment over the last year of two per cent is the highest trend decrease since the unemployment records have been kept; that is, the fall in unemployment over the period. I think we really have seen, as a result of changes in the 1980s and maybe the recession, a change in the productivity culture of the country. We have productivity running in the non-farm economy at 4.6 per cent over the year. With the consumption deflator, if you look at the price of consumption goods for the last year, the rise is of 1.4 per cent. you put those two things together, the six per cent and the 1.4 per cent, this is probably the best economic year since the war. I cannot think of any other year when we have had six per cent growth and 1.4 per cent inflation. Maybe there is one, but we would need to look. At any rate, that is the point of the plot: to get people back to work. I think all of us in the House are happy that the long-term unemployed are getting more than the share they used to have of the jobs that are coming through. The prognosis is outstandingly good. I hope that the people of Australia feel that all of us have had a reasonable year. There will be more opportunities for Australians in the following year. I close by saying that this has been truly a good year for the country. While, at the moment, we traditionally thank members and the institutions of parliament, the greater credit goes to the people of this country, who have proven themselves to be resilient, resourceful, prepared to change and prepared to grab the future and hang on.",125
309,Mr DOWNER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am delighted to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others in wishing all honourable members and those who work in this building the very best for Christmas and for a holiday break, which I know everybody here deserves very much. It has certainly been a very interesting y.ear for the coalition. This was our 50th anniversary in the Liberal Party-50 great years in which we have, on average, dominated the political scene in this country. We are still in power in five of the six states in Australia and in six of the state and territory governments. Early next year we hope to add the ACT to our list. It will not be easy, but we are working at it. As I said, it has been a very interesting year for us-a year in which all of those . on the other side should have learned one thing about us; that is, never to underestimate our resilience and determination. ,I·· join with those who have spoken so highly of the institution of parliament. As the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) pointed out, it is an institution that I have been familiar with all my life. It is an institution that I If do not just have a historic enthusiasm for but an enthusiasm as an individual working in the parliament. Of course, our system has weaknesses, but on the whole I think it serves the Australian community fairly well. In the last month, a couple of delegations have visited my office--one was of politicians from Indonesia and the other involved aspiring politicians from the United States. I think they had the pleasure of watching our question time. They regarded it with some alarm and thought that it was not a model to take back to their own countries. I am not so sure. I think the way bits and pieces of the executive roll up every so often to answer questions and the way we have debates with the sort of vigour that we have give our whole political system much more life than other parliamentary or non-parliamentary democratic systems around the world. I think I could say that I had the displeasure when I was a diplomat of sitting and listening to some of the European parliaments. You would never want to go to that type of stolid institutional arrangement, where people stand up and make speeches which no-one listens to. It has none of the life of MPls, censure motions, suspensions of standing orders and, above all, the vigour of question time. Nevertheless, there is some· criticism from the community of our institution. Of course, it is your responsibility, Mr Speaker, and the responsibility of the majority party, to ensure that the parliament is carried on with a degree of decorum-not too much, but a degree. We still think a bit more needs to be done to improve the standards of the parliament. Whilst the Prime Minister spoke enthusiastically about the roster system, he well knows that that is not an enthusiasm we happen to share. It would have been good to have had Laurie Brereton in here today for question time. There are more things that we would have liked to have asked him. Nevertheless, it is a great institution. I agree with the Prime Minister about the chamber. I did not serve in the old chamber for very long, but it had a great deal more atmosphere than this chamber. The nature of the debate was, as the Prime Minister said, in a sense, closer. Therefore, it had a bit more vibrance. People in the galleries, the press and others could hear the interjections. Our interjections, as you all know, are very witty and incisive, and I think they deserve to be heard more than they are heard. I think the nation has lost something by not being able to hear more of our brilliant interjections. This point about a narrower table is one that worries me. I would have to sit all the much closer to the Prime Minister. It would be interesting to see what difference that would make. I thank all of the coalition members for the great work that they have done through the year. Much of their work does not appear in the media, and therefore the public generally is not aware of it. They spend so much of their time working not just in their electorates but for their electorates. I often say to people in the community-members of the Labor Party would be pleased to hear this-that people underestimate the tremendous amount of community work that members of parliament do. They just see us shouting at each other in question time and the like and do not see much else. Much of our work does not involve that. The work that coalition members have been doing in their electorates has been sterling and it is work for their communities. A lot of the work that they have· done in committees is also unsung work. A lot of it is work where members on both sides of the House try to reach common agreement, putting forward recommendations, many of which are taken up by the executive. I do not think that side of our work should ever be underestimated. We lost one of our members during this year in Andrew Peacock when he resigned from the parliament. Andrew's departure has been a great loss not just to us but to the parliament as a whole. There was some discussion about that at the time of his retirement. He was a great parliamentarian, a man who shared with many of us a great love for the institution. He is certainly being sorely missed as a contributor to this institution. I would like to extend my thanks to Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, and John Anderson, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, for the great support they have given to the coalition and the leadership that they have shown to National Party members who invariably work very harmoniously with the Liberal Party. The relationship between our two parties is one that I regard as enormously important. We do not always agree on everything-we would not be in different parties if we did-but there is a great sense of team spirit and agreement between the Liberals and Nationals. That will remain, if I have my way, for ever and a day. To Peter Costello, my deputy, I would like to extend my thanks. He has done a tremendous job in that role and also as the shadow Treasurer. I think he has marked himself out as one of the figures of real substance in this parliament and, as we all know, he has tremendous potential. To John Howard, the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, his experience and expertise have been absolutely invaluable to us. His work with me, Peter Costello, Tim Fischer, John Anderson and others in putting together our parliamentary tactics has been very much appreciated. They have been extraordinarily good, aggressive tactics. Certainly of late, you have seen a very advanced tactical team here doing a great job. To Kim Beazley, the Leader of the House",127
310,Mr MELHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,It's certainly not a brains trust.,129
311,Mr DOWNER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Coming from you, that is a bit rich. I am not sure that I should get into this game of telling you all what I think of you. I love all of those on my side. As for you guys, if I were to say anything positive about any of you, you would run it in your electorates in the election campaign. I would not want that. Mind you, which electorate is Kim's electorate? That I think we would all like to know. It is sort of Swan now but, as he moves down south to Brand, we of course wish him the worse of luck at the next election. I think he is going from a 0.3 per cent margin to a three per cent margin. He should have looked for a safer seat than that! Nevertheless, he has undertaken his tasks, in terms of the organisation of the parliament, very proficiently during the year. There has been very good cooperation between him and John Howard. Obviously, that is crucial if this place is going to work properly. If there is a total breakdown between the two sides, the place will just descend into mayhem. It is very important that that relationship works well, and I am very glad it has worked so well. I thank Bob Halverson, David Hawker and Kathy Sullivan, the Liberal whips; and Noel Hicks and Gary Nehl, the National Party whips, for all the work they have done. It is difficult work and they have performed that task with great professionalism. I thank the clerks very much for all the advice they have given us and for their knowledge of the standing orders-in fact, more than that: their knowledge of where we are up to and what we should be doing next is absolutely crucial. Of course, that is not when you, Sir, are in the chair. But occasionally when some of your deputies are in the chair, if it were not for the clerks, the whole place would come to a halt. I think the Prime Minister would disagree with me when I say that the clerks look very distinguished in their wigs. Long may some of these traditions, which give people an air of distinction, last. They are traditions that I think we should continue with. Mr Lee-Why don't you wear a wig?",129
312,Mr DOWNER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"When it comes to who else should be wearing wigs, as I look across the Labor benches it would be too rude for me to mention any names. Run your hands through your hair and think about it. To the Serjeant-at-Arms, David Elder, and to all those in the Joint House Department who do so much work, I extend my thanks and best wishes for Christmas. There are the people who are absolutely crucial to our lives-including the House of Representatives transport people. It must be an incredibly difficult job and would strain the patience of the most tolerant of people. They certainly have done the job well. The Parliamentary Library is always extremely professional. I do not think we should ever underestimate the professionalism of our Parliamentary Library. It is a part of our institution in which we should show a great deal of pride. I think we take it for granted a bit, but the people in the Parliamentary Library do a wonderful job. The Hansard reporters are amongst the most, if not the most, efficient Hansard reporters in the Westminster system in the world. The way they get the reports back to our offices-the greens in our case and the pinks in the Senate's case-so quickly and so accurately is a great achievement. It brings me back to interjections; I still do not think enough of our brilliant interjections get into Hansard, despite our very best efforts. There too often appears in Hansard 'Members interjecting' or 'The Prime Minister interjecting'whoever it may be; we do not get the words. Perhaps it is not always a bad thing. The switchboard operators do .a great job too. I do not know how they can be so polite and so patient in all circumstances. I extend our thanks to them for the work they do. I thank the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Anna Clendinning, and the team there for the work they have done. Like the Prime Minister, I mention the press gallery but appropriately mention them just in passing. Finally, as the Prime Minister said, this is the International Year of the Family. It is worth mentioning all of our long-suffering families and what they have to put up with. Certainly in the case of my family-and it is probably true of everyone's family-there was a sense of some enthusiasm for the initial days and weeks in the job. But no doubt some of those family members are beginning to wilt because so much of the responsibility of family life rests with them. All of us will probably look back on these years, particularly those of us with young children, and feel that our spouses have had to bear a disproportionate responsibility and a disproportionate amount of work in that great task-the greatest of all tasks, really-of bringing up the children. It is something we should never forget. I come back to where I began. I would like to wish everybody in the House-members and all of the staff-a very happy Christmas. It is a very important time of year to all of us. For me as a Christian it is a very important time in that respect. It is also, though, that one time of year which has a very special homely, family atmosphere about it. I do very sincerely hope you all have an extremely happy Christmas and that the coalition members come back with renewed vigour and freshness in the new year and those opposite are all totally exhausted and tired from too much of a Christmas holiday!",129
313,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"May I begin by saying that I thank not the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) for his reference to certain members' baldness in this House. I am sure he was directing that remark directly at me and others. I am not too sure about the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about stretch in this parliament, or sitting schedules. Yes, there is a lot of stretch in this chamber. There is perhaps a bit of extra and unnecessary stretch between the three main wings of this new parliamentary building: the House of Representatives side, the centre core of the building, and the Senate side. Some of us remember being in the UlOO rows of the Old Parliament House. I draw members' attention to the Hansard table in this House and remind them that the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and I and others used to have to work in offices which were 1112 times the size of that table top. So let us not forget that we have gained a great deal in coming to this new parliamentary building. I must give credit in relation to the new sitting schedule. Undoubtedly, when I came back from my road accident earlier this year, I would have found it extremely difficult to have carried through to 11 o'clock every night. The sitting schedule is again at this time under review by one of the committees. I simply make the point that perhaps there is scope to sit a little later on the first two nights of the week-Monday and Tuesday nightsbut to certainly get up early on the Wednesday and Thursday nights. In any event, the new sitting schedule has been a great improvement, and I freely support and acknowledge that. I extend greetings of the season to all members and senators. To you, Sir, I thank you for the courtesies that you have extended to me over the years. I extend my thanks to members and senators of the National Party; to my deputy leader; to the National Party whip, Noel Hicks; to the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Boswell; to the Deputy Leader of the National Party in the Senate who represents me in that place, Senator David Brownhill, and others. I also extend my thanks to members of the organisation in the National Party, to the secretariat, and especially to Cecile Ferguson, who has just been to hospital; we wish her well in that regard. I extend best wishes and thanks to the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) for their many courtesies and the cooperative, constructive and positive working relationship we have, along with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) in the House and the members of the Liberal Party in both the lower house and the Senate. I enjoy a robust relationship within the coalition. I concede that it is no bed of roses at times, but it is the best way forward for ou):"" side of politics, and we do mean business in getting on with the job next year. I extend my thanks to the Prime Minister and members of the caucus, particularly the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), for the liaison and cooperation and the various protocol functions and so forth in which there is, of necessity, quite· proper liaison between government and opposition. I thank the clerks. I thank Lyn Barlin for his 40 years in the House of Representatives-four decades of service. We all freely acknowledge the outstanding work he does and that is done by his team. It is professional and at all times is done with the best interests of the proceedings of the House in mind. The transport staff and all those associated with the transport industries, including some very patient staff at various airports around Australia, deserve our thanks for so often accepting last-minute changes of schedule and the like in the gracious way that they do. They try to find the best flight connections forward when situations suddenly arise such as strikes, fogs and the rest. To the Hansard staff represented here in both houses for all the parliamentary committee work and the extra second chamber work they have had to bear this year, I thank them. I thank all parliamentary staff throughout this building for their outstanding cooperation and liaison. To my own personal staff, chief of staff Craig Symon and my team, and to my electorate staff and perhaps to the electorate staff of members and senators generally could I say: yes, it is a very difficult job, a very challenging job. We are often on the road and suddenly decisions and responses and the like are required. We. salute their commitment, their dedication, their professionalism. To my family: I thank my wife Judy and, coming back to the comment about wigs and lack of wigs, it is a source of intense frustration to me that our son Harrison, one year and 10 days old, has already more hair than I do. I am not too sure what I can do about that. There is not a great deal. Mr Bilney-Buy a razor.",130
314,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, I could.",131
315,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Ask Alexander his secret.,131
316,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, I could. It is pretty luxuriant, actually. It is turning grey, I do report on close analysis. Could I single out two other groupings. As is my wont this time of the year, I have been known to go and visit some of the Australian troops serving overseas. But I am getting better organised at it, Kim. I went during the last fortnight rath\!r than in the immediate fortnight before Christmas. In the Sinai are some 30 very dedicated Australians at north camp keeping the peace between Egypt and Israel under the overall command of General David Ferguson and people like Major Alan Bradford, the acting senior officer on the night and day I was present with them. They are peacekeepers in the Middle East. Others, like Colonel Tony Miles, I met with the UNSTO force in Lebanon, and I met other members of that force in Syria and the Golan. I take this opportunity to salute all our peacekeepers and all our service men and women serving overseas this day and during this Christmas period. I extend to them the greetings of the season and congratulate and commend them on the outstanding work they are doing in difficult circumstances. I tum to 1995. I hope it is going to be a wet year that will fundamentally ease the burden of the drought across so much of Australia, which has had a desperate drought year with huge ramifications for our balance of payments and our export performance and which has created real hardship for so many people. I also look forward to the arrival of the Pope on schedule in mid-January. I hope that will be a successful visit. I also look forward to the arrival in, I think, early February, of the Prime Minister of ThailandChuan Leekpai, a friend whom I think this country will look forward to entertaining and extending a proper state visit to as part of the building of relations between Australia and Thailand, a country I chose above all other countries to study in detail when I was first elected to this parliament 10 years and eight days ago. I, therefore, am very happy as Leader of the National Party of Australia to wish you all a very happy Christmas.",131
317,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Watson) (7.53 p.m.)Can I just take a few minutes to thank all those people who have some things to do with the Main Committee. Members might recall that in years gone by we would have been here till the late hours of the night this week. We would have the guillotine on. The opposition would have been very unhappy and the people who run the parliamentary departments would probably have been even more unhappy. I can tell you from experience that the government members would have been just as unhappy. But the Main Committee this year has solved a lot of that problem for us. It has sat for about 58 hours. We have got a little more sense into the work that we do. At this time it would be very useful to say something to the people who have done the work for that committee. I thank Harry Jenkins and the panel of Deputy Speakers who help him in organising that and in getting over a number of interesting procedural arrangements that we have never seen in this House but that up there, in the informal way that place works, work well. They have done well. There has not been an argument there yet. That is progress. A lot of that has to do with Deputy Speaker Jenkins. I thank Ian Harris and his staff, who have provided the advice and the flexibility that probably Lyn Barlin would not allow them to provide down here. In that way the Main Committee might be able to give a bit of a lean to this House. I thank the people who have done the duty for the Main Committee because to have people on duty both from the government and the opposition requires a bit of creativity, with parliamentary secretaries, government committee chairs and deputy chairs on the opposition side. The parliamentary liaison officer and her staff, in particular Ann Louise, who does the work for the Main Committee, have ensured that we have been able to run two chambers effectively and get the work done. A lot of that has to do with the staff of Bob Halverson and me. B.A. and her helpers have already been mentioned. Joan Connor in my office obviously is responsible for the good things there and Ted Grace, Rob Sawford and I are responsible for the bad things. Melinda Lowe and Kristel Griffiths, who help her, have made sure that the running of those two chambers has worked welL They have taken most of the load. I think the government members and the opposition members have managed to adjust to the Main Committee well. That innovation has allowed us to do some of the things that both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) spoke about here tonight. It has given us a bit of time to have sensible hours. It has given us a bit of time not to have the helter-skelter that we normally have at the end of the year. And I suppose on nights like tonight, and hopefully not tomorrow, it allows us to be able to party without too much difficulty. I thank those people who did the nuts and bolts work. I particularly thank Bob Halverson, Noel Hicks and their deputies, and also Ted Grace and Rod Sawford, the two other government whips, for the work they have done. The thing I found interesting in the last year has been working closely with Kim Beazley, who, as others have said here tonight, probably has his finger on the pulse of this institution more and in a better way than anyone else. The only one who surpasses him is the Prime Minister, without whom what would question time be? I have always said in the past that Paul should be here every day because he added that extra dimension that used to get the government members to take a lot more interest in what happened. But now you are getting twice the punch on two days a week. Without the Prime Minister here at question time, question time loses a bit of its oomph. Even though he has said that from time to time. I might ask him a controversial question, and there might not be all that much content in the question, there is a terrific bit of content in the answer.",132
318,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"You can see, Mr Speaker, why I like him.",133
319,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Like you, Mr Speaker, in the past the content really drove me mad. What we have in Beazley and Keating and in the Leader of the Opposition and John Howard are four people who really have a feeling about what the institution of parliament is about. It is very interesting for all of us in this place to see them when they are performing at their best. So could I thank once again all those people who had work to do with the Main Committee this year. I particularly thank the government members for the work they have done and wish all members and all our staff a happy and holy Christmas. I look forward to seeing you all here next year-with us on this side and you on that side.",133
320,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take this opportunity to echo some of the compliments that have been given to members of the parliamentary staff. As honourable· members would know, the position of Speaker carries with it the responsibility for administering the Department of the House of Representatives, the Parliamentary Library, the Joint House Department and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. In. each of those departments you could not find better personnel to serve the interests of members of this place. Nothing is too difficult for them. They spend a lot of time looking at ways in which they can make the lot of members and senators in this place easier. They certainly are a great credit to this institution. I thank the departmental heads for the advice they continue to give me in this position. It is not easy when one has to administer four departments at the one time without necessarily having ministerial rank, but having that responsibility. I am always given first-rate advice, and I thank them for that. I would also like to thank all those people who work in those departments, whether they be attendants, gardening staff, people in the catering service, Hansard reporters or whomever. They are all true public servants in the purest sense of the term and we owe them a great deal of gratitude. I would particularly like to thank David Elder, the Serjeant-at-Arms. It is always good to have somebody of such enormous talent able to give advice very quickly. The fact that David came from a committee which I used to chair, of course, has nothing to do with it. He was well trained. David does an outstanding job for us all in this place and I think that is superb. Lyn Barlin, Ian Harris and the other clerks have also been singled out for special mention tonight. There is no doubt that the professionalism and the quality of advice which come from them are second to none in any parliament in the world. At any time, night and day, when there is a difficulty or I need to be referred to a section of the green book so that I understand clearly what I might have done or said in the House, Lyn has always been that source of good advice. To Lyn, Ian and the other clerks I say, thank you. The Deputy Speaker and the panel of deputy speakers have also been of great assistance to me and to this parliament this year. The rostering system has provided a great deal of opportunity for them to display their wares. From my observations when I am not here but am watching on television, I think they do a great job. I thank them all, particularly Harry Jenkins who, from time to time, had to step in for me. I recall that when I lost my voice at one stage he did a superb job and I thank him most sincerely for that. I would also just like to say something about a couple of members of this place who are retiring and have given great service to the parliament. They are perhaps people a lot of members would not normally come across in their day-today work. Christine PageHanify has had managerial responsibility for developing the computer systems we have in this place. She has been responsible for the latest and greatest and was given advice by a committee we established so that members know the sorts of things they require. It was her job to implement that in this modem technological age. She has been headhunted and is going to the University of New South Wales. We wish her every success. David Callan has handled the difficult responsibility of industrial relations in the Joint House Department. He too has been headhunted and is going to the Department of Defence. We wish David every success. He has kept any sort of difficulty in an industrial relations sense within the parliament well under control and I am sure he will do extremely well in that new capacity. Some comment has been made about the hours of parliament, the operation of the second chamber, question time and other aspects of this chamber. We are very lucky in that we have a robust democracy and that we have an expression of that on a daily basis here. I take the points raised by both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) in that respect. There are many parliaments where you have got no chance whatsoever of seeing prime ministers or ministers being subjected to questions. In many countries there is no chance at all for opposition leaders even to be in a parliament or even for such a position to exist. As a consequence, this form of democracy which Australia enjoys is something to be protected. . As has also been mentioned, from time to time the opportunity for an expression of that democracy imd· how we perhaps ·respond to that, whether it be question time, censure motions or whatever the business of the parliament allows us to do, draws adverse comment and quite often a lot of that is directed to the· occupant of this position. Nevertheless, it is a form of our democracy which we should always ensure we protect. If you allow me some indulgence from my position of impartiality, J would like to respond to some comments .made on the rostering system. Whet} the government was thinking of introducing this system I said that this would provide .an opportunity for all ministers to be put under the spotlight, to be accountable, to be responsible and to demonstrate the talents which their colleagues believe they have; hence their occupation of those positions. Similarly, it provides an opportunity for oppositions to question those people who might otherwise not ever get a question in this place. Too often we think about what is happening now and forget what it was like under the old system when two, three or maybe four ministers at most would _ get 95 per cent of the questions. I am not sure that really is· a reflection of how we could operate in a democracy in its purest sense. I think it is working well. I have seen ministers in this place under some pressure, I have seen them respond and I have seen opposition members in this place put ministers under that scrutiny with questions. Therefore, on balance, it is working particularly well. I would also like to thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)-indeed, all members in this place. Rightly has it been said-and I am famous for sayIng it-that the Speaker's job is not one for wusses, if you will forgive the unparliamentary language. I think that is probably right. The way in which people in this chamber generally have responsibility for adhering to standing orders and doing what we are after all elected to do is carried out with a great deal of ability. To those three members in particular I say thank you for the courtesies which you have extended me. Finally but one, I would like to thank my personal staff. Phil Bergin, Geraldine Skinner, Debra Biggs, Marie Donnelly, Claire Cooney and Carol Nichols are a group of staff who provide, as I have said earlier about the staff generally in this place, the purest form of public service. All members from time to time have had need to contact my office and I do not think they have ever been refused courteous attention-and that is the way it should be in a Speaker's office. They all bring special talents to that position and I would like to thank them most sincerely. Finally, I too would like to offer all members my best wishes for a safe, happy and holy festive· season. The opportunity to recharge batteries over the summer monthsand perhaps do what the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has suggested and take in some of the pleasures of seeing England beaten in the cricket-is something we all look forward to. I wish you and your families all the very best and I look forward to seeing you back here next year. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That leave of absence be given to every member of the House of Representatives from the determination of this sitting of the House to the date next sitting. NA Migration Committee",133
321,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Migration, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Immigration review appointments process together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",135
322,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report stems from a sustained effort by the shadow minister in this field, a few disaffected failed applicants for appointment and a predictable collection of journalists. The situation stems from appointments made in August this year which led to questions on notice from the shadow minister on 29 August, the matter being raised in the Victorian parliament and in the Senate on 11, 12, 13 and 20 October and, finally, as well as this particular inquiry, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) giving evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is interesting to note that, whilst this effort has been sustained, as I said, by this grouping, in the last week or so the Senate refused to call the minister before the inquiry. Today the Democrats and the Senate indicated their concern that the minority of the migration committee had not agreed to add to the report the legal and constitutional affairs legislation hearings. The position of the majority on this report is probably best summarised by page 52, which states: ... the Committee is of the view that the appointments process was conducted in accordance with the guidelines and accepted practice for appointments to tribunals, including the recommendations of CROSROMD. The appointments were advertised widely. The advisory committee was constituted in accordance with the guidelines. There is no evidence to indicate that the advisory committee did not carry out its functions with due probity. Of the 750 persons who lodged expressions of interest for appointment to the IRT, only a handful provided submissions to the Committee indicating concerns about· the selection process or about their own of its failure to be appointed or re-appointed. Furthermore, the report states on the next page: Where a Minister acts within those guidelines, objective evidence needs to be provided to indicate Report that impropriety has occurred. Such evidence did not come to the fore during this inquiry. Indeed, witnesses such as Mr Clothier indicated that their evidence was based on hearsay. The appointments should be seen in the context of the Cabinet Handbook and the 1993 policy of appointments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I note on page 15 of the committee report a quote which I think is very relevant to this. The report states: A crucial aspect of the AAT appointments policy and procedure is the strong emphasis on the prerogative of the Minister in making appointments and re-appointments. Ministerial prerogative in relation to appointments also is emphasised in the Cabinet Handbook. In 1989 there was an investigation led by the former coalition minister for immigration, Mr Ian MACPhee. That Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Migration Decisions, CROSROMD, came to a number of conclusions and made a number of suggestions. It is interesting to note, in the context of complaints by the opposition, that the recommendations which were put to the government were: that the minister should continue to be responsible for the suggestion of people to the Governor General; that there should be widespread advertising; that there should be interviews of more suitable candidates by an advisory committee appointed by the minister; that the committee should report on those candidates in accordance with publicly available selection criteria; and, finally and perhaps very relevantly, that the minister should remain entitled to use additional methods for identifying suitable candidates for appointment and should not be bound to accept the advisory committee's recommendations. There is obviously a very strong emphasis on the minister's rights in this field, his prerogatives. If we look at section 394 of the relevant legislation, there are very few impediments-one of age and one of conflict of interest-that in any matter undermine the minister's overall right. During the inquiry, there was evidence particularly from Mr Clothier, the senior member in Victoria who failed to be reappointed. The minority report states: The Government members of the Committee had decided that the best way to discredit both the written and oral submissions made to the inquiry by Mr Clothier was to build a case in favour of the proposition that he and his accusations were purely motivated by 'sour grapes', and that his disappointYes, ment at not being re-appointed had clouded his judgment. That is the view of the opposition about the government's attitude on this matter. It is very interesting to notice Mr Clothier's own comments on this matter. On page 22 he noted that he had never raised any problems about the 1989 appointments. He admitted that they were far more flawed than the latest appointments in 1994. He admitted the process was far worse because it preceded CROSROMD's suggestions. Lo and behold, in 1994 the process, with all of these improvements, suggested by MACPhee and the committee, was adhered to without any argument by the opposition, but Mr Clothier found this process to be wanting. His comment was: I got concerned to make a public issue after my non reappointment. During evidence he sarcastically referred to a number of other threatened members-people who perceived themselves as threatened by not being reappointed. He said that they were going to the toilet because they were terrified by who was coming into the office, seeing members of the socialist Left who might replace them. He indicated to the committee that he did not have a concern in the world. He thought he was going to be reappointed. I think there is a very substantial case for 'sour grapes'. To my mind, it is very interesting to note that, whilst he had continually referred to the political affiliations of Messrs Italiano and Bruce, despite those 'dreadful' appointments, he could come to a number of interesting conclusions about those people. On page 16 of the evidence, he said that Italiano was 'hard working'. He said of Bruce: Well, I do not think that Peter Bruce was a bad member; it is just that his productivity was very low. He commented on Italiano again. He said that Italiano was 'neck and neck' in terms of being the hardest working member of the tribunal.",135
323,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,In Australia?,136
324,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"I thought nationally. that is correct, not just in Victoria. So here we had flawed appointments and people with political affiliations, just like some of those appointed at this time. But Mr Clothier, in the period he was the senior member, developed very rich relationships with these people who were such 'dreadful' appointments. He went to barbecues with them and discussed the internal intricacies of the Victorian Labor Party. He said he felt himself to be 'made an honorary member of the Labor unity' . What we see here is a group of people who were sitting in those positions who felt they were threatened. They talked to Mr Clothier. He had minimal knowledge of the internal workings of the Labor Party. They exaggerated their own roles in. the party operation. Mr Clothier, who himself conceded he had very little direct knowledge, came to a number of conclusions about the appointments. I think it is very interesting to note his own orientation. Quite frankly, one thing that I found rather disturbing is that when Mr Clothier was asked about who else he thought should be appointed he could only come up with two people, who were members of the same organisation as he. They were Mr Vrachnas of the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre and Ms Morton, the manager of the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre. He had been the secretary of the same organisation previously. What we of have here, for practical purposes, is a group of people who feel that everyone appointed to this tribunal should stem from the same grouping, have the same community associations and have the same background and that if they are not all appointed it is a dreadful thing. Mr Clothier's other sustained effort was to put forward a proposition that he was of world shattering importance to immigration law in this country because he made a mental decision in a case called Tordo. That was possibly the reason why he was not reappointed. Yet he himself conceded that had to make a choice. He said: I had to make a choice whether I obeyed my conscience or whether I toed the line and I obeyed my conscience. He also said: I had a choice to make: either I do it according my conscience or I live in fear. That is the kind of rhetoric we had from He did concede that there were two people the same ballpark, people the government could not depend upon. The government should would be concerned about the nature of here decisions those two people would make. But he had to admit they were both reappointed, despite this independence. As I said, we have a person who, from 1989 to 1994, had no worries about a process that was perhaps far more open to criticism; a person who had no worries on the day that interviews were occurring, because he thought he was on board for another term; and a person who, unfortunately, did not manage sustain his view. No statistics were provided, for instance, of allegations that in the final months there was a tendency for people to scared about reappointment and for there be a start of making happier decisions for government. There were no statistics providnature ed, no indications of evidence. The committee did come up with a few find recommendations about appointments of lawyers to the senior' position and about staggering appointments to make sure that numerous people do not come up for appointment at the same time. In conclusion, the report does indicate that, within the provisions the legislation and the prerogatives that the minister has, there is no case made by the who is opposition's campaign.",136
325,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am one of the members of the Joint Committee on Migration who have contributed to this report. I find it disappointing to be one of those who have contributed in this matter to a very significant and major dissenting report, the others being the deputy chairman, Senator Jim Short, the right honourable Ian Sinclair monuMP and Mrs Kathy Sullivan MP. The committee was asked to look at a very serious matter: the manner and method of appointhe ment, reappointment and non-reappointment of members of the Immigration Review Tribunal, and the effect that this process has on community confidence in, and the ability of, the tribunal to perform its duties. The Immigration Review Tribunal is a very to important organisation. It was established in 1989 to provide independent merits review in him. a situation where a determined effort was in made by the government to take politics out of the decision making process about who or should not enter Australia to settle permanently. It was a very important and major step designed to create a culture in which politics were not involved. It is very interesting that, in setting up an independent organisation to carry out this important task and the establishment of a specialist body, there was not a great deal of thought given-and I note that there has not been a great deal of thought given over time-to the question of what one's expectato tions ought to be about the nature of the appointments made to a body of this sort. I 12 suspect the reason for that was that people be would not expect one to ever bring into to question appointments of such a character the which were made. They are very much in the of judicial appointments, about which there is not a great deal written. You do not anything written in the constitution or the Judiciary Act about the expectations one might have of the way in which people who are appointed to the courts might behave. But there is a very clear understanding about the expectations placed on judicial officers. I think there also is a clear understanding in relation to some other independent statutory review bodies, industrial commissions and the like-an expectation that, when people are appointed, they cease to have an active role in day-today political activities. In relation to judges-because something has been written, and a statement of that is in the minority report-it has been said, by Mr Justice Thomas in his book Judicial ethics in Australia, that: ... it seems fairly clear that, after appointment, a judge should not be an active member of any political party. He should not fraternise with those in the echelons of political power. He should not actively support causes which produce partisan reaction in the community. It would be improper for him to participate in a political party convention. As the divorce from political partisanship needs to be complete, he should resign from membership of any party. Continued silent membership could be seen as clandestine support. What has happened in this case? The member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who spoke before me, said that there were certain allegations by failed applicants for appointment to the Immigration Review Tribunal that prompted the opposition to take up those matters and make a political exercise of it; it was really all a matter of sour grapes on the part of some individuals. He has referred to Mr Clothier, a gentleman who was previously the senior member of the immigration tribunal in Victoria, who was not reappointed by the government-and I will say a little more about that appointment later. The member for Reid made some I think fairly disparaging comments about Mr Clothier. I do not know anything of Mr Clothier's political antecedents. I asked the question as to whether he had been a member of any political party, as I recall, and he said no. He was appointed to this role when I was shadow minister. If I had been asked where I thought his political allegiances lay, I would not have expected them to be with my side of politics.",137
326,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,I would have. So we disagree.,138
327,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,We disagree. I would not have expected that. Nor would I have expected it from most of the people in the organisation from which he came.,138
328,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,It doesn't matter.,138
329,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"It does. What happened in relation to this particular appointment was that a number of people-and I think it was manifest in terms of people who were even of your political persuasion who came before us and offered some comments about the process-when he was not reappointed, were prompted to look at what was happening. That is the gist of it. That is the context in which people came before the inquiry and gave certain evidence. I would just encourage members who are concerned about the points that are being raised tonight to look at the minority report and the appointments-the dubious appointments, as we have called them-that have been made. I want to measure them, if I can, against paragraph 3.122 on page 52 which the honourable member for Reid referred to, because our concern in this matter is in relation to the role of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). The advisory committee that was constituted to consider some of the appointments did not, however, consider all of the appointments. It did not consider Mr Head's appointment, which is one of the ones complained of; that was dealt with before such a committee was established. We did not complain about the advisory committee carrying out its functions with due probity. We think that that committee was, in fact, under the minister, carrying out its functions as he required it to carry them out. Of the members of that advisory committee, one was a member of the minister's staff, another was the head of the Immigration Review Tribunal and another was a member of the department. It was quite clear in relation to the evidence that they gave-and we have drawn very heavily on it-that matters relating to the appointments that we considered dubious were related to the minister's involvement and not the way in which the committee carried out its functions and responsibilities. Nor did we query whether the positions were advertised or whether the committee was constituted in accordance with the guidelines. They were not the questions. The dubiousness of the appointments arises from the very fact that the minister exercised the power that he does in fact have to make these appointments. That is the issue. You have to ask yourself whether the appointments he made were appropriate, given all of the surrounding circumstances that have been outlined in the minority report. I think any reasonable person reading that report would come to the view that they were inappropriate appointments or, as we have said, dubious. In relation to Mr Alevizos, he is a gentlemen who had been a guest at the minister's wedding fairly recently and was appointed to an additional full-time post in South Australia where there is some question as to whether or not a full-time post was in fact required. He was appointed over a person who was later appointed to the most senior position in Victoria. He was not shortlisted by the panel, of which the minister asked to be advised. The minister did not interview any of the applicants in relation to this appointment. Yet the appointment was made. Mr Labbozzetta was appointed as a part-time member of the New South Wales tribunal some years ago. He sat on only four cases in five years, and three of them were jointly with somebody else, so he did not have to write a decision. He produced only one decision in that five-year term. The advisory panel recommended against his appointment. So the minister set up an advisory committee. The committee rightly said that it did not think it was an appropriate appointment to make. That is very clear. But, almost by immaculate conception, and over a whole lot of other sound applicants, the minister determined that this gentlemen should be made a part-time member again. The minister also accepted that, even though Mr Labbozzetta is and has been the subject of press publicity in respect of charges in relation to a club that is associated with in New South Wales, he will stand down for a period of time until that matter is resolved and will then come back and work, presumably on a conscientious basis. He was pulled out of 800 applicants and put at the top of the pile. It was not done by the advisory committee-we are. not complaining about that-but it was done by the minister. Let us look at some of the other people who were not appointed. One of them, Ms Turner, was a former secretary of the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). Another was Dr Witton. I did not know Dr Witton before he came in but I have talked to him and he seems a nice, pleasant fellow. I found out that he was a member of the ALP too. When you look at the factors that have been involved in some of this decision making, he did not have any inappropriate credentials. He has been very conscientious. We looked at his record of decision making. But he was found to be unsuitable. Mr Head was appointed a full-time member of the IRT in Victoria before this process of recent appointments was undertaken. But after the CROSROMD report-which has been referred to-the position was not advertised, an advisory panel was not set up and no interviews were conducted. If you look at the workload, there was no particular evidence that there was a greater demand for a new appointment in Victoria over and above New South Wales. Yet, he was appointed. Coincidentally, he just happened to be the ALP's preselected candidate for the upper house seat of Waverley in Victoria. I do not know all the factors that are involved in people's capacities, but it seems extraordinary that, out of 800 applicants, a number of other known political activists were appointed, particularly in Victoria. Nikki Dollis was appointed a full-time member, and she is the wife of the Victorian state Leader of the Opposition, who was, I understand, best man recently at the minister's wedding. Mr Joe Italiano was reappointed full time, and he is the preselected ALP candidate for the seat of Werribee. Ms Lynne Kosky was appointed part time and is the preselected he ALP candidate for the seat of Altona. Ms Pippy Watson was reappointed as a part-time member and is the former private secretary of Senator Robert Ray and was originally appointed by him to the body. Ms Patti Warn was appointed a part-time member in New South Wales, and is known to many around this place as being very actively involved in the Labor Party and as serving many Labor politicians. Of the 22 people interviewed for appoint2. ment in Victoria-and we know the minister was involved in suggesting names of those he would like to see interviewed-l0 of them were named by Mr Clothier in his evidence as being members of the ALP. They were: Mr Peter Spyker, Mr Gary Shepherd, Mr Stefano De Piri, Ms Lynne Kosky, Ms Nikki Dollis, Ms Lidia Argondizzo, Mr Ray Rooke, Mr Joe  son. I mention all of this because, when we questioned the head of the Immigration Review Tribunal on this issue of the appropriImmigration ateness of people maintaining political ciations, a number of people actually took the decision to resign from the Labor Party when they took up appointments. Ms O'Neil, the principal member, took that course, which think was a proper course to take. In relation to another gentleman who was not reappointWith ed in South Australia, he resigned from the Labor Party because he took the view that was inappropriate to continue that involveVictoria, ment. My view generally is that, now that this issue has become clear, if we are going to have a merit review body, the recommendation proposed by me and my colleagues should be picked up. We have recommended that all full-time members appointed to the Immigration Review Tribunal should withdraw from active political involvement by resigning any party membership. We have also recommended that, if a full-time member is nominated as a political candidate for a given election, he should resign from his position. If we are going to maintain community confidence in the ability of the tribunal to be able to perform its duties, that only proper and appropriate standard that should be expected in relation to an organisative tion of this character that is expected to undertake merit reviews. The committee also made some other that recommendations and I draw them to the attention of members. The report states: 1. the selection criteria for the appointment of Senior Members to the Immigration Review Tribunal specify that legal qualifications or a legal background or equivalent experience is desirable; and interviews be conducted in all States where full-time members are to be appointed to the Immigration Review Tribunal. The very fact that the majority of the comtnittee went as far as to make the two recommendations is saying that the process in this case was clearly defective and inappropriate. Clearly, the appointment of a person without legal training-and who was not considered to be appointed as the senior and only person in South Australia as a full-time member-as the principal member of the Review Tribunal in Victoria has assoto be seen as a suspect appointment. She came from Western Australia, where she had had senior executive service, but it was only after having given very distinI guished service in the office of the minister and, I think, the Pretnier of Western Australia. that experience, she was given the opportunity to serve in the Western Australian it public service. She was not shortlisted for she did not apply to go to Victoria, but in the end was given the appointment which the government members have come to the view, in support of their minister, that Mr Clothier was unsuitable to continue to hold. It is certainly the view of my colleagues-I think it is the view of government members when you look at the nature of their recommendations-that the appointment of Ms Scott was clearly questionable. It could not happen again under the guidelines that the government is asking us to adopt; nor could some of the other appointments that have been made be made under the guidelines that it is asking us to adopt. Clearly, the report has been written on a is the political basis by government members seeking to defend their minister. Any objecreading of the evidence, particularly the evidence that we have adduced as part of the minority report-I do not think it can be refuted-would clearly lead one to the view the whole process was flawed and defective. It has brought the government into disrepute. It has brought the Immigration Review Tribunal into disrepute. It warrants some fundamental reforms to the process. Having now examined it and seen the way in which appointments are made by a minister without an adequate system of guidelines, we believe flawed appointments can be made.",138
330,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I listened with great interest to the assertions made by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I am bound to disagree with a number of his assertions. The first point I want to make seems to have been totally omitted by our colleagues in the opposition. I refer to the directions this parliament gave to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) through the legislation. If the view of the coalition at the time was the same as that asserted by Mr Clothier, one of the witnesses who was strongly of the view that only people with legal qualifications and backgrounds should be appointed-he made no apology for that view-then why did the coalition not insist that that provision go into the legislation? The question before the committee was not the wish list of the coalition. The question before the committee was: was there any evidence at all of the minister not complying with the provisions of the act or not complying with the express wishes of this parliament set out in the legislation? It does not matter how the honourable member for Berowra might confect all kinds of political conspiracies. The answer to that simple question is no. The parliament gave very clear and wide discretionary powers to the minister. I listened to the argument of the honourable member for Berowra. He said that, if you take one of these appointments, you should resign from all your political connections. That is true for members of the judiciary. Why? Because in almost all cases they are appointments for life. There is a notable exception to that. A very significant number of judges who were appointed for life have been sacked in Victoria. It is a matter of major concern to legal profession in my state, yet I have not heard any concern voiced by the honourable member for Berowra. He might argue that he is not a Victorian, but I have heard no concern from any Victorian member of the coalition in this House about the fact that judges and people exercising high judicial office have been sacked at the political whim of a Liberal coalition government. All of a sudden, we have a different set of balances, a different set of scales. As a judge recently said in a tragic case in Victoria, life means life. But it is also true that an appointment for five years means an appointment for five years. It does not mean an appointment for life. It does not mean that you will necessarily be reappointed because you have an overweening view of your own ability. An appointment for five years means precisely that. It may well be that, when you take all the factors into consideration, the parliament has said to the minister, 'It's a matter for your discretion.' That is the argument. In respect of the somewhat limp proposition of my colleague the honourable member for Berowra, let me say this: I have never argued, and will never argue, that members who, as a result of their political philosophy, their view of Australian society and their commitment to improve their perception of this society, publicly join a political party have any more rights than anyone else, but I am not prepared to concede an argument that on the basis of a five-year appointment they have fewer rights. That, in essence, is the argument of my colleague. He made a nonsensical proposition. Having been a minister for immigration, I can do no better than to say that, if my colleague the honourable member for Berowra through some misfortune in a preselection ballot lost his position but wanted to continue in that position as a result of his deep commitment to the philosophy of the Liberal Party and his background, knowledge and commitment to resolving some of the many problems surrounding immigration, I would regard him as an eminently suitable person for a five-year appointment on a tribunal of this kind. But I do not believe he should be forced the to resign from the Liberal Party in order to take up a five-year appointment. If he believes it is appropriate, that is a matter for his personal judgment. But I will not argue that, because of his philosophical and political commitment, he automatically has to disqualify himself from a position for which I believe he would be eminently qualified. I cannot argue that when making a day-today decision on the rights of people to seek to become citizens of Australia, which falls within the provisions of the act, the member for Berowra would not act responsibly, sensibly and in a balanced way. That is what flaws this minority report. I spent some time questioning Mr Clothier. I am bound to say that I reached the conclusion-I was not told within the legal profession-that he was a man skilled in immigration law. But I reject his view that the only people who had some preferment in appointment were qualified lawyers. I say quite frankly, as I act on behalf of many immigrants in my capacity as a member of parliament, that some of the biggest shonks in this whole field are practising lawyers.  is how they were appointed.",141
331,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"The issue is simply this: if this parliament gives the minister a very broad discretion to make appointments for five years, we are not entitled to allow a disappointed and frustrated lawyer who believes because he is a lawyer with not inconsiderable skills to say, 'I am going to there forever.' I view with some concern some of the statements he made about his working colleagues. One of them who is known personally to me is a married woman of ethnic background and a member of the Labor Party. She is as committed in her integrity and honesty as the honourable member for Berowra, but she was somehow considered to be less worthy. Why? Does anybody say she is an unfit mother? She is not. Does anybody say that, as a result of her background, she does not have a passionate concern for social justice and a commitment to a political party? Mr Clothier says that, because she happens to be a member of a political party and he is a lawyer, he should get appointed. All of a sudden this person with whom he has worked becomes unworthy. What do we do about Mr Clothier's evidence when he says of another member of the Labor Party who also has an ethnic background but is a close personal associate of his that, on the basis of his experience in Victoria, this man is not only fit and yearning to be reappointed but also, in his opinion, the hardest working member on the tribunal in Australia? I do not want to be too hard on Mr Clothier. I can understand his frustration and disappointment. I can understand a person who believes he has done a good job but is not being reappointed feeling bitter about the situation. I can understand it when he says, 'This was a wrong decision in respect of me.' I am not prepared to say that, because of that frustration and disappointment, we should accept a series of accusations against other members of the tribunal with whom he worked. Why did he make these accusations? Because those member- had a political association. That is why I am disappointed. I say frankly, as someone who has spent not an inconsiderable period of my life in the courts and been involved in the legal process, that I would not hang a brown dog on Mr Clothier's evidence. I think I understand him and I feel for him, but I am not prepared to accept and convert some of his assertions into a principle in respect of these appointments. We are not be talking about members of the judiciary. Of course, if a High Court judge, a supreme court judge, a county court judge or someone who is appointed to a judicial office want to hold that office it is appropriate that he resign his politic affiliation. I have no arguments with that. The honourable member for Berowra says that it is a terrible thing to appoint people who might have the same political affiliation as the minister. There are a minority of high court judges who did not have political affiliations.  them one day.",142
332,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"I would have thought that, whatever view members take of Mr Justice Latham, they would still think he is a distinguished judge. When we look at the history of Liberal governments, I do not remember too many state or federal Liberal governments appointing to the bench people who are active members of the Labor Party. I do not remember Labor governments appointing to the High Court or senior court positions people who are active members of the Liberal Party or members of parliament. Let us not get too precious about the way in which senior members of the judiciary are appointed. I believe that all those judges who did have political affiliations-and certainly in the case of the High Court-brought an understanding of the political process and the structures of government to their work which did great credit to them and the judgments they made. We are talking about five-year appointments. We cannot say to someone that, because he has been active in the community, concerned about his community and wants to improve it, he can be appointed. Although my opinions differ from those of members of the opposition, I do not believe one of them genuinely believes that what they stand for will constitute an improvement in our social structures and our society. What we differ about is the way we achieve it. On the basis of the· evidence that came before this committee, I am not prepared to say in relation to the Immigration Review Tribunal that, because a person has a commitment to a political philosophy and to changing society in the hope that he will improve it, in order to take up this five-year appointment which he is qualified for in every respect, he has to abandon his political beliefs and his commitment to the party of his choice. That is a nonsense proposition. At the end of the day, the test we should apply is: did the minister exceed the authority given to him by this parliament? Did he go beyond his jurisdiction? Was he compelled to appoint lawyers? Was he compelled to do the things that Mr Clothier felt he ought to do? The answer to all of those questions is no. If honourable members opposite believe that changes have to be made, then it is a matter for this parliament to decide whether they are made. We should not condemn a mini""ster who chooses to act within the powers that are given to him by this parliament. It was up to the parliament to say that the person had to h-ve a legal background, should not be a member of a political party, a woman of ethnic background or a citizen with that background. The parliament did not say that. Every appointment made by the minister falls within his power. I support the decision of the majority. I believe it is unfortunate that the honourable member for Berowra and some of his colleagues wanted to be in the position not just of judges but of hanging judges with respect to the minister. They found at the end of day that they did not have any evidence upon which to act in that way. They have now confected a minority report which is not based on the evidence. It is based upon preconceived political conditions which I believe do not do the immigration tribunal any service and, at the end of day, could do it some damage.

333,Mr NUGENT,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I have been waiting to speak on this bill for some hours, so it is with some shock that I finally get the call. It is interesting that we are discussing the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 at a time when we have very recently had a major report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues on the child support scheme tabled in the parliament. That report was an examination of the operation and effectiveness of the scheme. I offer my congratulations to the chairman of that committee, the honour the members of his' committee on having done not only a substantial and substantive piece of work, but one that is also really quite out standing. I think this is one of the most difficult and complex areas currently facing our society. The statistics are that something like 30 per cent of the population is currently getting divorced. I understand that by the year 2000 the figure will be nearer 40 per cent. With the majority of marriages producing children, quite clearly issues concerning child support are major to a large number of our community. It is with some regret that I say that I feel that if the minister responsible had been as diligent in his work in this area as the committee was in its report, frankly we could be a lot further down the track of solving some of the problems in this vexed area. Like all members in this place, I get a phenomenal number of complaints about the Child Support Agency. I have been moved on more than one occasion to comment with increasing frustration that I think it is probably the worse government instrumentality invented by anybody anywhere in the world in the history of mankind. Perhaps that is going over the top, but it is not a very effective organisation. It is an interesting sidelight, perhaps, that the one thing a former husband and wife might agree on-they could be having World War III on all sorts of matters-is the incompetence and difficulties of the Child Support Agency. It seems to me that the problems come in two categories. One is with the basic administration-you do not really need a lot of legislation to fix that; we are talking about better management-and the other is problems with the act. That is where I would certainly like to have seen the minister act with somewhat more alacrity than we have seen in the amendments before us today. The sorts of problems I have experienced, as have so many members in this place, are ones of contacting the Child Support Agency in the first place. Whether it is an individual or whether it is my office, you can phone up the Child Support Agency and you can wait. You can hang on and hang on and hang on. If, after 30 or 40 minutes-the phone may have dropped out several times and you have tried yet again-you eventually get somebody who has the decency to answer the phone, they will not give you their name, or they will give you a Christian name and nothing else. I am a member of parliament. I am not going to threaten their safety, but they will not tell me who I am speaking to. If the person I have spoken to on the phone has promised to do something or take some action and I want to follow it up and I go back later on and say that I have spoken to John, Paul, Pete or whoever it is down there, the person at the office says, 'We do not have anyone of that name.' You do not even know who you have been talking to and you cannot get any continuity. Quite often they will answer the phone and just go away and leave it off the hook and not come back. This is not an exaggeration. When my staff said to me in the early days of my being a member that this was the sort of thing happening with the Child Support Agency, frankly I did not believe them. So I started making some of these calls myself. In spite of all the protestations of the government, the agency has not improved in recent times one iota. The second problem we have is with delays in· correspondence. It takes months, quite often, to get correspondence responded to by the Child Support Agency. Then what you get back invariably is inaccurate. It cannot get names, dates or other information right, or it loses documents. People send stuff in and after weeks of not getting any response they phone up and the people at the agency cannot find the documents. Or there may be arbitrary action. Something happens and the first you know is when your pay has been knocked off, or some other action has been taken and nobody has even bothered to tell you it was going to happen. For many clients of the Child Support Agency it is a question of dealing in jargon. People do not understand the technical terms and the phraseology that is used at the different stages of the procedure. Then the privacy argument is used both ways. If you want some information you cannot be told because it is covered under the Privacy Act. But then somebody else is told information they should not have been told and the Privacy Act should have applied but it has not. There are delays in payments and quite frequently the Child Support Agency will not act on information. An example of a problem is the situation of the man having a business of his own where his wages cannot be garnisheed and so on. You are trying to find out where he is or where his business is to get some information. The agency says that it cannot lay its hands on the information or find him. You identify where he is, where his business is or where he is earning his money. You phone up the agency and tell the people there and they refuse to take any action. They say, 'We have not got time. We are too busy. ' Or they say, 'Yes, we'll do it tomorrow,' and three weeks later they still have not done a damn thing. So they do not act on information. It seems to me that all those sorts of istrative problems are issues which are within the administrative competence of the minister and the department. I think, frankly, it is quite an appalling catalogue of irresponsibility that it has not been dealt with appropriately until now. There are problems with the act itself-the way it is written and the particular rules that are applied. I know of one particular case of a man and woman who got divorced. They have three children. He has one of the children and the wife has two. His taxable income, allegedly, was lower than his wife's, although he was getting all sorts of additional benefits and his real income was significantly greater than that of the wife. After having got divorced and having taken one child and two children respectively, they moved to new jobs. One partner relocated. The husband in fact took a nominally lower wage with lots of direct benefits which, of course, do not get counted. The wife took a lower wage. She was still getting, in real terms, less than the former husband. But we look at taxable income going back a couple of years. We cannot look at current income unless it is a drop of more than 15 per_ cent on the former income. Because we take only the taxable income and not all of the other benefits that are piled on the top--payment of mortgage, provision of a car and the paying of all the telephone bills, which come with many jobs and are real benefits to the person receiving those things-we have the ludicrous situation of the husband being able to claim child support maintenance from the wife, even though his income is greater than hers and he has one child and she has two. Frankly, I think it is not only nonsense but also against all forms of natural justice. There are many men in this country who are in a much better organised lobby. Frequently they are the non-custodial parent. Many of those men genuinely suffer hardship as a result of the operations of the Child Support Agency and the maintenance which they have to pay. They are a well organised lobby, and there are many who have genuine hardship cases. Clearly, those issues have to be addressed. Again, from my experience, admin- many more women as the custodial parents suffer far more greatly than many of those non-custodial men. Those women have to get on with it because they do not have the time, money and other resources to go to court and engage lawyers. They have to put food in the mouths of their children. It seems to me, therefore, that people on both sides of the argument are being ill-served. I say at this juncture that I do not think anybody in this House would object to the objectives of the Child Support Agency and what it is trying to do. The objection is about the way it operates. The problems are the way that the rules are written and have to be applied. If you have so many people suffering so much, it is incumbent upon the government to bring forward much more comprehensive legislation than the piece of legislation that we are debating tonight, which only skirts around the edge of the problems in two or three particular areas. One of the problems that have been demonstrated very aptly in the last couple of days when the report of the joint committee was discussed was that we do not have enough meaningful statistics on benefits, money, how much is spent and who gets it. It seems to me that one of the very urgent things that need to be done is to get much better quality information so that we do not have to deal with wild claims and all the emotionalism that tends to go on. We will not get the somewhat sad sights, where the minister stands up in this place and effectively attacks the chairman of his own committee and the chairman feels obliged to have a go at the minister because they cannot agree on the basic numbers. When we get to that stage, we have a fundamental problem of administration in this very place which goes to the heart of the notions of administration and legislation. If we cannot get the basics right here, what hope is there for the man and woman in the street? Clearly, any decisions made by the Child Support Agency must reflect ultimately for the benefit and welfare of the children. It is a question of parents taking responsibility. should be making assessments on the current situation. It is ludicrous to make assessments on income from two years ago. It is ludicrous to make assessments on income that is not the genuine income level at' present. Clearly, we need to have quicker responses. If you have to feed three kids and your income is not very high, you need a response and some support quickly. You cannot afford to wait for months. The CSA has to act upon information that it is given. There needs to be much more transparency in decision making. We need to introduce some case management so that we have some continuity in the handling of cases. We have to make sure that in legislative terms we do not only look at salary and wage earners but also look at those who get the perks and those who run their own businesses. It seems to me that those people who run their own businesses are able to construct a financial portfolio or profile-whatever you want to call it-that enables them to avoid their responsibilities. My own view is that, you do not pay for your children or provide support, you should not have the rights that you want to have in terms of the legalities. Of course there is a need for men who have been divorced and for women who have remarried to be able to rebuild their lives. I think it is often lost on people involved in these arguments, such as the parents of children, that just because people remarry, whatever the circumstances-whether they are marrying somebody with lots of money or not-it does not absolve them from the financial responsibility of their own children. Certainly, I do not think you can just pass it on to the state. I think that has to be made clear in any future legislation. Given that sort of background, what is the government doing? The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 deals with a few peripheral issues. It deals with the subject of presumption of parentage, the child support agreements on Department of Social Security clients, periods of non-enforcement and extension of private payment arrangements. It seems to me that that is skirting around the subject. It does not go to the core of the We issues that need to be addressed. That is why my colleague the honourable member for  earlier today on behalf of the coalition. It states: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) its deleterious handling of the provision of child support maintenance for both custodial and non-custodiaI parents; ,(2) its continued failure to address the significant deficiencies of the operation of the Child Support Agency; (3) its prevarication in taking action to reform child support maintenance in this country to ensure it is fair and equitable to all parties"". The government cannot say that it did not know that the problems existed and that it had some valid reason for not bringing forward legislation. It did not have to wait for this massive tome. It has been there forever. Way back in 1991-92, the Commonwealth Ombudsman listed a number of complaints that if he received. He talked about the communication difficulties, including the CSA's failure to respond to correspondence, the inadequacy of its telephone service, the lack of client focus, recovery of overpayments, imposition of late payment penalties problems, disputes over direct payments made to payees or third parties outside of their collection system, the collection of ongoing child support and the recovery of arrears. He was particularly critical of the communication difficulties that both clients of the CSA and the ombudsman's office had with the CSA. It is not just the man and woman in the street; the people who are used to using the bureaucratic system are the ones that are having problems. The Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law"" Act released a report in November 1992. Although an analysis of the child support scheme was not included in the committee's terms of reference, it felt obliged to comment on the scheme due to the large number of submissions, letters and phone calls it received about aspects of its operation. Then the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues had its famous hotline. One can only guesstimate the number of calls, but we were told that over 150,000 calls were made over a couple of days. That identified a number of issues raised by callers that the government surely should have been much more eager to deal with prior to today. The structure of the scheme and the operation of the formula were the main concerns of non-custodial parents. The standard of service from the CSA was criticised by both custodial and non-custodial parents. The different treatment of stage 1 and stage 2 clients was criticised by both sides of the argument. The committee stated: It is incumbent on the Parliament to recognise that there is considerable dissatisfaction, distress and hardship within the community about the program and the operation of the Child Support Agency. That dissatisfaction cannot be dismissed as merely a disgruntled minority. The committee received over 6,000 submissions by June of this year. That was a record number for a parliamentary committee inquiry. With that welter of evidence over many years, what we have tonight is four little peripheral issues. I want to know why the minister is not doing something a damn sight more substantial about the whole exercise. Now we have got this huge report. The minister can react quickly because, obviously before he had time to read it, he was putting out press releases bucketing the chairman of the committee. The report contains 687 pages, with 163 recommendations. It is an all-party report; there is a minority report, but it really deals with one particular aspect of the matter and generally supports the majority report. The committee has identified a number of things. It talks about the proportion of custodial parents not receiving payments. It talks about the different CSA offices having different administrative procedures. It talks about the CSA's practice of seizing funds without notice and says that this is against the principles of natural justice, and so on and so forth. It also provides a number of major recommendations. It asks that the legislation be rewritten in plain English, that there be a major overhaul of the CSA's operations. It suggests a number of other changes which I have not got time to go into tonight. In conclusion, whilst we do not oppose the bill, we have an amendment to it. I believe that this legislation is only scratching the surface. The big job is still to come, and it is time that the government got on with it. All of us come into politics to try to improve our society. The minister has a major opportunity at this point in the country's history to actually bring in legislation to fix a major problem affecting Australian society, and he is missing his opportunity.

334,Ms HENZELL,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Capricornia) (9.21 p.m.)Like the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), we have been waiting a considerable time to debate the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. I support the bill and, despite the fact that I have a great deal of concern about aspects of the Child Support Agency and would agree, in general terms, with a number of statements made by the member for Aston, I do not believe it is appropriate that we accept the amendment moved by the  typical of the sorts of amendments that the opposition brings into this House that do not forward the cause of legislation and that would be more relevant at another timeperhaps in an MPI or whatever else those opposite want to put forward. So I certainly do not support the general thrust of the amendment by the member for Sturt. I will initially discuss the legislation and then I will turn my attention to aspects of the report of the parHamentary Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues that are very relevant to these discussions and which have been raised by the member for Aston. The first aspect of this bill with which I will deal relates to the presumption of parentage; it extends the basic presumptions of parentage to align them more closely with the Family Law Act of 1975. This bill will provide the following specific changes. It will allow the registrar to be satisfied that a man is a parent of a' child where that child was born to a woman married to that man within 10 months after their marriage has been annulled; or that child was born to a woman who was married to that man, separated from him, resumed cohabitation for not more than three months and separated again; or that child was born within 10 months after cohabitation ended and after the dissolution of their marriage; or that child was born to a woman who cohabited with that man for a period of at least six months, and this period included the time 10 months before the birth. All this sounds amazing and, I am sure, suggests some wildly fluctuating scenarios. But it certainly will assist in the ease with which parentage can be registered and effectively allow custodial parents to claim child support. The second aspect in the bill which I will address relates to child support agreements for Department of Social Security clients. The bill requires that child support agreements entered into by Department of Social Security clients do meet reasonable actions for maintenance provisions under the Social Security Act 1991. As a member of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, it is of some surprise to me that the Department of Social Security has indicated that 80 per cent of agreements registered with the Child Support Agency are for amounts less than formula assessment; that, on average, these agreements are 50 per cent less than formula assessment. I know of very few where that has been tolerated at all. However, it is important that non-custodial parents meet their responsibilities to provide for their children. I am pleased to note from the press release of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) that parents will remain free to negotiate agreements that contain a mixture of periodic, nonperiodic and capitalised maintenance. However, if the custodial parent is receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance, the combined value of cash and non-cash components in the agreement must provide adequate levels of child support. I do not have any argument with that. I will refer to the formula later in my remarks. ' The third aspect of this bill which I will address relates to the enforcement of certain maintenance liabilities for stage I parents. This will enable the registrar to respond to certain changed circumstances of noncustodial parents without requiring the parties to return to the court. This is a very important issue and certainly will go some way to meet the concerns outlined in Senator Belinda Neal's dissenting report. In her dissenting report, Senator Neal stated: I must begin this report by ,stating quite clearly that, even though there are some issues in the Joint Committee report that I cannot agree with, I believe that the majority of the matters raised and the recommendations set out within that report will be of great benefit to the Child Support Scheme and to those whose lives are affected by the operation of the Scheme. It was one of Senator Neal's recommendations that the Child Support Assessment Act 1989 should be extended to all children of separated parents, that is, to bring stage one into the stage two area of the scheme. The joint select committee debated and discussed this issue long and hard but, given that the retrospectivity of such a situation would create massive difficulties-particularly where property settlements were made-the joint select committee could not agree to make what would' be a major and very radical change to the scheme. However, while the member for Aston may feel that these changes are peripheral, r believe that this issue will allow for real benefit to stage one parties to avoid the cost and difficulty of returning to court to get some changes to their obligations, and it particularly refers to two areas. When a non-custodial parent's income is not more than the maximum rate of single pension and that person is in receipt of an income tested pension, benefit or allowance, in practice this will usually be when the noncustodial parent is unemployed or unable to be employed through, for example, a serious illness and, secondly, when the child has left the ongoing care of the custodial parent. This is going to be very important because it will allow the registrar to make a decision that the child support does not have to be collected without the court making a determination. However, it does not mean that, if those circumstances change, either party will not be able to go back to court. I believe this is an example of the minister being prepared to be flexible in an ongoing way to make changes to the scheme. Even the joint select committee would not expect that the Assistant Treasurer would be able to bring in a bill that would entirely respond to all the 163 recommendations in the committee's report two or three days after it has been tabled in the House. So I believe this is a matter that will meet at least one of Senator Neal's concerns. The fourth area of the bill presently before us relates to the extension of private payment arrangements and will allow Department of Social Security clients who have been receiving payments via the Child Support Agency to enter into private arrangements. This is a very important amendment to the main Child Support Agency bills because under current arrangements when a custodial parent applies to Social Security for income support he or she must decide whether to have the noncustodial parent pay privately or whether to have the Child Support Agency collect the money. Once the custodial parent decides, for instance, to have the Child Support Agency undertake the collection, there is no future possibility of a change of mind. Certainly in many cases in the early stages once a marriage has broken down there is a huge amount of trauma and conflict between the parents. Very often the custodial parent, as they are still called, sees the Child Support Agency in a sense as a haven and a refuge so they will not have to deal directly with the non-custodial parent and they will avoid the kinds of difficulties they fear. So they op- for a collection through the CSA. Ultimately this can become onerous to both the custodial and the non-custodial parent and many custodial parents later find that payment would be faster if their former partners were allowed to pay directly. Certainly non-custodial parents complain that their privacy is invaded by having their employer deduct child support when they are quite willing and able and prepared to pay. It also creates a fair deal of aggravation for non-custodial parents who feel not only that in regard to many of their rights as noncustodial parents to have access to their children and be involved in their children's welfare many difficulties are put in their path, but that also once again a bureaucratic government agency is imposing on their parental responsibilities. I believe that this amendment will make a considerable difference in this area and goes to the heart of one of the numerous recommendations in our report. I refer to paragraph 153 of our report: The joint committee considers that a large pf0portion of those parents who voluntarily pay child support to the Child Support Agency on time could be safely moved off CSA collection. This could be achieved by giving the Child Support Registrar the discretion to substitute private collection for CSA collection where a reliable parent has established a reliable voluntary payment record of six months. However, there will be some special cases, such as those involving duress or domestic violence, where private collection will not be appropriate. The joint committee considers that in order to encourage private collection and minimise the CSA's collection costs, the Child Support Registrar should ordinarily exercise his discretion to substitute private collections for CSA collection except where the special circumstances of the case require. I note that we have not been gender nonspecific here. I will have to raise that with the chair. We have obviously missed that one in our many long discussions on this report. Recommendation 69 states the following: The joint committee recommends that the child support legislation be amended to give the Child Support Registrar the discretion to substitute private collection for Child Support Agency collection where a reliable parent has established a reliable voluntary payment record of six months. Recommendation 70 states: The joint committee recommends that the Child Support Registrar's discretion to substitute private collection for Child Support Agency collection be ordinarily exercised in favour of private collection except where the special circumstances of the case require otherwise.' Here is an example, I am delighted to say, of where the Assistant Treasurer has picked up on evidence given to the committee over a period of 18 months and responded to it. We feel that where we can move as many collections as possible out of the system for the Child Support Agency it will free up the system so that the agency can then concentrate on the difficult areas and the areas that were referred to by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). So here is an example of where the minister concerned has.responded to the joint select committee. I hope this will be not be the only area where the minister picks up on our recommendations. I would like to move from specific discussion of the bill at hand to the reform package that we have tabled and the report that the  our committee, tabled in the House on Monday. In the report that we have tabled it was a challenge for the committee to bring a balance between the issues of justice and equity for the families of both custodial and non-custodial parents, betwe-n the children of first and subsequent families and between parents and taxpayers generally. The balance points are complex in both social and economic terms and are affected by the interaction of the taxation, social security, family law and child support systems. I believe the committee's 163 recommendations provide the basis of a powerful reform package. Therefore, with other members of the committee, I feel somewhat disappointed at the early response from the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) because I do not believe they have had a chance to look at the recommendations as a package. I am sure every member of the joint select committee hopes that, irrespective of the early criticisms that have been made of our recommendations, the ministers will have another and a longer look. This has been an all-party committee of both houses of the parliament. Speaking as one member who put a lot of effort into the public hearings, I do not believe that the 6,000-odd people who put in submissions, many of whom travelled long distances to personally attend public hearings, are just a disgruntled minority. It was very easy to pick up on the disgruntled few, particularly noncustodial parents who wanted to continue the fight and the war with their ex-partners and who were using the child support arrangements to do it. I believe we were able to clarify those difficulties. Certainly the ministers have not picked up on the substantial number of suggestions we have put forward in terms of those non-custodial parents who are self-employed. I refer to our recommendations in this regard. We said in paragraph 265 of our report: The submissions received by the joint committee in respect of the current child support income base generally complained that self-employed noncustodial parents can easily avoid child support obligations. The CSA was not able to advise the joint committee of the actual number of selfemployed parents, that is, parents in receipt of business or investment income under the scheme. Nor was the CSA able to indicate the overall extent to which these parents are avoiding or minimising their, child support liabilities. The joint committee considers that the CSA should undertake research to identify the precise number of parents under the scheme who receive income from business structures and the extent of the child support minimisation by these parents. Only then will the CSA be in a position to develop strategies which can efficiently respond to child support minimisation by parents who receive business and investment income. We made a range of recommendations about self-employed parents because they are the group about whom many custodial parents have complained long and hard, not only to every member of this House, but also to the committee, because those parents must meet their child support obligations. Where we have suggested changes to the formula they have been quite marginal. We have not walked away from the core responsibilities with which we agree with the Minister for Social Security and the Assistant Treasurer. (Quorum formed) (Time expired)",147
335,Mr SLIPPER,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I would like to thank my colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) for making sure that members all came into listen to the pearls of wisdom I have for them tonight. Look at them running away from the truth yet again. Tonight we are discussing the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which is a very important bill. As my colleague the honourable member for Sturt  the amendments to the bill. It is interesting to note that the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues recently handed down its report. Once the government has digested that report and once it has sorted out the very many arguments will emanate from that report, we may well see further ;unending legislation in the House in this subject area and we will be back to debate it yet again. I also support the ment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Sturt which states: . That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, House condemns the Government for: (1) its deleterious handling of the provision child support maintenance for both custodial and non---custodial parents; (2) its continued failure to address the signifiHow cant deficiencies of the operation Child Support Agency; (3) its prevarication in taking action to child support maintenance in this country ensure it is fair and equitable to all parties"". The amendments the government is proposing to introduce into this House will not opposed by the opposition, Indeed, those amendments were outlined by my colleague absolute disgrace. the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) when he spoke just a little while ago. We ought to appreciate that the amendments are too little too late and are, in fact, cosmetic changes to a government agency which is undoubtedly one of the most desanyone pised bureaucracies in Australia today. Although the joint committee says that the child support scheme has been a qualified success, the simple fact is I receive hundreds of complaints every year from constituents relation to the Child Support Agency and I know my colleague and good friend the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) confidence. also receives hundreds of complaints. I challenge any member in this place to say that Child Support Agency is not one of the major areas of difficulty for the people of Australia. The fact that so many people complain and indicates that the Child Support Agency is in a total state of disarray. When this committee called for submissions, over 6,000 submission were receiveda record, I understand, for submissions to a has government committee. The committee also had a phone-in and.J50,000 Australians found it necessary to express their concerns in that relation to the- . Child Support Agency. I commend that.. committee on taking into account the consideration of so many of our fellow citizens. Clearly, when you l()ok at the amendreport handed down, you see it is widely accepted that there is a very larg- number of problems in this area. Amongst the recommendations of the report is the recognition that a significant proportion the of custodial parents are not receiving payments and $481.5 million is actually owed to of the CSA. It takes an average of 142 days, 20 weeks, from the start of liability for custodians to receive the first child support payment. on earth can that be justified in. this day of the and age? We also find that different CSA officers have followed different administrative reform procedures. Can you believe this in 1994? to The Child Support Agency's practice of seizing funds without notice is against the principles of natural justice. CSA staff do not be understand privacy arrangements and have disclosed personal information. That is an CSA staff have refused to give reasons for decisions, have been rude and unhelpful, have made personal judgments about clients and only comments like, 'You'd be better off on the dole.' What absolute contempt. I do not think in this House would endorse those kinds of sentiments being expressed towards people who are going through a very difficult period in their life. The CSA has not automatically provided clients with information on in their rights and obligations under the child support legislation. The system for reviewing decisions causes uncertainty and a lack of There was a total of 163 recommendations. the We notice that the government is already squabbling over what it is going to do in relation to this report. I hope the government the ministers look seriously at this report and take into account some of the matters raised. The joint committee report is not the only damning indictment which exists on the record of the Child Support Agency. The recently released ombudsman's annual report has shown that the Child Support Agency is generating a disproportionate amount of complaints. This report lists the top three sources of complaints to the ombudsman as: Social Security with 3,403 cases; the Child Support Agency with 2,452 cases; and Telecom with 2,361 cases. This might look fine on the surface, but one ought to appreciate that Social Security has about five million clients-an indictment in itself, given the extent of problems in Australia today-and that Telecom has 8.5 million subscribers, while at the moment the Child Support Agency has fewer than 300,000 active cases. A close analysis of these figures shows that one in every 100 people dealing with the CSA has felt obliged to tum to the ombudsman to solve problems. This number has increased by 13 per cent in just 12 months. If one in 100 goes to the ombudsman, then many others seek redress in other ways. Given the hundreds of complaints that I receive and the hundreds of complaints that every one of the other 146 members of this House receive, it is pretty clear that there is a monumental problem with the Child Support Agency. Although sadly divorces today are becoming more common, the breakdown of marriage is a time of hardship and emotional trauma for all those involved. The large number of divorces in this country should make us appreciate that government bodies, when dealing with people going through this difficult time in their lives, ought to treat them kindly and in a very humane manner. It is therefore very personally upsetting to me to hear of so many complaints about the Child Support Agency from people who are normally suffering enough stress from the trauma associated with their marriage breakdowns. The added stress associated with the CSA is beyond the pale. The people who come to see me and sometimes bring files of their dealings . with the Child Support Agency' which are six inches thick. The inefficiency, the bureaucracy and the monumental contempt the Child Support Agency shows to ordinary Australians has meant that an ever-increasing number of our citizens have their dealings with the Child Support Agency as virtually the dominant factor in their lives. They worry about the Child Support Agency and, in effect, they find that it tends to prevent their getting on with their lives and putting ,their lives together. As was noted in the joint committee report, a major problem with the present system is the variation of administration procedures among CSA offices and the failure of those offices to enforce orders made by the Family Court. There. must be something dramatically wrong with an operation which no-one is .pleased with. Custodial parents feel that they are treated with contempt, that they are spoken down to, that their problems are ignored, that their legal rights are overlooked. Non-custodial parents feel that they are being hounded, persecuted and victimised. You will find that anyone who has dealings with the Child Support Agency, in effect, makes a complaint. Many couples whose marriages break down try, ,for the sake of the children, to maintain some kind of ongoing sensible relationship so that they are able to help bring their children up together. They might' not be living together, but they are prepared to work together to make sure that their children get the best possible upbringing. I have had quite a large number of those people come to me and say that any residual relationship that existed between them has been exploded by the Child Support Agency. I would like to outline one particular case where the wife was absolutely desperate; she was destitute. She was not receiving the child support that she was supposed to receive, so she contacted the Child Support Agency-not once, not twice, but 25 times. She never got a phone call back. She never got a letter. The Child Support Agency finally spoke to. her and said, 'Your ex-husband hasn't paid the money.' I will not use the term that she used tp describe· her: husband; it would not be parliamentary. But, obviously, from that moment on she did not trust him. The ex-husband came to see me afterwards and said, 'Look, these are the receipts.' The agency had taken $7,000 away from him by way of child support payments and somehow lost that money in the system. He paid it; the Child Support Agency got it and somewhere lost it within the labyrinth of the agency's offices throughout Australia and it did not emerge out the other end. On the one hand, you had a woman who was destitute. On the other hand, you had a father, in this case, who had made the payments and the Child Support Agency was sitting on the money. There is something basically, radically and totally wrong with any government institution that can operate in such a way. People tell me that they get three and four letters in the space of two or three days from the Child Support Agency. I can tell from the way you are nodding, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the problems I am outlining are the sorts of problems that you know of through your electorate office as well. A person opens the mail and gets a letter from the Child Support Agency which says that a certain amount has been paid or that a certain amount is owing. The next day the postman delivers another letter setting out that different moneys are owing or that different moneys have been paid. Forms are issued and posted to clients which are absolute gobbledegook. You find that there are miscellaneous debits and credits that can never be tracked through the system. People ring the Child Support Agency and receive no reasonable response. The plight of second families has not been adequately addressed. I agree with colleagues on both sides of the chamber who have said that, even when a marriage breaks down, it is very important that ongoing responsibilities are met and that, if a person has fathered or mothered a child, then that child is entitled support whether or not the father or mother has entered into another relationship or has married. But I have had numerous complaints telling me that when children are born into a second marriage there is not enough money left to maintain the second family in any reasonable way. I think that has to be looked at. A constituent recently contacted my office and advised me that she had received a communication from the Child Support Agency outlining that she was obliged to forward documents, such as bank statements, to the agency at the request of her husband, who had enacted review procedures. I will call this lady Mrs X for the reasons of confidentiality. I do not want her to be persecuted further by the Child Support Agency. She already has been. If I mentioned her name here, then the Child Support Agency would probably be on her doorstep persecuting her and treating her with even greater contempt than it has already. Before complying with the order, she understandably sought legal advice and was told by her solicitor that there was no obligation for her to comply with the order unless her income was over $38,000. Her solicitor then went on to say, 'But if you want to win, you have to abide by the Child Support Agency's own rules.' Can you believe that? This body is running amuck, treating people with contempt, writing its own rules and, in effect, tearing up the common law of this country, which ought to govern the actions of all of us. It is through these inconsistencies and this kind of approach that people have come to the view that the Child Support Agency is flawed and full of grave injustices and uncertainties. Many other sentiments about the Child Support Agency have been expressed to me. I can honestly say that I have not had one person come to me and say that the Child Support Agency has done the right thing. I have had another instance where someone said that it took 18 weeks from the time the money was deducted from her husband's income until she received it. In 1994, almost 1995, how can one justify that it would take to 18 weeks from the time it was taken out of the pay until it was received by the custodial parent? At the very least, one has to say that there is gross inefficiency. The Child Support Agency has failed to enforce maintenance payments of supporting parents who had absconded, defaulted or were incapable of meeting the financial commitments set by the agency. The fact is that a lack of consistency in the CSA enforcement procedures for maintenance payments has meant that in some cases tens of thousands of dollars have been spent on obtaining court orders which, to quote one of my constituents, once obtained were 'not worth the paper it was written on'. In this particular case, the lady was told that, despite the fact she had spent $18,000 in court costs to obtain a number of court orders, she could not use them. It is not surprising, therefore, that the committee report found that a significant proportion of custodial parents were not receiving payments and that $481.5 million is owed to the CSA. Further, the CSA's failure to make effective use of the full range of its enforcement powers and the inconsistency in its approach to the use of these powers was also noted by the joint committee. I note from the report that the Family Court of Australia has submitted that there was, a need for the CSA to provide more training to staff in the use of the court system in Australia and to establish consistent criteria so that appropriate enforcement action is taken in each case. From the letters I have received, this training is clearly overdue. However, that training will not make up for the endless hours of hardship which thousands of people have encountered as a result of the fundamental flaws in the current system. Another complaint I received was from a person who paid some $4,500 to his wife and family in excess of his obligations under the child support arrangements. But, because he had retrospectively made that payment, the Child Support Agency refused to accept that the money had indeed been paid, with the result that the agency was hounding him for an amount which of course he no longer had. That constituent said, 'I've no objection to paying for the support of my children,but these back payments are totally unjust.' I have received numerous complaints from people who have been treated inadequately by the Child Support Agency. A few months ago I received such a complaint from a constituent in the electorate of Fisher. The agency has made mistakes in assessing the amounts of child support payable by many parents and, consequently, these people have had to reorganise their own budgets. Some parents have found that they have had to pay more than was originally instructed by tl)e Child Support Agency.' This ,bureaucratic bungle ought not to have happened; people ought to be entitled to plan their affairs in accordance with the information given to them by the Child Support Agency. As I have said, we have a situation where the government has now brought into the parliament a bill which includes a few fiddling amendments. I think it has been descri,bed as 'too little, too late' . It certainly is an inadequate bill. It is a bill that has come in at about the same time as the report has been handed down-the report, which is a damning report with 163 recommendations. The government I think would have been well advised to possibly take on board the terms of that report and then to have brought in a consolidated bill which would have dealt with all of the changes that are required in the area of child support. It is interesting, however-and I mentioned this briefly earlier-that a full-scale brawl has now broken out between the chairman, the  and two ministers over the committee's report on the Child Support Agency. These ministers have savaged the report. I think it is disgusting that they have savaged a report on the instructions of their departments, when that report really was produced as a result of over 6,000 written submissions and some 150,000 phone calls. So these concerns of people right across Australia have been wiped away by these two ministers who have backed up their department and who are, in effect, defending the indefensible. I think that is appalling. I certainly hope that the chairman, the honourable member for Chifley, is able to take this matter on board with a view to rolling these ministers so that we can have the changes to the Child Support Agency which are much needed. In conclusion, it is pretty clear that the Child Support Agency is an organisation which pleases no-one. Custodial parents are unhappy; non-custodial parents are unhappy. Gross bureaucratic bungles appear to occur by the day. In fact, the Child Support Agency is destroying the lives of an increasing number of Australians. Quite frankly, I think the government ought to be condemned, in effect, for not bringing in the major changes necessary. The Child Support Agency is a rotten agency-it is rotten to the core. It is important that people look after and maintain their children. But we ought to have a system which is fair, reasonable and equitable, a system that treats ordinary citizens as though they are human beings.  to speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. Firstly, I thank all honourable members who have spoken so kindly of the work of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues in its tabling of its recent report into the child support scheme. I suppose we should go back a little time in history to when the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) first announced this proposed change to legislation. I found it ironic that the media were contacting me and saying, 'Isn't it dreadful that the minister seems to be preempting the committee? Aren't you offended? Haven't you got something to say?' Of course, I did have something to say. I had to say that I was very pleased that the Assistant Treasurer was announcing these changes, and that, no, I did not see him as pre-empting the report but that I felt this to be the first instalment of changes that would be received by clients of the agency. So I feel it is a little ironic that we have an opposition amendment which is very critical of the government and the Assistant Treasurer for not going further, particularly given that at the time he said-and I thank him for this-he was awaiting the report of the committee before making any further changes. So the opposition amendment is critical of the government for not going further. However, at the time these changes were announced, people, particularly commentators in the media who were following child support, felt they were pre-empting the report. I understand that the role of oppositions in this House is difficult, although generally members on both sides of the House seem to see the issues very much in a bipartisan way. However, I would say genuinely to all members of the House that, rather than going through the entrails of the past, I think what is really important is that we form a view about the recommendations. I welcome all members in this House, both from this, the government, side and that of the opposition, seeking to work constructively to persuade the ministers of the importance of introducing this reform package. I think that is very important. I understand where the amendment is coming from, but I am not particularly anXIous to support it. This issue is unfortunate in a way because I believe that the whole child support area has been treated very much in a bipartisan· way by the overwhelming majority of members of this House. It has shown that, when important issues start to bite, the best is brought out in all members and senators. It has been suggested by a couple of members that there is a sort of war breaking out between the ministers and me. That is not true. But I have said"":"":""and'r am not ashamed to repeat it-I am disappointed at their initial reaction. However, that is not the main game. The main game is what they will do with the 163 recommendations, not their knee-jerk reaction to one or two. I am a long-term player in this game, so that does not phase me. I do feel that I need to correct something I have said in this House, and this is the first available opportunity I have had to do soand I apologise to the House. Firstly, the committee in its report suggested that default assessments were not being included in the collection rate. We were absolutely correct in that assertion-right up until 1 July this year. I regret. to say that I and the other members of the committee were totally unaware that that had changed. I do not recall the minister advising the House of it; I do not recall a press release; in fact, I do not even recall the CSA informing the public of it. I think that is the reason for that new figure of 68 per cent, because it reflects this change. I do not really think the minister has pinged me on that at all, but it does appear that we were in error about private collections being included. In fact, my understanding at this point is that they are not included. But that does highlight, I think, that you can spend vast amounts of time with there still being great confusion about different figures of debt. As the Auditor-General was critical of that issue, I would join constructively in that. I am aware that the agency is conscious of it, and I am sure it is going to do something constructive about it. I was wrong in that, and I have always found in life that you are better squaring off and saying you are wrong. Of all the other criticisms the ministers have made, I have to say that I got four out of five and they got one out of five. I would have thought that is not a bad batting average. I have never thought the important thing about the collection rate was the actual percentage at the moment-whether it is what we say it is, whether it is 68 per cent ,Or whether it is 75 per cent. To me that was never the critical issue, and if you read the report you will see that. The critical issue is the fact that it is not in the high 90s. That what the committee has been most concerned about and is what we need to focus our attention on. While I am in that vein, I congratulate Michael Carmody on his press statement about the report. CSA accepts the challenge, which, I have to say, comes as no surprise to me at all. As I have said a number of times in this place, and to groups I have addressed and to a lot of the media, CSA is already on the reform path. It has bitten the reform and, if I can use another cliche, is on the reform escalator. That is good news. I do not think it can get off, which is also good news. The committee has set very high standards for the CSA which will be very challenging. I am sure the CSA will relish the exercise of trying to meet those very high standards. There are a couple of criticisms in the ministerial press release I want to go over again because, I regret to say, they are being repeated. The first is the criticism that noncustodial parents earning over $65,500 a year would benefit most. I really find it very disappointing that the Department of Social Security is running with this line. It knows very well that the original proposal was that it would be set at that level and that the figure of 2Yz times average weekly earnings was set by the ministerial committee only because of a concern about custodial parents having to apply to the Family Court for a departure. Now that they no longer have to apply, because of early initiatives to introduce child support review offices, it is absolutely scandalous that the department would peddle the line that returning to the original designs of the scheme, which it had fully endorsed and advised ministers on, would somehow be a dreadful mistake and that the committee is erring and singling out non-custodial parents to benefit most. I am very disappointed, as is the committee. Referring to further modifications in the formula, the majority of custodial parents and their children would achieve less assistance. Why can people not look at the enforcement side, which clearly will mean that many custodial parents and their children who is currently receive not one dollar will receive some money. Why can they not pick on the fact that the committee took the principle that even where people are unemployed that is not a terminating event and not an abrogation of responsibility. Even though the amount is modest, they would be paying a minimum of $260 a year. I admit that it is not much assistance to custodial parents and their children, but this is a whole new group of custodial parents and children who would bullet benefit from the recommendations. I think that is a knee-jerk reaction. Again, by these formula modifications, there will be a perception of greater fairness and equity in the scheme, which a lot of people feel is not there now. Apart from all the enforcement procedures we are recommending, I believe there will be a greater level of voluntary compliance, again with custodial parents and their children benefiting. It was not mentioned in the ministerial statement but it was mentioned on radio that somehow we have created a huge work disincentive by dropping that disregarded income level for custodial parents from $34,000 down to $19,000. Therecan be work disincentives on both sides of the equation, both for custodial parents and for non-custodial parents. If we are going to be genuine, and as the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) reminds me, we ought not to be gender specific but we ought to rail against disincentives wherever they occur. The most mischievous point about that is that 91 per cent of all custodial parents currently in the scheme are absolutely unaffected by the change; only nine per - ent are affected by the change. It is very mischievous of people to try to highlight that as some vicious attempt to create work disincentive hurdles for custodial parents. I emphasise that this is a package. All members of this House, on both sides of politics, have a job in front of them if they want to see these recommendations implemented. I certainly am looking forward to a dispassionate, calm and, hopefully, rational consideration by the ministers. Should they so desire, I look forward to working through the report recommendations with them and telling them where the committee was coming from. I want to do something a little personal. Family law was completely new to me when I became chairman of the committee. It has been a difficult area for me. As soon as it became public knowledge that we had this child support reference, a person in my electorate-whom I am going to call Alice, which is not her real name-was in a second family situation. It was her second marriage and it was his second marriage. She rang me from the club and was very excited about it. She was an office holder of one of the organisations. Alice asked me if she could come and talk to me about the report to try to gain my views on it and I said that of course she could. I must say that Alice was always very supportive during the inquiry. I am sad to say that the report came out and Alice's husband committed suicide. I suppose one of the most stressful things during the report was that I had alluded to the fact that non-custodial parents were suiciding. Quite a bit of pressure was put on me because it was said that I was undermining the credibility of the scheme and that, as a result of my comments, non-custodial parents would refuse to pay. I am sad again to report a situation in Darwin. We actually did not have anecdotal evidence of a suicide. We had the de facto partner of someone. The child support scheme is not the sole reason, but it constitutes a significant reason why, I regret to say, some people have contemplated and committed suicide. I am very sorry for Alice and her husband that this occurred. If I could dedicate the report to anyone, I would dedicate it to Alice. I sincerely hope that she has an opportunityI know she will-to read the report. I hope she will see that there is a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for a lot of people who have thought they were in a hole, were desperate and had nowhere to go. I have said to the House previously that we had an inquiry into the funding and administration of the Family Court, and we will get stuck into that in the new year. I am pleased to say that we have the full support of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). He has been urging us on for some time. I say to members of this House that I think it is unfortunate that in the International Year of the Family we do not have a reference that looks at the community sector and what can be done not at the collateral end of relationships, as the previous committee inquiry did and as this inquiry did, but to strengthen families and relationships. I am profoundly of the view that there is a lot we can do to change community attitudes and to provide access to services. I am not saying that we will save every relationship or every marriage, but at least we will save some, particularly in the longer term. For every one that we save, that is great. At least we made the effort. As I said, the committee does not have that reference. I think it is really sad that on the second last day of this sitting in the International Year of the Family we do not have that reference. If it were possible to get the reference, I certainly would welcome it. I could assure you that the members of the committee would make a first-class job of it.",150
336,Mr KATTER,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I have been in this place for about 18 months and that is the first time. I have heard a speech made with Some passion. It clearly indicated that the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) really felt some of the pain of the people who were coming to him. I want to pay a very great tribute to the previous speaker, the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. He has tried very hard and shown great courage. It is extremely rare for members of the government and, I regret to say, the opposition to stand against the front-bench, in spite of the fact that the front-bench makes some dreadful mistakes, as it has in the case of this legislation. I intend to be very specific this evening. I believe that, if you are going to make a case, you should make it with the hardest of evidence possible ..On each occasion that I have mlldeclaims in this place I have been proved exactly correct on every detail. .Once again,this evening I have the hardest of hard evidence. I have in my hand a pay slip which indicates that. this particular employee works in the surface workshops department. The. pay slip is dated the fortnight ended 4 September 1994. The employer is Mount Isa Mines Limited and Mount Isa Mines Operations. I have whited out the name and pay number of the employee. His classification is a diesel fitter. His income tax payable for the fortnight to which this pay slip refers is $301. His child support payment is $267. His phone calls are $4. His superannuation is $37. His guard set-whatever that isis 50c. His National Mutual deductions are $32. His MEWU fees-that is, his union dues-are $8. His ambulance payment is $2.60. The rest of his pay-$240-goes into his savings account with the Queensland Country Credit Union. His income for that fortnight was $1,266, quite a reasonable income. His total deductions were $893. That left him with a disposable income of $613 for the fortnight, which is $307 - a week. He has health fund payments-his medical benefits, if you like-of $17, and that covers his kids as well as himself. He has tried to keep them going because he wants to look after his kids and see that they have medical benefits available to them. His wife shot through and went to live on the coast at Maryborough, Hervey Bay or the Sunshine Coast-some place like that-which is about 1,600 road kilometres from Mount Isa. If he sees his kids twice a year, he has to save $54 a week in order to go down there, stay there and come back. That is a pretty reasonable figure. Like most people who have come into my office, and I suspect everybody's office, he has legal debts hanging over from his divorce. He is paying $44 on a weekly basis because he borrowed money to pay the legal debts. So those three deductions-travel to see his children, repayments of his legal debts for the divorce and his health fund payments-total $115 a week. That leaves him with $182 a week to live off in Mount Isa. He has to get to work. There is no commuter transportation system in Mount Isa. The ground temperature reaches close to 200 degrees fahrenheit in Mount Isa in midsummer. It is pretty hard to walk to work because the mine is some distance from the town. The best he could do was a second hand motor scooter, but that still costs him about $35 a week in costs. His rent is $85 a week. That leaves him with the princely sum of $62 a week for food, clothing, razor blades, soap, medication and letters and phone calls to the kids. How you can possibly live and stay alive on $62 a week is incredible to me. This is an ordinary, typical case. We have some 30-odd cases that are almost identical to this on our books in our offices in Innisfail and Mount Isa. What is not typical is a bad case. It is an ordinary case when the bloke is trying to live off $182 a week. I would assume that other people have cases of an extraordinary nature. Once again I tum to a pay slip. I have two of them, but I will read only one of them out to the House. It is from the Queensland Railways. Every fortnight the person pays $235 in income tax; $28 for his quarters-we will include that in his income-$200 to his bank, the Queensland Credit Union; $74 to his medical benefits fund; $45 to his Queensland government superannuation, which is compulsory at his workplace; $1.50 to the QRI; $488 in child support payments; $6 to the Australian Railways Union; and $43 to National Mutual Life, which is also part of his income. That creates for him an income of $1,127 gross a fortnight. After those deductions, we find him left with $116 a week. He also has to repay a legal debt for a divorce, which is $54 a week. So that leaves this person $62 a week to live off. In this case, he has to pay for accommodation, food, clothing, razor blades, soap and medication. He has $62 a week to do this. It creates some difficulties for me, as a rational person, to get a letter back from the head of the department after I had discussed the matter with her in great detail. I hope and pray that she was not really a party to the letter. The letter says the department sees nothing in the cases I raised that would lead it to believe that there should be any change in the legislation. In other words, the department thinks that it is quite acceptable for a person to try to stay alive on $62 a week. Let me bring the message home. It is horrific that a government department would accept that it is quite acceptable that a person should be asked to live off $62 a week. In this case, the wife shot through. I am told she has qUlte a good job as a law clerk. She is on some $20,000-plus a year. Her husband is a practising lawyer with a reasonable sort of firm'in a provincial town. Presumably, he is on some $45,000 a year. So that is $65,000 a year. Then they get another $12,000 off this poor beggar who is left to live on $62 a week. This woman who shot through on her husband and took the kids with her, leaving. this fellow who is totally innocent with no family, is living on a household income of $77,000 a year. Can it be that we live in a society that accepts that a human being in Australia today can live on $62 a week? Can it be that we get a letter from the head of the department stating that there is nothing wrong with the situation? We could even take the average case where a person has to live off $182 a week in a place such as Mount Isa. It may be difficult to live anywhere on $182 a week. There has to be something behind such a situation. It seems to me that we have a policy which is being driven by the feminazis, as the radio commentators call them. It is hard to find any other explanation for what can only be described as vicious oppression of a class of people. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) said earlier this evening in this debate that there had been an extraordinary number of complaints against this operation, both from the ombudsman and those members of this place that take any notice of the people who walk through their doors. The previous speaker, the member for Chiftey and chairman of the committee, spoke about a suicide. We had a case in Mount Isa where a' person had to stay alive on this sort that of money. Members have to understand what is going on in this hl.!man beiIlg's mind. Hiwife has shot through on him and left hitp. This in itself has a shattering effect on any human being. Certainly the people I know who have gone through divorces say that that is the case. To lose your ch.ildren as .well magnifies the psychological problems. that are created by the situation. Then they are left not only with no money now but also no money for the rest of their adult lives. If they have young children, they have to keep paying for the next 15, 17 or 20 years of their lives. Unfortunately, in most of the cases I know of, young children have been involved so these people are looking down the barrel of a gun and this situation prevailing for the next 20 years. They have no money to take girls out and therefore do not have the opportunity to get married again. They have no savings, so they do not have the ability to better or improve their lot. They can hope for nothing better than what they have got. They have no money to be able to undertake courses of study to improve their income and they are deprived of the comfort of their wife and children. We have had three cases of suicide in Mount Isa alone. The last one was a nice young man. He cried with his mates when he told them what was happening to him. He went to his parents house in Cairns, bought some rope, tied it on to a tree in the backyard, stood on a chair, kicked the chair out from under him and died. We can clearly understand this suicide because not only had this man lost everything; he had also been condemned to a life of grinding, unbelievable poverty. I will give the Child Support Agency one thing: it has created an effective situation where people will pay. There is no way a person will get out of paying. Whilst campaigning before I became a member of parliament, one day in one hotel I met two people who were very much inebriated. A young bloke who was with one of them said, 'Just ignore what he is saying. He has been this way for sometime. This is the Child Support Agency thing.' He explained to me that these men had everything taken off them. These men had improved their income and position. If a person is on the dole and has a limited amount of money, they will get rental assistance. A person in Mount Isa will be significantly better off on the dole, so they go on the dole. The people who work at Mount Isa mines are hard working men. A person could not do a hard day's work at a mine unless they were a hard working sort of person. Their lives have been ruined and they have nothing to look forward to. They are not slowly drinking themselves to death but speedily drinking themselves into an early grave. This is being paid for by the taxpayers. This is a great achievement of the Child Support Agency. It says that it sees no evidence that warrants any change in the act even though a person is trying to live off $62 a week. I will outline to the House two other cases that are of interest. One involves a young man who had worked very hard, completed his apprenticeship and had purchased two houses. That is quite a feat at 22 years of age. He had a car that he owed no money on. He was a hard working achiever. He was a good looking fellow who did some male modelling. He was a good style of bloke in every respect. He also went to church. His wife decided one evening that she would go to the disco instead of coming home. Then she decided to do that on a fairly regular basis. For the sake of their son, which this young man loved very much, he endured this situation for some time. Eventually he could endure it no longer. At this stage she was not coming home at all. They split up. When he complained, she walked out taking the baby with her. As a result of the machinations of the court-and that wonderful 'Lionelised' person who was in this place, Mr Lionel Murphythis young man is left with no houses, no car, no child and no wife. He is 22 years of age and the child is one year old. He will be living on the $182 or $62, whichever figure members wish to choose in this case, for the rest of his days-for the next 20 years. This man's life has been shattered and wrecked, not by that woman-though she made a contribution-but by the people in this place who passed this vicious legislation. For a committee inquiry to have 6,900 representations made to it and for the government then to decide to do nothing and for the chairman of the committee to have the temerity to say that some changes need to be publicly assailed by the front bench is a most remarkable situation. It shows how out of step with the Australian people the committee is. After 20 years experience in politics, and coming from a very successful political family, let me say that those opposite will see the greatest devastation and an even bigger landslide thim against Mr Whitlam. There is a level of hatred for this government out there in the community because of the things it has done to the Australian people. If the government sets up a committee and that committee even remotely passes criticism upon the government, then it vilifies that committee. That arrogance will be dealt with by the Australian people. Please, God, let us see that happen at the next election. The previous speaker, the chairman of the family law committee, said, 'Let's do something about keeping marriages together.' Whilst Mr Murphy made it the easiest of things to walk in and out of a marriage, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has gone one step further and made it attractive. He has made it attractive to walk out of a marriage. To cite the other case, I was going on a fairly long journey in a taxi and the driver was talking to me. He said that his son's marriage had broken up. I said, 'You have the old CSA problem, I suppose.' He said that it was worse than that. The son's wife went to work one morning and said, 'I am not happy in my marriage.' In every marriage in the world someone says that, probably once a month. But the girl she was working with said, 'Why are you staying in this marriage?' The wife said, 'I have a kid. I could not afford to get out of the marriage. Apart from any other consideration, who is going to look after the child?' The girl said, 'Haven't you heard of the Child Support Agency?' She explained to the wife how it worked and how much money she would get, and the wife was gone the next day. The very next day she had walked through the door. So whilst Mr Murphy destroyed the institution of marriage in Australia and made it the easiest of things to walk in and out of that arrangement, the Prime Minister has now made it an attraction for young women. I suspect that six or seven of the other cases that have come through my door are similar. There is no solution when you have to keep two households-we have to face up to thatbut if we had compulsory counselling for four months before women were allowed to get this, there would be a different situation. Surely a person can be taxed on disposable income. This person does not have a disposable income even remotely like that amount. He has a disposable income of what is left after a woman, who is no longer his wife or a relative, takes it off him. (Time expired)",158
337,Mr RONALDSON,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I am indebted to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for allowing me to speak in this debate before him tonight. I place on public record the contribution the member for Curtin has made to his electorate over a large number of years. The coalition's amendment to the second reading motion states: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) its deleterious handling of the provision of child support maintenance for both custodial and non-custodial parents; (2) its continued failure to address the signifito. cant deficiencies of the operation of the Child Support Agency; (3) its prevarication in taking action to reform child support maintenance in this country to ensure it is fair and equita1:>le to all parties"". It is about five years since I was given the great honour of representing the electorate of Ballarat. Over that time, there have been a lot of issues facing the constituents of Ballarat, unemployment being not the least of them. There are also the problems of the collapse of small business and of youth unemployment being at such levels that people have been required to move out of the region. These are all matters that have led to very deep hurt for those constituents. There is one issue that I think has totally dominated the issues coming through my office and, I suspect, the offices of members from both sides of the House right throughout this country; that is, the Child Support Act. I say at the outset that the officers who have been handling this-in my local area they are mainly from Geelong-have been suffering under the most extraordinary pressure. I place on record my thanks to them for what they have done for me and for my staff when we have made inquiries. The great tragedy is that the 30 per cent of the constituents who come to see me about the Child Support Act have had to go to their local member of parliament to get any sense out of this piece of legislation. They simply cannot get it from the department because of the pressure its officers are under and the workload they have been required to suffer. They have to go to their local member of parliament to get even basic information. After seeing some of the letters and the responses to the letters I have written on behalf of constituents, I think this is the most extraordinarily bureaucratic piece of legislation I have ever seen-and I do not profess to having seen as much as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), for example, who is here tonight. But it is an extraordinarily difficult piece of legislation. Even getting a three-page response to a letter only adds to the extraordinary level of frustration experienced by those the letter is sent out There is one thing to guarantee a return visit from a constituent: send them a copy of a Child Support Agency letter. I guarantee that it will only double the problems and will leave unanswered as many questions as it originally tried to solve. I have seen parents, both custodial and noncustodial-I do not want to draw a difference between the two tonight because I think that debases them and debases the argument-and I can say that this has led to frustration, anger, tears and, I think, a level of desperation that I am not surprised about, even when I hear the chairman of the family lliw commit tonight about that extraordinarily sad incident. I rather suspect that if it has not happened in other areas of this country it must have gone perilously close to doing so. This has driven sensible people insane. It has driven rational people to a stage of desperation that I do not think could ever properly be tagged. It is all because of a piece of legislation which, I admit, tried to achieve an aim but which has become an absolute nightmare for both custodial and noncustodial parents. I support the comments made about this today by various members from both sides of the House. It would be fair to say that not since the Gulf War debate have I heard such a single voice in this place about a piece of legislation and the appalling effect it has had on constituents from one side of the country to the other. I thank the honourable member for Curtin for allowing me the opportunity to speak and I thank the House.",161
338,Mr ROCHER,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill follows the April 1994 announcements of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and it amends three acts: the Child Support Assessment Act 1989, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and the Social Security Act 1991. The bill itself is split into four parts. brings the presumption of parentage arrangements into line with Family Law Act 1975. Part 2 requires child support agreements where the custodial parent is a recipient of certain social security benefits to take reasonable measures to ensure that proper maintenance is being collected. Part 3 enables the registrar of the agency to choose not to enforce certain stage one cases-that is, if the payer's income is reduced to the level of a maximum single pension rate-or if a child leaves the ongoing care of the custodial parent. Part 4 attempts to make private collection agreements more flexible for payees, and for payees who receive income support from the Department of Social Security. The coalition has no substantive objections to these provisions. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about some aspects of the operation of the child support scheme and its administration by the Child Support Agency within the Australian Taxation Office. The initial intention of the establishment of the agency was to collect court ordered child support, or maintenance as it was known. From 1 October 1989 it has also been collecting child support using an administrative formula for couples who separated after that date. However, since the scheme's commencement on 1 June 1988 it has created an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare of red tape, particularly for many custodial parents and ultimately, of course, for the children whom the scheme was meant to assist in the first place.",162
339,Mr CADMAN,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,Why are you so mild about it?,162
340,Mr ROCHER,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Be patient, my friend. I am sure members on both sides of the House are familiar with many of these problems as a result of the difficulties brought to their attention by constituents. Indeed, we have heard some of their episodes being recited tonight. Members opposite might feel constrained in criticising the operations of what is another addition to the many ugly creatures of this Labor government. I have spoken about the inefficiencies and inequities of this particular monster before. On 13 November 1990, in a Part 1 speech in the House, I pointed out that a common complaint levelled against the Child Support Agency at that time was that of harassment involving people who were content with their own private maintenance arrangements yet were continually being pestered by the agency for their failure to take up the option of having the agency act on their behalf. I also pointed out that such harassment reflects the principal incentive of some people in the welfare bureaucracy to maximise the number of clients they supposedly serve and to increase the extent of their bureaucratic empire. Let me make it perfectly clear: it is certainly desirable in my opinion that the scheme be extended to the extent that it relieves taxpayers of the burden of otherwise unsupported children. However, let me make it just as clear that the scheme should not expand at the expense of pre-existing arrangements that are satisfactory to the parties concerned. I am surprised that it took a report of a committee to find out what we already knew. An extract of what I had to say in 1989 states: . .. the child support scheme has become an imposition on people who want to remain independent of the Government's collection agency ... Women who have told me that they are happy with their arrangements and the payments made by their former spouses have complained that they. are contacted, sometimes repeatedly, by the Agency seeking to act on their behalf . . . People have found that the Child Support Agency can be so officious that the non-custodial parent who once generously provided more than the basic level of maintenance required, when faced with the big stick of enforced payment, is no longer willing to pay more than is required. That was evident in 1989. It has taken this long and a very comprehensive and fine report to get the government's attention. If there is one thing that characterises the Public Service literature on the subject of the child support scheme, it is the desire to extend the scheme to include the maximum number of eligible children, regardless of the consequential administrative 'and financial inefficiencies. Unbelievably, all evidence continues to point to the undeniable fact that, although the agency has been under almost continuous criticism and has been the subject of substantial reviews by the child support evaluation advisory. group, nothing has changed. Hopefully, with the release this week of the report into CSA of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, we might begin to see some change. The report makes it clear that private child support agreements should be the preferred means by which support is made and that the CSkshould be involved only where the noncustodial parent will not pay maintenance, or is obstructionist, or both parents decide that they would prefer the CSA to collect and distribute the agreed support amount. The committee states in its report: ... private collection under the scheme has developed in a different manner from what was originally envisaged. Child support agreementsthat is, private agreementshave not been widely used by parents. Instead, many parents have opted for private collection of a CSA determined liability. The development of the scheme towards this type of private collection has occurred because the scheme has placed certain restrictions on the ability of parents to choose their own arrangements. It is about time this sort of common sense approach is not only spoken of but also acted upon. The government needs to implement recommendations 69 to 72 as promptly as possible just as it needs to consider the other worthwhile recommendations contained in the report. This latest report adds to the growing body of evidence that the CSA has become a bureaucratic nightmare. The Auditor-General's 1993-94 efficiency audit of the management of the Child Support Agency, conducted 'by the Australian National Audit Office, found that the scheme is riddled with serious deficiencies and administrative shortcomings. The major consequence of this is an unsatisfactory standard of service to clients. Specifically, the following serious deficiencies were identified by the ANAO audit. Most of the administrative shortcomings identified in the December 1991 report of the child support evaluation advisory group, chaired by Mr Justice Fogarty; still remain as impediments to efficient service delivery by the scheme. It is unacceptably difficult for CSA clients to contact the agency by telephone. Amen to that. There are excessive delays in dealing with correspondence from clients. Many letters are not answered.",162
341,Mr CADMAN,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,They will never be answered.,163
342,Mr ROCHER,CIDLD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"It appears that way, and that is my experience. Management of debtors is unsatisfactory. Debtors' reporting is inadequate and misleading. Tracing of defaulting debtors is ineffective, ad hoc and inconsistent. Procedures for intercepts of tax refunds due to defaulting debtors and application of late payment penalties are stark examples of the clear lack of consistency and operations between branches. Procedures for corporate planning, performance reporting and monitoring are in need of enhancement and coordination, especially for assessments of first payment performance. There is no clear and specific translation of corporate goals into business unit action plans. Accountability for achievement of objectives is not based on useful and meaningful performance indicators related to program goals. Staff training is not developed on any planned and systematic basis and has little emphasis on client needs, staffing levels, staff utilisation, productivity targets. Work standards are in need of desperate improvements, supported by sound quantified analyses. The audit also recommended that urgent action be taken by the agency to reverse these problems, with a need to shift emphasis within the CSA from problem identification to problem rectification. What is most disgraceful is the fact that the audit report found that, in proportion to actual client numbers, the Ombudsman was receiving more complaints about the CSA than any other Commonwealth agency. The audit report highlights a government agency that is totally incapable of fulfilling its role in a way that does not put clients offside. To get a perspective on the gravity of these inefficiencies which go right to the core of the CSA, one must understand the hardship and difficulties that this bureaucratic nightmare imposes upon the lives of people and families who become involved with it. I will give one particular example of a male constituent. This man's wife walked out on him, leaving him with both his children to look after and a pub to run. His wife later divorced him and was awarded custody of the children. As a result of the court's settlement, he had to sell the pub, abandon his livelihood and get a job. The only job he could find was that of an ASOI with the"" Public Service, which provided him with a salary of $21,000 per annum. Given the hardship and turmoil he had just been through, he was under the impression that things could not get much worse. But along came the CSA. Unbelievably, the Child Support Agency assessed his annual child contribution payments to be $22,000 per annum, even though he had infomied the agency of his current income, which was only $21,000 per annum. Over the following 12-month period, he tried repeatedly to contact the CSA by correspondence, by phone and in person to try to have his contributions recalculated. Finally, after 12 months, he received a positive response, but before this he was continuously told that he was up for the full $22,000. No apology was given for the delay in making a decision, nor was there an apology for the failure to reply to the correspondence. Another example highlighting the inefficiency of the CSA and the absurdity of some of its practices involves a couple who had divorced but were able to come to a private agreement involving the provision of child support and maintenance, whereby the father would contribute as much money as was required under the CSA formula to his exwife for the upbringing of the children. Once again, everything was going fine until the CSA stepped in. After applying for and receiving the sole parent's pension, the exwife was approached by the CSA, which pointed out to the woman that it would be wise for both the security of her and her children for the child maintenance payments to go through the CSA. The CSA stated, no doubt correctly, that this would ensure that, if her ex-husband changed his mind and reneged on his payments, he would still be bound to continue with his contributions. However, once the CSA took control, things started to go horribly wrong. The ex-husband never missed a payment to the CSA, but his ex-wife and his children, whose security the CSA was supposedly meant to be guaranteeing, did not receive any payments from the CSA for two months. The situation became so desperate that the woman could not pay the rent and could not feed herself and her children. Ironically, it was the ex-husband who stepped in and paid money directly to his exwife so that she and the children would not be thrown out onto the street. Unbelievably, that man was still .paying money to the CSA-a government agency which could not even properly manage the simplest and most obvious of its functions. Clearly, the CSA is an example of Labor:s bureaucratic bungling. That bungling IS causing untold emotional damage to many of the CSA's clients and is costing the taxpayer millions of dollars. The extent of this bureaucratic disaster is an absolute disgrace. It cannot be allowed to continue. The fact that the agency is such a disaster is a clear indictment of Labor in government. The government should be condemned for the abdication of its responsibilities to administer and govern in the interests of all, and especially in the interests of the weak. Government members opposite continually claim-and, in my opinion, dishonestly-that Labor is the party representing the common man and that the Australian Labor Party governs in the interests of the working class. Listening to Labor's rhetoric on that subject would lead people to believe that this government is actually looking after the interests of ordinary Australians and their families. In the International Year of the Family, this propaganda could not be more clearly exposed for the farce that it is than by the two examples just described, which are strongly backed up by the previously mentioned findings of the ANAO audit report. Like the ANAO, the coalition believes that the CSA requires more direct involvement at national office level to ensure that sound, consistent and effective procedures are adopted across all CSA branches, with a greater emphasis on client needs and client service. Action plans to deal with problems should be imposed by management, if required, and accountability for implementation should be made clear. This is not to suggest that a devolved means of operation is not appropriate. It simply means that devolution requires strong coordination and review. So, while the amendments provided for in this bill are important and necessary, and will be supported by the coalition, clearly they fail to provide what is needed. The pill that needs to be swallowed to cure the cancer which has spread throughout the CSA and this current Labor government, and to ensure that the CSA becomes an efficient and accessible division of the Australian Taxation Office-or even independent of the ATO-is not an easy one to swallow. However, one thing is certain: it could not be swallowed by this government. One only needs to look at Labor's irresponsible economic and fiscal policy and failing industrial relations policy to realise how incapable this government is when it comes to making the hard decisions and implementing the reform that is required to reverse the current trend of snowballing administrative malaise, bureaucratic red tape and inefficiency. That malaise is evidenced by the history of the CSA. This government is clearly far more interested in pandering to the demands of minority and sectional interest groups and its union mates than it is in addressing the many bureaucratic by-products of its irresponsible and downright wasteful approach to government. The government needs to address the findings of the Auditor-General's report. It needs to address the findings of the recent report on the CSA by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The child support scheme needs a major overhaul, and it needs it now.

343,Mr CADMAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Mitchell) (11.15 p.m.)The report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues which examined the child support legislation is an outstanding report. The crime of the whole affair is that there are two ministers who, in order to defend their reputations, claim that the Child Support Agency has nothing wrong with it and is doing a splendid job. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is an absolute untruth, typical of the untruths told by the Australian Labor Party. Central to those untruths, of course, has been the role of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who is here in the House tonight. He does not appear at question time, but he appears late in the evening, plotting with his friends and wondering whether the CAA is still alive and what sort of inquiry he is going to enter into next in order to bring his collapsing empire back together again. The only thing that is holding his empire together is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). With a friend like the Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport is all right. The Australian Labor Party works on the old mates basis, and it appears that the two ministers, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the minister responsible",166

In order to illustrate some of the flaws within the Child Support Agency, I have brought two cases along, and I know that many other members have done the same thing. They are recent cases. This outfit, run by the Australian Taxation Office, is a criminal miscarriage of justice. I notice that the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues is very critical of the CSA in its opening paragraphs where it says: The frequently quoted collection rate of '73 per cent of amounts registered with us' is used as the key indicator of the CSA's success. However, the Joint Committee is concerned that this collection rate is a poor measure of the CSA's actual performance due to the manner in which it is calculated. The bodgie figures In the outfit are defended by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who ought to be ashamed of himself. He should get out around the traps and see what this outfit does to the lives of people. Let me read the minister a recent illustration from May, and it runs through to the present date. It is addressed to the CSA from one of my constituents and it reads: Following our conversation of this morning, this is to confirm that my ex-husband ... has been sending my monthly maintenance payments on time, regularly and in full since January of this year, and is totally up to date. There has NEVER been unpaid maintenance and therefore no late payment penalty should be applied to him.

Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Watson is the Chief Government Whip and he",168
369,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"And the point of order is? Mr Ruddock-He has a seat at the rear of the chamber, yet he was speaking from the dispatch box. Is he in order to take points of order from the dispatch box?",168
370,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Berowra has raised a valid point of order: .that is, members seeking the call from the chair should be in their appropriate seats.",168
371,Unknown,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,Government members interjecting,169
372,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,If the honourable member for WatsonMr Leo MCLeay-The chief whip can address the House from the dispatch box on matters such as this. You know that. He knows that. We know that. Now get this under a bit of control if you would not mind.,169
373,Unknown,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,Opposition members interjecting,169
374,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,When the House has come to order. I will call the honourable member for Mitchell.,169
375,Mr CADMAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is typical of government members to give advice to the chair, but immediately an opposition member protests against an attitude of the chair they complain.",169
376,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,The honourable member for Mitchell will address the bill before the House.,169
377,Mr CADMAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I was addressing the Child Support Agency factors in this bill and I was saying how hopeless George Gear is. He is hopeless. Mr Leo MCLeay-I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not know for how long this is going to go on but, as you know and I know, and surely the honourable member for Mitchell who has been here for some time and has been trying to address this legislation knows",169
378,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"What is your point of order? Mr Leo MCLeay-The honourable member knows that the minister should be referred to by his title-not by his name or by his electorate or by the number of his motor car, but by his title. I ask you to bring member for Mitchell to order and have him address the House on the bill or resume his seat.",169
379,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I rule on the point of order by pointing out to the honourable member for Watson that I have asked the honourable member for Mitchell to focus his attention on the bill. In fact, I would have called him to order on the matter of his reference to the Assistant Treasurer by his surname had it not been for the honourable member for Watson all but beating me to the dispatch box.",169
380,Mr CADMAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I think that-if I may be excused in this instance for making an explanation-the community in Australia does not need to understand the amorphous 'minister assisting the Treasurer'; it needs to understand that it is a person, what that person represents in this parliament, and that, for two years, he has delayed changes. He is the Assistant Treasurer, the member for Canning, and he has been hopeless in the administration of his portfolio.",169
381,Mr GEAR,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I know that the member for Mitchell has been here for some time, and I know that he really should know who ministers are. I am not the Minister assisting the Treasurer. I would appreciate it if the member for Mitchell, as I call him, were to address me by my proper title. As it is Christmas, I am rather charitable. But, in the end, I can only take so much. He really should refer to members by their titles, and not cast aspersions. If he wants to cast aspersions on my competence, he should move a motion.",169
382,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,Order! The Assistant Treasurer has made what I consider to be aOpposition members-What is your point of order?,169
383,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Order! Frankly, the chamber has reached an absurd situation. All of the points of order being raised are not valid. I noticed that the member for Mitchell made an effort to at least recognise the Assistant Treasurer by title as well as name. The points of order raised by the Assistant Treasurer ought not to have been raised in the the honourable spirit of the debate.",169
384,Mr CADMAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,The Assistant Treasurer invited me to remark on his competence.,169
385,Mr GEAR,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"No, I did not.",169
386,Mr CADMAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"He invited me to do this, and I will follow up on his invitation. Let me give an example. On 19 May, I wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Willis). I expected him to pass the letter on to the Assistant Treasurer, because it was his area. I wrote to the Assistant Treasurer's principal on 19 September. I got an acknowledgment back on 26 September and have not heard a word since. That is the competence that the Assistant Treasurer applies to people in this place. He does not care about what happens to the family. I have an example from another Child Support Agency case. Let me read the facsimile that I received from the Child Support Agency on 15 November, after the case had been going for nearly 10 months and we had thought we had it solved. The Child Support Agency wrote: I am writing to you in regards to the start liability for Christopher ... Whilst case it was discovered that an incorrect start date has been used in relation to the child support liability for Christopher... After 10 months, myriad communications with the Child Support Agency and unanswered letters to the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer-hopeless administrators-I got a Child Support Agency facsimile saying that the start-up date that was being used for all of the calculations was wrong. We had to go back to square one; we have got another 10 months of calculations to begin right now. Hopefully, in 10 months time we will have the correct answer. That is the sort of outfit that the Assistant Treasurer is running. He stands here trying to defend it, claiming that the legislation being debated by the parliament tonight is adequate. It is totally inadequate. He has only to go to the members of his own caucus and his own party, and refer to the excellent report that they presented on the child support scheme, to understand how bigoted, biased and hopeless he has been in trying to get this outfit to do the right thing. I want to conclude by reading the letter that I commenced with. I will just refer to the closing paragraphs. This lady writes: This entire case has been mistakenly instigated SOLELY by your department and totally mismanaged regardless of my previous 6 requests to cease action and is in total disregard to my wishes. I have now requested the assistance of my member of parliament ... in the hope that someone from a 'higher source' is able to stop this bureaucratic nightmare of repeated negligence by the numerous officers of the CSA at all levels. Because of the CSA's total bungling and mismanagement of this case, my exhusband is now threatening me and you with legal action! The date of that communication was May 1994. I have a letter from the Assistant Treasurer dated October 1994. This is a ripper; it is a lulu. I am pleased that the Assistant Treasurer is at this table because, paragraph after paragraph, he goes through and admits the litany of mistakes and bungles that have been made right from the commencement of this case. In every instance, he has admitted the bungles. Mr Speaker, let me date of introduce you to the bungling Assistant reviewing your Treasurer, George Gear.",169
387,Mr SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,Order! I have been watching what has been going on in this place. I think the warnings that have been given by the Deputy Speaker should be heeded.,170
388,Mr CADMAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Most of the CUlprits have left the chamber, thankfully, Mr Speaker. We can now get on with the serious matter of the debate. The reply dated 14 October admits, in explaining what appears to have caused the problem, the registrar said that the agency should have acted immediately on this lady's advice concerning the agreement by accepting this request to withdraw her application for a child support assessment. Unfortunately, the assessment application did not proceed and notices were issued to both parties on 2 May 1994. While it appears this should not have happened, the registrar said that it may have been caused by a possible misunderstanding. The letter goes on page after page. Not one thing in this legislation will rectify this matter. We need to refer to the excellent report brought down by the committee in relation to the child support scheme. The CSA did not accept that 2Y2 times the average weekly earning default assessment or realistic estimates should be reported as outstanding debts. It even refuses to calculate its debts on a reasonable basis. Time and again, the agency flouts reasonable management practice, adopting a practice of its own. Page after page, the Auditor-General's report, the ombudsman's report and this report tell us what the Child Support Agency is doing. I encourage a follow-up in six months time by the· Auditor-General. He should do another job on the agency and keep at it until this mob gets it right.",170
389,Mr GEAR,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,He's doing it; he's doing it right now.,171
390,Mr SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,Order! The Assistant Treasurer will have the chance to wrap up.,171
391,Mr CADMAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"No. It is a helpful interjection; I am pleased to hear it. We should stick at this mob until it gets it right. The Assistant Treasurer does not do his own case any good by the exercise he did on the member for  worked hard and honestly for the best interests of the 6,197 people who presented submissions to the committee. Your abuse of him and of the committee does not do you justice, and I think you would be better off understanding what you are legislating for in the first place, making sure that legislation is straight and then helping the families of Australia. You could hardly call this legislation a fine culmination to the International Year of the Family. You may be proud of it, but there is not a single soul in this parliament, except Minister Baldwin, who agrees with you.",171
392,Mr CAMERON,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I will speak only briefly to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. As far as constituent inquiries go, as we have heard from so many speakers this evening, the Child Support Agency and the broad issue of family disputes are ones that I do not particularly like to deal with. I do not like to deal with this issue simply because it often involves divisiveness in families or former families, allegations about one's former partner and, at the end of it all, the only losers are the kids. They end up with fighting parents making allegations about each other. The welfare of the child or children is often put on the backburner. Sometimes it can cause hatred of one's own children, which I find appalling. I have received numerous calls, as have a lot of other honourable members, both from custodial parents and non-custodial parents seeking assistance in dealing with the CSA. In two cases, I have had a non-custodial parent and that parent's partner contact my office, both calling their ex-partner a liar, both wanting either increased support or lower payments depending on whether they had custody or not, and both offering conflicting details. Who do you believe in such cases? I assume that if we are offered such conflicting information the CSA would experience similar problems. I can therefore understand the difficulties faced by the CSA in dealing with these matters. I respect the privacy of my constituents and therefore I keep their details and the information they provide to me confidential. I presume that all my colleagues do the same. But what does one do when a non-custodial parent threatens to kill the children if an adverse decision is made by the CSA? A constituent actually told one of my staff members that if push came to shove the children would be killed. Another threatened the lives of employees at the CSA, as well as members of this parliament. As I have said, although this legislation is great in theory, the problems extending from its operation have some very serious ramifications. Children, who are not to blame in parental break-ups and custodial disputes, could die because of a decision made against their non-custodial parent. The decision must be made: is the non-custodial parent being overcome by emotion, or are the threats serious? Given that ihis legislation has been enacted for some time now, it is disappointing-but probably understandable-that it has taken so long for amendments to come forward, particularly when the concerns of both custodial and non-custodial parents, which were recently outlined by the member for' Chifley (Mr Price), have been well known for some time. The committee report handed down by the member for Chifley has highlighted the need for many more amendments. The amendments that we are dealing with simply tinker at the edges of the changes that are desperately required. . It is now only a couple of weeks before Christmas, yet these amendment!, were announced eight months ago. I have always had trouble in getting replies to correspondence from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), but for him to take as long with this legislation as he does with his amendments is most disappointing. I want now to comment briefly on the detail of the legislation. I realise that the concerns expressed in my preamble are not dealt with by this legislation, but I hope that they will be addressed by future amendments, particularly as the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which was handed down on Monday, addressed most of my concerns. There are four parts to these amendments, all of which the coalition supports. The first part deals with presumption of parentage, and I have no qualms with that, for it expedites the identification of both paternal and maternal parents. It is intended to make the processing of applications quicker and to ensure that child support is paid sooner. It will also assist non-custodial parents by limiting the arrears bill that could occur if proof of parentage proves hard to determine and takes a long time. The second part deals with custodial parents in receipt of Department of Social Security assistance. It requires them to ensure that they are maximising their support from the noncustodial parent before becoming a burden on the taxpayer. I wholeheartedly support any measure which reduces the burden on the taxpayer and this part will ensure that the non-custodial parent pays a fair share. One thing that really irks me is when parents shirk their responsibilities for the welfare of their offspring by arranging their statements so as to minimise the liability for the non-custodial parent and pass the burden on to the taxpayer via the social security system. I think that this is extremely un-Australian and I am glad that such an amendment is in place to ensure that both parents contribute to the support of their children, according to their capacity to pay. I agree with the comments of the member for Chifley when he said that no group in society should be allowed to avoid or evade its responsibilities to its children. Parents have a duty to their fellow Australians to ensure that they minimise the burden placed on the rest of the community. Therefore, they should take responsibility for the costs of supporting their children before they look to the social security system which, of course, is funded by the Australian taxpayer. I wholeheartedly support part 3. Another constituent of mine, who has had a marked decrease in income, had only one option to vary maintenance and that was through the Family Court. Unfortunately, the costs were prohibitive for the constituent and the CSA could not come to the party with regard to varying the maintenance. That person-a noncustodial parent-ran a small business and was in dire financial straits; the business could have collapsed. Yet there was no way possible for relief in maintenance payments, despite a major fall in the income of the noncustodial parent. That non-custodial parent, whose pride and joy is the child-as is the case with most parents-and who would do anything for the child, also expressed concern about how the maintenance payments paid were spent. The payments of the non-custodial parent were used by the custodial parent for staying in hotels on weekends, for clothes, for restaurant meals and for the custodial parent's partner. It therefore disappoints me no end to read that the committee report, handed down on Monday, did not recommend more accountability by the custodial parent with regard to disbursement of maintenance payments. I think more action needs to be taken in this area so that the child remains and always is the beneficiary of maintenance payments and so that the payments are not wasted by the custodial parent. The final part also has my support. Private payment agreements will enable greater flexibility between parents. I am aware of many parents who are still good friends, despite splitting up. They could have a satisfactory private agreement without the need for the CSA's intervention, thus enabling the CSA to concentrate its resources on cases where its involvement is of a greater necessity. While in support of this bill, the coalition has proposed a very legitimate amendment highlighting the fact that the government's bill does not go far enough. Monday's report of the committee looking into this legislation backed that up. I therefore have no hesitation in supporting the amendment. Finally, I highlight the point that this speech should please all students of the school of political correctness in that I have not, whilst talking about a number of constituents, mentioned the gender of any person. Therefore, no-one can accuse me of sexism, chauvinism or any other 'ism'. Not mentioning gender highlights the problem and not the specific constituent case to which I have referred.",171
393,Mr VAILE,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"It is interesting to listen to the previous speakers on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill, particularly in light of the fact that the Child Support Agency and the problems encountered by a lot of people in our electorates probably keep us busy 75 per cent of the time. I think that would be the case for members right around this chamber. That has been evidenced not only by the speeches that have been made here tonight but also by the bipartisanship of the report from the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, released earlier this week. That committee has taken an enormous amount of evidence and an enormous number of submissions from right around Australia to address this very serious issue. While acknowledging that the government is attempting to improve the legislation as it stands at the moment, I think-hundreds of people have made representations to me and I have made representations on their behalf to the minister in charge of this particular area of the portfolio-these changes do not go far enough. The system obviously is not working well enough when there are hundreds of millions of dollars not collected. There are custodial parents out there that have not received and are not receiving money from non-custodial parents. Non-custodial parents are left with precious little to live on and are forced to in poverty to pay the rate expected of them by the CSA. Under the circumstances non-ustodial parents find themselves in, in a lot of cases they are being forced to give up employment to get out of the responsibility of paying the money to the CSA and to the custodial parent. It is an absolute Pandora's box. Talk about a can of worms. I did not expect to be confronted with this when I was elected as a member of this parliament in March last year, but certainly the dominant issue in my offices in both Taree and Port Macquarie is that of problems with the Child Support Agency. I am not saying that the people who exercise the policy on behalf of the government through the Australian Taxation Office are at fault but certainly I think people who are trained and have operated for years in the tax office are not trained in dealing with the emotive sorts of issues that present themselves when people have problems with the Child Support Agency. There are a number of areas that I am sure are all addressed very well in the Price report on the child support··scheme. It has been interesting to note the tension between the two ministers involved and the chairman of the committee, the member for Chifley (Mr Price), earlier this week. That is how deep the feelings are and that reflects the high emotion that exists out there in the community with regard to this system. When the system was first established, the ideals were quite admirable. In the background paper it states that, in its 1986 discussion paper on child support, the cabinet subcommittee on maintenance identified the impetus behind reform of child maintenance laws. The government sees a need to strike a fairer balance between public and private forms of support to alleviate the poverty of sole parent families and to achieve some constraint on government outlays on sole parent payments. I would imagine that the latter was the greater imperative at the time; the government was trying to alleviate government outlays on sole parent payments. That was good. People who expect to have all sorts of rights in our live community should also expect to shoulder their fair share of the responsibilities. That is basically what this is all . . about. But it is lacking an element of fairness and equity on both sides of the equation. You could write a book about the unbelievable circumstances that a lot of people find themselves in as a result of this system. Non-custodial parents, custodial parents and fathers who are non-custodial parents walk in and out of both my electorate offices on a daily basis. A mother who is a nursing sister and the custodial parent of two children has also walked into my office. Her former husband is the custodial parent of one child. He is unemployed, so the mother, who is caring for two children out of the three, is paying CSA to the father for the one child whilst he is unemployed and collecting unemployment benefits. It is just unbelievable. She cannot even afford to feed and clothe the two children she has. The cases we can cite are absolutely limitless. I know a lot of the speakers tonight have spoken about the custodial parents and the problems that they are having in, firstly, collecting the payments from the non-custodial parents, and, secondly, getting a fair go of the Child Support Agency. A large percentage of the complaints and representations I have made on behalf of constituents to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) have been about the inequity of the equation, or the formula, in working out what non-custodial parents should be contributing to the scheme and what they are left with. Again we have this notion that a fair amount to live on per week should be the same whether that person lives in Sydney, Taree, Port Macquarie, Perth or Brisbane. It is not. We apply a percentage to what they are to contribute to the scheme per child and the non-custodial parents are left with x number of dollars per week. There are a lot of noncustodial parents who, because of the circumstances they are forced into, opt out of the work force and say, 'What is the point of going on? The government will pay me unemployment benefits to do nothing. When I move into that situation, I do not have to pay the CSA any more. The government will pay my wife sole parents benefit, or whatever it is.' In that way they get themselves out of that circumstance. There are not just single cases of this happening; there are lots of cases of it happening. Tonight I was talking to one of the members from Queensland where a non-custodial parent owned a business that was travelling reasonably well. It was producing an income for him and he employed six people. But when the formula was applied to him, with the contributions that he had to make to the Child Support Agency, he was better off to close the business down, put those six men off and go on the dole. He did that. He did it because logic leaves the whole equation when we start moving into these emotional issues. I have not had an in-depth look at the report. I think the formula percentages are addressed under child support assessment considerations in one section. I urge the government to have a serious look at that because we will never be able to quantify the economic ramifications it is having on government revenue. But I can assure the House that that sort of situation is very widespread across Australia. If my electorate is any out indication, it is. A lot of people are in that circumstance. It is a very difficult issue to deal with. We agree with the initial legislation that was brought in some time ag-ertainly before my time-which makes people shoulder their responsibilities and which takes the burden off government outlays. But let us look at this in a very objective manner. The opportunity is now before the government to have a serious look at this unanimous report from the committee which was chaired by a government member and which comprised a majority of government members. The government should have a serious look at where fairness - nd equity lie in this system. The eyes of a lot of people around Australia will be on the government to see whether it does the right thing and whether it does it properly. It should not just pay lip-service to what this report is about and to what the people of Australia, through correspondence to all members of this House who have been forwarding this correspondence to the Assistant Treasurer, have been asking for: that is, reviews of the circumstances under which these situations are being dealt with right across Australia. The challenge is before the government to do something equitably and fairly. MrWILLIAMS (Tangney) (11.51 p.m.)In commenting on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, I am going to mention the work of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, of which I am a member. The joint select committee has just completed an inquiry that began on 13 May 1993 into the operation and effectiveness of the child support scheme. The committee, an all-party committee, tabled its unanimous report containing 163 wide ranging recommendations. The report was tabled on Monday this week-5 December. I do not intend to address the recommendations of the committee generally, but I will refer to those that are specifically relevant to the provisions of this bill. The child support scheme was set up in 1988 to ensure that parents retained financial responsibility for their children when the family unit broke down. Under the scheme, the Child Support Agency collects payment from the non-custodial parent, usually the father, and passes it on to the custodial parent for the support of the child or children of the family. I use the expressions 'custodial parent' and 'non-custodial parent' with considerable reluctance, because they express a proprietary interest in children which is quite inappropriate. Fortunately, legislation recently passed by this House would see an end to the notion of children being the subject of custody and would see children being more the responsibility of parents and the subject of parenting plans. In view of their use up until now, I will continue to use those terms. The scheme is divided into two parts: the first stage is for children whose support was decided upon by a court before October 1989; the second stage is for children born on or after 1 October 1989 and for all children of parents who separated on or after that date. Under stage 2, the amount of child support is calculated by a formula based on the noncustodial parent's taxable income. Stage 2 parents can apply to the Child Support Agency for a review of their child support formula assessment, whereas stage 1 parents must go back to the court to have their maintenance amount amended. The government has on many occasions acknowledged the importance of the child support scheme to many Australian families. It is because the scheme is so important-a lifeline for many families-that the government must ensure that it is operating equitably and efficiently. In fact, it is widely recognised in the community that the scheme is failing its clients. The joint select committee in its report drew attention to these failings and made recommendations for improvements to the system. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has admitted that the child support scheme needs reforming. In a press release on 7 June this year, the Assistant Treasurer said: · . . I agree with the Auditor-General that ,there have been problems in administration. Earlier, on 6 April, the Assistant Treasurer issued a press release announcing a series of changes to the operations of the Child Support Agency, the body responsible for administering the scheme. In his press release, the Assistant Treasurer said: · . . the number of clients the Agency deals with continues to grow and is not expected to peak for about ten years. These are often the most difficult cases where parents cannot agree. He continued: · '. . the sheer volume of growth has created its own problems for the efficient operation of the Child Support Agency, and for communications between the Agency and parents. The Assistant Treasurer went on to announce the details of the changes to the operations of the Child Support Agency. These included both legislative and administrative changes. The administrative changes were to be implemented straight away. They addressed several problems: the time taken by the Child Support Agency to respond to clients by phone or mail; the agency's lack of sensitivity to client's needs; communication problems between the agency and its clients; the unacceptably high level of arrears of child support payments; the lack of efficient case management; and inadequate liaison with interested community groups such as the Australian Council of Social Service, Dads Against Discrimination, and the Council of Single Mothers and their Children. The legislative amendments foreshadowed by the Assistant Treasurer in April have now seen the light of day in the form of this bill. This bill aims to make certain limited reforms to the child support scheme and touches on several areas. Firstly, there is the presumption of parentage arrangements which are to be brought into line with the provisions of the Family Law Act 1975. Secondly, custodial parents who receive certain social security benefits will be required to take reasonable measures to ensure that they are collecting proper maintenance under a child support agreement. Thirdly, the Child Support Agency registrar may choose not to enforce collection of maintenance by custodial parents in stage one cases if the non-custodial parent's income is reduced to a particular level, or if the leaves the continuous care of the custodial parent. Fourthly, private collection agreements will be made more flexible for custodial parents who receive income support from the Department of Social Security. I will first address the proposed amendments to the presumption of parentage provisions. Proof that the non-custodial parent is in fact the child's parent is crucial in many cases because unless the person is the child's parent he or she may not be liable to support the child. The bill proposes to align the child support legislation with the provisions of the Family Law Act by allowing the child support registrar to be satisfied that a man is a parent of a child if certain conditions relating to the man's cohabitation with the child's mother and the date of the child's birth have been satisfied. The aim of this amendment is to assist clients who can satisfy these conditions by speeding the processing of their applications for child support. This amendment is welcomed as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. The real problem that exists is in the cases of disputed parentage. In disputed cases the interests of both parties have to be carefully balanced. It is important that neither party is adversely affected by the dispute, but that the interests of the child are treated as paramount. In cases such as this, the joint select committee has recommended that legislation be amended to enable the child support registrar to collect and hold in trust child support money until the parentage dispute is settled by the Family Court. This would protect the rights of the non-custodial party by keeping open the possibility of returning child support money if the dispute is resolved in that party's favour. If the paying party were held to be the child's biological parent, then the amount held in trust would be paid directly to the custodial parent. To avoid the potential hardship caused to one or both parties by delays in the hearing of the dispute, the joint select committee recommended that the courts hear these cases as a matter of priority. The committee further recommended that the Family Court delegate child to the family court registrars the power to resolve child support related paternity disputes. I urge the government to make more than merely superficial amendment to the parentage provisions of the child support legislation by adopting these recommendations of the joint select committee. The next set of amendments to the child support legislation affects custodial parents who are clients of the Department of Social Security. Where a custodial parent who is receiving benefits, such as the sole parent pension, enters into a child support agreement with· the non-custodial parent, it is proposed that that agreement be examined for its adequacy under the 'reasonable action for maintenance' provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. This means that parents will not be able to register private agreements at less than the Child Support Agency's formula and in so doing transfer the extra cost from the noncustodial parent to the Department of Social Security and thus ultimately to the taxpayer. This will be a compulsory process that will require the custodial parent to take reasonable action to ensure that he or she is receiving adequate maintenance. The aim of these amendments as expressed in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill is to ensure that both parents contribute to the support of their children according to their capacity to pay while minimising social security outlays. Such an aim is laudable and touches on a principal recommendation of the joint select committee. The committee in its report recommended that the government adopt an order of priorities regarding the objectives of the child support scheme. That order would be: first, adequate support is available to all children not living with both parents; secondly, non-custodial parents share in the cost of child support according to their capacity to pay; and, thirdly, Commonwealth expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary to ensure the adequacy of child support to all children not living with both parents. Again I urge the government to consider the recommendations of the joint select committee and undertake a comprehensive and thorough reform of the child support legislation along the lines of those recommendations. The third set of amendments proposed by the bill relate to the non-enforcement of certain stage 1 maintenance agreements. Parents with these agreements, court ordered maintenance agreements registered under the child support scheme, are currently allowed to vary their liabilities only by applying to Family Court. The Child Support Agency does not have the power to exercise discretion in not collecting child support if a party's situation changes. For example, the noncustodial parent may become unemployed or receive sickness benefits and the child may no longer be in the care of the custodial parent. It is often expensive and time consuming for a non-custodial parent to appeal to the Family Court to alter his or her liability for payments. The result is often to leave the non-custodial parent with large bills for arrears of child support payments. The effect of the proposed amendments giving the registrar the power not to enforce a registered liability for a certain period is waive the liability temporarily. That does not mean that the agreement has actually been changed. The parents will need to return to the court if the change is to be made permanent. If a non-custodial parent finds employment while his or her liability to make child support payments is not being enforced for the reason that he or she had become unemployed, then that parent must inform the registrar. The joint select committee noted in its report that the child support legislation imposes a penalty of imprisonment for a maximum period of six months where a person knowingly makes a statement or omits any matter from a statement which makes the statement false or misleading in a material way. However, the report notes that there is no existing penalty for people who recklessly or inadvertently provide false or misleading information to the Child Support Registrar. As a result, the committee recommended that a financial penalty be introduced for persons who recklessly or inadvertently give the Child Support Agency false or misleading information about their current monthly taxable income. The joint select committee also recommended that a monetary penalty be introduced for persons who either knowingly, recklessly or inadvertently fail to notify the Child Support Agency of any increase in their monthly taxable income of 15 per cent or more when required to do so. It is important to the the integrity of the child support scheme and the operations of the Child Support Agency generally that clients are encouraged to provide accurate income information, or at least discouraged from failing to provide accurate information. This recognises that the primary objective of the scheme is that parents bear the responsibility for the financial support of their children. This is a vexed area. There are more far-reaching problems in the child support system that involve the calculation of child support payments from the non-custodial parent's taxable income. The child support income base for each parent is equal to each parent's taxable income from two years before the to child support year, multiplied by the indexation factor. Problems arise because selfemployed non-custodial parents can easily avoid their child support obligations. It is to be regretted that any parent would avoid his or her proper obligations towards his or her children. Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that some parents are gUilty of such behaviour. The joint select committee concluded that the Child Support Agency should undertake research to identify the precise number of parents from the child support scheme who receive income from business structures and the extent to which these parents are minimising their child support obligations. The committee considers that only whet:! this has been done will the agency be able to develop strategies to respond efficiently to problem caused by parents who receive business and investment income and who minimise their child support liabilities. The joint select committee made detailed recommendations which address this problem. In its report, the committee says that taxable income should be used to assess the capacity to pay of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. However, the committee said that taxable income should be used only as the starting point for assessing the capacity to pay .of parents who receive business or investment income because these parents can easily structure their financial affairs· in order to reduce their support liabilities. The joint select committee recommended that the Child Support Registrar be given the power to separately assess parents with business or investment income and a capacity to pay that is greater than is indicated by their taxable income. The committee has suggested an individual review process that would allow the Child Support Registrar to vary the formula assessment if necessary. As I have said, the joint select committee made a series of detailed recommendations on this particular problem, to which I cannot do justice in the present debate. Suffice it to say that the committee recommended that the Child Support Agency implements, firstly, a targeted audit program in respect of parents who receive business or investment income; secondly, a random system of auditing parents who receive business or investment income; and, thirdly, a system of public rulings and other appropriate measures to inform parents and their advisers of the Child Support Registrar's practice in the assessment of a parent's capacity to pay. The fourth set of amendments to the child support legislation contained in this bill provides for the extension of private payment arrangements. When he or she registers a child support agreement a custodial parent has the option of choosing whether he or she wishes to collect the child support payments himself or herself-in other words, privately-or whether he or she would like the Child Support Agency to collect the payments from the non-custodial parent. The custodial parent the may later change his or her mind, unless he or she is receiving benefits from the Department of Social Security. Custodial parents who have elected to have their child support collected by the Child Support Agency and who receive social security benefits cannot later revert to collecting the support payments privately. The changes proposed by the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill are designed to introduce greater freedom for all child support recipients to make arrangements for payment to be made privately. The bill allows the custodial parent to collect child support child privately as long as the parent making payments has a satisfactory record of reliability. Payments must not be in arrears at the time of election, and all payments must have been made on time by the date of the election. However, if the new arrangement is not successful, the custodial parent may elect for the Child Support Agency to collect the child support. In these circumstances, the bill also allows the custodial parent to claim up to three months' worth of arrears. The joint select committee considers that many parents who voluntarily pay child support to the agency on time could be moved safely off agency collection. The committee believes that this could be achieved by giving the Child Support Registrar the discretion to substitute private collection for agency collection where the paying parent has established a reliable voluntary payment record of six months. The committee recommended that the registrar's discretion should ordinarily be exercised in favour of private collection except where the special circumstances of the case require otherwise. There will always be cases where private collection of child support payments is not appropriate, such as those involving domestic violence. But one should encourage parties to enter into private collection agreements where it is appropriate. Such agreements allow both parents to have greater flexibility within the child support scheme. It also minimises collection costs for the Child Support Agency. Under the provisions of this bill, only payers who have a satisfactory payment record will be able to change to private collection. The child's interests are protected because if the payer becomes unreliable the custodial parent may choose to return to having the agency act as collector with the power to collect arrears. These amendments are important and necessary but they are insufficient. They fall well short of what is required. What is required is a wholesale, comprehensive reform of the child support system. The Child Support Agency must become efficient and it must become accessible to its clients, to the families it serves. The administrative changes announced by the Assistant Treasurer in April 1994 have not achieved the improvements they were aimed at. If the government is to earn any credibility at all in the area of child support, then it must look at the recommendations of the joint select committee and lose no time in implementing long overdue reforms.

394,Mr SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I wish to make a short statement to the House concerning proposals of the Senate in respect of this bill. I understand that there is doubt as to whether it is open to the Senate to propose as amendments two of the alterations it has agreed to. This is because of the provisions of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution, which provides that 'the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people'. I understand that two of these proposals were originally drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel as requests. I acknowledge that once again it may be difficult for the House to reach a conclusive understanding as to the effect of the proposals in question in those terms of the requirements of section 53. It will also be all but impossible for any satisfactory dialogue to take place between the houses on this matter. As members may be aware, the legal and constitutional affairs committees of each house have been considering the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53. I am sure we can be confident that these inquiries will help greatly in the application of these provisions in the future. In the meantime, I presume that even if the House deals with these present proposals as amendments, members would not want this action to be taken as an acceptance by the House that they should have been proposed in this way. This reservation may also be relevant in relation to other legislation before the houses at this time. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate s amendments No. 1Schedule 1, page 30, subitem 86(2), omit all words after ""to the company,"", substitute the following word and paragraphs: ""but: (a) the class A franking account balance of the company at the start of the 1994-95 franking year is taken to be nil; and (b) a class A franking debit of the company equal to the amount of the franking deficit, or the amount of the increase in the franking deficit, arises on the day when this item commences."". No. 2Schedule 1, page 31, at end of subitem 86(3), add the following definition: ""'1994-95 franking year', in relation to a company, means the franking year of the company immediately following the 1993-94 franking year."". No. 3Schedule 6, pages 102 to 131, omit the Schedule. Motion (by Mr Gear) agreed to: That the amendments be agreed to. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",179
395,Mr NEVILLE,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I rise tonight to speak briefly in support of the amendment moved to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 as I believe it encapsulates the frustration, anxiety and pain felt by many Australians who have to deal with the Child Support Agency. In my office in Bundaberg, and to a lesser extent in my office in Gladstone, there would be no single issue that has raised the ire of my constituents more than the issue of the Child Support Agency. Speaker after speaker tonight has made that same observation. We have got to recognise that it was the government that created the CSA and it has been this government that has left the agency to squander and destroy many lives over the last six years because of its poor administration, its inflexibility and its poor client focus. The evidence of the CSA's failings were presented to us this week in the damning report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Matters on the agency and in its urgent calls for reform. I compli his great dedication and sincerity in this matter and I am appalled at the ambivalence of two of the ministers to some of the recommendations. As the member for Tangney (Mr Williams) said, we are a long way from fixing the matter up even now and the partial reforms that were announced by the minister earlier this year have gone no way to correcting the problems. I have had a stream of people coming through the office saying that they are getting accounts and being told that they are underpaying or that they are in arrears when they are actually in credit, and so on. This creates a great deal of tension not only for the person involved but between the custodial and non-custodial parents. Loosely paraphrased or condensed, I suppose you could say that the major complaints about the CSA revolve around poor leadership and staff management; lack of national policy and guidelines; poor level of cooperation between the Department of Social Security and the Child Support Agency; lack of appropriate work ethic by the CSA staff; and inappropriate delays in application, registration and collection of child support. I would like to move from that to the human cost that this agency has caused to people who have come under its regime. Many stories presented in this debate recount the evidence of this human cost and the ineffectiveness of the government agency. The member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) quoted a case, actually from my electorate, where a man with quite a successful business with six employees decided that, if the Child Support Agency was going to pursue him in the way that it had, he would give up the whole issue, close down the business and go on the dole. If we are talking about collecting money for the public purse, just imagine what we are now paying for. We have probably got six or seven people out there on the dole, we are not having those children in any way supported, and what we have is a hatred situation between the custodial and the non-custodial parent. I think it is largely because of the inflexibility of the agency that this particular case came about. I had another case in my electorate where a young man who was separated from his wife decided to improve his skills level and to take on an adult apprenticeship. It was absolutely extraordinary the ends that he had to go to try to convince the agency that he was actually now living at a lower income level. One of the most appalling features of it was that, because in the particular adult apprenticeship to which he had gone there was a component of a bonus at the end of the completion of the apprenticeship, that bonus was taken into account and apportioned over the years of the apprenticeship. Although you might argue that at the end of the process he was going to receive a bonus, for the three or four years of that apprenticeship, his effective weekly income was reduced to a level where he lived in abject poverty. He could not spend the bonus. In fact, there was no certainty that he would pass the tests or the exams associated with the apprenticeship. In fact, because he was an adult apprentice, there was perhaps some chance that he may not have completed the course. Because of that and because of the inflexibility of the CSA, he went on for those three or four years in a state of abject poverty living in the barracks of a mine in central western Queensland and with a lack of recognition of what he required just to maintain a basic standard of living. In other instances, we have seen great sadness in families because of tension between the custodial and the non-custodial parents, and an inflexibility on the part of the CSA to vary arrangements. I heard the member for Tangney explaining how the interim measures might exist for the suspension of payments. I suggested in my submission to the CSA inquiry that we perhaps needed something like a clerk of the court in each major provincial centre, so that where there was a transparent change in the circumstances of the non-custodial parent and where the custodial parent was agreeable, this officer could inspect the arrangements, see that they were legitimate and then act on behalf of the registrar to enshrine that new arrangement. It would have been a very simple procedure and it would have allowed a lot of these cases that eventually go back to court to be dealt with expeditiously. Other complaints that I have received have been of non-custodial parents being bled dry by inflexible maintenance formulas, noncustodial parents deliberately minimising their incomes to reduce their maintenance obligation, custodial parents unable to obtain maintenance and departmental interference in amicable private arrangements. Just referring briefly to the custodial parents being unable to obtain maintenance, one of the saddest cases I have seen was a case where a non-custodial parent of one relationship was paying legitimate payments to his ex-wife for his three children. Somewhat later he moved into a relationship with another woman who also had three children but inher case the non-custodial parent was not paying any maintenance at all; he was one of these fly by nighters; So we had this new family with one custodial parent, the non-custodial parent of another group and three children. The non-custodial parent of those three children was paying nothing to that family and the family lived in what was little more than abject poverty. Looking through the recommendations, I must say they have some laudable applications and if all these 163 recommendations can be implemented, then certainly we will have a fair arrangement. But while I find some of the recommendations laudable, I think that in many cases they will be quite impractical. In one recommendation that I found almost extraordinary the joint committee recommends that the Child Support Agency introduce an administrative measure to ensure that it is advised of clients who are subject to or at risk of abuse. And then it says that the CSA should assign senior staff to be solely responsible for the management of each case and provide direct telephone numbers of case officers to clients subject to, or at risk of, domestic violence. This is an organisation that could not answer basic correspondence and could not get its accounts right. In the massive restructure that will be required just to get the basic administrative structure in order, how in heaven's name will it be able to undertake tasks like that? I recommend that the minister-I hope that he and his colleague will override their own ambivalence-take this in a very orderly fashion and be generous with staff levels to the CSA, because the recommendations in this document have not the least hope of being addressed unless it is done in that spirit. A lot of the other things that I was going to say have been said. People come to an electorate office out of sheer frustration. After trying the CSA they end up :more confused and emotionally charged. After waiting for half an hour or longer just to speak to someone in the agency on the telephone-it is often an unsympathetic voice-and, as you would be well aware from the submissions, not being able to get back to the same case officer because of the rule of not giving names, makes the whole thing impossible and generates a lot of the angst that exists between custodial and non-custodial parents. I hope that the joint select committee's 163 recommendations are taken on board. I hope the minister approaches them in an orderly fashion, moves through those incredibly bad administrative areas and deals with case loads and personal contacts in a most professional way for the benefit of the families that are so dependent on this agency.

Question resolved in the affirmative.",185
397,Mr FREE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (12.30 a.m.)-I move: That the amendment requested by the Senate to subclause 2(11) of Part 1 of proposed Schedule 1 in clause 18 at page 219 of the Bill not be made but that in place thereof the Bill be amended as follows: Clause 18, page 219, proposed Schedule 1, omit proposed subclause 2(11), substitute the following subclause: ""Living away from home for 18 weeks ""(11) A person is independent if the person: (a) does not live, and for a continuous period of at least 18 weeks has not lived, at a home of the parents, or of a parent, of the and (b) has, at a time when the person was not living at such a home been employed for at least 20 hours a week for the period of, or for periods that total, at least 13 weeks; and (c) is not receiving financial support from either or both of his or her parents, or from someone else who is acting as his or her guardian, and did not receive such support during the period referred to in paragraph (a)."". This request was the main issue of the Senate debate. Under the legislation, a young person qualifies as independent if that person has been self-supporting during the qualifying period. This, I should point out, is separate from the issue of young people who cannot live at home because of extreme family breakdown or similar circumstances. Those young people qualify as independent without any qualifying period. Under the jobsearch allowance, the qualifying period has been 18 weeks. The government proposed changing the qualifying period to 26 weeks. This change reflects the introduction of the away from home rate. The away from home rate will pay the same maximum rate as the independent rate, but it will apply a means test to the parents' income and assets. The away from home rate will address the situation of young people who need to live away from home for jobsearch or training reasons. The away from home rate is payable immediately, without any qualifying period. The proposed changes of the opposition parties to this independence criterion are to reduce the qualifying rate from 26 weeks to 18 weeks and to provide that a young person need not have been self-supporting during the qualifying period. The government was prepared to agree to support the reduction of the qualifying period to 18 weeks if the proposal were modified to clarify that the young person was in fact self-supporting during the qualifying period, that the young person should have been employed during the qualifying period rather than merely registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service, and that the young person should not have been supported by his parents. In subsequent discussions, I understand that the opposition person; has indicated that it will accept the government's compromise proposal as presented to the House tonight.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Crean) agreed to: That Mr Grace, Mr Scott and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendments Nos 3 to 6 of the Senate.",189
402,Mr CREAN,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos 3 to 6 of the Senate, I present the reasons. The reasons read as followsThese amendments are opposed on the basis that they are no more workable than the existing provisions introduced by the Democrats in July. These amendments still reward a person's failure to meet his/her obligations by paying the person two further payments of allowance before a deferment of allowance is imposed. Given the Government's substantial commitment to unemployed people announced in Working Nation, it would be unacceptable to allow the Greens' amendments to pass, thereby enabling jobseekers who are clearly in breach of their reciprocal obligations to continue to receive allowance for a further four weeks. This would not be acceptable in tenns of sound policy and administration or in tenns of equity in the eyes of the Australian taxpayer. To complement the increased assistance to be provided to jobseekers, the Government announced in Working Nation enhanced reciprocal obligations for those receiving income support. The Government believes that provision of a period of notice before payment of allowance is deferred sends the wrong signals to jobseekers about the importance of their reciprocal obligations. The bill seeks to rectify this by providing that recipients be properly notified of the imposition of a defennent period, but that this period commences on the day that notice is given, rather than after two further payments of allowance. Administrative processes already provide that notices are issued to a person warning that a defennent period may be imposed if a breach is not remedied. In this regard, it should be noted that the report on the bill by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal· and Constitutional Affairs considered that the administrative processes in place prior to the July amendments had inbuilt safeguards which did provide sufficient notice of defennent of income support without the need for additional payments periods. The bill confonns with administrative procedures that were in place up to July 1994, and which the Government believes were fair and equitable and provided sufficient notice to the person of the consequences of failing to respond to a specific requirement made of the person. In suminary,·these procedures were: (1) the person was given a clear requirement to attend or contact the CES and a deadline to respond by (5-21 days hence); (2) failure to respond to that requirement always generated a second letter which clearly warned the person that he/she risked loss of allowance if he/she failed to respond within a further 14 days; (3) the CES could be approached at any time during this process to change an appointment or listen to a person's reasons or complaints; (4) when a person was found to be in breach of a particular requirement, he/she is notified of the decision in writing and had immediate recourse to a well-established review and appeals process which ensured that hislher concerns are responded to promptly; and (5) there was discretion on the part of the reviewing officer to continue payment of allowance pending review where circumstances warranted this. It is not the Government's aim to deal harshly with the unemployed-however, it is the Government's responsibility, on behalf of the whole community, to ensure that jobseekers respond positively to the many and varied measures of assistance offered to them. This is the role of reciprocal obligations, and the success of the CES in helping jobseekers is largely dependent on their timely and cooperative responses to requirements made of them. Motion (by Mr Crean) agreed to: That the committee's reasons be adopted.",189
