12,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. The price of f.a.q. wheat is fixed by the Australian Wheat Board, which is composed - of representatives of the Governments of. the - Commonwealth, and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia; also representatives of the wheat growers in those States. At present, the only use to which such f.a.q. wheat is put' is the making of Hour. The price of wheat below f.a.q. isfixed .by the State Government, but naturally such price is dependent upon the price fixed by the Australian Wheat Board for - f.a.q. wheat.

13,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"the Prime Miuister, - upon notice I. Is it a fact that, in connection with, the filling of the position of Director of Navigation, - the Government made a selection without first obtaining recommendations from the Permanent Head of the Department and the Public Service Commissioner, as contemplated by section 31 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act? 2. Was the matter referred to the Permanent ""Head and the Commissioner, and did they strongly recommend the appointment of Mr. East as the applicant best qualified for the position ? 3. Is it a fact that the officer mentioned for eight months filled the position of Acting Director and of Chairman of the Marine Council with marked ability, and to the entire satisfaction of his Minister and of all the marine interests affected? 4. Is it a fact that the Government refused to accept the recommendations of the Permanent Head and Public Service Commissioner, and called upon the latter to make another recommendation, giving as a reason for such action that nautical as well as adnrnis'trative experience was necessary for a proper discharge - of .the duties of the position? 5. Is it correct that the officials occupying ^positions corresponding to that of the Director .[-56] of Navigation in all the great English-speaking countries, namely, in Great Britain , Canada, United States of America, and New Zealand, are none of them nautical men, or possessing any nautical experience? 6. Did the Government make any inquiries or obtain any advice as to the qualifications necessary for the position; if so, from whom? 7. Is it a fact that Mr East was the departmental oflicer who, under his Minister, handled the Navigation Bill , ancl advised Ministers during its passage through Parliament in 1912, and in that connection rendered services for which he was specially thanked by Ministers concerned ? 8. Is it a fact that Mr East is reputed, by those competent to judge, to possess an exceptionally thorough knowledge of the Navigation Act and of the constitutional limitations in its application ? 0. Is not Mr East admittedly also an officer with high administrative qualifications, and possessing exceptional ability and experience in organizing work? 10. Have the requirements of section 31 of the Public Service Act regarding the statement of reasons for not approving a recommendation within seven days been complied with ; if not, why not? 11. Was the Prime Minister asked to receive a deputation representative of the Public Service regarding the matter, ancl requested to hold over the appointment in the meantime? 12. Seeing that tlic position of Director has been vacant since the death of the late Director, nearly five years ago, and that the commencement of the Navigation Act has been postponed for an indefinite period, what special reason existed for the haste now displayed in the matter ?",20
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. Yes. It is pointed out when the appointment of the late Captain Davies, the first Director, was made, the Cabinet of which the honourable member was a Minister, dealt with the applications before they were sent to the Public Service Commissioner for a recommendation, and on the recommendation of the honourable member rejected the recommendation of has the Permanent Head that a layman in the Service should be appointed as Director, and insisted upon the appointment of a nautical man from outside the Commonwealth Service. It will thus be seen that the two Governments were practically in entire agreement in policy and method of appointment. 2. Yes. 3. Yes. 4. Yes; 5. Yes. G. Repeated requests and recommendations were made by those immediately associated with seafaring matters in the' Commonwealth that only a nautical man should be appointed to the position. 7. Yea; but it should be stated that the late Captain Davies, the first Director, was the expert who attended Parliament and on whom the Government relied for advice on all technical and practical matters. 8. Yes. !). Mr East is a good officer, but it is not considered he possesses the qualifications in the degree the question would appear to suggest. 10. Yes. 11. Yes. 12. It is not proposed to postpone the commencement of the Navigation Act for an indefinite period. The necessary preliminary organizing work wns being delayed owing to the appointment not being made. It was, therefore, necessary to make the appointment at the earliest possible moment. POSTAL INSTITUTE .",20

18,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l lows :On the 6G.000 tons of sugar imported from Java the insurance rate varied from 9s. 9d. per cent, to 10s. l i d . per cent., and change from 15s. per cent, to 17s. 6d. per cent. On the 4,000 tons of F i j i sugar the rate insurance was 8s. per cent.; exchange, nil. NICKEL COINAGE.",21

20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No decision has yet been arrived at in regard to this question. LETTER - CARRIER S' AWARD .,21
21,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Seeing that the Australian ' letter carriers' award was finalized by Mr Justice Powers on the 3rd March, 1920, left the stated Arbitration Court on the 12th March, and was placed on the table of the Bouse on the 26th March, why is it that the award rates are only payable as from the 20th April? 2. Will the Minister favourably consider the question of paying the new rates as from the 1st April instant?",21

24,Mr HAY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether he has recently received any communication from the Central Wool Committee? 2. If so, will he lay the same upon the table of this House; and, if deemed desirable, make a statement thereon?",21
25,Mr HUGHES,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I am unable to answer this question i u its present form , for the reason that communications are continually being received from the Central Wool Committee. WOOL TOPS AGREEMENT .",22
26,Mr RODGERS,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"the Prime M in ister, upon notice Whether the Government is prepared to allow to the Australian wool-growers in respect of the wool supplied to the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company under contract for the manufacturing of wool tops, the same share of profits in such wool as if it formed part of the wool sold to the Imperial Government?",22
27,Mr HUGHES,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Tea - I do AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from l o t h A p r i l , vide page 1263): Clause 7 agreed to. Clause S(1) The Commission shall consist of three members who shall be appointed by the G overnor-General. (2) A duly authenticated organization, recognised or acknowledged by the Minister as being a body representing returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth, may submit to the Minister a list containing the names of not less than three persons from which the organization recommends that a selection be made of a person to be appointed as one of the Commissioners, and the Governor General may appoint a person selected from that list to be one of the Commissioners.",22
28,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Y a r r a ) [11.11] - I was glad to hear the Minister 3ay last night that there was no justification for the statement i u the press that persons had already been selected as members of the Commission, and I then expressed the hope that, those whose names had been mentioned would neither be prejudiced nor favoured thereby. Every applicant has the right to a fair run. 2 provides that a duly authenticated organization recognised or acknowledged by the Minister as representing returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth may submit to him the names of not less than three persons from which a selection is recommended of the person to be appointed a Commissioner, and Governor General may appoint as one of the Commissioners a person selected from that list. In my opinion, no organiza[56]- 2 tion should be recognised as the only body eligible to submit names. As I have already pointed out, the trade unions represent from 70 per cent, to 100 per cent, of the workers in the various trades that are organized, but the Victorian Government has never asked them to recommend persons for appointment to Wages Boards. Instead of that being done, a ballot of those employed in a trade has been taken, and there should be a ballot of the soldiers to ascertain the name of the person whom they would recommend for the position of Commissioner. Later, I shall move an amendment to that effect.",22
29,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Maribyrnong) [11.13]. not know - whether the Minister has given the reason for the appointment of a Commission of three members. I understand that originally pensions claims were dealt with by a Board of three, but that it was found more convenient to allow the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in each' State to deal with the work, ancl that the determination of questions arising in connection with the granting of pensions has thus been considerably facilitated. A Commission of three members with a quorum of two would require the investigation of every case by at least two persons; and that would be likely to occupy more time than if the work were done by one person. I am informed that in Victoria alone pension cases are being dealt with now at the rate of about 1,000 a week. In New South Wales the number would be greater, and there are the other States as well.  to war pensions?",22
30,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I am referring to soldiers' pensions. The Minister may reply that very soon all cases w i ll have been dealt with, at any rate, so far as the initia l stages are concerned. But he must be aware that in connection with Sub-clause old-age pensions and war pensions the review of cases has occupied a considerable time. It is unwise to depart from the salutary rule of allowing one man to deal with all minor cases. No doubt it is necessary that major and special cases should be dealt with by the Commission as a body, but if one member is able to the deal with minor cases and details the work will be expedited, and the soldiers will benefit accordingly. I am afraid that the provision that two members shall form a quorum will mean that no action can be taken by a Commissioner in the moveabsence of a quorum, ancl the appending of two signatures to every minor matter will mean delay. Two men, however inknowledged telligent, will take longer to deal with a matter than will one competent person.  ister) [11.3.9] - This clause deals geueread ally with the Commissioners, and covers the whole activities of the Repatriation monwealth. Department. Those activities include war pensions. But I take it that the practicable? Commissioners themselves will decide how the work shall be dealt with. Por stance, they may agree that one of their number shall deal with pensions, allowing ing their representative. an appeal from his decision to the full Commission. So far as I can sea, there is nothing in the clause or in the Bill prevent the Commissioners apportioningtwo the work exactly as the honourable member has suggested.",22

32,Mr LAZZARINI,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Werriwa) [11.211-. - I support the objection raised by the declared"" "" black."" Leader of the Opposition in regard to sub-clause 2. It iswell known to orable members that there is more than one returned soldiers' organization the 'Commonwealth, and it seems arbitrary that the Minister should pick out one, and give to it the right to nominate object to that. a representative of returned soldiiers. That provision is likely to lead to dissatisfaction, and cause some soldiers to lose faith in the Repatriation .Commission. I urge the Minister to accept t?he suggestion that all soldiers should have a right to vote for the selection of their representatives on the Commission, just as all th© members engaged in a trade are allowed to ballot for the election of m representative on a. Wages Board. I its present form. do not say that the Minister will be prejudiced in his selection of a man, but the fact remains that according to this clause the Minister will have to pick one organization as officially representcated' ing all returned soldiers.",23

There to is not one State in which there are not or more organizations of returned soldiers, and the strongest body in one State is not necessarily the strongest in others. I have no quarrel with any of them, but I think that all returned soldiers should be placed on an equality. There was a great, deal of heart-burning at the recent conference of returned soldiers in Adelaide. Some branches of the par&nt have broken away, ancl in the words of industrial unionism they have been declared "" black."" In other States the parent organization has been",23
35,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Would not the honorhonable member's object be obtained by eliminating the words, "" recognised or in acknowledged by the Minister""?",23

If the amendment is carried repatriation will be placed on a better footing-than if the sub-clause is agreed to in,23
39,Mr MAHON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Kalgoorlie) [11.28] - A simpler way of attaining the object aimed at by the Leader of the Opposition would out be to omit the words "" A duly authentiorganization,"" and insert inlieu thereof ""Any organization.""",23
40,Mr ATKINSON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,That is what the .subclause means now.,24
41,Mr MAHON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"No . If that amendment were made it would obviate the necessity for the Minister to inquire into the character of an organization in order to certify that it was duly authenticated, and it would save him from any suspicion of political bias or influence in selecting one organization in preference to another A M organization must be "" duly authenticated"" by somebody, and that somebody must be outside the organization itself. This means, of course, that the Minister - will have to decide whether an organization is "" d u l y authenticated""; but my suggestion leaves it open to any organization throughout the Commonwealth to submit three names. Even supposing an organization represents only a fraction of the soldiers, what harm is done by allowing that organization to submit three names, seeing that the power or discretion of the Minister is not curtailed in any way? A wider latitude would be given and the possibility of any favouritism or political patronage prevented. Further, if my suggestion is accepted it will remove the necessity for a ballot, which, though in theoi y admirable, is a cumbersome and expensive method of arriving at a decision. Already there are too many elections in - Australia. The returned soldiers are scattered all over the Commaonwealth, and we can quite imagine - what it would mean to take a ballot »of all the returned soldiers from the far (north of Queensland to the remote limits of Western Australia. Every soldier, or nearly every soldier, is connected with some organization; and my suggestion opens the door to all, while, as 1I have .already said, the power or discretion of the Minister is not interfered with in any way. This seems to me .a very simple way out of the difficulty.",24
42,Mr ATKINSON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Wilmot ) [11.34] - I .have every sympathy with the desire of the Leader of the 'Opposition (Mr . T u d o r ), that the returned soldiers shall he as full y represented as possible on this Commission-that the members of th'! Commission shall-be persons satisfactory to the great m a j o r it y of the men. Unless the soldiers are satisfied in this direction how can we hope t:o make an ukimate success of repatriation ? The closer we get to the soldiers, and the more knowledge we have of their desires, the more we can hope that the objects we all have in view will be attained. I cannot help thinking, however, that it would be quite impracticable to take a ballot. I agree that there might be some trouble if the words "" duly .authenticated"" are allowed to remain, because it is dear that some one will have to give a certificate on the point. It would - be a .good idea to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr .Mahon), for in this way we should have nominations from bodies representing all the returned soldiers. There are not many who do not belong to some association or another by this time; and, at any rate, the suggestion would give .us complete a representation as any ballot would. Even if it were decided to hold .a ballot, I am afraid a great many of the men would fail to vote.",24
43,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,That is their look-out.,24
44,Mr ATKINSON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"In "" any case, I do not think the expense of a ballot is worthwhile, and, moreover, it would take a long time to carry out, while showing no greater representative result.",24
45,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Hallways) [11.36] - I ask the Committee to retain the clause as drafted. The desire is to have members on. the Commission representative of the general body of returned soldiers; and on the Minister is cast the obligation to be satisfied, before he makes an appointment, that he has a nominee from a thoroughly representative organization. As to a ballot, I quite agree with what, is said by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr . Mahon). The men are scattered all over Australia, working their way up into the remote parts of Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, and we all know the time and expense involved in organizing for a general election. Any Returned Soldiers Association is generally organized on a Federal basis, and is, therefore, able to make definite representations to the Government of the day. There is a similar provision in regard to the State Boards, with which Ave have to deal later, and the sole object is to have these bodies as representative as possible.",24
46,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,But the proposed amendment does - not obviate the 1 difficulty.,24
47,Mr TUDOH,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,I should he pleased to withdraw ray amendment in favour of the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon).,25
48,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I urge the Committee not to accept either amendment. Mr MAXWELT, - The nomination by an association is, after all, only a recommendation, and the nomination of the most representative organizations will have most weight.",25
49,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,We ought to be sure that the recommendations come from Organizations of weight.,25
50,Mr WEST,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"East Sydney) [11.40] It would seem that the minds of the supporters of the clause are not big enough to realise that Australia is a very large place, and that it is necessary that the representation of the soldiers on this Commission should be as nearly perfect as possible. Unless proper representation of the men is secured, there must be much discontent. They are all strongminded men, who have seen something at the other side of the world, and they have now a larger conception of their position in the community. The amendment, in my opinion, would remove a cause of possible friction, and we realise that the men themselves must feel that the members of the .Commission are heart and soul with the repatriation cause. The success of the scheme depends on those who are made responsible for its administration, andfchey,of course, must be men in whom the soldiei's have every confidence. Even should there be dissatisfaction with the - personnel of the Commission, the men would have the consolation of knowing that they had had a voice in its selection if the amendment be adopted. I do not like the clause as it is at present, and either of the amendments approaches what I desire.",25

I also desire to move the omission of the words, ""recognised or acknowledged by the Minister as being a body.""",25
53,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Fawkner) [11.45] I take it that the object of this clause is to secure that ithe soldier appointed upon the Commission shall be truly representative of the soldiers of Australia, and I think the amendment will attain that end. Any organization may make a recommendation. It is only a recommendation, after all, for the guidance of the Government; and, naturally, the organization which, in the opinion of the Minister for Repatriation, most truly represents the Soldiers will receive the greatest consideration. The Minister would attach more importance to the proposal of a large and influential Organization than to the recommendation of a body which may represent only a few returned men.",25
54,Mr ATKINSON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,All the returned soldiers' organizations might jointly recommend one man.,25
55,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"So much the better, but this amendment would secure that the appointed soldier, whoever he might be, and by whomever he might be recommended, would be representative of all the soldiers in Australia.",25
56,Mr RILEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"South Sydney) [11.48] I am inclined to vote against the whole clause. We have been informed by the Minister that the bulk of - the work has been already completed, and that the task of repatriation is well in hand. That being so, why create a new Commission? We have been told that the present body has done excellent work. What better work will the new Commission perform? Will it change ithe policy upon which the present Commission 'has based its efforts? I have been careful hitherto not to criticise the work of the Commission, realizing that it has faced a gigantic task. But I say now that the Commission has really done nothing very big or important. Week after week it has paid out sustenance money. In Sydney, I have often seen hundreds of men waiting to make their frequent and regular registrations, in order that they should not be deprived of the sustenance allowance. Had the Commission done something really big, had it subsidized municipal bodies, or even ' Government Departments, to carry out public works, and so provide employment for hundreds >>f returned men, it would have had a much more successful record. All the money paid out by way of sustenance has been really wasted. There should have been a bold policy undertaken in establishing definite national works; but no effort has been made in that direction. If we appoint a new Commission at high salaries, and for a long period, are we guaranteeing ourselves better results? I am prepared to assist any Commission to solve the problem of repatriating all our men; but what qualifications are the proposed new Commissioners to possess in order to secure appointment?",25
57,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE, Order ! I ask the honourable member to confine himself to ithe amendment. The clause itself is not now before the Committee.,26
58,Mr RILEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The first line of the clause has to do with the appointment of three Commissioners, and it is upon that first line that I am basing my remarks.",26
59,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"An amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon) for the omission of certain words. 1 must, therefore, for the time being, require the honourable member to confine himself to the amendment - He will have an opportunity later to speak to the whole clause.",26
60,Mr RILEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"My contention is that provision for the appointment of three new Commissioners is unnecessary. Let the present body carry on for the next twelve months or so, by which time, apparently, the work will have been established upon 'a permanent basis. Unless the Government can indicate the nature of the qualifications which it will seek in the new Commissioners",26
61,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Order ! loath to intervene, but must again ask the honourable member to confine himself to the amendment.",26
62,Mr RILEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I will take a later opportunity to discuss the principle contained in the clause as a whole. If returned men are to be consulted with respect to the appointments of the new Commission, those appointments should be made upon as broad a basis as possible. I hope the Government will not be guided merely by the recommendation of the largest body of returned soldiers, but will look first to the qualifications of the nominees. The sole fact that a nominee is a returned soldier - who has the confidence of the largest organization, should not be sufficient.",26
63,Mr HAY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"New England) [11.55] Since I have been ""closely in touch with very many returned soldiers, and am familiar with their immediate wants and future requirements, I am of opinion that the amendment will sufficiently meet their case as far as representation on the Commission is concerned. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has stated that he sees no reason why the present Commission, which has done such good and useful work, should not continue. I am satisfied that we are only now entering upon our grave responsibilities so far as concerns the securing in life of our returned soldiers. I am not so much concerned with those who have acquired technical and other education, because they are not placed in the same position of responsibility as returned men ivho are settling upon the land. It is very necessary, therefore, that the soldiers should be represented on the Commission by some one who understands their immediate requirements in respect of land settlement. I have had occasion to visit two soldier settlements >in my electorate, and, although at present the men are more or less satisfied with their conditions, and are hopeful of their prospects, I am convinced that unless some person is appointed to the Commission who possesses an intimate knowledge of their needs, and a deep sympathy with them also, a great many of our soldier settlers will find it hard to carry on. They have set out in the hope that prosperity shortly awaits them. ""We all know that the amount of I am money at their disposal is limited. Unless the new Commission possesses very deep sympathy with and am intimate knowledge of the requirements of new settlers, I fear that failure must face many. It has been stated that in many instances land has been acquired at more than its true value. In my own electorate that has been the case, but adjustments are being made, and the soldier settlers expect that the reappraisements will satisfy them in regard to values. The areas, in most instances, are insufficient. During the past year, many settlers in my district have had to battle against one of the most appalling droughts in the history of Australia. Their cases will have to be reconsidered almost at once from a financial standpoint. Indeed, from time to time, the circumstances of the soldier settlers embarking upon production will require sympathetic revision. I would like to cite the case of the men established on the Kentucky settlement in my electorate. There are about 80 to 100 men, limited each to about 50 acres, and the provision made in the way of housing is insufficient at present",26
64,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Order ! I have been waiting for the honourable member to connect his remarks with the amendment. Sc far.,' he has not done so. He Avill not bo i'n order in speaking upon the general tenor of the clause itself.",27
65,Mr HAY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I thought we were discussing the question, of the Commissioner to be appointed by returned soldiers.",27
66,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,When rhe honourable member for South Sydney (Mr. Riley) was speaking I directed his attention to the same matter.. The question of the appointment of a Commissioner is not before the Committee. The question Hinder consideration is the omission of certain words relating to the class of returned soldiers who are to have a voice in the appointment of a Commissioner. The honourable member will have an 'Opportunity of dealing with the broad 'question after the amendment is disposed of and the clause is under consideration.,27
67,Mr HAY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,'In that case I shall content myself by stating that I support the amendment of the honourable member for - Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon).,27
68,Mr BRUCE,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Flinders) .[12.2] - In my opinion, Iflie amendment will do nothing to alter the position as set out in the Bill. The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition. (Mr Tudor), that all returned soldiers, irrespective of membership of organizations, should have a voice in the selection of the representative of the soldiers on the Commission, would - have had ;i considerable effect, but seeing - that it would entail a ballot, it is ticable. Otherwise I would agree with it. The present proposal is to give to - any small number of soldiers who form an organization, of returned soldiers the right to nominate a representative for the consideration of the Minister for Repatriation. Such a body might not have more than one member in. each .State, but nevertheless it would be an organization of returned soldiers, and, under the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon). Would be entitled to submit a nomination to the Minister. Thus innumerable nominations might be submitted, representative or not representative, of returned soldiers, and possibly the whole thing might result in chaos; biit in any case it would not make a ha'porth of difference in the position. The amendment does not seek to take away the final right of the Minister for Repatriation to select the "" Commissioner who is to represent the returned soldiers, and it is obvious to every one that his selection will be made from one of the three nomineesof the Returned .Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, which is the biggest organization of returned soldiers. The inclusion of the suggestion of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon) might be very useful to an honourable member oil the public platform, where he could say, "" I advocated that you should have an equal chance for your organization "" ; but such a statement would not be correct, because actually nothing of thesort will occur. The amendment will not really alter the position one iota. Therefore I oppose it.",27
69,Mr MAHONY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Dalley) [12.5] - I support the .amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon).. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr.. Bruce) has given away the"" whole show,, because the underlying principle of the clause as it stands is that the 'Organization which the .Minister knows will give him the member of the Commission hedesires to appoint is the only body he will recognise. I have nothing to say against the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, but they are not the only legitimate body of returned sailors and soldiers in Australia. There are - quite a number of other organizationswith very large memberships. There is imprac- one body in New South Wales which is inTOOway associated with the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, and its members are genuine returned soldiers who have all ""'done their bit.'' I claim that they should have a say. in the submission of nominees for the final selection of - the Minister in the appointment of the returned soldiers' representative upon the Repatriation Commission. If we restrict the area of selection, we shall possibly create a feeling of distrust among the great body of returned soldiers outside the Imperial League. We ought to demonstrate to the soldiers that they can have the utmost confidence in the Repatriation Commission; and, in order to do so, we should make provision that all soldiers shall nave a voice in the selection of the men who comprise it. Tliere is no danger in the proposal of the lionorable member for Kalgoorlie. If the Minister is afraid that some of the various organizations will recommend men who are incapable of carrying out the duties of Commissioner, the final selection lies in his hands, and he ca-n reject any nomination' he chooses. On the other hand, he ought to give all the returned soldiers, regardless of their political opinions, an opportunity of having a voice in the selection of the men who are recommended 'to him for appointment. Is the great body of returned soldiers affiliated with the Labour movement, and standing behind this party, to have no say in the submission of names to the Minister? If the Minister is to adopt that attitude, he will build up difficulties for the Commission right from the beginning. I hope that he will seriously coiisider the question of giving to every returned soldier, no matter what organization he belongs to-political , social, or otherwise-a n equal opportunity of deciding upon the names to be submitted for selection as representative of the returned soldiers on the Commission.  Trade and Customs) [12.10]. - The ciple underlying the 'clause is Minister for Repatriation must make the appointment; and, as the amendment does woit attempt to interfere with his gative in this respect, I propose to it.",27
70,Mr ANSTEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Bourke) [12.11] - I not particular as to what the Minister does in this regard, but I would like take the opportunity of mentioning that the Government distinctly promised soldiers that they would have a represenvernment tative on the Repatriation Commission. But, of course, they have no indention of letting them have anything of the kind. It i.s a farce to say to any one that he can submit a nomination. Representation means the election of one's representative.  clearly that one of the three Commissioners must be a returned soldier.",28
71,Mr ANSTEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Jus t so; but where is the representation if some one else selects the man? Representation means that the soldiers should have the right to elect their representative. The Bill provides that the organization may nominate some one to sit on the Commission; and, if the Government think him a fit person, they may proceed to appoint him.",28
72,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,The Government must appoint some one.,28
73,Mr ANSTEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The Bill provides that the Government may do so. The men can go through the farce of nominating a particular individual, and when they have gone through that process the Government may, if they choose, accepr one of the particular nominations.",28
74,Mr BELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,The Government will accept one of them all right.,28
75,Mr ANSTEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,Of course. They may do so.,28
76,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Le t the honourable member move to substitute "" shall"" for "" may.""",28
77,Mr ANSTEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"If I do so, will the honourable member for Fawkner support me?",28
78,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,Yes .,28
79,Mr ANSTEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The Government won an election largely, and ""stormed the trenches,"" on a proposition, in a manifesto issued to the soldiers in France, that, they would have the right to a representative on the Repatriation prinCommission. But now they do not prothat the pose to keep that promise. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - Yes , we do.",28
80,Mr ANSTEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I simply rose to repreromind . the Government of the promise accept they have made. I have no wish to pander to any pa:rticula.r sedtion for am votes. I shall avail myself of the offer made by, the honourable member for to Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), and with his legal talent and my own eloquence I am the convinced that we shall induce the Goto make the amendment desired by us so that a man shall be directly elected by the returned soldiers to represent them on the Commission without interference by the Minister or anybody else.",28
81,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Maribyrnong) [12.17]. - I had intended prior to the speech made by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) to outline a further amendment which would give every returned sailor and soldier, quite independently of any organization, a voice in the selection of a member of the Repatriation Commission. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) has said that the proposition made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) is impracticable. I would remind him, however, that there are members of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League living in the most remote parts of Australia, and that even if tion were made from nominations submitted by the League, ballot-papers would have to be sent to these men just as would be necessary if the men were allowed, a direct vote on the question. I should like sub-clause 2 to be so amended that it would readA selection shall be made by the returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth of a person to be appointed as one of the Commissioners and the Governor General shall appoint the person selected to be one of the Commissioners. That would do away with any final selection by the Minister for Repatriation. Even if the clause were amended as proposed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon) two or three men would be nominated by an organization, and from that number the Minister would make a final selection. That would not carry out in its entirety the promise made by the Prime Minister to our soldiers in France. I desire that our sailors and soldiers wherever they may be shall have an opportunity to elect their own representative on the Commission. In a later part of the Bill it is provided that if any Commissioner proves himself unfitted for the task he may he displaced, so that we might safely make the amendment I have, suggested.",29
82,Mr MARRS,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Wentworth) [12.21] I have listened with interest to the speeches made on this clause, and am pleased that the Minister in charge of the Bill has signified his willingness to accept the amendment proposed by. the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Mahon). I have been a prominent member of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League from its inception, and was for some time on the council. At first I felt that that organization should represent the returned men in the selection of a representative on the Commission ; but we must realise that there are a number of men outside that organization who should have a vote. The amendment as accepted by the Minister will give every returned man in Australia an opportunity to join with his brothers in nominating certain representatives. Every man will have a chance to vote on the question, because there is nothing to stop a man from joining the League or some other body, which could put forward a selec- nominations from which the Minister would make a final, selection. The clause as proposed to be amended will carry out in its entirety the promise made by the Prime Minister that the men would be allowed to nominate their representative tin the Commission.",29
83,Dr MALONEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Melbourne) [12.25]. I support the view put forward by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey), because during my long political experience I have found that Ministers are ready to interpret the word ""may"" in an Act of Parliament in a mandatory sense when it suits them to do so, while in other cases they will not. In a Bill providing for the salary of the Governor General it was set out that it ""may not exceed"" a certain sum. A. member of the Labour party was successful in securing the substitution of the word ""shall"" for the word "" may,"" with the result that later on when Lord Hopetoun, despite his splendid record, declared that the allowance of £10,000 per annum was insufficient, the little word "" shall"" prevented Australia being robbed of an additional £10,000 per annum for the Governor General. Under the clause as it stands the election of a representative of the soldiers on the Repatriation Commission would be as difficult as the election conducted for the Doge of Venice, in connection with which candidates went before nine different committees before a final selection was made. If an officer and a ranker were nominated, would the Governor General select the ranker? Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr Mahon ) toThat the words "" recognised or acknowledged by the Minister as'being a body"", lines 4 to ti, be left out.",29
84,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Maribyrnong) [12.2S]. - In order to give effect to the proposal I made a few minutes ago, I find it will be necessary to move for the omission of sub-clause 2. I therefore moveTliat sub-clause 2 be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" (2) A selection shall be made by the returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth of a person to be appointed as one of the Commissioners and the Governor General shall appoint the person selected to be one of the Commissioners"".",30
85,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Kooyong) [12.31]. - The sub-chiuse as it has been amended seems to me to carry out the promises that have been made to returned soldiers. The. amendments accepted by the Minister have the effect of widening the provision to permit of any organization which may be representative of the whole of the soldiers submitting a list. Therefore, it w i l i be for the soldiers to make such arrangements as they may think proper for the purpose of the submission of names, much as is done in this State in connection with the appointment of Wages Boards.",30
86,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"In connection with the appointment of Wages Boards, all those connected with an industry, whether unionists or not, have a voice; but the clause as amended allows only the members ""of the recognised organizations to submit a list.",30
87,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The amendments which have been accepted permit of an organization being formed to represent the whole of the returned soldiers, and from its list of three names a selection will be made by the Minister. It has been suggested that we should provide that one of the three names so submitted shall be accepted by the' Minister. there are two objections. The first is that the recognised phraseology of an Act of Parliament concerning the actions of the Crown or of the Crown's representative is "" may,"" not "" s h all "" ; and, secondly, if we used the word "" s h all "" instead of "" may "" we should do away with the Government's responsibility for the selection, and it is desirable that the Minister shall be held responsible for these appointments. He ought to be accountable to Parliament for what he does in this matter. Every one knows, of course, that agreed when provision is made for a nomination by an outside body it is the almost in variable rule of Governments to accepc that nomination. In this case three persons are to be nominated, one of whom may be selected, but the Government should be made responsible for the selection. Any Government which failed to accept a nomination such as is provided for would, of course, bring upon itself much trouble, and that is a thing that Governments seek to avoid. Consequently, they are only too glad to recognise the spirit of a provision such as this. In my opinion, the provision as amended gives effect to the promise of the Government, and is couched in proper phraseology, and members may rest assured that the nomination will , in accordance with well-established practice, be accepted.",30
88,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,I point out to the honourable member for Maribyrnong that he can move the omission of only so much of the sub-clause as has not been already dealt with by the Committee.,30
89,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"If that be so, I have lost my opportunity. I understand that I cannot move to delete words which the Committee has determined shall remain in the sub-clause.  the clause.",30
90,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I do not wish to do that. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That the words "" that list,"" in sub-clause 2, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" any list so submitted.""",30
91,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Y a r r a ) [12.38] - My desire is that all returned men, whether members of an organization or not, shall have an opportunity to. join in the proposed nomination, though, in view of To that what the Chairman has just said, I cannot move now the amendment which I temporarily withdrew. Amendment agreed to.",30
92,Mr BRENNAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Batman) [12,41] I cannot accept the sub-clause in its present form, because the amendments have done nothing towards providing for an appointment in accordance with the wishes of a majority of the returned soldiers. As the sub-clause stood in the first place, the Government could say what in its opinion was a representative or an authentic organization of returned men, but it has given way on that point, because the Minister recognises that he will still have the power of selection, which is really all that matters. The Government will make their selection from the list of the organizations which they wish-to patronize, ancl, this being so, their apparent concession in agreeing 'to - accept nominations from any organization is of no advantage. He will accept nominations from any organization, but he will make the selection from the organization he wishes to patronize.",30
93,Mr ROUGEHS,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,That was obvious from the outset.,31
94,Mr BRENNAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"It was quite obvious to me; but I had hoped that, as a result of this discussion, the more democratic view would in some way be crystallized in language, and adopted. Effect ought to be given to the wishes of the returned soldiers in regard to this appointment. It is quite immaterial whether we say that the Governor General "" s h all "" or "" may"" appoint a Commissioner from among the men nominated by the soldiers, but we should ascertain what the majority of the soldiers desire, and give effect to it. I suppose this matter is not. likely to 'be re-opened, but if it is considered impracticable to take a ballot of all the returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth, whether or not they are members of organizations-and I can hardly understand the fanatical adherence of honourable members opposite to the principle of preference to unionists in this matter-w e should, in the last resort, having got a number of nominees from the different organizations, create such machinery as will enable them to make a selection from amongst their number. The Governor General might then appoint such person to be a representative of rJie soldiers upon the Commission.",31
95,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,It is quite competent for the organizations themselves to come to some agreement.,31
96,Mr BRENNAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The various bodies may themselves agree upon one nominee, but if they do not-and I think it more than probable that they will not, because we know that there aTe political antagonisms amongst returned soldiers, as there arc amongst others-patronag e will ultimately rest with the Government. That was never intended. The intention was that this appointment by the soldiers should be real, and not fictitious. Therefore, I support the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) in their efforts to secure a real choice by the returned soldiers, aud not merely a. nomination by the Government as to the particular organizations which shall berecognised.",31
97,Dr MALONEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Melbourne) [12.50] I do not think the returned soldiers are being given a square deal. Would anyhonorable member support, in connection!, with the election of members to this House, a system of allowing each constituency to nominate three persons from whom the Governor General should!.' select one? Why should we introducesuch a system in connection with the representation of returned soldiers? I prophesy that if by chance a ranker is. nominated, the' Governor General will not appoint him, but that an officer will be chosen. I also prophesy that a friend of Chris. Watson will be appointed to one of the posts. The third Commissioner is likely to be a legal gentleman.  the honourable member that there is notruth in the statement published in the press regarding the appointment of Commissioners.",31
98,Dr MALONEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I am not speaking: in a personal sense; but when I see a certain gentleman hovering about this building I know that something is to be done in which he is interested, and that something is usually done as he wishes it. Only by allowing the soldiers to elect, their own representative independent of the Governor General, who is here today and gone tomorrow, will the returned, soldiers have complete confidence in the Commission. Let each man's discharge bebis elector's right; and if a representative: is chosen by a ballot of the soldiers, there will never be the slightest disclaimer by any of the organizations. The ballot is. quite practicable, for the addresses of soldiers aTe known to the Department, and', they should be allowed to vote, by post. I warn honourable members that if the Government make the appointment, and therankers are given no representation, the soldiers as a body will not be contented.",31
99,Mr LISTER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Corio) [12.54] - I have -.noted a marked change in the opinions ..certain honourable members since the first Repatriation Bill was discussed in this 'chamber. When the original measure was 'before us, I pointed out t h at the great majority of returned soldiers at that were outside .the organizations, and I ""taken to task by certain members of Opposition because I had the temerity advocate that they should have some .cognition in connection with the appointby ment of the soldiers'' representative on administrative body.

116,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Wakefield) [2.19] - I endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), because, in my opinion, Parliament and the country have not had that information, which is their due. No doubt the initial stages of the repatriation scheme have been exceedingly important. We have been reminded by the Minister forRepatriation again and again that there, were no precedents to go on, and that entirely new ground had to be covered. Surely the initiation of a scheme of the kind, the laying down of a broad plan of operation, is as important as any subsequent part of the business can be; and we ought to know the why and wherefore of this special Commission. Clause 11, which deals with the powers and duties of the Commission, infers that the members will have a direct responsibility, dependently of the Minister, in initiating expenditure of amounts not exceeding £5,000. That, of course, is a big responsibility.",33

I may say, indeed, that I have an open mind as to whether I should support the appointment of any Commission in the absence of more justification.",33
119,Dr MALONEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Melbourne) [2.23] - It always seems to me that members of Parliament do not take notice of one salient fact. Mr Speaker receives £1,100, and is appointed only for the life of Parliament, or for so long as the party to which he belongs holds office. This officer, every three years, has - to face - the electors,, whereas appointments such as we now are considering are generally made for a longer term-in this instance, five yearsWhen Mr Denison Miller was appointed Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, the term was seven years, and that term was renewed by the Government when Parliament was in recess. Moreover, Mr. Miller's relative, Mr K'irkpatrick, is getting possibly thousands out of those unfortunate repatriated soldiers. Not only that, for there is a combine which includesan insurance company, and it is time to consider the two questions together. I shall certainly not vote for this clause unless the amount of the remuneration is set forth. Had it not been for the fixing of a certain sum of money in the case of the Governor General, Lord Hopetoun would have been given £20,000 a year instead of £10,000, which is the salary of the present Governor General. This is not our money, but the money of the public; and it is only right that we should know how these officers are to be appointed, and how much they are to be paid. I am offering no factious opposition, but if the information I ask is not forthcoming, I shall be compelled to voteagainst the clause.

In regard to remuneration, the salary of the Controller today is £900 or £1,000. nexion, I am in a difficulty, seeing that the Minister for"" Repatriation (Senator Millen) has been unwell for two or three days, and unable to attend to his duties. However, I should say that the salary the Commissioner would be £1,500, with £1,000 for each of the other Commisbeen sioners. It must be understood, however, that I am now speaking - without ""book,"" or without anything having been decided",34
123,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Surely you know Avhat is in the mind of the Minister for Repatriation.  is contemplated in this matter, because, for the last two or three days, I have no opportunity to consult the Minister.",34
124,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,What has the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) say?  surer could give no more information than I can. Dr MAT.ONBV - The newspapers set for t h those very figures.  that such salaries would 'not be excessive. The newspapers do not know what is to be paid. I regret I can give no more definite information.,34
125,Mr RICHAIJD POSTER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Are you talking in the first place of £1,500 a year for an expert man? I take it that the function of such a Commission is largely to control public expenditure, and see that we get the highest efficiency.  Commission will in various ways have the handling of many millions of money. It is essential that we should, have good men, and I do not think we can get them under the salaries I have mentioned.",34
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"ParramattaMinister for the Navy and Acting Treasurer) [2.29] - There seems to be a general idea in the Committee that something further should be said about the powers and functions of this body. As the M in  out, nothing has been arranged either in regard to the personnel or to the remuneration. One could not very well determine in the what remuneration to grant to a body u n t i l Parliament had settled what that and body was to do. A wrong impression is the liable to be created by the statement that the bulk of the work has already been In this condone. What is meant by that, of course, is that the initia l difficulties have been overcome. The organization has been set going. Considering all the difficulties in cidental to building up this great activity of out of the ground, wonderful work has been done. But only a beginning has made, and our obligations along these lines will remain u n t i l every man has been repatriated in the fullest sense - that is, until vocational training has been completed, which may take some years to compass-and must continue until men have been set up, for example, on the land, and until the money lent for that purpose has been repaid. Every day we are creating fresh liabilities in all had these respects, and. there wiU' be tremendous administrative functions for the new Commission. All that work is at its to beginning. The earlier work of creating the organization, which has been one of difficulty, has been performed. The administrative side of the Department is just opening out; and it was for the jnirpose of creating an administrative body to carry on, now that the organization has been firmly grounded, that this Bill was framed.",34
127,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"If the parties who created it have carried on to the satisfaction of the Minister, they should surely be considered when the new Commission is being appointed. Sir JOSEPH. COOK - The Government will-secure the best men it can find. If those men are in the Department, so much the better. I agree that, before going outside to look for ability, we must take care that we shall be securing better talent than exists inside. In the word ability, I include experience, administrative capacity, and many other things which go to make a first-class administrator. The mind of the Government is perfectly open upon these matters. Nothing has yet been arranged, so far as I know. No selections have been made. No one has been definitely and positively spoken of, and no salaries have been, fixed. That this body will have large and important functions to perform goes without saying. It will be a body corporate, to begin with.. sue,, and be sued. It will be a body comparable with the various railway administrations, aaid will bear relationship toMagisterial control in the same broad sense as do Railway Commissioners. So far as the administrative side is concerned, it will act independently. For example, the Commission will co-ordinate, the activities of the States. It will be the final Court o i Appeal from the subsidiary bodies, set up in each State; and, generally, it will control: and be responsible for all operations'..",34
128,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Did the ister say "" final Court of Appeal ""? 1 Sir J p SEPH COOK - Alway s subject to Ministerial veto, of course. What its precise and detailed functions may be will be determined later by regulations, and Parliament will have an opportunity of seeing and consideringthose regulations. May I also remind honourable members that this body will? take over the 'administration of pensions. It will connect, consolidate, and co-ordinate all the activities relating to the soldier, as far as: possible. Thus,, honoirable members will see that there will be very important functions to perform. There are some things, of course, which will necessarily determined by Ministerialauthority. Take, for instance, the matter of the scale of benefits. That wiU be a question of Government policy; but the Government having laid down the broad lines of its policy, the Commission will be, so far as details of administration are concerned, the final-Court. It will be the trustee of all the moneys issued from time, to* time. It will be responsible for collecting them;, and; for policing their expenditure. Generally, it will be for the Commission to see that all the activities set up by the Government are faith fully and adequately performed. Therefore, wa ought to be prepared to pay what w.emust pay to secure such a. Commission. We should get our men first, and. get the best men,, and then we should b» prepared to pay. them what we must in order' to, secure, them.. Consideration of the amount of salary, when, taken side by side with responsibility for millions of money, is, after all, comparatively minor. I hope honourable members will be assured, therefore, that the Government is full y alive to the importance of making the right appointments, and It may that they will be assured at the same time that we shall gravely and full y consider the payment - of salaries commensurate with the duties to be performed.",35
129,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Melbourne Ports) [2.38] - I differ from honourable members who. contend that the financial responsibility of the Commission, namely, up to a sum of £5,000, is too wide. This factor has a close connection with the question of salary. If the Commissioners are to be wholly under the control of the M in ister, and may not expend even as much as £5,000 upon their own responsibility, Min- what will be the use of paying them high salaries ? A first class clerk might as well be aippointed' to run the affairs of repatriation. I do not suggest that the Commission should have anything to dowith matters of policy, but that it should be given full administrative powers. I hope its freedom of action, up to the disbursement of £5,000, will not be restricted. Unfortunately, Departments, and even Ministers, have a bad habit of evading their financial responsibilities through spending more than the authorized maximum by means of carrying, out works in sections.",35
130,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"This Commission may do the same. be Mr MATHEWS - It may, bu t surely we are not going to force the Commission to submit every littl e project to the M in ister. I repeat that if the powers of the Commission are to be almost entirely cut down, it will be absurd to pay high salaries. Naturally, the Commission should be bound to work upon the basis of the Government's policy; but the Commissioners might as well be paid £500 a year if their duties are to extend no further than those of glorified clerks.  does not' suggest that the Commission should be empowered to make huge purchases entirely outside of Government control ?.",35
131,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Certainl y not. I have, always contended that heads of Departments should be given financial responsibility on a basis in proportion to the salaries paid them.",35

I presume that that would be the salary of our country. of the Chairman, and that the other Comthat missioners would receive a rather lower sum. Upon examination of the Estidiers mates, I note that the Comptroller of patriation receives £90 0 per annum. The extraordinary fact is that two officials under the Comptroller, namely, cipal Medical Officer and the Director of Vocational Training, each receive £1,00 0 per annum.  to get a good doctor for a lower salary.",36
133,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,I do not say so either; missioners. but what an extraordinary position would be if a factory manager were to drawing a lower salary than his foreman.,36
134,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,In certain administrative Departments we must often pay technical officers higher .salaries than the amount received by the head of the Department.  that the Comptroller of Repatriation not been paid as much as he should have received.,36
135,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I quite believe that. The Chairman of the Commission should at least receive as much as the most highly paid officer under him. I do not know of any such circumstances throughof out the Commonwealth Service as exist in the Repatriation Department today.  arises in ' other Departments. We have had to secure specialists, but could not hope to do so if we were to offer the scale of salary as applies to ordinary civil servants.",36
136,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"At present the Comptroller is responsible to the Minister for the manner in which the Department is run, yet he has men under him who are receiving higher salaries. I have nothing to say as to the ability of those men. I believe that the Director of Vocational Training has - very important work carry out.  rowed from the New South Wales Governbe ment. ' Mr TUDOR - I believe that he is very good officer, and it is important that the Department should employ the very best talent. I know that when technical training of soldiers first - I asked menced, the Department employed for were part of his time the Director of the Melrebourne Working Men's College, who is a n very excellent officer, and one who is wrapped up in the training of the youth, We have to recognise many of our returned nurses, as well as the widows and daughters of our solwho have lost their lives, are also Rereceiving training.

Of course, so far as the Repatriation Commissioners are concerned, very much will turn upon what is prescribed. has The words ""as is prescribed"" appear very frequently in this Bill . If they feel so inclined, the Government may, by regulation, extend to the Commissioners control which Parliament never intended they should have. Therefore, I hope that every care will be taken in the selection these gentlemen; otherwise, we may have cause to regret not limiting their powers.",36
138,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,There cannot be efficient administration of an Act unless same wide powers are given to the officials.,36
139,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,It all depends upon the way in which the powers are prescribed. Very often Parliament gives away too much of the control it should retain to itself.,36
140,Mr RODGERS,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,Sub-claus e 1 of clause 7 limits the powers of the Commission.,36
141,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"To an extent it does; but when the Minister for the Navy (Sir to Joseph Cook) said that they were to be similar to those of Railways Commis' sioners, I understood that they were to very wide indeed. I hope every care will be taken in the appointment of these a gentlemen, and that they will carry out their duties f a it h f u l ly and well. Possibly, if they are. given exceptional powers, they the may uproot much that has already been comdone, and initiate a new system. - Mr Francis (Henty) l[2.50:]. - I would like to have the assurance of the Minister and the Government that the Commission will be subject to the control of the Minister in all matters of policy. I believe that it should have the powers which, the Government seek to give it so long as every provision is made that those - powers are administrative only, and do not apply to matters of policy, more particularly to the establishment of a new system of repatriation.. In. other words, I hope that in matters of policy nothing can be done without the sanction , of the Minister.  do anything in the matter of policy without the sanction of the Minister.",36

144,Mr RODGERS,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"My reason for moving this amendment is primarily the announcement ' by the Minister for Repatriation in another place that much of the work of repatriation has been completed. Linked up with this work, we have, as now provided in the Bill, the administration of war pensions. nical and vocational training should all be completed in three years' time. Neither the work of land settlement nor the administration of the War Service Homes Act falls within the province of these Commissioners. They will simply be called upon to carry out that branch of repatriation work directly undertaken by the Commonwealth. If this means that at the end of three years we are to have two Pension Departments in Australia, this .Commission administering war pensions, and the Treasury administering invalid and old-age pensions, we sire again setting up that dual system of control to which so much objection has been raised in Australia. My proposal to limit the term of office of these Commissioners to three years will not prevent the Government from renewing their appointments. The work of repatriation is a matter which has been created by the war, and is of a temporary character. I hope that we shall not perpetuate any expenditure that we can get rid of. We have heard it repeated over and over again that, as soon as possible, all expenditure associated with war activities will cease. That is my reason for proposing to limit the period of the appointment of the Commissioners. 'The Minister has asked me how we can expect men to offer their services for such a limited term. That objection will not apply to Commissioners who are selected from members of the present Repatriation Staff, and as regards the gentlemen chosen from outside «* the Service, it will not be so much the terms of the appointment that will attract them as it will be a desire among the soldiers themselves to select men who can help to unravel their problems. No doubt the soldiers' organizations contain very brainy men, who will come forward at a salary of £1,000 a year to help to solve the problems of repatriation for their comrades. In any case, Parliament should show some evidence of a desire to get rid of war expenditure and of needless departments as quickly as possible. I want to see the work effectively carried out for the balance of the period of repatriation, and if I thought that my amendment would in any way limit the effectiveness^ of the Commissioners' operations, I would not move it.",37
145,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Is it necessary to fix any term of office? Tech- Mr Rodgers - I think so, in regard to mem drawn from outside the Service, but in taking a forecast of repatriation work, I cannot conceive that in five years time there will still be need for active administration. There may be the work of the collection of loans advanced to soldiers, and there will be the matter of the administration of the War Pensions Act, but I object to the inauguration of a new Department to deal with a branch of the work which is likely to. outlive the other activities of repatriation, and which means the creation of two Pensions Departments, and two sets of officers to do work which one Department could effectively undertake. Dr. EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [2.59] I have naiuch pleasure in supporting the amendment. I might not have adopted this latftitude if there had been an inversion of the order in which the clauses appear in the Bill . If , for instance, clause 11,. which deals with the powers the Commissioners will exercise> could have been 'fully discussed at an. earlier stage, so that the Committee could have had a knowledge of what those powers really would be, good' reason might have been shown for appointing the Commissioners for the full term of five years-; but as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) has pointed out, the activitiesof the Repatriation Commission may easily be totally unnecessary at the end of three years. In deciding this issue we have missed 'the point from the very beginning, largely owing to the fact that we commenced a process of setting out upon a voyage without any definite plans. The Minister for Repatriation in one of his early speeches said that he had determined to 'let events shape his course. As the result of that policy we find the States today completely controlling What, from the ifnancial point of view, is f)he most important part of repatriation. I refer to soldier settlement. were any means whereby the Commission could supervise land settlement and expedite the work of. the States in that respect, I should agree with the Minister that more than five years would elapse before the activities of the Commission ceased. Mr BURCHE.TX - But the wealth does not control the laud.",37
146,Dr EARLE PAGE,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The Commonwealth, in handing over to the Spates the expenditure of millions of pounds in connection - with the settlement of returned soldiers on the land, surely ought to have retained some control over that expenditure, and the determination of the rate at which it should take place. I am the president of a Local Repatriation Committee covering two shires and two municipalities, and for the last eighteen months have been in active control of it . We have had men waiting for land for fifteen months, and have been unable to obtain any satisfaction from ' the Returned Soldiers Settlement Branch of the Lands Department of New South Wales. I do not suppose that we have on<our books the name of a man who has not been try in g for at least six months to reach finality. No outside business concern would have handed over to another body the expenditure of i u g e sums 'of money without retaining some control over it , and being represented by officers to 'expedite the work and to see that the men got a fair deal. The position is 'that men come back, anxious to. go on the land, and keenly desirous of making homes for themselves. Unfortur nately, owing to delay in dealing with their applications they have, month after month, to lounge about street corners or over hotel bars. Their applications are approved by the local authorities-by the Local Repatriation 'Committees and by the local valuers-ye t they cannot reach finality.",38
147,Mr RODGERS,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,And - meantime the Commonwealth is paying sustenance money.,38
148,Dr EARLE PAGE,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,All the time.,38
149,Mr ELEMING,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,".Does not the trouble arise from the fact that, the States will not hand .over their land ? Dr EARLE ,PAGE - That may be so; At the .inception of the repatriation movement, I put before the then Premier If there of New South Wales (Mr Holmaiv), who in January of last year transmitted it to the Commonwealth Government, a proposition such as that advocated by the Empire Resources Development Commission .in connection with the extinction of the war debt of England, which would Common- have - enabled the' Commonwealth, by the simple process of resumption, to secure control of a certain area of' land.",38
150,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,Order! The honourable member is now going beyond the question before the Chair.,38
151,Dr EARLE PAGE,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I am dealing with the question of whether the appointment of the Commission should be for - three or 'five years. If the Commission could deal with the establishment of in dustries there might also be some reason for a five years appointment. . Almost every day we read in the press of ' demands by ifarmers and others for the establishment of woollen mills and flour mills on a 'co-operative basis, and' of appeals 'for assistance made by them to the Minister for Repatriation. Is this Commission to have anything to do with such propositions.? I should-like, even at this late hour, to suggest that the money to - be expended on repatriation has not yet been eaten into to such an extent as to prevent the adoption of a comprehensive - and complete system of repatriation in certain parts of Australia which would enable the members of the Commission to hold office with satisfaction and credit the country, not for five years, but for - the whole of their lives. The money so far expended on repatriation has been distributed, with good intentions, sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely; but it is not going to be of any permanent benefit to the soldiers who have been assisted.",38
152,Mr MAXWELL,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,Because of want of system.,39
153,Dr EARLE PAGE,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Absolutely . would urge now, as I suggested some time ago to the Government of New South Wales, and later on to the Government of the Commonwealth, the adoption of a definite comprehensive scheme that would permit of the settlement of 50,000 or 75,000 soldiers in an area where already there are a certain number of homesteads, so that it would not be completely given over to soldier settlement. There occur to me immediately two suitable areas. One is in the Clarence and Richmond Rivers district, while another is in the southern part of New South Wales and the, northern part of Victoria. would' lend itself to such a proposition. In both cases power plant, could be installed by harnessing water very cheaply. Eighty per cent, of the area consists of Crown lands, so that there ought not to be much trouble about its resumption. If a power scheme were developed, we should be able to establish not merely settlements of returned soldiers, but secondary industries",39
154,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,I must again ask the honourable member to confine himself to the question before the Chair.,39
155,Dr EARLE PAGE,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wannon.,39
156,Mr RILEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"South .Sydney) [3.8] - I am pleased that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) has submitted this amendment, and that at least one member of the Country party has promised to support it. It is a fair and reasonable proposition, and, I think, will meet with the support of most membe'rs of the Opposition. We must not forget that this clause provides for the setting up of new administrative machinery. The Commission, under the amendment, will have three years to demonstrate its fitness for the work; and at the end of to that time, if it has proved its usefulness, there can be no doubt that whatever Government is in power will re-appoint it for a further term. This House is elected for a period of only three years, and I think the amendment is a cautious provision to make. If it be agreed to, we shall be able lateT on to negative the clauses providing for the administration of the war pensions scheme by. the Repatriation Department. The Invalid I and Old-age Pensions Branch of the Treasury is undoubtedly the best in the Commonwealth, and it should not be superseded by an outside body in the administration of war pensions.",39
157,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Wakefield) [3.11] - I shall support the amendment, since I am just as doubtful as I was previously as to the wisdom of appointing a Commission. Its success or otherwise must depend upon the developments of the immediate future. There are three sections ef repatriation work. In the first place, we have vocational training, which,, under ordinary conditions, should Each come to an end some five years hence. Then we have the war pensions section, and finally the section dealing with the building of homes. It is very doubtful whether the war pensions system could be better administered than it is by the Treasury at the present time - We are not likely to have in the Repatriation Department men who will give greater satisfaction than have the Treasury officers who have been charged with the administration of the war pensions scheme up to date. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - The medical service side of the Department will extend over far more than five years.",39
158,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,Do we need a Commission to deal with the medical side?,39
159,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I think so. Mr RICHARD FOSTER, - I disagree with the right honourable gentleman. The medical side will not be difficult to handle. My trouble is in regard to the homes construction branch of the Department, in connection with which we need to have men of splendid qualifications. The Department has made up its mind that in Victoria it can do this work more effectively and more cheaply itself than by letting contracts. I am not in a position at the present moment to show that that is so; but I remind the Minister that things may change considerably. Under the present abnormal conditions, the Government may be justified in the course that it is taking in Victoria, but three or four years hence things may be very different. In South Australia, 500 homes have now been completed, and contracts have been let for another 500. I ask the Minister to send one of his officers to see what is being donethere under the contract system. If he does so, it will be found that the houses are cheaper and better built than those that are being put up in Victoria. The ceilings, instead of being 9 feet high, are nearer 12 feet.",39
160,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,The honourable member is now going beyond the amendment.,40
161,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I know what the report will be if the Government sends a competent officer to South Australia. If the work is to be done by the Department, the best and most efficient .administrator is needed to supervise it, and such a man cannot be got for £1,500. Indeed, we could afford to pay £5,000 for the right man. I ask the Minister whether the Commission is not to be responsible for this work ? ",40
162,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Then make the term three years, instead of five years.",40
163,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Illawarra) [3.18] - I am in favouirof the amendment. At the commencement of the repatriation activities, I urged the Minister to adopt the system which he is now adopting; but it seems to me to be rather late in the day to make these new proposals. The foundation work of repatriation has now been practically finished, and it has been carried out, so far as the Central Administration is concerned, by the Minister and his principal officer, who has been drawing a salary of only £900 a year. Now it is chiefly the finishing work that remains; yet for that is proposed the appointment of a Commission, consisting of a chairman, to receive £1,500 a year, and two others at £1,000 a year each; so that we shall be paying £3,500 for routine and supervisory work, which, as every one knows, is much easier than the laying down of foundational principles.  sioners now, and the new Commissioners will take their place.",40
164,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The present Commissioners are honorary, and we have to pay only their expenses.",40
165,Mr MCDONALD,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,There will still be the extra Minister for Repatriation.,40
166,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"He will be needed for the present. My objection is that we are setting up quite unnecessarily a costly Department for which there is not sufficient work. Senator Millen has said over and over again in public that the business of getting the men back to their civil occupations is practically finished, and even if he had not said it , we ourselves would know that today there are comparatively few of the 300,000 soldiers who returned who are still looking for employment. Only some 25,000 men still remain to be repatriated. Yet it is at this stage that we are asked to authorize a very costly new system. Senator Millen and his officials have earned the thanks of the community for the efficient manner in which they have carried out the difficult work of organizing the Repatriation Department. The difficulties of that work have been nearly surmounted, and what now remains to be done is .merely the amending of regulations, the extension of benefits, and mere routine work that does not call for the great capacity for organization that was needed in the early stages of repatriation. Therefore it seems to me that the proposal of the Returned Soldiers Association, which is what we are now considering-becaus e I am sure that if the Cabinet, unshackled by promises, could look only at the work of repatriation in its present stage, this proposal would not be before Parliament",40
167,Mr CORSER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,The honourable member should go to Queensland.,40
168,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The representatives of each State must speak for that State. My experience is that the greatest complaints in respect of repatriation concern land administration. At the' beginning, when I urged that if we found money for land settlement, we - should control t'he spending of it* or at least have a voice in its expenditure, we were told that the States owned the land, and that they must be allowed to carry - out 'that work. But it is the Commonwealth 'that is now get-tiing ""the - blame for inefficient land - settlement - administration, - and it is ithe soldiers who are sufferingtfromi t . There is, 'however, nothing in - the Bill .to .arm the Commissioners with power to interfere. If there were, there might be some justification for their appointment. I see no justification for the expenditure contemplated in the Bill, which is to extend over a period of five years. Personally, I do not - think that there - will be work for ,the Commissioners for a period of three years, unless the payment of pensions is handed 'over to them as an - excuse for the continuance of their office. The pensions work is now being done efficiently; fewer complaints come to us in regard to the Pensions Department than in regard to any other. But now, after probably 75 per cent, of the pensions work has been done, we are .asked to create a new staff to take over duties that are now being performed efficiently by other officers. That is not economical, aajd the change is not warranted by the facts of the case. No reason has been given why the present pensions arrangements should be disturbed in order to find work for these Commissioners, who otherwise will have very little to do. Personally, I am prepared to vote for a three years' term, in order that the Government may keep the rjromises made at the election, and to the Returned Soldiers League, but I am >not prepared at the present time to go beyond that.  Home and Territories) [3.23] - It seems to me that the numbers are up, and therefore I must with great reluctance accept the amendment, though it will materially limit our selection. Still, I do not wish to prolong discussion when honourable members have made up their minds. I wish I could take as sanguine a view as those who say that we are in sight of the end. I have pointed out that, in regard to finding employment, we are nearing the end; but there is much other work for the Commijsion to do on behalf of the returned soldiers. I have had as much to do with repatriation as any member.",40
169,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"More .  thing is satisfactory in the Pension* Branch surprises me. - Mr Riley - That is the case in New South Wales. Mr - B0YNT0N - It is 'complained that, at present, 'information respectingpensions has to 'be sought under two - ear three different - roofs, and that the war pensions administration is on - different; lines - from those followed, in. regard to old age and invalid pensions.",41
170,Mr HECTOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"LAMOND - It is - my experi; ence that pension matters ;are - dealt - wi'iih. more promptly, and finalized more? quickly, than any - others.",41
171,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"That is the experience in* Victoria, too.  cause it is often easier to deal with a pension application than with some - other applications that may ""be made on behalf of a returned soldier. I do not wish to speaikr on the land question, because it is not; dealt with in the Bill. I think that if the amendment is carried, we shall, at the end. of three years, have to re-appoint the Commission. MT. TUDOR (Yarra) [3.27] - When L first saw the Bill, I was inclined to think the provision for a five years' term a fair one. I was surprised to learn by thespeeeh of the honourable member for I l l a wa-rra (Mr Hector Lamond) that this B i ll is the result of promises made byCabinet to the Returned Soldiers LeagueMr HECTOR LAMOND:-No .

174,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I have never, since I have been a member of this House, made a private promise to any organization. The honourable member for Illawarra stated that if the Cabinet considered this matter untrammelled by the promises it made to the Returned Soldiers League, we should have a different Bill.",41

J! have no intention of delaying the Bill, 1 and' later I shall be prepared to move an - Amendment leaving the administrationof pensions as it is today. I congratulate the honourable member for Wannon on - the victory he has obtained', and I hope - that on subsequent clauses also, the Minister wiM be foundi n a better frame of mind, so that this Bill may be made as perfect as possible before it leaves this 'Chamber.

178,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Yarra) [3.33] - I move That the words "" or as are prescribed"" in - subclause. 1 be struck out. If the amendment is carried the Commission will be able to exercise such - powers and perform such duties as are - conferred upon it by this Act. - authority is wide enough.",42
179,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The sub-clause .us at present worded is most dangerous. It would allow the operations of the Commission to exceed the provisions of this measure. Mr TUDOR,-That would be a - dangerous power to give. The Commission would have authority to do things that are not contemplated by the Bill itself.  in any Bill introduced by a Labour Oovemment they ever tied themselves in iiny way.",42
180,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I cannot recall any measure introduced by a Labour Government which included words such as those to which I am taking exception: Of 1 course inmost measures there is the usual clause empowering the Governor General to. make regulations consistent with the Act;, that. is. quite' right,, but the powers proposed to be> given bythis sub-clause 1 arefar too: wide. The wonds "" or as are prescribed?' wouldenable the Commission to do anything.; it could, construct a railway from Oodnadatta' to. Port Darwin underthe authority of the Repatriation Act.",42
181,Mr WEST,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"East Sydney). [3.35] The caution which the Committee has received from the Leader of the Opposition should' be seriously considered!. The words which he has proposed to strike out would' give to theCommission' powers which no honourable member would be agreeable to give: We all' know that regulations by the bucketful can be issued so longas they comply with the Act; the Privy Council decided' in a Queensland case that the Executive may issue any regulation that does not exceed the powers conferred' by the Act. The Committee - should be careful to not insert in the Bill' a powerthat may not bein accordance with the wish of the Parliament. The Commissioners would' not be infallible, and we should beware of giving them unlimited authority. Unfortunately, during - the last few years there have been too many Commissions and regulations, and Parliament has been ignored. The amendment representsa wise precaution.",42
182,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [3.40] That The Committee need to have no fear of the wording, of the sub-clause. The words to which exception has been taken are essential in order to give a certain elasticity in the carrying out of the general purposes of the Act.",42
183,Mr RICHAUD,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,'FOSTER - Will this subclause enable the Executive to pass regulations that are not in conformity with the Act?,42
184,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"All the regulations must be in conformity with the Act. '""' Prescribed "" is a technical term, and is defined by the Acts Interpretation Act of 1904 as meaning ""prescribed by the Act or by the regulations under the Act."" The Commission will have the powers which are already expressly contained in the Act. Only a limited number of powers are specified as being vested particularly in the Commission; for instance, the Commission has power to make recommendations to the Governor General in Council. The Executive must be responsible for everything that) is done by regulation. We have' provided that the Commission shall, subject "" to the. control of the Minister,'' be charged with the administration of the Act. The idea is to vest in one body many powers which at present are scattered through various Departments. We are endeavouring to vest in one authority all matters relating to administration, but always subject to Ministerial control. The powers of the Commission will be those set out' in the Bill, and such others as may be prescribed. They will be mostly in connection with administration.",42
185,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,This is only allowing the Executive to prescribe powers within the terms of the Act.,43
186,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Exactly . It is essential in administration to have some elasticity, or otherwise we may find ourselves at a "" dead end."" For instance, in the Census Act it is provided that the Governor General may appoint a statistician who 'shall have such powers, and perform such duties, as are conferred upon him by regulation.",43
187,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"But this Bill goes much further. ,",43
188,Mr RILEY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,The Statistician has the spending power of the Commission.,43
189,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Because the Statistician is in an entirely different position. However, the words "" such as are prescribed "" mean only such regulations as are made in accordance with the Bill.",43
190,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,The Bill' is the very source of the power.,43
191,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"We cannot go beyond the Bill, and it would be a mistake, in the interests, of the Department, and of the soldiers themselves, if we were to take away this essential elasticity.",43
192,Mr MARR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Parkes) [3.47] - I oppose the amendment because, after hearing the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), I think it necessary that the words should be retained. As to the powers of the Commission, I should like to give some illustrations of where improvements could be made in .administration. In the case of the soldier settlers, particularly on the Yanko irrigation area, the Commonwealth Government make available to the State Government of New South Wales an amount equal to £625 for improvements, but the men are not allowed, to spend this money as they like. They cannot buy the particular, class of farming implements which they think suitable, whereas civilian settlers on the same area, with the same grant from the State Government may purchase their implements at discretion. Then, again, as we know, men who intend to get married are given a furniture grant, but those who go on the land, and are also desirous of getting married, have to purchase the furniture out of the £625.",43
193,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,The men in the town are given only £35 for furniture.,43
194,Mr MARR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"That would be of assistance in the country, too.",43
195,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,Muc h furniture cannot be purchased for that amount now.,43
196,Mr MARR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"That is so; but a small amount is better than nothing. Another source of complaint is that different rates of sustenance allowance are paid in town and in country. In the country only a small amount is allowed, on the principle, I believe, that the men who receive it are not so much under the supervision of the officials as are the men in the city. The absence of Local Committees to supervise these men is no reason why not they should not be paid the same amount as are the men in the city. I can bear out what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has said in regard to the war service homes. I am sure that all who have seen the homes are convinced of the fine work the Commission is doing; but no honourable member has mentioned the most pleasing feature, namely, that every man employed in the building of such homes, in most centres, is a returned soldier who has been vocationally trained. That speaks volumes for the efficiency of training, and no doubt does much to overcome the difficulty of the shortage of labour.",43
197,Mr LAZZARINI,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Werriwa) [3.53] Despite the. explanation of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) I must support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). The issue of regulations such as we have seen so frequently in the past, seems to be threatening the very basis of parliamentary government. The Government are the exeeutive of the country, but, still, they ought to be responsible to Parliament for more of their actions than they are at present. The Government are given too much authority under clauses which empower them to prescribe regulations, and, in my opinion, they should not have any more power than Parliament is prepared to give them. In spite of what the Minister for Works and Bailways (Mr Groom) has told us, I venture to say that, under this clause, the Commission will go much further in its activities than, perhaps, we are prepared to allow. The repatriation scheme extends into muuy branches of our national life, and as the Leader of. the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has said, the Commission, under the powers proposed, might even build a railway, seeing that they have to find-employment. It is absolutely necessary that the Commission should be restricted within the four corners of the Bill , and if the measure does not prove sufficient for its purposes, the Government can come to Parliament and seek an amendment.",43
198,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Robertson) [3.56] I understand that the Government do not propose to accept the amendment, and I . hope it w i ll be rejected by a large 1 majority of ' the Committee. The tendency, this afternoon is altogether to restrict too much the powers and authority given by the Bill . There must be a certain amount , of elasticity in all'Acts-of Parliament) and we have been told by a legal member of the Government that nothing' can be done by the Commission outside the four corners of the Bill.' Under the circumstances, I see no reason for any fear; and, moreover, I ' regard this as one of the chief clauses in the Bill . I am glad to see that the Government intend to co-ordinate as far as possible the' whole of the activities in connection with repatriation. If anything, indeed, I Tegret that the Government Have not gone much further, and dealt more definitely with the land settlement phase. Until land settlement is brought directly under the control of the Commissioners we shall continue to have disastrous delays and disappointments. At the same time, I protest against any restriction of the powers of the Commis[58] sioners under the Bill . The whole measure is an enlargement of the ixin&tions of repatriation; it is a broadening of the scope and benefits to the men who are to receive their just reward, and I hope nothing will' be done in the way of restricting the administration. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. WILLIAMSTO WN SHIPBUILDING YARD . Motion (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That the Housedo now adjourn.",44
199,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Melbourne Ports) [4.0] - Rumours are being circulated in my district with respect to the shipbuilding yard at Williamstown. ""We have been told that the firm of Vickers has made an offer to purchase the establishment, thus doing away with Government control. Also it has been stated that Thompson and Company Proprietary Limited, of Castlemaine, intend to purchase the Williamstown yard. My constituents feel that they would be far better ofF if the Government were to continue shipbuilding activities. There is also the announcement of the Government with"" respect to the 12,00Q-ton ships, none of which is to be built in Victoria. It has been stated that Williamstown is not fitted for the construction of such large \ easels, but experts have assured me that ships, of much, greater dimension than have so far been constructed, there could be successfully built and launched. Can the Government furnish an assurance of their intention to continue the shipbuilding industry in my electorate, and to do so more extensively rather than cut down activities 1  Home and Territories) [4.4],-There are only two yards in Australia under present conditions capable of building the larger typo of ship indicated. Those are at Walsh Island and at Cockatoo Island. It does not follow, however, that larger ships than have hitherto been constructed, cannot be built and launched at Williamstown. I have been assured that for a limited expenditure an 8,000ton vessel could ""be turned out at Will liamstown. It has been officially considered that the Williamstown yard could be full y utilized for the building of the smaller types of vessel, and that the other yards, which arc capable of turning out the bigger ships, should be devoted to that' purpose. With respect to the rumours indicated by the honourable member, the Prime Minister has just handed me a note, upon reading twhich I understand thut an offer has been made for the Will liamstown yard. I take it that Cabinet will consider the matter.",44
200,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"Yarra) [4.7] - This is n vary serious position. What nn outcry would be raised in any of the States if , for example, an announcement were made respecting offers for the private purchase of the railway workshops. If there is one thing in the world which trade and commerce requires, it is the construction of more ships. What will become of the Williamstown industry if the Government hand it over to private interests? Surely Parliament will be given an opportunity of considering the proposition .before anything drastic is done. .have been informed only recently that private enterprise has not been able to - build as cheaply in other parts of the - world as Government employees have been, able to do here. The ships constructed in America, and which the Commonwealth Government returned to those who had built them, were such that the private parties concerned would not take delivery.",45
201,Mr MAHOKY,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"The trouble is that they - did so, and worked the ships for'many trips and made huge profits, and. that then they returned them instead of - accepting and paying for them.",45
202,Mr TUDOR,LAND SETTLEMEN TANDWAK SERVICE,"I believe that was the case.  wrong impression which I had gained by a hasty reading of the Prime Minister's note. I find that the message is to the effect that no offer has been received for the purchase of the Williamstown yard. Honourable members, no doubt, will be relieved. No departure will be made from the Government's present policy there. If an offer of such a nature had come to hand the Government would have consulted Parliament before taking definite action. Mr TUDOR ; - I am very glad to hear that. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bouse adjourned at 4.9 p.m. We",45
