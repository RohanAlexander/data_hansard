DAYS OF MEETING - BUSINESS tical OF SESSION.",14
7,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay-Prime Minprolonged ister ancl Treasurer) [3.6] - I move That the House, for the remainder of the session, unless otherwise ordered, meet on Monday at 3 o'clock p.m., and that the of meeting on each Tuesday, Wednesday, ancl Thursday be 10.30 o'clock a.m. On behalf of the Government I wish to say-by no means as a threat-that we must, before the session closes, deal with the business which it is imperative to consider. It is only possible to have twenty .sittings before Christmas, but by strenuous effort we hope to get through, and, at the same time, to provide a reasonable opportunity for the full discussion of all the measures undertaken. In addition to the business already on the notice-paper, we intend to introduce a Bill giving the public servants the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, a general Bill providing for the issue of Commonwealth stock, and a measure of minor importance amending die Australian Notes Act. - To what effect?",14
8,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In respect to the ^7,000,000 limit for the 25 per cent, reserve. A Naval Defence Bill must also be passed.",14
9,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,And the Navigation Bill?,14
10,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The second reading will be moved by the Minister in charge, but esthe further consideration of the measure We do not require of honourable members that they shall pass all the measures on the notice paper. Those which it is considered necessary to pass are the Commonwealth Bank Bill, the Public Service Arbitration Bill, the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, the Seamen's Compensation Bill, the Kalgoorlie Westto Port Augusta Railway Bill, the Purthe chase Telephone Lines Acquisition Bill, and In addition, there are one or two items of of policy to engage attention, which I am not at liberty to speak upon now.",14
11,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat) [3.9] - The GoPrime Minister was never more sanguine has than in the just delivered statement of the The Opposition is of the opinion that the general as principles, of the Commonwealth Bank Bill Parliahaving been discussed f u l ly during the second-reading debate, the measure may now be dealt with clause by clause, in pracand business-like fashion. In regard to neither it nor any other will debate be beyond the point at which it can be useful. Within the limits of their responsibility, we on this side are anxious to each facilitate the transaction of business. Some time exception will be taken to the proposal that' we shall meet on Mondays at 3 p.m. For Victorian representatives it means only an additional sitting day. The representatives of New South Wales, however, having arrived home on Saturday morning, would have tp leave again on Sunday evening, whilst the representatives of South Australia would reach home on Saturday morning, and have to leave again for Melbourne on Saturday evening, since there is no Sunday train from Adelaide. The proposal is equally inconvenient to representatives of Tasmania. I suggest to the Prime Minister that, since we shall be sitting extremely long hours if the remaining proposals are adopted, he might forego, until about the last week, his proposition that the House should meet on Monday, and substitute for it a proposal that we meet every Tuesday morning at 10.30.' The representatives of South Australia, leaving home on Monday night, would be here by that time, and the representatives of New South Wales, also leaving home on Monday, instead of Sunday, night, could be here two or three hours after the House met. From the opportunity I have had of ascertaining the general feeling of honourable members on this side of the .House, I believe they are prepared to make practically the sacrifice that the Government asks, except that in the particular direction to which I have referred the sacrifice is considerable, while the gain cannot be material. It will seriously inconterests venience every honourable member who lives outside this State or whose business calls him beyond it . Since we are disposed to meet the Government, so far as our responsibilities will allow, by confining ourselveb to such criticism as is essential in order the Ministry and the public may be properly informed, the Prime Minister would probably find himself in a better position to make a further demand on the House should it become necessary at a later stage, by refraining from making 'this demand for meeting on Mondays until it is peremptory.",14
12,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wentworth) [3.13] - I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister does not intend to carry out the whole purpose of the proposals he has just submitted. I have on previous occasions complained of this practice, so that it cannot be said that I am objecting to it because it is made by the present Government. The duty of the Parliament should be, not to carry as much legislation as it can through a session, but to pass as much as it can pass in a satisfactory manner.",15
13,Mr WEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Do as little work as possible !,15
14,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I cordially agree with the honourable member in the belief tha: a man can do better work in eight hours than he can if you make him work all day ! 1 cannot understand why the honourable member should claim a privilege for persons outside, when he is prepared to deny, without the slightest consideration, the same privilege to the Opposition, who are charged with the duty of public criticism of public proposals.",15
15,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,This is a sweating proposal.,15
16,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is. It is absurd enough that of all trades in this country the trade of the politician is the one that requires no apprenticeship. It is bad enough that we should be sent here without any proof that we are fit to be here to examine public measures. But the position becomes absolutely absurd if we are not given a reasonable opportunity to examine public measures before we are expected to deal with them in 'this Chamber. I do not know how we can be expected to carry out our duty if we are to have measure after measure slung at us, and have no time in which to closely examine those measures before we proceed to debate them. I do not think this proposal is in the inof the country, although it may be in the interests of the Ministerial reputation in the country. I wish to speak quite frankly to honourable members opposite. The proposal now before us is not new. It has been made by every Government since that I have been a member of this House, and I have been equally warm in denouncing it regardless of the Government from which it emanated. I cannot help realizing that the reputation of the Government may not necessarily mean the welfare of the country in this connection. The reputation of the Government depends on. getting through as much business as they can possibly place on an electoral placard. They want a certain number of measures passed. At the end of a session we find thirty or forty measures on the list, many of them, Supply Bills or others, requiring very little consideration. The object of this practice is to secure numbers, not quality. Our object should be, T think, to deal with every measure submitted to us with due discretion and absolute prudence, so that we can say that no measure is passed that is not carefully considered. Is it not notorious that much of our time year after year has been spent in amending Acts that have been hurriedly passed? Is that not conclusive proof of my statement that this House does not devote itself much to the duty of passing its measures wisely as it does to the desire of passing as many as the Government choose to subcriticise m jt?",15
17,Mr HALL,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Thos e passed at the beginto ning of a session require to be amended just as often as do those passed at the of a session.,16
18,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If there is anything at all in my argument, and I submit that there is, it must apply infinitely more strongly when Bills are submitted - which the House cannot have a reasonable opg portunity of criticising. What sort chance do the Government expect the Optically position to have of criticising any measure that is submitted during the period elapse before this Parliament is prorogued ? We shall be here every day from 10.30 a.m. until 11 p.m. We have to sleep-although my honourable friends opposite may feel that it would be better, perhaps, if we were bull-dozed into a state of mental side ! exhaustion-and what time is left to examine measures ? Is it fair to put upon a House of this character such a strain? Is it not prostituting the National assembly to so work it out, and give it no chance to consider the measures submitted to it? ask my honourable friends to be reasonable, and to see this matter apart altogether from narrow party interests and advantages, The honourable member for Eden-Monaro suggests a number pf ingenious methods which business might be expedited. I not hear the Prime Minister say how far - the Government are. committed to deal this days. session with the somewhat difficult question of the Tariff..",16
19,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable memthe ber must not discuss that question.,16
20,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Prime Minister - gave as the reason for this proppsal the - measures that he intended to introduce - during the remainder of the session. - submit that I should be in order in cussing as a reason why this proposal - should not be granted,16
21,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable memdoes ber would not be in order in discussing the merits of any one pf those particular tipns.,16
22,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not propose to - cuss the merits of the Tariff, but the - orable member for Eden-Monaro has just suggested to me that if we did not consider the Tariff this session, we might deal with it on Boxing Day. I urge upon the Prime so Minister the necessity of considering the welfare of the country, and to give the Opposition a reasonable opportunity to the measures submitted to the House. If the Prime Minister will not go the length of enabling the House to meet during reasonable hours, sit a reasonable end time, and do its business in a reasonable w a v > w e might, at any rate, have our Monday free. This is not a matter of personal importance to myself, because I long since found that constant travelling at the week end interfered with my work here. I re« d the adjournment from Friday to Tuesof day as affording a most valuable, and practhe only, opportunity for inquiry into the Government measures to be subto nutted. When an honourable member has d e a l t with his correspondence, he finds the ^st time for considering measures in advance to be during-the week-ends,  - three weeks of the session left, at the out",16
23,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"But I understand that the measures to be submitted are considered by the Government to be of importance. The Prime Minister will do great dis-service to the country if he persists in forcing I a number of proposals through Parliament without affording *a proper opportunity for examination. I do not urge that a proposal of this kind is peculiar to the present Prime Minister, because the practice has by been resorted to by previous Governments, did though, so far as I am aware, we have never hitherto been asked to sit on Mon",16
24,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think not; the previous Government took the other course of gagging Opposition on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays !",16
25,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the Prime Minister has the courage of his convictions, and he thinks the Opposition are abusing their I privileges, he ought to bring the "" gag "" into disoperation. I am glad that the Honorary Minister has, by his interjection, shown what is at the back of his mind; he not think it well to apply the "" gag,"" but rather to resort to a process of exhausquesticn. It is the absolute duty of the Government tp apply the "" gag,"" if it is disthought that the Opposition, instead of hpncriticising, are deliberately setting themselves to talk measures out, or howl, as Government supporters did when they were on this side of the House. The Standing Orders have deliberately placed",16
26,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Will the honourable member discuss the question before the Chair?,17
27,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The question is that it is necessary to give extended time to business, because, as it is now suggested, honourable members on this side have unduly protracted discussion.",17
28,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is not the question before the Chair.,17
29,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"1 submit, with all deference, that the interjection just made by the Honorary Minister",17
30,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"As the honourable member knows, interjections are disorderly.",17
31,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then I deeply regret that this interjection should have come from the Ministerial bench. If honourable members on this side had abused their rights of criticism, arid Ministers had no power to deal with them, it would have been reasonable to ask for extra sittings; but the House has deliberately given any Ministry power to apply the closure, and it is the duty of the Government to act on that power. Why should the guilty and the innocent suffer alike? Why should honourable members, who devote themselves to proper criticism, suffer for those who indulge in "" stone-walling,"" though, of this, I have seen nothing during the session? The proposal of the Government is dangerous, and not in the public interest, ancl it will tend to militate against fulness of a deliberative ancl legislative Chamber like this. I regret that the Government should have gone a step further than any previous Government' in making this House a mere registering automaton of their decrees, instead of a place where their views and intentions should receive the most earnest criticism for the welfare of the people of Australia.",17
32,Mr BAMFO RD,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Herbert) [3.27] When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, I was reminded of the old saying which bids us beware of the Greeks when they bring gifts. Nothing, in my opinion, could suit the Opposition better than the adoption of this motion, because, either business must be done in a slip-shod way, or some of the measures must be jettisoned. I am sorry that for once I find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Wentworth. Business of Session. thought the Leader of-the Opposition was favouring the motion with a sinister motive, but it seems to me, in view of the utterances of the honourable member for Wentworth, that mere is no concerted action 011 the part of the Opposition. I am totally opposed ro the motion. There is no reason whatever for hurrying legislation on. There is nothing sacrosanct about Christmas, and we can sit just as well after that festivity as before, and finish the business in a reasonable and proper way. You, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Maranoa, and others are particularly interested in this matter, for, if we rise at Christmas, the natural assumption is a session beginning in A p r i l, or not later than May ; and that means that we should have to visit our constituencies during the monsoonal period. During the referendum campaign, I was in my constituency, but was unable to get about on account of the heavy rains, and we may anticipate similar weather in the early months of every year. The Prime Minister is very optimistic if he expects .to get through, twelve of thirteen measures between now and, say, the 22nd December. In my opinion, the business cannot be completed before Christmas; and if we try to finish in that time, the result must be disastrous to the Labour party, though, of course, it may very well suit the Opposition. I wisb to study, not the convenience of the Opposition, but the interests of my own party, and to some extent my own interests, because I desire to get to my constituent* during some portion of next year. I shall .the use- vote against the motion.",17
33,Mr BRUCESMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Parkes) [3.31] This little flash of personal independence coming from the Ministerial benches is as refreshing as the sight of a piece of blue sky would be to one who had been confined in a cellar for two or three months. It gives one hope that some day honourable members on the other side will begin to think for themselves and exercise a little judgment. When the honourable member for Wentworth was addressing the House I noticed a very self-satisfied smile upon the faces of a number of honourable members on the Ministerial side, because the honourable member spoke of the necessity of considering measures on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays. Those who smiled seemed to forget that, whereas they have had these measures before them over ancl over again in their Caucus, and considered them in I every detail, we have them sprung upon us suddenly, and are asked to consider questions like the Commonwealth Bank Bill, involving great economic principles, without any notice whatever. Honourable members opposite, on the other hand, have settled them in detail, and they are brought down here, as if this were a mere registry office, to which far-reaching measures were sent merely to be put through. During last session, when advocating the Referenda Bills, the Attorney-General said that unless they were passed there would be nothing more for the Federal Parliament to do, because we had practically exhausted our legislative functions. Yet the Government have found a political menu as long as one's arm, and so full of material that when we reach the end of the year it becomes necessary to keep everybody here for every day in the week except Saturday, beginning at half-past 10 o'clock in the morning and sitting until 10 or 11 at night. This shows the hollow hypocrisy of the constant talk of the Labour party about eight hours being enough work for any man, whether he uses his brains or his muscles. Quite apart from these considerations, there is no reason why all this legislation should be put through in this year. I understand that the Prime Minister has already intimated the possibility of our having a summer sitting after the end of the year. like to know whether the public or the Savings Bank depositors are crying out for the Commonwealth Bank Bill.",17
34,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss that question.,18
35,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The same argument applies to all these measures. I challenge the Prime Minister to point to any one of those on the notice-paper for which the public have ever asked in such a way as to necessitate Parliament sitting - for abnormal hours to put it through. The Government merely wish to put up a placard in order that they may win some popularity in the country. Speaking, like the honourable member for Wentworth, as a member coming from another State, I may say that if we leave here on the Friday. Saturday is practically a dies non. There is very little opportunity for one to attend to his private affairs on that day, and all that is available is the first part - of Monday, even under normal circumstances. But, according to the new proposal, we are to leave here on the Friday, reach Sydney on Saturday, and leave again on the Sunday in order to be here to do business on Monday.",18
36,Mr WEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member does it for races; he ought to be ready to do it for parliamentary work.,18
37,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We have racing perhaps only once in a year, and in any case I do not see that that has any bearing upon this question. In the whole of the ten years for which I have been a member of this Parliament, I have not had to leave Sydney on a Sunday more than once. I see no unusual circumstances making it necessary now, and I urge the Prime Minister to consider whether there is on the part of the public any crying desire for any of these measures which cannot be satisfied by sitting at normal times.",18
38,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Melbourne) [3.35] It is very difficult to answer the arguments of the honourable member for Parkes, because he speaks trom such a high altitude that if his feet were in Purgatory his head would still be above the clouds. A famous Oxford collegian once said, "" For complete ignorance, commend me to a schoolmaster."" I can assure the honourable memI should ber for Parkes that when he dogmatizes upon a subject about which he knows nothing, he reminds me of that saying. A witness who was asked by a lawyer, "" Will you swear that I have any money in my pocket?"" replied, "" I believe yon have money in your pocket, but I should not care to swear it "" ; but I take it that the honourable member for Parkes would swear anything in connection with the Caucus, whether it was true or otherwise. I resent these early-morning sittings. I am nearly dead, and, I suppose, other honourable members are half dead, but I do not want to be completely dead.. I resent strongly that we have nothing definite about the anomalies of the Tariff. People who have come out as immigrants to this country are unable to get employment. I know one man who has been out here for six weeks, and, although it was said that there was plenty of employment in his trade, he would have been in great trouble but for the help of a dear, kind lady. I am waited upon daily by people who want employment, and as we have had no distinct promise in reference to the anomalies of the Tariff-^",18
39,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I think you have.,18
40,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is it to come on this year ?,19
41,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We shall not break a promise.,19
42,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not think the Prime Minister would ever break a promise. If he has given a promise in this case, I am certain that it will be kept, if any human being can keep it. I see no reason why we should not carry the session over Christmas. We should do our work all the better, and be all the stronger, if we sat for the ordinary half-day. No one on this side of the House wishes to burke discussion or to use the powers which this Parliament has already agreed to; but, at the same time, if it is necessary to hurry on these measures, let us have the usual hours, and put our powers into practice if need be, because I am certain that no argument from>this side will convert a member on that side, and certainly no argument on that side will convert a member on this The honourable member for Parkes took exception to travelling on a Sunday. I would object to it also, and I hope to see this Parliament removed from Melbourne within a few years. In my opinion, it is too much to add a Monday sitting to the four strenuous sittings we have every week, and the number of those who were members of the first Parliament, but are now dead, is evidence that the travelling of a thousand miles a week to attend the meetings of Parliament is not fair to the man who does it, nor to his wife and family. In the interests of the health of members. I protest against the proposal for sitting on Monday. Personally,. I would be willing for the session to go over into next year. There are measures which I hope to see passed into law, which must be discussed. Of course, if it should be necessary to move the closure it must be moved, so that a determination may be arrived at. Mr HANS IRVIN E (Grampians) [3.42] - In my opinion, the electors are not in a hurry for much of the legislation proposed by the Government, and measures ill-debated might as well not be debated at all. Honourable members opposite are numerically strong enough to force through their programme. Why do they not take the straight and manly course of applying the ""gag"" in the first instance? But the results of the Boothby election, and the Victorian State elections, are a warning to the Government to take a pull. The handwriting is on the wall. Ministers must see that the people are opposed to hasty legislation. Much of our legislation may ultimately prove to be unconstitutional. We, on this side, are opposed to many of the Government proposals, because we think them antagonistic to the public interest, and no legislation at all is better than unjust or harmful legislation. It has been said very fairly by an honourable member on this side that the proposals of the Government are considered and debated before being brought before the Chamber. I agree with that. The same opinion has been expressed in the press. The Opposition members, however, have not had an opportunity to express, in Caucus, our opinion regarding them. It is not in the interest of the country that legislation should be forced through; but, of course, the Government is strong enough to take the bull by the horns, and gag discussion by the Opposition.",19
43,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Calare) [3.46]. - Whil e willing to support the Government programme, I am opposed to Monday sittings. For more .than ten years I have been constantly travelling between Sydney and Melbourne for the purpose of attending the meetings of this Parliament. I know what it means to leave Sydney on a Sunday night to be present at a meeting on Monday, and to attend here from early in the morning until late at night for the greater part of the week. That is an experience which I do not wish repeated more often than is necessary. The black record of this Parliament is largely attributable to the strain imposed on members. I have never voted to gag discussion, and never shall do so. When members abuse their privileges it is their own concern. Those who do not do so should not be punished for those who do. No doubt, the Opposition"" wish to prevent the Government from carrying legislation, and are therefore in favour of shortening the session. In my opinion, it is not necessary to end the session by Christmas time. Rather than rush measures through without fair opportunity for discussion, we should continue our sittings into the new year. Some of the proposals of the Government are out of the ordinary line, and must be discussed very fully. To give time for this discussion, we should be ready, if necessary, to prolong the session beyond Christmas.",19
44,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Franklin) [3.50]. --The almost annual debate on motions of this kind should awaken attention to the need for adopting a suggestion which I have made from time to time, and to which, or» two occasions, I have tried to give effectthat is, that there should be a time limit to the speeches of honourable members. Had an opportunity presented itself this session of getting the matter discussed, I should have brought it forward, but our procedure makes it almost impossible to deal with private members' business. When we have a debate on a raihvay question, certain honourable members read a few engineering works, get hold of a few catch phrases, and then, posing as engineers, talk about gauges and other engineering questions for hours. When a banking proposal is before us, standard works are again stewed up, we all become experts on banking, and Hansard is filled with pages of matter which any one of us could read for himself in the text-books. In my opinion, Ministers and Leaders of the Opposition should be given an hour in which to state their opinions on any subject, and other members not more than half-an-hour. Under such an arrangement, speeches would be shorter and better, and there would be ample time for discussing the business of the House.",19
45,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What would the honourable member do with five-hour men?,20
46,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"My proposal would gag them. It is amusing to the members of the Labour party speak against gagging, in view of the fact that the longest sitting on record in Australiaa three days' sitting of this House-wa s made necessary by their support to the resolutions which provide for gagging. _ I hope that next session one of the earliest measures introduced will be one to compel honourable members'to deal with the business of Parliament, in a practical way. I am in favour of Monday sittings. Throughout the session Tasmanian representatives cannot return to their homes more often than once every three or four weeks, and representatives from Western Australia and Queensland have to remain in Melbourne all the time. It is not too much, then, to ask the representatives from South Australia and New South Wales to spend the concluding two or three week-ends of the session in Melbourne, to enable the House to sit on Monday afternoons and evenings. As to long sittings, it is generally admitted that they are not a success, and I hope that we shall not repeat the practice - of meeting in the morning and sitting until late at night.",20
47,Mr RYRIE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"North Sydney) [3.54] - I agree with the honourable member for Franklin that it would be a good thing to have a time limit for speeches, but honourable members opposite cannot accuse the Opposition of "" stone-walling"" this session, or of having endeavoured in any way to unduly prolong discussion.",20
48,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,This is a non-party question.,20
49,Mr RYRIE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is evident from the fact that two of the supporters of the Government have said that they are "" prepared to give every reasonable support to the Ministry."" If this were a party question, they would be absolutely bound by the decision of the Caucus. I do not approve of "" stone-walling."" An Opposition may delay the passing of a measure by resorting to that practice, but in the end the Government, with a majority behind them, is sure to pass it , so that the only result is a waste of the time of the country. I should be glad, however, if some time limit could be placed on the speeches of honourable members. I hope that the Prime Minister will reconsider his determination to ask the House to sit on Mondays. I , for one, should find it very inconvenient to attend here every Monday. As it is, I cannot return home at the week ends and be back in Melbourne every Tuesday, and if this hear proposition be agreed to I shall have to remain in Melbourne for the rest of the session-: By agreeing to meet every other morning at 10.30, we shall be doing a fair thing, and I do not think any good purpose will be served by over-working honourable members. I wish to emphasize the remark made by the honourable member for Wentworth, that whilst the Government and their supporters are in favour of eight hours a day for the workers outside, they are prepared to make us work twelve hours a day. That is sweating. If eight hours a day is a fair thing for the working man outside, it should be a reasonable working day for parliamentarians. Is it any wonder, having regard to our long sittings, that a great many men who have entered politics have either gone to the wall, or have died comparatively early in life? We should not be overworked. I already feel the strain of politics, and am practically falling away to a shadow. I do not think it is possible to get through the programme which the Prime Minister has submitted; but I think we shall be able to do a great deal of work without sitting on Mondays. I promise the Government every reasonable assistance, for I do not desire that we shall meet again shortly after Christmas. After the arduous duties of the session, we are entitled to a reasonable spell. I certainly hope that we shall have Mondays free.",20
50,Mr FOWL ER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Perth) [3.5] - Whil e there is a good deal in the suggestion regarding the curtailment of speeches, I wish to point out that the evil of which complaint is made begins every session by the putting forward of a shop-window programme that is impossible of execution. That is the fault, not of this Government in particular, but of all Administrations, and it is responsible for a good deal of the demoralization that overtakes Parliament towards the end of every session, when important measures are rushed through without the necessary consideration. quite prepared to strain a point in order that we may carry out some of the work which the Government are anxious to achieve, but I protest against the proposal to pass this session all the measures that are before both Houses of Parliament. It is utterly impossible. It has been suggested that we might continue 'the session over Christmas, or have a summer session. 1 would, however, ask honourable members resident in Victoria and New South Wales whether they think it fair that those of us who come from distant States like Western Australia should be compelled to remain here for the greater part of the year. It is not a Federal proposal, and I hope the Government will at once realise the*impossible nature of the task they are setting this House in proposing to carry this session all the proposals now before Parliament. I hope they will realise that it is time for them to take a sane view of the position-to say honestly that they are proposing to carry into effect more than is reasonable, and that we should get into recess as soon .as possible. The strain on members since the inception of Federation has been something of an abnormal character, and it is time that it should be eased off. When I look round the House, and see friends of mine who entered this Parliament with me .ten years ago-honorabl e members like the Prime Minister, who was then a sprightly young man-and see how they have aged in these years, I feel that there is sufficient stands. justification for my plea that the sessions should be shortened, that the work should be carried out in a business like fashion, and that impossible tasks should not be set us.",21
51,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.3] - I take no ception to the criticism of this motion, which is one that is usually submitted every year towards the end of the session. The honourable member for Herbert, in urging that we ought to have a summer session if the work is not done is repeating only what I said myself. While he and other honourable members speak of the great volume of business that has yet to be transacted, he and they forget that nearly all the measures constituting that business have been discussed in this Parliament. They are all in preparation for passing. The position so far as they are concerned is something like that known to the miner when the whole of the ore has been raised to the surface, and put through the mill , and - the cleaning up alone has to take place. I am It would be just as unreasonable to say that the whole process had to be gone through in connection with mining when the cleaning up alone remained to be done as it would be to say that the whole process has to take place of inquiring into and examining these measures. Honourable members are familiar with the terms of our proposals, and, in my opinion, we are adopting the right course. T admit that it is somewhat difficult for honourable members from other States to attend Monday sittings, but I ask the House to pass the motion as it stands, on the understanding that we shall make the experiment next Monday, and give honourable members a holiday on the second Monday. That would break the monotony, and enable honourable members to return home at the end of next week. At all events, we shall see how we get on.  posal for Monday sittings stand over until the second week?",21
52,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I think our proposition the more convenient.  members have already made their arrangements.,21
53,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We shall see by the second week how we get on. I ask honourable members tb pass the moKon as it Question resolved in the affirmative. ARBITRATION (PUBLIC SERVICE) BILL. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for an exAct relating to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the Public Service of the Commonwealth. COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 24th November, vide page 3192): Clause 1 (Short title).",21
54,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wentworth) [4.6] - I have a suggestion to make, which seems to me to offer the best opportunity of arriving at an opinion on a very, important side of this measure. It has struck me that the subject-matter of this measure ought to have been distributed over two Bills-that there ought to be one corporation to deal with banking of an ordinary character, and another corporation to deal with the Savings Bank. Under the measure as it stands we are to have one corporation covering Savings Bank and ordinary banking business. That means that if the ordinary bank happens to make a loss, the assets of the bank, as a whole, including those of the Savings Bank branch, can be drawn upon by creditors of the ordinary bank to meet the liabilities of the bank as a whole. That is bad. We ought to divide the two proposals. We should have the Savings Bank within one corporation and the ordinary bank within another. I suggest to the Prime Minister that, by merely altering the short title to "" Commonwealth Banks Act , "" instead of "" Commonwealth Bank Act , "" and making the necessary consequential amendments, we could arrive at the result which I believe is desired by the majority of honourable members.",22
55,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member wish to separate the two?,22
56,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"As corporations, otherwise there will be a possibility of the Savings Bank deposits being levied upon to meet the debts of the ordinary bank.",22
57,Mr HANS IRVINE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,-That is what is going to happen.,22
58,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is what can happen. I am not urging any opposition from a party point of view,",22
59,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member propose that we should have two separate banks?,22
60,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Yes .,22
61,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I cannot agree to that, although I would make the Savings Bank a separate branch of the bank.",22
62,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"My point is that, whilst the two are within one corporation if the ordinary bank makes a loss, the deposits of the Savings Bank can be recovered by the creditors of the ordinary bank. The bank being one corporation must be sued and dealt with as one corporation.",22
63,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I agree at once to the Savings Bank money being kept separate.,22
64,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is what I am trying to arrive at. I do not care what amendment the honourable member makes as long as he gives effect to that proposal; but I do not think he can adopt any other legal method than that of providing for two corporations. I am satisfied from what the Prime Minister has said that he proposes to keep inviolate from the debts of the ordinary bank the deposits in the Savings Bank Branch. That is all I desire. We ought to safeguard the large deposits of the Savings Bank as much as possible. I shall not submit an amendment, but trust to the Prime Minister to have an alteration made later on. Clause agreed to. Clauses 2 and 3 agreed to. Clause 4In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears"" the Bank"" means the Commonwealth Bank of Australia established by this Act, ""the Governor"" means the Governor of the Bank.",22
65,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat) [4.10] - The right honourable member for Swan, who is not at present in the chamber, suggested that it might, perhaps, not be advisable to name the chief officer of the bank "" the Governor,"" because current allusions to him under that title might lead to certain confusion, inasmuch as it is one employed to describe the Governor of a State. For the purpose of lucidity and distinction it might be desirable to have the title varied in some way.",22
66,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"He could be called "" the Bank Governor. ' T",22
67,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Prime Minister might think the matter over with a view to fixing on some appropriate title.,22
68,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I like the title "" Governor,"" because this official will be something more than a bank manager.",22
69,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Of course; and, therefore, I think an appropriate title ought to be applied.",22
70,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.11] - As I have said, I think that the title "" Governor "" is the most appropriate in the case of a bank of this description. I admit that some confusion might arise; but when the title isassociated with the bank, I do not think there will be any doubt on the part of financial people. I frankly say that I prefer the word "" Governor,"" unless the Committee feel very strongly on the point.",22
71,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,""" Bank Governor "" would discriminate.",23
72,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the honourable member thinks that sufficient, we may make that the title. If it is not out of order, I should like to say that I was looking forward to the time when there could be no trouble in this matter-whe n there could be no confusion with Governors of States",23
73,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The right honourable member is out of order.,23
74,Mr RILEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"South Sydney) [4.12] - If this is the proper time to refer to the question of director, I should like to point out that we may yet have three "" Governors,"" and not one.",23
75,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That matter comes up under another clause.,23
76,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Parkes) [4.13]- I think the honourable member for South Sydney is quite correct. If the Prime Minister intends to suggest a Board of three directors, or trustees, he will be following the precedent of the Bank of England; and it is important to know whether such is the intention. If it be so, I do not see any objection to the use of the word "" Governor "" ; but, on the other hand, if the Governor of the bank is to act alone, his title may be much less appropriate. Amendment (by Mr FISHER) proposed - That after the word "" the,"" first occurring in line 6, the word "" Bank "" be inserted.",23
77,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Parkes) [4.15]-As the clause stands now, it reads ""the Governor means the Governor of the bank,"" and the official, therefore, is distinguished from any Governor, or from the Governor General. I do not think that the title ""Bank Governor"" is nearly as good as "" Governor of the bank.""",23
78,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Apparently , the insertion of the word is to prevent people thinking that the word "" Governor"" applies to the Governor of Timbuctoo 1",23
79,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the amendment be carried, the clause will read, "" The Bank Governor means the Governor of the bank,"" and that, of course, is nom sense. The amendment seems to me wholly unnecessary.",23
80,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.16] - The honourable member has discussed the matter. in a humorous and somewhat dictatorial manner. The honourable member for Ballarat pointed out that the right honourable member for Swan had some apprehension that the title proposed in the Bill might give rise to some confusion in the minds of people in connection with the Governor of a State. On that being pointed out, I consented to insert the word "" Bank "" ; and the worse that can be said of the amendment is that it is a redundancy. If , however, the additional word removes any misapprehension or confusion, no harm is done.",23
81,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Parkes) [4.17]. - - I cannot see how the word "" Governor "" used in this connection could be taken to mean the Governor of a State. The definition clause sets out that wherever the word is used in this Act it means the Governor of the bank; and what more do we require? The Prime Minister ought to object to any amendment that is redundant.",23
82,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Maribyrnong) [4.18] I quite agree with the honourable member for Parkes that the amendment is utterly unnecessary. There can be no possible confusion between the Governor of the bank and the Governor General in Council, because the latter is always spoken of as the Governor General.",23
83,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat) [4.19] - The right honourable member for Swan pointed out that references to the Governor of the bank, verbally or in the press, would be briefly to "" the Governor,"" and that this would be likely to give rise to a certain amount of confusion with the Governor of a State. No one has yet mentioned the Governor General in this connection, t called attention to the matter in the absence of the right honourable member for Swan; and then came the suggestion that the title should be ""the Bank Governor."" I hesitated to adopt this suggestion, because that is not a taking title. It does, however, describe the official; and for want of a better, it was proposed by the Prime Minister. My own suggestion was to leave the matter with the Prime Minister, so that he might consider some modification, with a view to giving the Governor of the bank a distinctive appellation. Mr HANS IRVIN E (Grampians) [4.20] - I think the amendment ought to be withdrawn, as absolutely unnecessary. I may say that personally I do not believe in the Bill at all ; but the clause as it stands is clearer than, in my opinion, it would be if the amendment were carried.",23
84,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Bourke) [4.21] - It is really delightful to find that, in the opinion of the honourable member for Parkes all the foolish members of the Committee are not on this side. The honourable member for Parkes regards the amendment as a foolish one, though it did originate with his leader. How are we to read this Bill if the amendment is carried? Clause 11, for instance, would read something like t h is : - "" The bank shall be managed by the Bank Governor of the bank.""",23
85,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Quite so - it is a redundancy.,24
86,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not see that we require this definition at all.,24
87,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wimmera) [4.22] - It is not necessary to insert the proposed word. I understand that in some of the States we find what is called "" the Governor of the gaol "" ; and we are not told of any confusion that arises between that official and the Governor of the State. Every time the chief officer of the bank is described, it will be as "" the Governor of the bank."" Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 5 (Establishment of bank).",24
88,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wilmot) [4.23] Owing to the arrangement made to close the second-reading debate at a certain time, I had no opportunity to address myself to the general principles of this measure ; and, therefore, I should now like to offer a remark or two on this clause. In the first place, I have no objection to the Commonwealth establishing a bank. It is quite possible for the Commonwealth to establish a bank that will be a really strong institution, to which other financial, institutions can look for support. The question is, "" What sort of bank are we going to establish, and under what sort of management 7 "" I admit the truth as a general proposition of the statement that banking is merely a matter of dealing in credits, but the credit must have a fairly sound foundation. It is quite open for the Commonwealth Parliament, if - the people desire it , to found a sound and proper bank, so long as we go the right way about it. My trouble is, "" A r e we going to found a bank that will be worthy of this Commonwealth ? "" If we desired to be so foolish, we could start a large generous affair, open-hearted and open-handed, to which everybody could come in time of need, and where no one would be denied; but I do not think it would carry on for very long. I am afraid that if we do not do something in that line, some people in Australia will suffer a great disappointment, because the people were told that the present banks were bleeding the public, and making immense profits, and that the Commonwealth could establish an institution to which the poor and needy could apply with a certainty that their wants would be supplied. We are a Federation, and it would be a good idea if our bank were given a really Federal basis, by the States being allowed to co-operate with the Commonwealth in it . This would tend to make the institution all the sounder, and also help to simplify the very difficult and pressing problem of dealing satisfactorily with the Slate debts. That was one of the great questions for which Federation was brought about, but after eleven years of Federation we are as far off any practical solution of it as we were at the beginning. I am sorry no scheme was outlined in that direction in the recent Budget, but this bank must, sooner or later, take a hand in dealing with the State debts. It will have to be the financial institution through which we do the business. I wish to put it on record that, if we give the bank a more Federal basis than the Government propose, it will simplify our procedure, and materially heip the settlement of the question, which will have to be dealt with, not only in a way that suits this Parliament, but in a way that is satisfactory to the States which have incurred the debts, and to the people of Australia generally: If we go about the business in the right way, we can establish a National bank which will be in the proper sense a banker's bank, strong enough to help in time of need any other bank that is worth propping up. Of course, there have been in Australia banks that have gone smash, and that sooner or later would have collapsed under normal circumstances, but other banks have gone down that need not have gone insolvent had there been some institution to tide them over their period of stress.  come to their assistance, for instance.",24
89,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not necessarily the State, so long as there was some strong central institution. If we go about it properly, it is possible for us to establish a bank that, in time, would not only be able to render such succour to other institutions in need of help, but that would be a sound business in itself, and earn substantial profits that could be applied to Commonwealth purposes. Apart from that, it could save the Commonwealth a lot of money by doing the Government business, and by negotiating for the flotation, transfer, and renewal of loans. I take it that that is one of the best arguments for the foundation of a bank of this sort.",24
90,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the honourable member is an individualist, why does he want the private banks to be helped by a State institution ?",25
91,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The help should be given in the case of a financial institution which is not really insolvent, but which, pressed too hard at a certain time, would have to suffer a great decrease in the value of its securities, and so cause great loss to many people, and the State generally. Institutions of that sort should be saved from collapse, in the public interest. As an illustration, I can refer the honourable member to what happened in his own State in 1893. A tremendous loss would have been caused to the whole of Queensland if the great securities held by the Queensland Bank had had to be realized at that time, but the Government came forward with their note issue and other forms of assistance, and kept the bank from collapse.",25
92,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Our objection is that you believe in Socialism for the big fellow, but not for the little one.",25
93,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not saying that the Commonwealth Bank is an absolute necessity. I do not think it is. I merely say that such an institution as I have outlined could be established, and if it is on sound lines I see no great harm an it. I clo not say that the Commonwealth Bank should overshadow the private banks, but, if established, it should be a bank that we can all look up to. When established it should also have a branch to deal with the Commonwealth note issue. This would be a. great improvement on the system of handling notes that we have had so far.",25
94,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The note issue might be taken over by the bank sooner than you expect.,25
95,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That would be a great improvement. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We had to give it a trial run before starting with the note issue.,25
96,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It would not be 'difficult for the bank, when established, to take the note issue over. It could manipulate the business in a better way for the Commonwealth than could the Treasury. With its central office in Melbourne, and its branches throughout the country, the bank would, as it were, have itsfinger,on the pulse of the community to a greater extent than the Treasury has, and so could tell better how trade was going, and the amount of note issue required. By setting up a central institution we could deal with Savings Bank business also, but we should be taking On unnecessary trouble. We shall have quite enough to do in the first instance to establish our own general bank. It would be wiser to leave the Savings if Bank business as it is now, or at any rate before we take a share in it we should consult the States, which already have Savings Banks of their own, in which the people of Australiahave placed over ,£50,000,000. A great deal of that money is lent out on short-dated loans, and a great deal of it also on long-dated loans, through the Credit Foncier system.",25
97,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It would suit the honourable member's purpose as well .to discuss the question of the Savings Bank branch when Part V. of the Bill is reached.,25
98,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was trying to picture the sort of - Commonwealth Bank that I should like to see established under this clause, but I bow to your ruling. Those in charge of the Savings Banks of the States have done all that they can to make their systems uniform, with the result that depositors now enjoy practically all the conveniences which they could have from a Commonwealth Savings Bank, and the run duplication of this machinery is unnecessary. The capital of the proposed bank should be adequate. We need £2,000,000 or more to establish the bank.",25
99,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Clause 9 deals with the capital of the bank.,25
100,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Still , I think that my remark is in order. A more important point is this : It would be better if the bank were not purely a Commonwealth Bank, and had private capital as its basis. It would then be more useful in times of trouble. The Bank of France is not purely a State Bank. Like the Bank of England, it is based on private capital, as is partly the case with the Bank of New Zealand. A purely State Bank might not be able, when its help was most needed, to give the assistance that was required. Panics come when they are least expected, and no method of preventing them is known. If at a time of panic a purely State Bank could not meet the demands made on it, the position would be very awkward, because the public credit would have been - destroyed, and there would be nothing to f all back on. But with an institution like the Bank of England or the Bank of France, you would have something to come to the aid of the credit of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth could come to the aid of the bank. President Thiers, after the war between France and Germany, said that the Bank of France saved France, "" because it was not a State Bank."" H ad that bank been wholly a national concern, it could not have given the assistance which it did, because the national credit had been destroyed by the war. The situation was saved by the credit of the bank coming to the aid of the national credit. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The credit enabled the bank to expand its currency.",25
101,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The expanded currency was supported with private credit created by a long course or' good management on the part of those conducting the affairs of the bank. Monsieur Pierre D'Essars, who wrote a History of the Banking of all Nations, said thatWhen the Bank of France issued notes secured by Treasury obligations, it added its own guarantee to that-of the State, and the paper circulated consequently at par. If the bank and the Government had been one and the same, the bank's signature would have been no reinforcement of the State's, and the paper intended to be taken on trust would have been valued at just what the State's credit was worth. That touches a vital point that has not been fairly dealt with by Ministers or their supporters. If this bank becomes, as no doubt it will, an ordinary trading concern, it must, like any other institution, occasionally suffer losses, and, should the credit of the Commonwealth be injured, there would be nothing to back it up. A bank based on private capital, doing the Government business on easy terms, and enjoying certain privileges, so. that it would be somewhat in the position of the Bank of England, would be a much stronger institution, and of greater value to the community, than a purely National or State Bank. Mr THOMAS BROWN ""(Calare) [4.52] - Like the honourable member for Wilmot, I had intended to speak during the second-reading debate, but waived my right to do so to enable the Bill to get into Committee on Friday afternoon. Therefore, there are many matters on which I should like to speak which I cannot discuss now. But I am glad to witness the general approval-in some cases a modified one-of the Government proposal fpr the establishment pf a National bank. The honourable member for Wilmot favours the establishment of a bank which will be a sort of agent for other banks, and would come to their assistance in times of financial crisis by placing the credit of the Commonwealth at their disposal. But I think that the time has come when the people should control directly their great monetary interests. At the same time, I would leave the financial field as open to private institutions as it is now. The establishment of a purely National bank has been strongly opposed, when efforts to that end have been made by the States. national Savings Banks have been established by the Governments of the States, but until recent times that of New South Wales did not lend money to the general community, and I believe that a similar policy prevailed in the other States.",26
102,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I would point out to the honourable member that he will have an opportunity to fully discuss .the question of Savings Banks on clause 35.,26
103,Mr THOMASBROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I wish only to explain my support of this proposal by pointing to the policy obtaining in connection with the State Savings Banks, and showing that this scheme will be more generally in touch with the desire of the people. It will be conducted with due regard to the carrying out of the general principles recognised in the banking world, as compared with the more restricted system adopted by the earlier Savings Banks. The bank to which I was referring when the Chairman intervened would not lend to small holders, and its principal customers as borrowers were the privately-instituted banks. It was only when the crisis of 1892-3 came along that this institution, in common with others, got into financial difficulties. The result was that the State, being the larger and the more substantial institution, had to guarantee their assets, and so prevent the general bankruptcy which threatened.",26
104,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The State also guaranteed the notes of the other banks.,26
105,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,As well as the assets of this particular bank.,26
106,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,In a time of panic the notes of our bank might not be too good.,26
107,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There was a time of panic when the notes of some of the large banks which had previously been considered to be very substantial were not worth the paper they were printed on. One could not get them changed, and the State had to come to the assistance of these private institutions. The lesson of the crisis was that the State was more substantial, and more to be trusted, than was this semi-State Bank or the private banking institutions. It was only when the guarantee of the State as a whole was placed behind them that confidence was restored and business proceeded along normal lines. That proves that the bank, as proposed to be established under this Bill, has a larger asset on which to operate, and that, notwithstanding the fear expressed by the honourable member who preceded me, that there may come a time when the operations of this bank may be seriously affected by a crisis, experience demonstrates that before a State institution can be seriously menaced by any general loss of confidence on the part of the depositors and those who do business with it, the other banks, including the State Bank which does not possess the full guarantee of the several States, will be in a very much worse position than it is possible for this bank to be in. As the honourable member for Denison clearly demonstrated the other day, there is a vast difference between the popular idea of the functions of a bank and the real basic principles on which it works. The banks, after all, are simply dealers in credit, and, that being so, it is desirable that their credit shall be substantial, and that there shall be general confidence in their ability to meet their engagements. My argument is that the Commonwealth, being the larger and wider institution, representing the people as a whole, is not liable to the withdrawal of public confidence that falls to the lot of private institutions. It was objected that the Commonwealth Bank should be completely removed from political control. That is only right, and I support the Government in their desire to establish this bank, and to establish it under conditions that will insure that it will be conducted on proper commercial lines, free from any interference on the part of politicians or those interested in politics. That is not the position of a private banking institution.' Private banking companies are very anxious to have leading politicians on their directorates, and well-known politicians largely preponderate on their Boards. In the practical work of banking, as the people have reason to know, politics are not altogether unknown. First of all, the small holders of overdrafts from a bank are squeezed when a drought or some other Mr Thomas Brown. trouble takes place, and that process has been as largely responsible as any other factor I know of for the wiping out of the small settlers and the aggregation of large private estates. In other ways also politics have been introduced into banking business. Small men with ' overdrafts have been told that they must exercise due caution in expressing themselves in the political arena, otherwise they may be called upon at a moment's notice to make good their overdrafts. Such an experience is well known to the poor farmer. It would be a great thing in the interests of pure politics if we could have an institution that would be so free from political bias and control that such an experience would be impossible in connection with it. It does not obtain in connection with the State Savings Bank, and a great National bank that can remove such a blot from the free exercise of our political rights will confer a great service upon a large and substantial section of the community. In these circumstances, I heartily support this measure; and I am glad to find that the opposition that used to be offered in the State - Parliaments to every proposal to establish a bank under State control is not so pronounced in this case. I trust that this will be a National bank in every sense of the term; that it will do all the business that it is possible for a bank to do; and that it will do it in the interests of the whole people. I hope, further, that politics will not be obtruded in the discharge of its functions, and that the people who do their business with it will not have the sad experience, which has fallen to the lot of many doing business with private banks, of being hauled up to the bull-ring when their politics do not coincide with those of persons who have the control of the institution.",26
108,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Parkes) [5.7];I have no desire to make a second-reading speech, but I intend to avail myself of the opportunity which this clause affords to offer some general explanation of my own views on this Bill. The honourable member for Riverina remarked, when the honourable member for Wilmot was speaking, that he ought not, upon this clause, to deal with the general question, since it was merely one giving a name to the bank. On reading it carefully, the honourable member will see that it goes further, since it providesA Commonwealth Bank, to he called the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, is hereby established. While I agree with you, Mr Chairman, that it would be out of place now to deal in detail with any of those questions that we shall, have an opportunity to discuss byand-by, such as the details of the Savings Bank proposals, I think we have an opportunity on this clause to deal generally with the advisableness of establishing a Commonwealth Bank. In the first place, I should like to remark that when first I saw this Bill I was rather disappointed with the character of the proposal, and surprised that the pride of the honourable member for Darwin should have been so severely touched by completely ignoring the scheme that was put forward, with the consent of the Government, some eighteen months ago, as the emanation of his own intellect, and endorsed by the Brisbane Conference. My recollection of that scheme was that there was to be a bank in which all the States were to be compelled to take a part.",27
109,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Invited .,28
110,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Not compelled.,28
111,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I understood that they were to be compelled. The capital of the bank then proposed was, I believe, about £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 . Mr KING O'MALLEY -£1,200,000 .",28
112,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The scheme was very vaguely described in the press. I do not think it was outlined by the honourable member himself, and I was a little surprised, in view of the reputation for financial ability which the honourable member had amongst his colleagues, that the Government should have so completely departed from that proposal ih introducing this Bill .",28
113,Mr GROOM,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Judgin g by the Sydney speech of the Minister of Home Affairs, reported in yesterday's Argus, it would seem that they are going back to that scheme.",28
114,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think it will be impossible to so transform this Bill as to make it in any way like the Bil l which the honourable member for Darwin proposed. I am not vain enough to imagine that I can influence the opinions of honourable members opposite by anything I can say on this question. I regard this discussion, so far as putting the Bill into shape is concerned, as quite futile. I have long given up the hope that any honourable members on this side can affect the measures, or the form of the measures, put forward by the Government. It has become a truism that all Bills are discussed in general and in detail before they come here.",28
115,Mr HOWE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member has no proof of that!,28
116,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have had pretty good proof of it in the case of other Bills-for instance, the Land Tax measure and the Commonwealth Notes measure.",28
117,Mr HOWE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is wrong !,28
118,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That may be; but this Bill, I know, has been submitted to the Caucus.  believe me when I say that I never saw this Bill until it was laid on the table?",28
119,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is quite compatible with the fact that the Bill was before the Caucus, and the general principle and details approved, and that it has come here now to be registered. I am not sufficiently biased to believe that honourable members opposite are opposed to joining with honourable members on this side in making some necessary amendments ; and when we come to the clause dealing with the management of the bank, I shall submit what I think is, in one respect, a much wiser scheme. Instead of throwing on the Governor the complete responsibilty for managing an institution which may have the handling of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, honourable members will be willing, I think, to appoint directors, as in the case of the Bank of England, or trustees, as in the case of the Savings Banks. I fear, however, that, on the general principles, it is very unlikely that any suggestions from this side will be adopted. I do not take the pessimistic view of this Bill that many honourable members do. It is quite open to the Government, especially of a young community like this, to take part in the banking business of the country. The Bank of England has been, not only a successful, but an extremely useful institution. The Commonwealth has, or will have, enormous financial prospects. VVe are going, by-and-by, to take over the debts of the States; and this Commonwealth Bank will have an office in London, in which a great deal of very useful work can be done in this connection. But a great deal will depend on the way in which such an institution is managed. It would be very undesirable that this bank should be so constituted as to be under the influence, directly or indirectly, of any Government or any Minister. My experience of banking extends over thirty years. I have been director of a bank, and I know something about the business; and I say that if we are not careful to make this bank completely and obviously free from political the public will never have in it that confidence which is so necessary to make it highly successful institution. ' The CHAIRMAN - The whole question of the management may be discussed happen! under clause n .",28
120,Mr BRUC ESMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not speakvery ing from the point of view of the managedo ment. Under the clause before us, I mit, I am at perfect liberty to discuss whole question of the desirableness of estabI lishing a Commonwealth Bank, and to under what conditions, quite apart other proposals in the Bill , I consider such an institution is likely to be successful. am not trying, sir, in any way to manceuvre or get round any of your rulings. I submit that we have a perfect right now to discuss manufacturers. the abstract question of the desirability of establishing a Commonwealth Bank, and, press to that end, to deal with those conditions which ought, or ought not, to surround an institution. If the public see or suspect that this bank, instead of being put into the hands of a Governor or and three competent men as trustees, is left in the hands of one man",29
121,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member must see that he is ters dealt with in clauses n and 12. Mr BRUC E SMITH - Thos e clauses may deal with the same question, but speaking on the general principle of polioctopus tical management. We shall have to it quite clear to the public-and this is view, I know, of all bankers and mercantde people  clear to the honourable member ?",29

' Mr Bruce SMITH - I am not a director of a bank, and I have not the slightest interest in any bank, directly indirectly. But, surely, I may bring to bear on this question my experience as bank director, and, from my knowledge commerce, say that the public will be very sceptical of the soundness, and probable future soundness, of an institution which is them, perhaps, washerwomen. liable to have the hand of any Government or Minister placed on it at any time in order to influence its policy?  surely does not argue that a National bank influence, cannot be sound?",29
123,Mr BRUC ESMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We know that a National banks have frequently proved unsuccessful owing to political influence. ,29
124,Mr BRUCESMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the question with which I am dealing. I not wish the honourable member to sneer subat any opinions which may be offered the simply because he is suspicious that come here as the advocate of say bankers. The honourable member makes from a great mistake if he thinks I am here as the advocate of any capitalists. I I know capitalists as well as he does; and I have no unreasonable partiality for many of them, whether as merchants, bankers, or I can assure honourable members that, if I stand up here and exopinions, those opinions are quite distinct from any influence that can be such brought to bear by any parties outside.",29
125,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member think that this has anything to do genera] manager with the clause?,29
126,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , I confess I do not; and I should not have gone into the matter had it not been for the rather uncalled-for observation of the honourable discussing matmember for Maranoa. The popular idea outside is that a bank is a means of making enormous sums I am of money-that banks are a sort of constantly bleeding the people, in make order to put monev into the pockets of what the are popularly called "" f at men."" During the days of the reconstruction of the banks I made it my business to attend a large t number of meetings of those institutions which availed themselves of the reconstruction laws, and I was quite astonished at the great variety of people who formed the shareholders. The cartoon in a Labour paper, representative of a banker, usually shows us a man of huge proportions,. with an enormous gold chain, big enough for a dog chain, large diamonds in his sleeveor links and in his rings, and smoking a big cigar. This represents the popular notion; a but the actual fact is that shareholders of consist of men and women, many of them of the working class, small shopkeepers, or various kinds of working women, some of If anybody attends a meeting of bank shareholders, he, too, will be astonished at the large number of poor and middle-class people to lie seen there; and when people look for the typical bank shareholder in the ridiculous figure presented by the working-class papers, they are labouring under an extraordinary delusion. bank shareholders are, many of them, of the same class of people as those who deposit their money in the Savings Bank; and to get them to take an interest in the Commonwealth Bank, it will have to be made quite clear that it is not liable to political influence.",29
127,Mr WEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I rise to a point of order. You, Mr Chairman, have allowed wonderf u l latitude to the honourable member for Parkes in discussing this clause; but I think he is now exceeding the bounds-that he is exceeding the bounds of ordinary decency towards other honourable members.",30
128,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The question decency I shall not deal with ; but I think I can show that I am quite in order. This clause is simply a proposition to establish a Commonwealth Bank; and we cannot deal with the advisability of taking that step without asking ourselves under what conditions it would be advisable to establish it. Surely it is obviously relevant to say that, if we establish a Commonwealth Bank, it ought to be free from political influence? I am pointing out, in an appropriate way, I think, that we ought to consider what is the class of people likely to use the bank, so as to give it that importance and substantialitv we desire. The CHAIRMAN' - Undoubtedl y this clause covers practically the whole banking question. I have already directed the attention of the honourable member for Parkes to other clauses in the Bill on which he could discuss this matter; but if he and other honourable members insist on having their say, on this particular clause, on banking generally, I , unfortunately, am not in a position to stop them.",30
129,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I congratulate you, Mr Chairman, on taking a little wider view than that of some honourable members who do not wish this question to be discussed. Some time ago I read a quotation from the Brisbane Worker on the subject of a State Bank. It is rather appropriate to repeat that quotation now, in order to show what the popular idea of a Commonwealth Bank is. The newspaper extract is as fol lows :The establishment of a Commonwealth bank of issue, deposit, e^-change, and reserve, would be .1 big step towards making the Australian nation master of its own currency, and liberate its citizens from the talons of the Money Power. That is the popular view-that every bank in the country, notwithstanding that it is in competition with a great many more in every other State, is a sort of vulture. The The word "" vulture "" is used in the article, and the allegation is that the banks are really trying to take advantage of the simplicity of the people to bleed them of their means. That is an utterly wrong view, which will not stand the investigation or the test of figures. When the Prime Minister was addressing the House upon the question, he said the average profit of all the banks over a great many years was 17 per cent, on their original capital, but that on their paidup capital today the profits were an average of 9'per cent. I have taken the trouble to look up the Year-Book for Australia, and I undertake the responsibility of differing of entirely from the right honourable gentleman's conclusions. He has never taken into consideration the banks which have absolutely failed. The . CHAIRMAN - The honourable member is not in order in replying to something that took place during the second reading debate.",30
130,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I shall not attempt to reply to the Prime Minister's speech. I have referred to it, and now propose to deal with the question of the profits of the banks. It is misleading to say what the banks pay upon their original capital.",30
131,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is now trying to evade my ruling.,30
132,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not think, sir, you have any right to say so. I wish to deal with the question of the profits of the banks, and to show that they cannot be arrived at by taking what they pay on their original capital. If one wishes to find out what a bank will pay, he must take as a basis, not merely the piesent capital, but also the market value of the shares. To ascertain what a bank would have paid on its original capital would take one back sometimes sixty or seventy years. In addition to their dividends, we know that banks and other institutions have put money into reserve funds. If you take their present capital you have to take into account as a basis for their profits, not only the original value of the shares, but the value of the reserve funds. We have to remember, too, that the shares are changing hands every day, and that the people who buy them pay so much premium on them, according to the interest they pay, as will give them about the same average which they get on all other public companies-namely , 5 or 6 per cent. To talk of the "" talons ."" of a bank, and of it being a ""vulture,"" when you have seen the character of the people who form the shareholding class of the banks, is wholly unfair. Honourable members would find, if they bought shares in one of the banks, that, at the current price, they would not produce more than 5, or, at the most, more than 6 per cent.; and if they were original shareholders they would find that they are not producing much more than that on the present capital, adding to the original tal the reserve funds, which have been saved out of profits. In the past, when prices were high, there were times in Australia when you could not borrow money upon a property under 6 or 8 per cent. In those days men made bigger profits, and the banks paid dividends to a certain amount and put a portion of their profits to reserve funds. Therefore, if you take the profits paid upon the original capital and the reserve funds combined, you find that they do not come to the high rates that many people suppose they do. If , on the other hand, you take the profits of the banks upon the current value at which people have been buying the shares for years, you will find that, being a sound, and what is called a gilt-edged, investment, they do not produce more than sometimes 4 per cent, or 5 per cent., or, at the very most, 6 per cent., so that the idea that this bank is going to make huge profits can be disposed of at once. That vision of ignorance is one which ought to be dispelled at all events from the mind of every member of this House.",30
133,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,To whom does the honourable member attribute ignorance?,31
134,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I said the public outside had an ignorant view of the profits of banks.,31
135,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,You said the members of this House were ignorant.,31
136,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I said I did not suppose any member of this House took the same view of it, whatever the public outside might think.",31
137,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,You say that now.,31
138,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I said it then. The honourable member, because he is at my back, and misunderstands what I say, gives me the lie direct. In taking into consideration what the banks have produced in the past, it would be utterly wrong to leave out of calculation the losses, not only of profits, but of capital, in the institutions that have failed. If you want to take the average of what a particular industry, whether banking or gold-mining, has brought in, it is not sufficient to take the successful ventures and say what they are making. You must take into consideration the whole of the ventures, successful and unsuccessful, calculate what money has been put into them, what money they have produced, and take that as an average over all their capital.",31
139,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"And consider also the ventures which private banks have capi- touched, and which this bank will not handle. . Mr Bruce SMITH - No doubt that also ought to be taken into consideration. There is a popular notion outside that the Commonwealth Bank is going to lend money to individuals in a very small way. I cannot discuss that matter here, but it has a bearing on the broader issue which I have put to the Committee. We ought to be very careful, when formulating a scheme for the establishment of a bank, to surround it by all the protection possible through the management. If that is done, and it is put upon the basis of other institutions of the kind, I have no fear for the future. As we are going .to convert some hundreds of thousands of State debts into Commonwealth debts, and to deal with their investment, and to have a branch in London, 1 think it will be a very useful institution, so long as it is entirely free from political influence.",31
140,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat) [5.35]--As we have come face to face with the particular proposals in the Bill, this clause not only affords an opportunity for the general discussion that we have had, but is the proper place"" to invite a specific statement from the Prime Minister on one or two of the most important features of the Bill, and some of the most important proposals which deserve a place in it. The clause provides for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. I have already defined my view of the bank. The word ""Commonwealth"" is, apparently, intended to be used in its more exclusive reading as denoting the bank of the Government of the Commonwealth, and of the Commonwealth alone. In the original shape of this proposition, the obvious intention was that it should be a Commonwealth Bank in the \ larger sense of the term, embracing the States and their Treasuries, as well as the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Treasury. Nothing could be more desirable .than such a combination. It would be in harmony with the intention of our own Constitution, enormously increase the resources of the institution, and, of necessity, carry with it the banking business of the States, which, taken collectively, is an immense .source of revenue, and affords enormous opportunity. At this stage, the crucial issue appears to be whether we intend to establish a rival and a competitor to the existing private banks, and to any possible State Banks which may be launched by any of the States. As this proposition is put forward, it creates a rival and competing bank entering into a field which at present is wholly occupied by private banks. As I understand the original object of those who, on various sides and from various political angles, have proposed an Australian bank, .the crucial question is whether it is to tional in its business and foundation in the wider sense of the term, or whether it is to step into the public arena relying only on its own great future resources as a combatant. It will seriously limit many of the present operations of the private banks, and might so occupy the field of national finance that only a combination of State Banks, if such a thing could be imagined, would be able to make financial headway against the powerful corporation that it promises to be. I am endeavouring now to direct the attention of the Committee to this parting of the ways. This is the time and place at which we must arrive at an all-important decision. One of the features which commended this project to many, myself among them, was that in the original draft submitted to the Conference by the honourable - member for Darwin provision was made, not as extensively as one would have liked, 'but quite explicitly, for the recognition of a certainprobable partnership on'the part of the States.",31
141,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What does the honourable member suggest?,32
142,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I wish, first, to ascertain the intentions of the Government. Mc. FISHER - The honourable member has a copy of the Bill .",32
143,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"-On this point the mea-sure is not explicit, and the opportunity for making it so presents itself. If this is to be a Federal undertaking, the bank should^e founded with State as well as with Commonwealth capital. [1,6] would make it immensely more powerful and popular. Should the States find part of the capital, their financial business would certainly be given to the bank, and the handling of their debts would naturally come under its management. This last is the outstanding financial undertaking to which all financial attention is directed, and its importance can scarcely be overestimated.",32
144,Mr WEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The States will be able to do their business through this bank in any case.,32
145,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; but we gain nothing by excluding, and a great deal by including, them as partners.",32
146,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Does the honourable member suggest that they should have a monetary interest, apart from their business transactions?",32
147,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; they should find be na- part of the capital, and should be shareholders with the Commonwealth.",32
148,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What share of the management would they have?,32
149,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not wish, to appear as the author of a carefully thought out scheme, nor am I antagonistic to other suggestions; but the possessor of a direct pecuniary interest in an institution pays more attention to its management, and does more to put business in its way, than one who is not cortcerned. in its success. My suggestion is a merited recognition of the position of the States, and affords an opportunity for the handling of their debts. It is a frank and open arrangement for the financial federation of our great public enterprises and interests. That is the real end of this bank. Of course, no proposition has the faintest chance of success unless submitted by the Government with the support of Ministerialists; but at this juncture a question not to be avoided is, What is our aim? Is it Federal in the inclusive or in the exclusive sense? The formulation of a scheme such as I suggest will in no sense coerce the States, each of which must consider the proposition - from its own stand-point.",32
150,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Would the honourable member be content to leave the door open to the States ?,32
151,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The r e should be placed before them, at least in a general way, a statement of the intentions of the measure and an invitation",32
152,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That would delay its That passing.,32
153,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not necessarily. That might depend on the replies returned by the States, and in such a situation I should be prepared to make a suggestion. But if the Government will not seriously consider the proposal, die discussion of it is fruitless. Still it is at least possible, to frame the measure so as to make provision for their coming in, a period, if necessary, being fixed in which the States could make a definite reply.",33
154,Mr WEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Would the honourable member remove the control of the institution from the Commonwealth?,33
155,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It s control would be shared with the States.,33
156,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Then political fluence of all kinds would come in.,33
157,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The measure is already in one sense saturated with political influence; my suggestion would not increase that. Were the States given a direct interest in the fortunes of the bank, we should have the guarantee of their support. I ask the Prime Minister what opportunity, if any, is to be given to the States to take part the establishment of the bank ?",33
158,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What does the honourable member propose?,33
159,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That the bank's capition. tal should be found partly by the States.,33

165,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"They might have reence, presentation on a board in the nature of directorate. We might either keep the present form of control, appointing a tral authority, advised by a directorate-on which the States were represented, or ereate a board having the larger powers which directors, of private banking institutions customarily exercise.",33
166,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.55]--The questionraised by the Leader of the Opposition is not so clear to my mind as it appears to be to his. One would think, listening to the honourable member, that the Commonwealth alone had the constitutional power to establish a National bank. As a matter of fact, no one knows better than he does; that the States themselves have far greater powers in regard to national banking than has the.Commonwealth Parliament.",33
167,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Hea r ! hear.,33
168,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We need not discuss or criticise their failure to exercise-that power, but their opportunities will not be in any inway minimized by the establishment of a. Commonwealth Bank.",33

170,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not theoretically, constitutionally, financially, or otherwise ",33
171,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Practically , the creation of this great bank will have an immense best effect upon their opportunities.",33
172,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In a day, if not in am in hour, the whole scene is changed. It wasbut yesterday that honourable members of the Opposition said that this banking proposal was most stupid and unworthy, and, indeed, that it was an impossible proposiTo-day we are told by the samehonorable members that it is going to> be a great institution, which will overlap others and prevent the. States from carrying legislation in the same direction. Thisask, Government is not antagonistic to the States; on the contrary, it is most friendly",33
173,Mr GORDON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Why not take them bias partners?,33
174,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Alread y the Government of the honourable member's own - Statehas agreed to bank with this institution, quite apart from any question of partnerThe question of partnership hasnever been raised by it, nor has it beenproposed, or suggested, by any of the States. It is quite true that the Minister of Home Affairs, at the Brisbane Conferoutlined a scheme, which met witha general approval there, in which itwasproposed that the States should co-operatecenwith the Commonwealth in the establishment of a National bank. That scheme, however, is not part of our platform. It is equally true that, for twenty years, a State banking proposal was outlined inconnexion with nearly every State Labour 0 platform in Australia. The people knew exactly what was meant. I do not wish to take away any of the credit to which the honourable member for Darwin is entitled for constantly keeping this question before the public. The business of this Parliament, however, is primarily, to establish a Commonwealth Bank to transact Commonwealth banking business, leaving it open at any time for the States to come in and co-operate with us if they so desire, The proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition, as I understand it, is that the passing of this Bill should be delayed until the States, by co-operating with us, become partners in this concern. If that' is his proposition, then I venture to say, with the greatest respect to the States, that the Bill will not be passed during this, or the next, Parliament. The second point to be considered is whether we could take in one State if the remainder did not elect to come in. In my opinion, such an arrangement would meet with absolute failure. When all the States desired to co-operate with us we could amend this measure in accordance with their wishes, so that there could be co-operation , and joint action, on the part of the Commonwealth and the States, in dealing with the great question of the State debts and their own financial business. After all, the question of the management of the State debts will, undoubtedly, come ultimately into this banking scheme, whether the bank be a cooperative concern or not. That, in my opinion, is inevitable. So far from the Commonwealth Bank proposed to be established being.un-Federal, I say that it will be most Federal. The Opposition have been most persistent in the assertion that a citizen of a State is also a citizen of the Commonwealth. How, then, can they say that the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank will injure the citizen of a State if it benefits him as a citizen of the Commonwealth? We have no power to coerce the States in this matter, but when they think fit they may express a desire to become partners in this national banking institution, and it will be found that this Government is just as desirous of co-operating with them as they are to co-operate with us. But to insert in this Bill a provision, making it at condition precedent to the establishment of - a Commonwealth Bank, that the States shall have agreed to co-operate, would be to cause a fatal delay and to disrupt the whole policy of the bank. I wish the Leader of the Opposi[11.6]- 2 tion to disabuse his mind altogether of the ideathat this Government is antagonistic to the States. I wish him, and those who are acting with him-in short, I desire all who take any interest in this banking proposal-to know thaL the Government are anxious to pass a Commonwealth Bank Bill for Commonwealth banking purposes, and that they wish to leave it open to the States at any time to express a desire to become partners in it. When that desire is expressed it will be time to raise the question brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition. In my opinion, the best managed bank will be such a bank as we propose, governed by one central authority, rather than by a combination of interests. In that way, alone, shall we secure a bank of the greatest utility. I do not say that we are shutting the door against the States coming in. We leave the door perfectly open, so far as this proposal is concerned, but I do not think it would be wise to de? - lay the passing of the Bill until the States came to an agreement regarding the question. The Leader of the Opposition knows how difficult it is to get them to agree upon anything, and that difficulty would be intensified in this connection, seeing that the States, notwithstanding that they had the original, constitutional power to establish banks of their own, have, in no case, attempted to pass legislation, providing for the creation of a bank to do general banking business. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on having' hinted to the State Governments that, they should have embraced before now the many opportunities offered them to create banks of their own. They would then have been in a position to say, "" Here we are with our own institutions - We shall be able to come in and co-operate with you."" Even if we have separate management, in my opinion co-operation is better than the merging of one bank into another. I am not of the view that it would be advisable at present to ask the States to become shareholders in this bank. I shall not dogmatize upon this .question, which has been sprung upon me, but I think the , people of the Commonwealth will be best and most expeditiously served if we pass this Bill , providing for Commonwealth control, on the understanding that when the States have arrived at an agreement -- to come in, and express a desire to do so, they will be able to, come in and be > shareholders with us' in a co-operative banking concern.",33
175,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Maribyrnong) [6.6] I regret that the honourable member for Parkes is not in the chamber, since I wish to refer to an incident which arose when he was addressing .the Committee. You will remember, Mr Chairman, calling me to order when I insisted that the honourable member had made a certain statement inferring that honourable members were ignorant of banking. I rather resented such an assertion, but since the honourable member has assured me that he did not make it I wish to withdraw my statement that he did. I was rather pleased to hear the Prime Minister say that the Government intend to pursue the open-door policy, so far as the States are concerned, in regard to this proposal; but if we were to adjourn the further consideration of the Bill until the State Treasurers had had an opportunity to discuss it, I am afraid that we should have to postpone it indefinitely. I should like the Treasurer to insert in the Bill a provision indicating to the State Governments that the door will be open to., them to comp in later on. Mr DEAKIN:-Ope n now; not necessarily later on..",35
176,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Perhaps the Bill as it stands leaves the door ajar. tainly think it ought to be open to the States to come in. Some honourable members have been exceedingly afraid of politics entering into the management of this institution, and ' I think that honourable members on both sides are averse to anything of the kind, It is difficult, however, to determine where what may be* called political influence ceases and practical management begins. I read today a speech made by the late Mr G. D . Carter, when Treasurer of Victoria in 1894, in moving the second reading of a Bill providing for the introduction of the Credit Foncier system in connection with the State Savings Bank. The honourable gentleman was surprisingly frank in pointing out what part, in his opinion, the Government should play in connection with that institution. In - the course of his speech he saidThe Bill makes the whole of the property and cash that may come into the hands of the Savings Bank Commissioners, Government property. We guarantee the depositors; and we have the right to control the finances of the institution. We should have - a preferential lien upon the money deposited. The right to veto a loan. The honourable member for Ballarat will probably tell us whether the Bill as passed gave effect to those views. It appears to me that the Treasurer of Victoria at that time had no fear of enunciating his views in that direction.",35
177,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is a very particular institution for advances of a particular kind.,35
178,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is all very well, but the fact remains that it is a bank. In reading the debate on that measure, I felt that I was reading the debate on the Bill now before us. The same old objections that were trotted out against that measure have been raised against that with which we are now dealing. There seemed to be no fear, however, in the mind of the late Mr G. DCarter, who was generally regarded as a Free Trade Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. It was in 1894, immediately after the banking crisis, that the Bill was introduced, because he believed there would be a great demand for cheaper money. Up to that time producers and others had had to pay 9 and 10 per cent; but as soon as that measure was announced the rate came down.",35
179,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The whole thing has been recast in the meantime; and the Credit Foncier has practically nothing to do with I cer- the Savings Bank.,35
180,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It may have been recast, but that was what was done at the time. I am simply giving the expressions of opinion as they occurred in debate, and as reported in the State Hansard. I protest against any delay in order to await the decision of the State Premiers. I do not believe that any decision would be come to until the Premiers meet in Conference in the early part of next year; and there will always be the open door for them to come in if they choose.",35
181,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hindmarsh) [6.12]. - We are indebted to the Prime Minister for the clear explanation he has given of this phase of the question. The States are free to come in if they exhibit any desire to do so; and to await any action on their part would, for obvious reasons, be a great mistake. If the measure be passed on the lineslaid down, it will be a clear indication that the management must be in the hands of bankers without any political control ; and the States, if they do come in, must do so under those conditions. In the past the States have been free .to institute banks of their own, but - they have not done so. The attempt made in South Australia years ago by the late Mr Kingston, failed. I venture to say, because of that distinguished and august body, the Legislative Council. The Legislative Councils of Australia will see that no State Bank is ever started, and that none of the States take a part in the proposed Commonwealth Bank. But it is just as well that the States should know the real position, and that they should not be able to say in the future that they had never had any invitation. If the States do take an interest in the bank, they will naturally want a nominee on the board; and how, then, could it be said that there was no political control. course, I am now speaking solely for myself, and 1 may say that I feel very strongly on the inatter. 1 see no likelihood of the States taking an interest in the concern; but, if they do, it must be on the principles laid down in the Bill. If they do not choose to join in this enterprise, let them start their own State Banks as soon or as late as they like.",35
182,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Richmond) [6.16] - It is strange to hear l i e Prime Minister say. ing that the door is to be left open to the States to subscribe capital to an institution to which the Commonwealth itself does not propose to subscribe a single sixpence, and, yet, that the States shall have no voice in the management. How is it possible to put such a provision in the Bill without affording them an opportunity later on to share in the government of the bank? Would any honourable member be prepared to subscribe to the share capital of a company and be deprived of any voice in its management? If the Prime Minister is genuine in his desire to give the States an opportunity later on to come in as shareholders, he ought also to indicate in what way they may be able to share in the management. It is of no use our simply putting a placard of this description in the Bill , unless we also indicate the conditions.",36
183,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We cannot do that.,36
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I know we cannot, simply because the whole scheme has not been properly thought out-n o general idea has been given of what eventually is to be done. There has been no proper inquiry; and, as a result, honourable members are acting without sufficient information. I say, the Commonwealth does not propose to subscribe a single sixpence.",36
185,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No one believes that about the capital.,36
186,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Commonwealth is not subscribing any capital to the institution ; it is simply making a loan for the time being. It is not even stated that this,£1,000,000 in debentures will be subscribed by the Commonwealth, and it may be subscribed by the public. Even if - it is subscribed by the Commonwealth it will be merely in the form of a loan; it will not be capital put into the institution by the Commonwealth. If we are genuine in our desire to see the States shareholders, we should indicate to them the general conditions in which they may become partners. It has been stated that the GovernOf ment, business will be a* matter of considerable moment to an institution of this sort, and that considerable revenue will be thereby derived. The Prime Minister was good enough to answer some questions of mine this afternoon, and we learn that the banks of Australia paid to the Commonwealth no less than £ 4 , 7 3 7 more than the Commonwealth, paid to the banks. The Commonwealth paid the banks £ 2 , 8 5 0 for conducting their banking business in exchange, and the banks, in competition with one another for the Commonwealth drafts on London, owing to having certain charges to .adjust at the other end of the world, paid to the Commonwealth no less than £ 6 , 5 6 2 for the privilege of negotiating those drafts. This may come as news to the honourable member, but it is well known in banking circles. The banks, in competition for money at distant places, where there are settlements to adjust, and so forth, are often very willing to purchase a draft, and give a. considerable premium on it.",36
187,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Flinders-lan e firms do that.,36
188,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Precisely . The banks also paid to the Commonwealth £ 1 , 0 2 5 as interest on fixed deposit. Honourable members will see that the Commonwealth Bank, so far as Govermnent business is concerned, will not make proiits, but will probably have to make a loss. , Mr SPENCE (Darling) [6.23] - The honourable member for Richmond does not seem able to get out of his head the idea of an ordinary bank, into which a number As of gentlemen put a certain amount of capital, with a view to dividends. And he compares such an institution with a National bank, established for the benefit and advantage of the whole people, who are really the shareholders, and who are not seeking profit in the same way. The suggestion that the States should come in as shareholders seems to suggest that some advantages would thereby accrue to the State Governments j and, if that be so, it must mean advantages in the way of political influence and political control. As a matter of fact, the people as a whole will reap any advantage there may be from the establishment of this bank; and to admit the State Governments would mean an alteration of the whole scheme. When the States express any desire to come in as shareholders, it will be quite time enough to talk about making provision of the kind. I believe the State Governments will very quickly find it to their advantage in handing some of their business to give patronage to the Commonwealth Bank in the ordinary business way. I do not see how they could do any more than that, even if we declared them to be shareholders, and gave them a say in the management. I trust the measure will be left on its present lines, ing it open to any improvement which the States may suggest, but always keeping in view the advantage of the people as a whole. This Parliament represents the people as a whole, and the State Parliaments represent only sections of the people. I do not see any advantage to be derived for the whole people by the States, as representing sections of them, coming into . the management. On the other hand, there might be a considerable element of danger through too much political and Governmental influence, which, ought specially to be avoided. It is not correct to say that the bank will be managed by one man only. The Governor of the bank will have great responsibilities, but I think we shall get better results than we should if we had divided control. I do not think that Australian experience has shown that government by three Commissioners has been an improvement on government by one man. There has rather been a difficulty in ing responsibility where more than one man is concerned.",36
189,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Are not three heads better than one?,37
190,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There is no doubt that the able man who will be secured as the Governor of the bank will .consult the experts and authorities regarding any important step that he has to take. is a provision in the measure for a Deputy Governor, which seems to have been overlooked, and when branches are established there will have to be managers appointed for. them. There will, therefore, be plenty of brainy men available for the Governor of the bank to consult. Let any honourable member picture himself as manager of the bank. What would he do as a sensible man, but get all the advice available, and then, after analyzing it, use his best judgment in deciding his course of action, he having the power and responsibility of deciding in any case? It is best to give responsibility to an able man, who will do his best, and be careful. Nobody rushes bull-headed into a job of that kind, and in any ticklish proposition the Governor would take die advice of those concerned ",37
191,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,^He would consult experts who Iiave no responsibility.,37
192,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"He would get the opinions of those whose opinions he considered of value, and then use his own judgment. It is a mistake to say that only one man's brains will be running the show, when there will be quite a host of managers leavas the business is extended, and all their opinions will be considered by the man in charge. I think the bank is being started on the safest lines. Probably the Governor will start carefully and slowly, and he will need to do so, as he will not have a great amount of working capital to begin with. I do not see any of the dangers that have been depicted. They are possibilities, but they are certainly not probabilities, if we have a man of experience and tested judgment in charge. It is not at all likely that a total stranger to banking will be appointed. We must get the best man available, and pay him a handsome salary to conduct what we believe will become the great National Bank of Australia, and be of great service to the country, corresponding in position with the Bank of England in the Old World. Sitting su?-pended from 6-jo to 7 -45 p.m.  locatnot know that I should have spoken but for the Prime Minister's remark that the Federal Government were animated by no feelings of antagonism towards the State Governments in regard to this measure. There is an old truism that actions speak louder than words, and we know that one division of the Bill relates to the establishment of a Commonwealth Savings There Bank. . All the States have at present Savings Banks in existence. We may disclaim as loudly as possible any desire to injure the States in that regard, but the fact remains that we are starting a bank which will run in opposition to the Savings Banks of the States. I question whether the Federal Parliament is entitled to establish a .Commonwealth Bank in - opposition to banks already being run by the States. The Prime Minister was also good enough to say that the States could come in: and work with the Federal Government in connection with this bank. We are entitled, to ask in what way they - can come in. I have pondered the matter over since the statement was made, and the only possible way that I can see for them to come in is as customers of the bank. There is no provision implied or - expressed in the.Bill by which they could come in as partners. In fact, the determination appears to be to make it a Federal bank pure and simple. The Prime Minister has not placed before us thosedetails which are necessary to enable us to form a proper opinion as towhether we should establish this bank. It was probably an unfortunate slip of the tongue on his part when he said that it was not the duty of the Government to afford such information to the Opposition; but whether it was a slip or not, it is undoubtedly being carried out in practice. Are we to set up large banking, establishments in all the chief centres? Are we to evict the State Savings Banks from the post-offices in order to establish our own? There are also a number of other particulars which ought to be supplied - to us before we carry the clause. Of course, it will be carried in spite of us; but I am entitled to raise my protest against the deliberate determination by a majority of this House, to establish this bank, in view of the fact that it is going to have very seriousconsequences to the State Savings Banks, and also in its general banking business, because we are to put ourselves in opposition to existing banks possessing large capital and resources. Unless we put the money of the taxpayers into the venture, to give it stability ancl strength, it will be a pigmy in comparison with the existing banks , from 1 the point of view of the capital at command.",37
193,Mr BILEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"--Are you against any form of Commonwealth banking""?  certain circumstances it might be judiciously entered upon. I should not raise a word of opposition to it if it were a bank purely to deal with Commonwealth securities, and transact Commonwealth banking business; but when it ventures into the realm of general banking business, and of Savings Banks which are already existing in every one of the States, it- - becomes an - altogether different and much more complex question, which ought to receive more serious consideration than it has so far had. We should consider whether we are justified in enteringthe realms of private enterprise, for the establishment of this bank means that, and means also a large increase in the number of Commonwealth employees. The number will' be small at first, but it will be gradually increased until it becomes a very considerable contingent. I dread the time when we shall have so multiplied our enterprises that the Commonwealth employees will be sufficiently numerous to become perhaps a dominating factor in the government of the country.",38
194,Mr RILEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"They are all individuals.  step in the socialistic direction, and appeals toymen with socialistic tendencies; but I am opposed to that sort of thing, ancl to the establishment of this bank, for that reason, coupled with others. If it becomes a marked success, it will mean a large augmentation of the number of Commonwealth employees, and to that extent it constitutes a somewhat menacing feature. ;",38
195,Mr HOWE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Does that apply if it is going to be a success? Mir. PALMER - The more successful it is, the more employees you have, and the more you multiply the number of Governmentemployes, the more you make the Commonwealth socialistic in its nature. I maintain that a socialistic condition is a danger which right-thinking people ought to set their faces against in every possible way.",38
196,Mr RILEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Are you against the Government running the railways ?  things which perhaps can be done judiciously by the Government. At any rate, that is no argument for multiplying indefinitely the number of concerns to be brought under Government control. The more we depart from the proper functions of government, the further we shall get away from the ideal conditions which, ought to surround every Government!",38
197,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Capricornia) [7.54] - I was very pleased to hear that the Prime Minister had every desire to allow the States to come into the Commonwealth Bank, because I realise that, unless it has the assistance of the State Governments, it is going to have a very stormy passage for some years. Those of us who have taken notice of the opposition with which every State enterprise has met, must see that the Commonwealth Bank is sure to meet with the same. When, with the cooperation of the British, Canadian, and New Zealand Governments, the Pacific Cable Board was created, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company set up the most unfair competition, and today the State owned Socialistic concern makes a deficit of many thousands per annum.",38
198,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,But its creation forced the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company to reduce its rates by more than one-half.,39
199,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , and similarly the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank will bring about the reduction of interest by i or 2 per cent.. But it is necessary to have the co-operation of the States to prevent a deficit in its working.",39
200,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Withi n a little time there will not be States.,39
201,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I cannot argue that question now, but such remarks create antagonism between the Governments of the States and that of the Commonwealth, which hinders Commonwealth enterprises, to the detriment of both. Again, when the New Zealand Insurance Department was started, the private insurance companies lowered their rates, doing all they could to maintain their business, and to attract fresh customers. There are twenty-two banks in business in Australia, and the Queensland National Bank alone has fifty-four or fifty-five branches in Queensland. The whole of our commercial business, with the exception of the little done by the Savings Banks, is in their hands. When the Commonwealth Bank is established, and the managers of the private concerns find that customers are likely to remove their accounts, they will ascertain the reason, and if it is that lower rates can be obtained from the Commonwealth, the rates charged by the private banks will be reduced. If the Commonwealth lends out money at 5 per cent., the private banks will probably lend at 4J per cent. There are other ways in which they will try to prevent the Commonwealth Bank from doing business: It will be impossible for the Commonwealth to establish as many branches of its bank as there are branches of the private banks. It will not be possible to have a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in every country town.",39
202,Mr HOWE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That will take time.,39
203,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , and that very fact makes it all the more necessary to obtain the co-operation of the Governments of the States. The Queensland Government has an agreement with the Queensland National Bank for the transaction of all Government business by that bank until 1921. That points to a way out of our difficulty. We should insert in the Bill a clause which will allow any State transacting business with the Commonwealth Bank to obtain a proportional share of the bank's profits. I do not think that the profits will be great, because of the competition of the private banks, but the public will gain by the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank by getting cheaper money. But if the action of the Commonwealth in establishing a National Bank is regarded by the Governments of the States as a high handed procedure, and they are further irritated by competition with their Sayings Banks, the Commonwealth institution will suffer.",39
204,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Would the honourable member permit the States to share in the control of the Commonwealth Bank?,39
205,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not clear how the States should share in the management of the bank. They might be allowed representation on an Advisory Board, though I hold the view that the management of the bank must, as far as possible, be beyond political control. The States might be given a power like that of the Senate in regard to financial Bills, namely a suggesting power. Undoubtedly one-man control is necessary for the success of the institution. There could not be two captains navigating one ship, and to have the bank controlled by a Board might neutralize the efforts of the man possessing the best brains for its management. If the States come in, it will not be long before some settlement is arrived at regarding the transference and redemption of their debts by the Commonwealth.",39
206,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Calare) [8.7]. - I recognise the advisableness of permitting the States to obtain an interest in the Commonwealth Bank. While this Parliament and Government represent the whole Commonwealth, each of the State Parliaments and Governments represents a portion of the Commonwealth, and the latter have undertaken big financial obligations which could be best managed through » central institution of the kind proposed. No doubt it is the intention of the Government to meet the States in this matter. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth is empowered to take over the debts of the States for the purpose of consolidating and redeeming them, but nothing will be done without their consent and cooperation. According tb the Commonwealth Statistician, the State loans will mature at a rapid rate in the near future. Between 19 n and 1915 loans amounting to £38,000,00 0 mature, in the next lustrum ,£39,000,000, in the next £49,000,000 , and in the next £19,000,000 , or £^77,000,000 within ten years, and about £146,000,000 within twenty years. Some of the States are more favourably situated than are others, and I regret to find that New South Wales in this respect is not too well placed. For instance, in 1912 it will have to meet a maturing debt of nearly £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 1918 it will have to meet a maturing debt of nearly £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and in 1924 - a debt of about £16,500,000.",39
207,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,And the States keep on piling up the public debt.,40
208,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; when we federated the indebtedness of the States amounted to about £200,000,000 , whereas today it exceeds £250,000,000 . In addition to these maturing debts, new debts are being created, and I hold that the handling of these maturing debts can be successfully dealt with only through an institution of this character. therefore endeavour as far as possible to secure the co-operation of the States, and we should have that co-operation in connection with the Savings Bank side of this proposition. The States at present not being in common agreement, the Commonwealth must give them the lead, and it can give them a lead only by passing a measure of the character of that now before us. The Commonwealth can deal with the matter only from its own standpoint, but it should be ready to welcome the co-operation of the States, and to make every provision to meet them in a reasonable manner. I was pleased to hear the declaration of the Prime Minister this afternoon that he was prepared to make this scheme fit in, as far as possible, with that requirement. That being so, I do not think there is any reasonable ground for strong exception being taken to it. I can understand the opposition of those who, like the honourable member for Echuca, are against the principle of the Bill ; but those who believe in the principle of it can find nothing in this proposal to prevent their hearty co-operation in building up an institution which will be worthy of the whole Commonweal th.",40
209,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat) [8.15] - It is very gratifying to discover that the general feeling of the Committee is at least not antagonistic to, and in some respects is governed by, a desire to see a closer relation between the Commonwealth and the States in the management of this bank.. The remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia show that he, at all events, is able to take a broader outlook, and to realise our responsibilities. I am disappointed, however, that no more positive step is to be taken. I brought the matter under the attention of the Committee, without any idea of causing delay. Still the probable advantages to be gained 0 ; in by an immediate junction of the forces of the Commonwealth and the States in finance is so important that, personally, I would have faced any necessary delay in order to bring it about. That, however, did not appear to me then, and does not appear to me now, to be essential. I would urge the Prime Minister between now and the time when the Bill leaves the Committee to consider whether something more than the open-door policy cannot be proposed to the States-whethe r we should not have the open hand as well as the open door. Let him consider whether we ought We should not to make in this measure at least some preparation such as would anticipate and if possible avoid the delay of waiting for further legislation in the event of the-States making to the Commonwealth overtures that it could reciprocate. It would be better still if the Commonwealth would make the overtures to the Governments of all the States, placing upon them the direct responsibility either of availing themselves of the opportunity or of pursuing their own individual courses. The general attitude of honourable members on both sides, especially considering the disadvantages by which we are faced in dealing with this matter at practically the close of the session, and in circumstances of great pressure, is encouraging. It should indicate to our critics outside that a broad national spirit is a Federal spirit. This proposition, important as I think it must be, is not undertaken with the object of the aggrandisement either of this Government or this Parliament. Our position is too well established to need anything of the kind. We can lose nothing in this regard. Nothing can be taken from us by any step in this direction. In these circumstances, and commending this matter to the further consideration of the Prime Minister, I shall allude only to the suggestion made from several quarters that the obstacles to this rapprochement between the States ancl the Commonwealth are to be found in the secondChambers of the States. If there is an obstacle, and that obstacle is effective, it is immaterial to us where it lies. I shall, however, be much surprised if the members of those Chambers of review, who, in the case of most of the States, are men of considerable business and financial experience, do not realise the golden opportunity now afforded them. At all events, if after the proposition has been submitted to them by their respective Governments, they still persist in turning a deaf ear, the responsibility will rest, not upon the Commonwealth, but upon those who will hereafter be called to account for their obstruction - Our aim, 'therefore, should be not simply to allow them to "" come in , "" as it has been phrased several times this evening, but to induce them to come in. We can undertake that task for reasons which, the honourable member for Calare put very happily. We are one and the same people. of us is a citizen of a State, as well as a citizen of the Commonwealth, and we are severally interested in the welfare of our several States, just as we are all interested stood. in the welfare of the whole.",40
210,Mr WEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Then why want dual control?,41
211,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not wish to pursue the honourable member with special propositions to meet his case. I am prepared to accept others far less acceptable to me if only this one great end can be achieved.,41
212,Mr HOWE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Canno t the honourable member make some definite proposition?,41
213,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"-We are nearing the close of the session, and the Government are at present disinclined to do more than intimate their willingness to receive proaches in this direction.",41
214,Mr FISHEK,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I go further, and say that I am quite willing to approach the States in any wav that will lead to mutual benefit.",41
215,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is better still. But we are near the end of the session, and until we receive some response from the States, I do not think the Prime Minister or his party will excuse us if we set to work to discuss all the precise terms on which this co-operation can be accomplished. Until we have received some further indication from them, we are not in a position to ask the Prime Minister to set aside the 'business - we are at present engaged upon in order that we may deal with the matter. .In these circumstances, I have endeavoured to be as brief as possible, and, indeed,,; have done much- injustice to this great subject by the rapid and cursory way with which I have felt bound to treat it pending some direct overture to and from the States. . , But if such an overture comes before this House rises, - we shall have no excuse for not prolonging the session sufficiently long to put this instrument in shape, and so permit the States to come in :and take advantage of it. I trust that, throughout Australia, it will be recognised that the Commonwealth Parliament realizes the importance of this instrument which is being shaped, especially for governmental purposes, and particularly in relation to the States. I have now found a passage in the report of the speech of the right honourable member for Swan, in which he defined in a few words his idea of a Commonwealth Bank. He said- . I think that a central bank to manage the Each financial transactions of the Government, including the taking over of the State debts, and the control of the note issue, is necessary, - so long as the position of that bank in relation to the Government is clearly defined and underI have made this quotation to indicate that, although there are differences of opinion as to the character of the particular bank now being established, and the functions that it should fulfil, we are, at all events-mos t of us on both sides are-agree d that those functions call for just that Federal unity ih financial matters between the Commonwealth and the States that I have been urging this afternoon. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 agreed to. Clause 7The Bank shall, in addition to any other appowers conferred by this Act, have power(a) to carry on the general business of banking; (*) to acquire and hold land on any tenure; (c) to receive money on deposit, either for a fixed term or on current account; (d) to make advances by way of loan, overdraft, or otherwise: (e) to discount bills and drafts; (/) to issue bills and drafts, and grant letters of credit; [g) to deal in exchanges, specie, bullion, gold-dust, assayed gold, and precious metals; (A) to borrow money; and (:) to do anything incidental to any of it* powers. 1 ' Mr DEAKIN (Ballarat) [8.24] - Referring back to the quotation just read as - to the functions that a Commonwealth Bank - is called upon to fulfil , we find that, first paragraph of this clause, which deals with the whole of the powers proposed to be conferred upon the institution, there is a broad line of demarcation. I refer to the paragraph authorizing the bank to carry on the general business of banking. It is thoroughly understood, therefore, that so far. as this bank is concerned, all busi-riess, .even speculative-usin g the word in the proper business sense-al l transactions involving a certain amount of risk, or dealing with private interests, is brought within the scope of this institution. Whatever an existing bank may do in its private relations, the Commonwealth Bank may also do. This appears to be venturing into a very' dangerous field, at all events at this stage of the bank's existence. I do not propose to debate the question, because it is one of those matters on which I understand Ministers have made up their minds.",41
216,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member differ from the proposal?,42
217,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do; I doubt whether it is wise to undertake such business. Of course, the Governor of the bank will invite this class of business, but he can expect but little for some time to come, especially with 'the resources at his disposal. The only other sub-clause to which I propose to call attention is sub-clause 4, which gives the bank power to borrow money. It .appears, therefore, that the no-borrowing .policy of the Government party is abandoned. Borrowing is now an open part of the programme of honourable members opposite.",42
218,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member not see that when the bank accepts de- posits it borrows money?',42
219,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Such transactions also come under the head of borrowing, but the draftsman evidently considers there is sufficient difference to place the two kinds of borrowing in two sub-clauses.",42
220,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The sub-clause means what it says-that the bank may borrow from another bank for its immediate con- venience.,42
221,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is not limited to borrowing from another bank-the borrowing may be from any and every source, i Mr FISHER - But I think that is the practical limit.",42
222,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The bank may also borrow from any Government, if the Government of the day are susceptible; there in the is no limit to the borrowing. Consequently, I take it that the policy of borrowing, which was formally sanctioned by this House, is now part and parcel of the Labour policy of the country.",42

224,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member who interjects is delighted at this measure, because it nationalizes banking.",42
225,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It does not, though I say it ought to.",42
226,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is a step towards that end.,42
227,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"A good step, too.",42
228,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is the nationalization of one bank for a particular purpose; and if the other banks could be suppressed by another Bill , the honourable member's satisfaction would be complete.",42
229,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Not suppressedI did not use the word.,42
230,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member did not, but his policy must lead him! to rejoice if all other banks were suppressed,"" and the whole banking of Australia nationalized by this means.",42
231,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hear , hear. I would act in all fairness, and not take anything from the other banks.",42
232,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not mean that the honourable member would what is commonly called rob the banks, but he is prepared to rob them of any opportunity of future advantage which he can acquire for his national institution ?",42
233,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I would treat them as I would the trusts-absor b them.,42
234,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What the honourable member condemns in a trust he applauds in the nation? Mr FRANK. FOSTER - The nation is the trust in this case.,42
235,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"What kind of trust? However that may be, this is a very important clause, and I call attention to these two points.",42
236,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"New England) [8.31] - I , of course, expected opposition from the honourable member for Ballarat to the proposal that this bank shall do all the work of a private bank. The history of all our attempts at State banking discloses opposition of the kind. In New South Wales there are two very exof cellent Savings Banks which are connot sidered National banks; in fact, they undertaken land mortgage business, of which they do a great deal.",42
237,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The right to do that was secured only after a big struggle.,43
238,Mr FRANKFOSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not in tend to go into that matter. We all know the benefit it is to a bank, when lending money, to have the account of the bormortgage Department. rower within the bank, and thus give opportunity to operate in .credit instead of actual cash. The idea of those who always oppose State banks is to force the Governa separate Bill.' ment to borrow money at a certain rate, and then lend it out again. In New South Wales the borrower was in the gestion ? glorious position that he went to the State bank and got his loan and immediately placed the proceeds in a private bank, which was able to operate on the money a free deposit. I congratulate the Goto do that? vernment on having embodied the principle of private business in this Bill . Many people who support our movement have asked, "" Why shouJd the Federal Gobeing vernment go so far as to create a National bank when there are State Banks in a cipal at a time. number of the States?"" But we really 'have no State Banks, only land Departments carried on in the most re stricted way possible, without any of ordinary powers of a bank. The Comman monwealth Bank will be able to deal rectly with its customers, with all power to control credit and unfixed debusiness. posits ; and this makes it paramount above every other effort at State banking hitherbe to. The Upper Houses of the States have alwaysopposed State banking, and all the State Governments are absolutely powerless to pass a measure like that before us. For many years to come will be utterly impossible for any State Government, no matter how strong in the Lower House, to establish a full and complete State Bank without first conqueradvanced. ing the Upper House. This shows the see absolute necessity for our going straight ahead with the Commonwealth Bank. As to asking the States to come in and assist with the management of the Commonthat way. wealth Bank, I could not tolerate such a proposal for a moment-to my mind it is absurd. As we go along with our policy of nationalization, and the nationalization, for instance, of monopolies, I trust the Federal power will be able to manage own business. So far as the absorption banking business is concerned, I have heard one complaint through the press have or otherwise; there has been something said about the Savings Banks, but that is all. I should like to ask the Prime Minister, in regard to the Credit Foncier, or land mortgage business, whether it is proposed to set forth the rate of interest to be charged on the loans.

A in business who has good assets with dia chance of making money, and who is the afraid to borrow, has no right to be in I should further like to ask the Prime Minister whether he thinks it would permissible under this Bill to act upon the co-operative banking system, whereby there is pledged to the Government the combined credits of those who form the now co-operative bank. The Government lends it in a lump sum the required amount, and the co-operative bank conducts its own affairs in the small outlying districts, giving a good solid guarantee for the amount' I shouLd very much like to that idea incorporated in the Bill , as well as the. Credit Foncier system.",43
246,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I am quite sure the Government could deal with the matter in,43
247,Mr FRANKFOSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It would be unfortunate to allow the Bill to pass without some provision of that kind, because the co-operative banking system reaches the smallest borrower within the State or its the Commonwealth. It would be able to deal with kinds of loans with which a big bank manager could not cope. We could not ask him to look after the accounts, or go into details, but if co-operative societies - of farmers and settlers, artisans, or others, wanted the money even to build bouses, or anything of that kind, and we advanced them the money under their combined security, we should be going to the furthest limit of possibility in extending credit to the humblest borrower in the Commonwealth.",43
248,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Kooyong) [8.41]. - It was somewhat difficult to follow the - dialogue between the honourable member for New England and the Prime Minister. Am I to understand that the Prime Minister suggests that it will be quite competent - under this measure for him to carry on the Credit Foncier system as at present - operated by some of the State Savings Banks? Mr . FISHER - No ; I did not say said that the Governor could lend to any Crown. person or body of persons to whom he thinks he ought to lend.,44
249,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There is no - question about that; but the honourable member for . New England appeared to . argue upon the basis that this Bill was intended to include the Credit Foncier system, providing for small advances to mers, artisans, and others with a proper .system of repayment.",44
250,Mr RILEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,-That is a matter f o management of the bank.,44

252,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,My reply was quite the - opposite. I prefer that matter to be dealt with separately.,44
253,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That should be thoroughly understood, because the Credit Foncier system is quite opposed to - general principles of the Bill . .a system of borrowing by a process of mortgage bonds, and then retailing the proceeds - out to farmers, artisans, and others who about that. - choose to borrow.",44

255,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It cannot be done under this Bill. ',44
256,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the point I am making. Honourable members must mot be under the impression that this Bill pay. is so wide in its scope as to include an effective mode of carrying out the Credit Foncier according to recognised principles. It is essentially a commercial bank that is contemplated, and, consequently, widely opposed to the general principles of lending out in small sums such as have been suggested. The honourable member for Maribyrnong was under a wrong impression regarding the history of the Credit Foncier system in Victoria. It is quite true that a Billhaving for its object the establishment of the system was introduced by Mr Carter, who was Treasurer in the Patterson Administration, and the second reading speech quoted by the honourable member was in connection with that Bill ; but the Bill was never carried. Consequently, the comments on it would hardly . be apropos to a measure of this kind.",44
257,Mr FENTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I quoted it as the stateso. I ment of a responsible Minister of the,44
258,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"But the Bill to which the speech applied was never carried. As I interjected at the time, it was abandoned, and, subsequently, a Bill which embodied the true Credit Foncier - system was introduced. I understood the honourable member to say that the amounts borrowed farare a charge upon the Savings Bank of the State. As a matter of fact, while it is the same institution that carries on the r the ordinary Savings Bank business and the Credit Foncier system, the two sets of funds are kept completely apart. Separate which - investments are made of the Savings Bank deposits. It is provided that, I think, 25J per cent, may be devoted to advances upon lancl, and that the rest must be invested in Government or the like security; whereas money for the Credit Foncier system is procured by the selling of mortgage bonds, and, in setting it out, elaborate provisions are the necessary to show the borrowers the sysI t involves tem of repayment by instalments.",44

We are anxious to have not only their moral but their practical support in this banking scheme. At the same time we are not prepared to share the control of the bank. A divided control of that sort would be fatal to its success. On the other hand, of course, die control might be altogether too concentrated, but that is another question.. I would prefer one-man control to control divided among the separate States. In order to obtain the support of the States we must make some special provision for them in the Bill , if only by giving them a share of the profits proportionate to the extent of their transactions with the bank. That would be the most business like method of treating with them. I do not know whether the Prime Minister has yet made a definite pronouncement on the point, but we should do a little more than merely express an opinion on it. If the honourable gentleman agrees, I should like to see embodied in clause 7 some provision setting out that if the States will transact their business, which is enormous, through .the Commonwealth Bank, they will be permitted to share in its profits in proportion to the extent of iheir business.",45

That is the beginning of it. This clause is not the place to make the provision suggested by the honourable member for Macquarie. l t deals with the powers of the bank. The honourable member's suggestion ought to. be dealt with in a separate clause, indicate ing the position that would be given to a State Government doing its business with the bank, and what would be the quid pro quo.

The Government do not necessarily anticipate that the provisions of the clause are to be put into operation immediately in their entirety.

277,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"This is the clause which sets out the general powers of the bank, and it is illogical to have a powers clause in which all the powers of the institution are not stated. The magnanimity of the Prime Minister stops short at taking whatever, money the Savings Banks may be inclined to hand over to him.

Clause 9Tlie capital of the Bank shall be One million pounds",46
284,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Calare) [9.2]. - I do not know if the Government have a special reason for limiting the capital of the bank to £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . It seems to me that a large financial institution, adequately representing the Commonwealth, will need a much larger capital, particularly if it gets the business of the States. A private institution, started with similar aims and purposes, would not be limited to a capital of £1,000,000. In my opinion, the Commonwealth Bank needs a capital of at'least £5,000,000. At any rate, it is not unreasonable to give power for the extension of the capital to £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . If the money is not needed, it will not be drawn upon.",46
285,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [ 9 . 4 ] - I think that '£1,000,000 is more than enough to meet the requirements of the bank for the first few years. I speak with great diffidence-,, but the advice given to me, which coincides with my own views, is that the bank willsoon have more money than it can handle. The difficulty will be to make use of the money deposited with it, so as to pay working expenses, and at the same time give a good return to the depositors. I cannot conceive of the bank needing for capital purposes anything like £1,000,000within the first two or three years. The capital used in building and equipping; offices would probably be more like £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 than £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 for a good time to come. As soon as the bank opens itss doors, it will get money. Were I sure that first-class investments for that money could be found at once, I should have no doubt of the immediate success of the institution.

It is not proposed that the capital of the bank shall be £ i , o o o , c o o , but that £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 shall be lent to the bank. The absurdity of that proposition is shown by the fact that the banks of Australia, possess coin, bullion, and cash balances amounting to £37,198,339 , their advances being £159,237,265, their other assets £53,765,400 , and their total assets about £250,201,004.

It is said that Parliament can do everything but prevent a baby from crying, but it is extraordinaiy to find it declared by legislation that borrowed money shall be regarded as capital. I am surprised that the Government has not put Commonwealth money into the institution. The sum of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , or something like it, should have been voted to start the bank, whose profits could go into the Treasury. The bank will have to provide interest amounting to 3 ! per cent, on the capital lent to it , and at the end of the first year it will be in debt. A profit of per cent., in addition to the 3J per cent, interest, would amount to only £15,000. We were told, in answer to a question today, that the Government pays something like £ 2 , 0 0 0 to private banks for the management of its business, and receives about £ 6 , 0 0 0 for interest on money lent to them. Obviously its business is not of much advantage to the banks. £ 8 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 5 , 0 0 which probably will not pay expenses for the first year.

The proposal in clause 9 is that the capital of the bank should be £1,000,000 , to be raised by the - sale and issue of debentures. Clause 10, however, is supplementary to clause 9, and under it the Government may advance to the bank for the opening of offices for business, and the raising of sufficient capital to carry on business, any sum that the Government may, in its wisdom, or absence of wisdom, see fit. There is no bar at all upon the energies of the Government under the succeeding clause.",47

The position seems to be that we are not dealing with our own money, and can therefore afford to be liberal! It would be infinitely preferable if the whole of the capital of the bank were to be subscribed under this clause.

No doubt my honourable friends opposite, if they wished to hamper criticism of the finances of any proposal, would cut up the scheme into a number of clauses, and then claim that we must discuss them one at a time. That would be the best way to blind the eyes of the people as to what is proposed in this case.",48
300,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I have allowed the honourable member considerable latitude in discussing clause io.,48
301,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not propose to discuss it further. The proper way to have drafted this measure would have been to set forth in clause 9 what, after close examination of the bank's probable requirements, we were prepared to give it to put it on ifs feet, and to expect the bank to be responsible for the repayment of the money so handed over to it.",48
302,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Richmond) [9.15] - It may possibly be owing to the fact that honourable members opposite believe that the credit of the Commonwealth is to be behind this bank that they think they are, entitled in connection with it to depart from what is known as sound finance. Any private institution starting on these lines would be scouted by the financial world. I am glad that honourable members opposite, judging by their cheers, share that view. would remind them that financiers will equally scout an institution started by the Government which departs from the principles of sound finance. If there is one thing which this bank should eventually do it is, I believe, the work of dealing with the debts of the States; but unless this bank has'the good opinion of the financial world, it will be utterly useless to us for that purpose. I stated during the second reading debate my reasons for believing that the capital of this bank should be subscribed privately. [ should be perfectly willing to see the rate of interest fixed.",48
303,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What rate?,48
304,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Anywhere in the vicinity of from 4 to 4J per cent, on the shares.",48
305,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then the honourable member would load up the bank right away? [""71",48
306,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Government propose to do that in any circumstances. Everything in connection with the starting of the bank, and the cost of its premises should come out of capital account. That being so, what is the reason for clause 10? If it is proposed to . raise by means of debentures the money necessary for the capitalization of the bank, why is it proposed to give the Treasurer power to make a temporary loan to the bank? All the expenditure in the initial stages of the bank should come out of capital account.",48
307,Mr HALL,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Mus t there not be some preliminary expenses?,48
308,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The initial expenditure, whatever it is, in starting the bank should constitute capital expenditure. It should come out of the £1,000,000 to be raised by the sale and issue of debentures. .",48
309,Mr HALL,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"So it will, when the bank repays the advance made by the Treasurer.",48
310,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Then what is the reason for clause 10?,48
311,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,When we reach that clause I shall tell the Committee. - Mr MASSYGREENE - The two«clauses should be read together.,48
312,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.19] - The two experts, 'according to their own statements, have spoken; but I differ from their views. I believe that the Bill is drafted in a sensible, straightforward manner. It provides that the capital of the bank shall be £1,000,000, to be raised by the sale and issue of debentures. Meantime, the bank being a Commonwealth institution, thu Treasurer of the Commonwealth is to adI vance it the moneys necessary to enable it to get a start, and to issue its debentures. The money so advanced, however, is to be repaid to the Commonwealth. The position is simplicity itself. The honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Richmond say that these two matters should be provided for in the same clause.",48
313,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"But should not the bank be started with some capital ? Mr FISHER. - Mone y will be advanced by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to enable it to begin operations. Immediately the Governor of the bank has commenced operations, he will be able to sell debentures up to £1,000,000, and he can then repay to the Commonwealth the amount advanced to it prior to the issue of those debentures. The. two matters, instead of being embodied in one clause, are, in my opinion, properly dealt with in two clauses. The one clause deals with the capital of the bank and the other with the power of the Treasurer to advance the bank the money necessary to enable it to commence business and raise its capital by means of the sale and issue of debentures.",48
314,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Fawkner) [9.23] It is obvious from the statements of the Government and their supporters that the capital of this bank is to be the credit of the Commonwealth.,49
315,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does that mean that the capital is to fluctuate?,49
316,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I suppose so. feel in duty bound once more to remind honourable members opposite that, although we are assured that the credit of the Commonwealth is* far superior to that of any private institution or individual, the credit of other countries has suffered reverses. Issues of notes by the United States Government have been sold on the public market at a discount of, I dare say, from 75 to 85 per cent. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They the highest bonds in the world.",49
317,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The point I wish to make is, that we are constantly being assured that the credit of the Commonwealth will always stand. Are we never u> have.any reverses? Are we always to have plain sailing? Is our credit aiways to be at its present high level ?",49
318,Mr HALL,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,A r e we ever going broke?,49
319,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I hope not; but this is the sort of irresponsible finance thai is going to break us. I do not expect change the opinions of honourable members opposite, but it behoves me to point om that the credit of other countries has suffered reverses, and that that m&y be the experience of the Commonwealth.. To establish a bank without capital, and upon nothing more than credit, is little short of a midsummer night's madness. Clause agreed to. Clause 10(1.) The Treasurer may, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, make advances to the bank for the purpose of enabling it to defrayanv of the expenses incidental to the establishment of the bank, the opening of offices thereof for business, and the raising of sufficient capital for carrying on business. (2!) Any moneys advanced in pursuance of this section shall be repaid to the Treasurer by the bank.",49
320,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hunter) [9.25] After hearing the discussion, I have come to the conclusion that there should be some provision for interest to be paid on any money advanced to the bank. The Prime Minister has told us that this advance is to give the bank a start; but I believe that in the case of an advance from the Treasury the bank should be placed in a position similar to that of any other business institution. While the Prime Minister holds that this advance is only for the initiation of the bank, the Governor of the bank may later on be of opinion that it requires a further advance; and there is no limitation to the operation of this clause. The advance of a million I may not prove sufficient, possibly through some mismanagement of the Governor himself ; and yet he may hold that, under this clause, he is entitled to a further advance without any interest. I hold that on all such advances, whether long or short, interest should be paid. Amendment (by Mr FISHER) proposed- That after the word ""bank,"" line 11, the following words be added : - "" together with interest at the rate of 35 per centum per annum."" are now",49
321,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Richmond) [9.27] - If what the Prime Minister said in answer to me on clause 9 be correct, I cannot see why the money advanced should be repaid immediately the capital is obtained; that is to say, I cannot see why the debt should not be immediately capitalized. Clause 30 provides fpr the repayment of this money out of a redemption fund to be created by placing half the piofits of the bank to the credit of that fund. But the bank may not to make a profit for two or three years, and it is more than likely that it will not. Under the circumstances the money which the Prime Minister says is only required to enable the bank to float its debentures and to get its so-called capital, ought to be immediately capitalized and liquidated so far as the Treasurer is concerned.",49
322,Mr HALL,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member means that it should be repaid out of capital instead of out of profits?,49
323,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . Perhaps the most important point of all is that the clause should cease to be operative, once its particular purpose is secured.",49
324,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister anrl Treasurer) [9 29] - The honourable member ret'ds the clause in a different > way from that in which I read it. It may not bave the limitation I think it has, namely, that it is only for the establishment of the bank in the first instance. The object of the clause is to provide money incidental to the establishment of the bank.",49
325,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Question is when the bank can be said to have been established.,50
326,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the question, but I agree generally with the view that this clause is not to give the Treasurer permanent power to advance money to the bank. If the £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 proves not to be enough, Parliament should be asked to sanction a further advance by another Bill . As a matter of policy, I do not desire a provision to enable the Treasurer to ad'vance further money without the authority of Parliament. I ask honourable members to pass the clause, and I undertake to see the Attorney-General in regard to it ; and if the provision does not mean what I think it does, some amendment can be made.",50
327,Mr GROOM,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Darling Downs) [9.32] I take it that "" the opening of offices"" does not mean only'the head office.",50
328,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It might.,50
329,Mr GROOM,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should say that it means the opening of various offices. When the Prime Minister was moving the second reading of the Bill , he was asked whether interest would be payable on the advances made to start the bank, and he replied that it would if the advances were for a long period, but if they were only temporary it would be hardly worthwhile to provide for interest. He further said, however, that if the Opposition thought any principle was involved he would have some provision made, but that his opinion was that the advances would not be for more than a year.",50
330,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I am of the same now.,50
331,Mr GROOM,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think the right honourable gentleman will find that the word "" of f i c e s"" will give rise to a supposition that there will be a number of advances extending over a considerable time.",50
332,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wentworth) [9.34] - It might be advisable for the Prime Minister, when consulting with the Attorney-General, to suggest the propriety of setting out quite clearly that when this money is repaid it ought to be repaid out of the £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 which is supposed to be the capital of the bank.",50
333,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That would wreck the bank by taking the capital away 1,50
334,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Is this blank cheque we are sanctioning now to be filled in"" for a large amount ? I have no desire to wreck the bank.",50
335,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is the honourable member's object.,50
336,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I beg to differ from the honourable member. All I want to know is where I am in presenting this blank cheque. If the bank premises are to be in Collins-street, or in Martin-place, the sum required will be over .£1,000,000; and if the non-provision of this money will wreck the bank,' the position is worth the serious attention of the Committee. If I understand the Prime Minister, he intends this money for certain incidental expenses.",50
337,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is what it means.,50
338,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If that be so, then there can be no objection to repaying it out of the £1,000,000.",50
339,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It might be paid out of profits.,50
340,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If there are any. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There must be £1,000,000 to start the business.",50
341,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"An y money for starting a business is usually put down to capital account, and amongst such expenditure is included that on premises. I do not know a single commercial undertaking with which I am connected that has not down in the capital ledger the value of its premises. We are informed by some intelligent members of the Caucus, who have, no doubt, previously discussed this matter, that this money is to provide bank premises, and yet we are told, also, that if we ask the bank to bear that expenditure out of the £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 we shall wreck the institution! I should like an expression of opinion from the honourable member for Riverina.",50
342,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I am not going to play opinion the honourable member's game !,50
343,Mr KELLY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member has told us so much, and I do not see why he should not take the people of Australia, into his confidence. He was not sent here to hold his Parliament upstairs, and to hold his peace downstairs, but rather to say exactly what is in his mind. This clause appears to me misty and vague, and 1 desire to discover what it means. The Prime Minister would do well to consider the propriety of taking this money from the proceeds of the debentures, so that when we are capitalizing the bank we shall know that it means £1,000,000, and not that amount plus a sum which the Treasurer is authorized to advance, and which the bank is to that repay in the dim and distant future, when it starts to make profits. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause IIThe Bank shall be managed by the Governor of the Bank.",50
344,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat) [9.40] - This clause raises the whole question as to whether the government of the bank is to be by one man or by some combination of officials. In any case there are provisions in the measure which go to show that of necessity there must be somewhere in the background a controlling authority. If we add together the various powers with which, in different portions of the Bill , that trolling authority is to be endowed, it will be discovered that there is another authority, which is the Government of the day",51
345,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I should like the honorpowers. able member to point that out.,51
346,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Government of the day will exercise a very great but undefined control over even the Governor of the bank, who in other portions of the measure appears to be endowed with almost despotic authority. The Governor and the Deputy Governor are to have 'such powers and to perform such authorities "" as are prescribed by this Act or the regulations."" To this Act I shall shortly draw attention; to the regulations I cannot, because we have not seen them, but they will or can be framed and authorized by the Government quite irrespective of Parliament, and in the absence of Parliament. We have, therefore, the powers and duties partly outlined in this measure, and capable of being indefinitely added to or altered by regulations outside this House. That is in clause 14. In clause 23 the consent of the Treasurer is required before establishing a London branch, or branches in other places beyond the Commonwealth. In clause 24 the approval of the Treasurer is required to appoint any person to act as attorney of the bank. Clause 32 is important. Under clause 53 the Governor arranges with the Minister of any Department in order to obtain the services of any officers for his purposes. But 64 is the important clause, under which the Governor General, which means Ministers, may make regulations "" not inconsistent with this Act prescribing all matters required or permitted to be prescribed or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act , "" and in particular for certain provisions as to the stock of the bank, and matters incidental thereto.",51
347,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I would suggest that the honourable gentleman should 'read the last provision in full .,51
348,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Prime Minister desires that this should also go into Hansardand in particular for'making provision for(a) the issue, inscription, transfer, transmission, and redemption of inscribed stock of the' bank, and all matters incidental thereto. Any man who obtains all powers which are necessary or convenient finds pretty well everything within his grasp.",51
349,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We have no power to preconscribe anything inconsistent with the Act.,51
350,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"E x a c t l y ; but if the occasion required one could show what a. skeleton this Bill is ih relation to these The limitations, if they can be called such, which are imposed by the Bill relate for the most part to non-essentials that could not be dealt with in any other way, or to matters which are not of immediate importance. As a matter of fact, I am not exaggerating when I say that this last clause practically throws the reins on the horse's neck. So *far as we are concerned as a Parliament, we throw the reins on the neck of the Government, and the Government can take the bank and the Governor pretty well anywhere they please. A very large authority is necessary, but while, under the terms of the Bill, the Governor is practically the sole responsible person-the deputy taking his place under certain circumstances-and it is understood that he is free from political influence, at the same time the power of regulation given by the Bil l is quite sufficient to show that the Governor .he bank after all in many cases will not be the real authority. The real authority wiU be found in the Government of the day. The Government have that power; most Governments would exercise it . Putting that view, with some diffidence, as my own opinion, I find myself greatly supported and strengthened by the interpretation of the Prime Minister himself, when he was expounding the Bill on the first occasion to the House. He pointed out very frankly, from the very first paragraph of his speech, that this will be a bank belonging to the people, and directly managed by the people's own agents-the y being obviously the Ministry of the day.",51
351,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , I do not think so. I do not think members of Parliament are agents.",51
352,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"To my mind the phrase - is susceptible of only one meaning. It was intended to convey that really the reins were in the hands of Parliament, and that - the Government of the day would exercise the driving power, subject, of course, to Parliament. The Prime Minister then went on to say that the Governor would, - in some respects, have an autocratic position, but that he was not as autocratic as - he appeared, becauseIn our case we have what is equal to a Board, - but without the information. The last admission is rather curious. think it means that Parliament consists of - men who have not the same information as the ordinary board of directors of a - bank, to whom he had alluded in the preceding sentence. To be more explicit, he addedWhat I mean is that Parliament meets at least - once a year. Here we become equal to a board, the - actual governing body of this bank. It is Parliament, which meets at least once a year. The honourable member for Darling Downs interjectedThe Treasurer does not suggest that Parliament is to be a board of directors? And the Prime Minister cheerfully repliedI say that we have what is better than a iboard of directors. Parliament being better than a board of - directors, which is the governing body of a - bank, is further clothed with all the authority and powers in the Bill which this House - can exercise. The Prime Minister addedI f any failure should occur through want of ability, or from some other cause on the part of the Governor of the bank, provision is made ! to enable Parliament to be informed, and Par-iiament can by legislation provide a remedy. We know that. All public servants and foodies are subject to Parliament, and liament by acts of legislation can provide - a remedy wherever a remedy isnecessary. What I am more concerned with is the fact that if we read these phrases toor gether-""The people's own agents,"" "" The body which is equal to a board,"" "" Parliament which can by legislation .provide a remedy""-w e have a chain of statements that we cannot 'afford to dispossible regard. There is one comforting knowledge-tha we have, not only the power, but the sponsibility. There is an absolute guaranhonorable tee, said the Prime Minister, on page 2647to all persons doing business with the bank that the Commonwealth will see that their legal - claims are met should any disaster overtake it. A little lower down he saidThe Treasurer will have something to say in <he management of certain investments, but I do not think that that will amount to any interference in the management of the bank generally. From these passages it is clear that the Prime Minister points to Parliament as exercising supreme authority-the authority of a board of directors. He refers to the exercise of the legislative power. But it is also evident, from the series of statements I quoted, that he regards Ministers _ as the active agents of Parliament in this relation, and, more especially when Parliament is not sitting, as the persons responsible for the control of this institution, as well as for every other Government Department. Consequently, in the appointment of a Governor, with the attendant risks of one-man rule, you have that one-man rule modified by the control of the Government of the day while it has a majority while Parliament is sitting, and always during the recess. Is that the form of government from which the best results are to be expected in a financial institution whose responsibilities are as varied and business as fluctuating in its character as those of every bank? Another illustration of Ministerial control occurred when, in reply to the interrogationW ill there be an annual charge for keeping accounts in the Savings Bank? the Prime Minister said That is a matter to be dealt with by regulation on the authority of the Treasurer, but were I in office I should veto such a proposal. The regulations under this Bill are, for all practical purposes, unlimited. They have to be read with the rest of the Bill, Parwhere restriction operates only in a few directions as any check upon the regulating power. The power to make regulations, and also rules, whether Parliament is sitting not, is in itself a very important authority, which will no doubt be often exercised by the Government of the day. In the circumstances, the question for honourable members is : "" Is this the best government which we can devise for the institution in which we are going to t embark so many of our fortunes?"" Withreout that personal experience which _ other members are able to claim, I venture to think that the addition of a certain number of qualified impartial and independent directors, either to act as advisers to the Governor, the final voice remaining always with him, or, following the usual model of the private bank, exercising joint authority with him, and capable of restraining him with certain restrictions, would strengthen the institution. The Committee is called upon to decide, before passing away from this clause, whether the bank shall be managed by an independent Governor, or whether the Governor shall be supported by two or three independent advisers, or whether he shall be the head of a board, instead of the whole and sole authority.",51
353,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member might give his views as to whether the management should be by one man or by more.,53
354,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is a difficult matter to decide, becauso now and then a man is discovered who is so admirably qualified for a certain position that one feels inclined to say, "" We possess the right man for the work to be done, and are ready to put our confidence in him.""",53
355,Mr WEST,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Bank of New South Wales is run by one man, and so are Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, and other institutions.",53
356,Mr HANS IRVINE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They are controlled by boards of directors.,53
357,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If a board chooses to trust its manager, that is another thing. With a board of directors and a chairman, you have the advantage of both systems. In any case, the Governor should have the support of an advisory board; though I have an open mind as to whether the members of the board should have the status of bank directors, the Governor being their president or chairman, and capable of being outvoted. The clause provides for placing absolute trust in one man; but there is no certainty that we shall be able to find a man so strong in body, so healthy in mind, and so well-informed, that we can put our trust in him. A man clothed with the despotic authority vested in the Governor might be tempted to take the bit (in his teeth, and it would be difficult to deal with a capable man when Ministers thought he was exceeding the margin of safety. It seems to me that the provisions of the Bill under which we trust the government of the bank to one man, and, at. the same time, give supreme authority to the Administration in power to make regulations and rules, will bring about a less stable control than the well-wishers of the institution desire.",53
358,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [io.o] - I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the Bill enables the Government to make' the bank a political institution.,53
359,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I spoke of the powers which may be exercised under the Bill. What the right honourable member intends to do is another thing.,53
360,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There is not a word or phrase in the Bill giving the Government power to interfere with, or to direct, the Governor of the bank.",53
361,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What is there that the Government is prevented from dealing with in the making of regulations?,53
362,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member relied first on clause 14, which says The Governor and the Deputy Governor shalt respectively have such powers and perform such duties as are prescribed by this Act or the regulations. All regulations must be consistent with the Act. The honourable member did not quote any provisions empowering the Government to pass regulations which would interfere with the management and control of the bank. - Mr DEAKIN - The Governor General may make regulations not inconsistent with the Act.",53
363,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If they are not inconsistent with it, they must be consistent with it. The next clause on which the honourable member relied was clause 23, which says The Governor may, with the consent of the Treasurer, establish a branch in London, in the United Kingdom, and may with the like consent establish branches in any other places beyond the Commonwealth. In what sense can an interference with the Governor take place under that clause? It ' is only right that the Government shall have power to say whether branches of the bank shall be established outside Australia, and where. There is no doubt that there will be a branch in London, and provision is made for branches elsewhere, and for agencies where there are not branches.",53
364,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Will the Prime Minister limit the regulations in accordance with the recommendations of the Governor?,53
365,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That would be unwise. The Governor may be an excellent man, so' far as the management of the bank is concerned, and were I Treasurer I should pay great heed to his recommendations; but the establishment of branches beyond the Commonwealth is a matter in which the Government should have a say. Clause 24 provides thatThe Bank may, with the approval of the Treasurer, by instrument under its common seal,, appoint any person (whether in the Commonwealth or in any place beyond the Commonwealth) to be the Attorney of the Bank, anc? any person so appointed may, subject to theinstrument, do any act or execute any power or function which he is authorized by the instrument to do or execute. There is nothing in that clause enabling the Government to coerce or influence the management of the bank in any way.",53
366,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What about clause 32 ?,54
367,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am willing to quote any clause that is thought to support the position of the Opposition, because it is of vital importance that the public shall not be led to believe that the Bill allows the Government to interfere with the management of a bank. Clause 32 enacts thatThe Governor may, with the consent of the Treasurer, make rules, not inconsistent with this Act or the regulations made by the Governor General thereunder, for any of the following purposes :(a) the good government of the Bank, (4) the classification of the officers Bank, and (f) any matter necessary or convenient to be provided for carrying on the business of the Bank. By the utmost straining of words, that clause cannot be construed as giving to the Government power to coerce or interfere with the Governor of the bank. The next clause on which' the Leader of the Opposition relied was clause 53. which says(1) The Governor may arrange with the Minister administering any Department of the Commonwealth for any officer of the Department to act as agent of the Bank for the transaction of Savings Rank business. (2) Any officer acting as agent of the Bank in pursuance of this section shall be deemed to be an officer of the Bank. That clause was drafted to enable the Governor of the bank to arrange with t.he Postmaster-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, or any other Minister, to permit his officers to act as agents of the bank for the transaction of Savings Bank business. A departmental official would be appointed an agent of the bank for the sake of economy. He would not act solely for the bank, but would do the bank's business in conjunction with his departmental work. Wherein does that clause giv.'; power to the Government to interfere with the management of the bank ? I come now to clause 64",54
368,Mr DEAKTN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is the clause.,54
369,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If that is the bugbear, let me say at once that we are willing to adopt any means for restricting the powers - if the GovprnmPnt in such a way as will prevent political influence in the managemp.nt of the bank. We desire the bank to be absolutely independent of political influence, which certainly will not be exercised by t'.ie Labour party. If there is any way in which clause 64, which empowers the Governor General to make regulations, can be tightened up, we are willing to consider an amendment. The case made by the Leader of the Opposition has broken down. He has abandoned one clause after another.",54
370,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,There has been no abandonment ; I simply read all the clauses giving to the Government power to interfere in the control of the bank.,54
371,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have quoted those clauses which merely give the Government power to co-operate with a view to facilitating the bank's operations, and do not affect the management of the bank.",54
372,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Clause 3^ goes right to the heart of the matter.,54
373,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am willing to reof the examine that clause. It must not go to the public either in the way of private tittle-tattle, or platform utterance, that the Labour party has any wish to introduce political influence in the management of the bank.",54
374,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,O r any other kind of influence.,54
375,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , though I do not know what kind of influence is referred to. The other point raised by the Leader of the Opposition is one upon which no body of men could dogmatize. I refer to the question of what is the best method to pursue . in regard to the management of this bank. Shall we have a Board consisting of officers of the bank ? Shall we have one man control, or shall we have a bank controlled by three or ten men?",54
376,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,As k the Leader of the Opposition.,54
377,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was exceedingly anxious to obtain his matured judgment on this point, but I fear that he has not quite made up his mind on it.",54
378,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member was looking for the impossible.,54
379,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If we could present to the House to-night the gentleman whom we propose to appoint as Governor of the bank, he tells me that he would be able to say whether or not he is in favour of one-man control. I am in a better position. I bave been impelled by my own reasoning to the conclusion that control by one man is better than control by any number of men. That is the conviction at which the Government have arrived. No body of men could dogmatize on the question of whether the bank should be controlled by one, two, or three men. But, assuming that we decided to have a Board of three, where should we obtain the members of that Board? It has to be remembered that this is to be a Commonwealth Bank, differently situated from any other bank of which we know. It is to be a bank owned solely by the people, and to be conducted in the interests of the people. A Board of directors for such a bank would, however, necessarily consist of men interested in other financial concerns. That is obvious. Men who were worthy of a position on the directorate would have banking experience, and in nine cases out of ten would have interests in other concerns of a like kind.",54
380,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,In private banks?,55
381,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,O r leanings in that direction.,55
382,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Althoug h they gave honest service, they would still be at that obvious disadvantage. That is one side of the question. But supposing we abandoned the idea of bringing in practical men from outside, and constituted a Board consisting of officers of the bank, what would be the position ? If the Board consisted of three men, it would comprise the Governor, the Deputy-Governor, and the officer next in authority. As the result of this, the Governor himself might be outvoted, and the policy of the bank determined by two of his subordinate officers. Whilst a Board of that kind might be able to conduct a bank, it would not be able to carry it on as well as would a single Governor, absolute and responsible. There is yet another line of reasoning that may appeal to honourable members, and it is that we might have a Governor and a Deputy-Governor, and also a number of inspectors, independent of the Governor, with power to report to the Treasurer, or the Minister administering the Act, as to the state of the bank's affairs. In that case, the Minister would know what the Governor did not, and he would be asked to decide between the reports made privately to him by the inspectors and the policy of the Governor. In that way political influence would become rampant. Immediately we allowed any appeal from an officer who was not the Governor to the Minister administering the Act, the Governor would be absolutely at the mercy of that Minister. What kind of man are we likely to appoint as general manager of the bank? What kind of salary are we likely to offer him ? Both the man and the salary attaching to his office must be first class.",55
383,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What is the right honourable member's idea as to the salary first time. that should be paid to the Governor?,55
384,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have already refused to state what I consider would be a proper salary for the Governor of the bank, and I go further, and say that it would be most inadvisable to advertise a position of this, kind. I am able to say to honourable members that I have no man in my mind at all in regard to this position, and that the gentleman who has been mentioned aslikely to be appointed is not an applicant.",55
385,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Mr Ralston hasalready in the press repudiated the suggestion that he is to be appointed Governor.,55
386,Mr FISHER,KALGOORIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It was an impertinence on the part of the press to publish the statement that he was an applicant for the position. Surely a man may come downhere to open a branch of his own bank,, and, whilst here, have a conversation with a few old friends, without such a suggestion being made in regard to him. I do not wish any one to believe that Mr Ralstonis not one of the biggest men in the Australian banking world, but those who know him know that he is not available for this position. That"", however, is by the way. The man to be appointed Governor of the Commonwealth Bank should have Australian banking experience. Indeed, it would be useless to select a man who is not an Australian banker. Then, again, the man who will undertake this work will have a fairly good knowledge of what the position really means. He will know very well that if he fails, his honour as a business man will be affected, and his future position in the banking world will be absolutely worthless. That is the purely personal, selfish side of the matter. If he fails, he will be lost in his profession, and will be almost an outcast. Then, amongst all men of wit, knowledge, and experience, there is always the ambition ' to succeed, and, having regard to all these circumstances, I think we are likely to get the best services from one man of ability. I do not intend to enlarge further upon the point; and, as I am not anxious that the Committee should come to ""a divisionon the question to-night, if the Leader of the Opposition thinks that it should be further discussed, I shall move that progressbe reported. Progress reported. ELECTORAL BILL. Bill received from the Senate, and (or* motion by Mr KING O'MALLEY) read a> House adjourned at 10.21 p.m.",55
