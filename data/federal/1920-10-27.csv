For some time past an attempt has been in progress to get an arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States for the adoption of rolls covering both Commonwealth and State electorates, but the only State that has, so far, agreed to this arl , enrangement, is Tasmania. Mr Oldham, our Chief Electoral Officer, is now in of Adelaide, and I think will b© able to the make an arrangement under which, not only the rolls containing the names of Australian Assembly electors, but also those containing the names of electors for the South Australian Legislative Council, will be combined with the Comevimonwealth rolls for the State. I feel confident that such rolls will be used at the general election there next year. From Adelaide, Mr Oldham will proceed to Sydney and try to get into touch with the authorities there.

12,Mr MATHEWS,SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"H as th© Minister for the Navy read the article in today's Age, which speaks of the creation of another Naval Base in Corio Bay, because Westernport has been found unsuitable for submarines, and did he see at the tail of the article the assertion that we were lucky to have the base in Victoria, because Hobart could provide a more suitable site? Is it proposed to go to great expense at Corio Bay in preparing a base on an unsuitable site? Would it not be better to establish the base at Hobart, and thus prevent the waste of money ?",20
13,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The establishment of the base near Geelong was determined before I took office, but having gone into the matter, I am satisfied that the site is one of the best in Australia. No doubt, in Tasmania there is an ample depth of water; but it is considered better to have the base on the mainland, and I am told by the best experts that Corio Bay provides the most suitable site. Submarines can lie in Corio Bay and go out into Port Phillip to be exercised. In Port Phillip there is a depth of 13 fathoms of water, over a splendid sandy bottom, so that there is no danger in exercising these vessels there. The submarine of today is a different vessel from the submarine that was in vogue when the Westernport Base was chosen. NA",20

19,Mr WISE,HINDMARSH TELEPHONE,"On 19th October, 1920, the Honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin ) asked the following questions :1. Whether the telephone subscribers in the district of Hindmarsh, which is 3 miles distant from the Central Exchange, Adelaide, were required to pay £6 per year annual rental prior to the increased telephone charges, while subscribers in the districts of Glenelg ancl Brighton, 6 i and 9 | miles distant from Adelaide respectively, were only required to pay £4 per year annual rental V 2. If so, will the Government give equal consideration to subscribers in the Hindmarsh trict by the installation of a local exchange, and thus afford an equalization of telephone rental rates? I promised that the information would ,be obtained, and now furnish the following replies :1. The rentals of subscribers in the Hindmarsh district are based on their radial distance from the Central Exchange, to which they connect, vide Telephone Begulations Nos. 5 and 7. Of the total subscribers in that district, approximately 50 per cent, are within the 2-mile radius of the Central Exchange, and were cliargcd a rental of £4 per annum prior the increase in rates, while the remaining scribers paid varying rentals, according to their distance from the exchange. In the Glenelg and Brighton districts, where local exchanges are established, subscribers residing within the 2-mile radius of the local exchange were charged a rental of £4 per annum, and those residing beyond that distance paid rentals according to their distance from the exchange to which they arc connected. 2. The establishment of an exchange ""at Hindmarsh would not be economically justifiable, nor is it considered necessary, in view the close proximity of that district to the Central Exchange, ""and as the subscribers in that area can be conveniently accommodated at the Central Exchange.

20,Mr GROOM,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 2 . 4 3 ] - I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1914, the following works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their report thereon, viz.:Extension to buildings and equipment of the Commonwealth Woollen Cloth Factory at Geelong, Victoria. On the Works and Buildings Estimates, which the House has already passed, provision is made for an expenditure of £8,000 towards these buildings and for an expenditure of £38,000 for plant, so that we have already appropriated for [244]- 2 this purpose a sum of £46,000. I am now moving that the whole matter be redisferred to the Public Works Committee for inquiry and report. To meet military, naval, postal and other requirements, it has been decided that it is desirable to double the present output capacity of 600,000 yards per annum of the Commonwealth Government Woollen Cloth Factory at Geelong. This involves the installation of additional plant and the extension of buildings for its accommodation. To provide this accommodation it is proposed to erect on a site to the west of and adjoining the present building, which is to Commonwealth property, additions comsubprising a floor area of 31,616 square feet, of which 19,760 square feet will be devoted to the extension of the weaving room and the remaining 11,856 square feet to the finishing room. These extensions will be comprised in a number of bays, each 30 feet wide, in continuity of those which already exist. The length of each bay will be 104 feet. The structure is to be similar in all respects to that of which already exists. It will have brick walls, a concrete floor, and steel story posts and roof principals. Efficient natural lighting will be provided by a sawtooth roof over the whole area of the extension, and there will be windows in the western wall. There will also be provided the necessary additional lavatory accommodation for male and female employees, together with drainage, & c , electric light, power, and fire-preventive services. Tha estimated cost of the works and services is £23,993 , and the Defence Department has advised that to provide the necessary machinery a further amount of £36,800 will be required, making a total estimated cost of £60,793. I submit the plans, specifications, and statement in compliance with the provisions of the Act.",21
21,Mr RILEY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,South Sydney) [ 2 . 4 6 ] - I desire to draw the attention of the House to what seems to be. a constant effort on the part of the authorities controlling the Works Department- I do not say the Minister is responsible for it-to erect Commonwealth buildings in Victoria or to extend some of those already in existence here. These proposals seem to suggest the atmosphere of Victoria.,21

23,Mr RILEY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Canberr a is part of our own Territory.

In my in the southern part of South Australia, we have abundant supplies of water running to waste, and we produce wool a large scale. We have, in short, everything essential to the establishment of a woollen m ill .

That can be given only by establishing these mills wherever possible in Australia. The finest wool in the world is grown in New South Wales, produces 39 per cent, of the total at Australian wool clip. The finest breed of sheep is to be found there. Mr. Falkiner, who was formerly a member of the House, has done a great deal in a that State to improve the breed of sheep. Amongst other natural advantages is an abundance of the particular class of water required for the treatment of the r wool.

There is a great future for Tasmania if its natural advantages in. this respect are developed to the fullest extent. Having regard to fact that. it is vital to the interests Australia that the woollen industry should be established on a broad and per manent basis, the Minister should agree to the Public Works Committee having power to extend its investigations to all mittee. the States. Honourable members are well - aware of the reputation which New South Wales has for the production first class tweeds.

The establishment of woollen mills is a damp. matter that should receive the most caref u l consideration at the hands of the Public Works Committee, and, therefore, the reference should not be restricted any one State.

Why? Because the necessary labour is forthcoming there. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce) can tell us that the white work industry is centralized, so far as Victoria is concerned, in the district of Bourke.",24

60,Mr HAY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"New England) [ 3 . 8 ] - I entirely agree with the argument which has been advanced in regard to the desirableness of establishing additional woollen mills in Australia. The woollen industry is one of our great key in dustries, and the question which we are now discussing is one of the most im .portant questions affecting . Australia. We should be narrow-minded indeed if we were to come to any conclusion upon it without a thorough and exhaustive in quiry into the best site that is available for Commonwealth woollen mills. I do not know what my constituents would think of me if I failed upon an occasion like the present to emphasize the claims of my own electorate. I do so, not from any narrow or parochial consideration, but merely because New England is the natural centre of the woollen industry of this country. trict grows the finest wool that is produced in Australia, and it is the most central of all parts of the Commonwealth. When a connection by r a i l is made between Dubbo and Werris Creek, the whole of the western portion of iNew, South Wales will be linked"" up with the New England District, which will then draw from Queensland and the north of the mother State practically all her wool supplies.

I have no doubt that when the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) gets his hydroelectric scheme operating upon the Clarence River we shall secure sufficient power not merely for the manufacture of our wool into cloth, but for gristing our wheat, tanning our hides, and manufacturing our boots. The whole of the in dustrial undertakings of this country will be revolutionized when that power is available.",25

The Committee should have a free hand to investigate and report to the House.",25
65,Mr CHARLTON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Hunter) [3.10] -. 1 hold a somewhat different view from that of honourable members who have preceded me. I do not think it is so much a matter of inquiry as to the erection of mills in the various States as a question of the necessity for this Commonwealth ParliaThat dis- ment to decide once and for all whether or not Commonwealth factories shall bo erected in our own Territory. The Commonwealth possesses today 900 square miles, to which we talk of eventually moving the Seat of Government. How are we to populate the Territory if we continue to build our factories in the various States? We ought not to confine the Public Works Committee to ascertaining whether there should be an extension of the Woollen Mill s at Geelong. They ought to have greater discretion. If we refer a matter to the Committee, and stipulate definitely that it shall inquire only into that particular matter, we l i m it the scope of their inquiry. The Public Works ComEverybody mittee should have the power to inquire whether Canberra is suitable for this particular industry, and not merely whether we should expend £60,000 in making additions to this factory in Victoria. I am not speaking from the point of view of any particular State. To-day the Commonwealth has offices and factories in different parts of Australia, more particularly in Victoria, and if we admit the / argument that where we have an existing building in Victoria development should be met by the extension of that factory, we can practically centralize all such industries in this State. We have erected many factories in this State, and I take it the day will come when their success will call for further extensions. Are we, then, in case of such development, to enlarge the factories in this or any other State in preference to erecting buildings in our own Territory?",25
66,Mr HEGTOK LAMOND,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Was this Geelong factory submitted to the Public Works Committee?,26
67,Mr CHARLTON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I cannot say; but I do not think so. My conteution is that the Government are in duty bound to siibmit such projected works to the Committee, with discretion to say, after hearing evidence, whether, in their opinion, they should be established in our own Territory or elsewhere. Wool is produced all around the Eederal area, so that there would be no difficulty in obtaining material for manufacture, together with, water and every other requisite for the production of woollen goods. Why should we expend Commonwealth money in improving State values, when Ave ought to be improving the value of our OAvn property? Some day Ave expect a large revenue from Canberra. We haA'e already, I believe, spent £1,000,000 there, and will have to expend many more millions in building the city. Why, then, should Ave not expend the public money in improving our property?",26
68,Mr MCGRATH,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Where could labour be got for the mill at Canberra?,26
69,Mr CHARLTON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"There is no difficulty in getting labour anywhere if Ave buy it. There are quite a number of working people who Would like to settle in the Federal Territory, and these people are not confined to New South Wales, but are to be found in other States.",26
70,Mr MCGRATH,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,We do not wish the people to leaA^e other States for the Territory.,26
71,Mr CHARLTON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I know; but this is a broader question than that of State rights; it is one of Australian rights, and affects the whole of the people of the CommonAvealth. Like any ordinary business man, Ave ought to expend our money in improving the value of our own property. In order to test the feeling of the House, I move That after the Avord ""Vietoria"" the words ""or erection of buildings at Canberra, New South Wales"" be added. I do this to give the House an opportunity to decide whether in its opinion the Public Works Committee should be restricted to the question of the extension of the existing factory at Geelong. If the Committee find that by an expenditure of- £60,000 this industry can be established with good promise of success in our own Territory, we are in duty bound to follow their advice. The sooner we commence in earnest to build up this Territory the better for the people of Australia, and we can only do that by establishing industries there.",26
72,Mr HAY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Will the Public Works Committee not also consider the claims of Canberra?,26
73,Mr CHARLTON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,The Committee cannot do that under this motion.,26
74,Mr LIATNGSTON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Why not include other States as well as New South Wales ?,26
75,Mr CHARLTON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Because I believe that every industry of the kind should, as far as possible, be established in OTIT own Territory, so as to improve the value of our own property. The greater that value is, the greater will be the revenue from it, and the better it will be for the Government and the people generally. We cannot increase the value of Canberra without population, and we cannot think for a moment that population will be attracted merely because it is made the the Seat of Government. Works must be established there, and our own works shonld be the first.",26

82,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Illawarra) £3.20] - I desire to move an amendment that will leave the selection of sites open to the Public Works Committee. I do not agree with the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that the choice of the Committee should be confined to Geelong or Canberra. For instance, the Commonwealth has territory at Jervis Bay that might be found to be more suitable than Canberra for the establishment of a woollen mill. My view differs entirely from that of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). Australia is many times larger than Great Britain, and it is an utter absurdity for the Commonwealth to seriously contemplate handing over to Victorian pastoralists the supply of the whole of the wool to be manufactured for Australia's requirements, or, alternatively, bringing the wool from other places to Geelong and then carrying the manufactured article back to those distant portions of the Commonwealth where it is to be used. I maintain that it is impossible for the needs of Australia to be supplied from any one centre, and I am surprised that tliere should be any dissent from such an elementary proposition. We know today that, in regard to the supply of suits of clothes for soldiers, the mill is many months in arrears in regard to serge. Those who have been supplied with tweeds have almost worn out their suits, while others who have applied for serges have not been supplied at all. I am inclined to think that it will be found, as this industry develops, that, the wisest policy will be to associate the manufacture of one line of goods with one factery, by which means we' would most likely get more expert handling of the product. That may or may not be so, but I am certain that it will never be an economic proposition to carry wool from North Queensland to Geelong, manufacture it there, and carry it back again over all that extent of territory to North Queensland in the form of tweed or serge for use by the people there. .Surely the sane policy would be to distribute the manufacture, not to one or two, but to .several of the centres throughout the Commonwealth. I want to point out what will be demonstrated again on several other items of expenditure-the method by which centralization around Melbourne is - carried out. We are not asked to investigate a proposition for the establishment of woollen mills at 'Geelong. They are taken over under some extraordinary power of the Government, and Parliament, is consulted after the deed is done. No inquiry is made as to whether Geelong is the best site. Parliament has no voice in that matter. The idea is t'o get a little industry commenced somewhere, and then, as soon as it is established, to throw everything into it, and keep on extending it, thus depriving other centres of fair treatment in connection with Commonwealth industries. I am opposed to the proposal to limit this expenditure to the extension of existing works, because it may be a much more economic proposition to establish a new factory in some other district, from which the product can be distributed to a large local area more economically than it canbe supplied from Geelong. Therefore, I give notice that I shall move a further amendment, substituting for the proposal of the honourable member for Hunter the addition of the words "" or alternatively to establish new woollen mills elsewhere in Australia.""",27
83,Mr MCGRATH,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Ballarat) [3.25] - I shall oppose the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton). New South Wales members are taking a very parochial view of this question. Everlastingly they bring into every proposition some reference to Canberra. We all know what the lionorable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) has pointed out, that the Com-' monwealtli Woollen Mills cannot turn out all the tweed required, but we also know that they did splendid work during the war, for no soldier was better equipped in the matter of clothing than was the Australian.",27
84,Mr BIIET,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Muc h of the clothing worn by the Australian soldiers was manufactured at Marrickville.,27
85,Mr MCGRATH,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Most of it was made at Geelong. Quite rightly, the Government have determined that every returned soldier is to be supplied with tweed at a cheap price, but the Geelong mills are thousands of yards behind in the supply of the article. I see no reason why the supply of tweed should be confined to returned soldiers. If the Government are legally entitled to sell tweed to soldiers, surely they can also supply soldiers' widows and the fatherless children of soldiers with cloth at a cheap price.",27
86,Mr HEOTOK LAMOND,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"But they cannot supply enough for the soldiers. Mr MoGRATH - I am aware of that, but a debate as to Avhether mills should be established in Queensland or at Canberra Would simply mean delaying the carrying out of extensions which are necessary at Geelong. The honourable ' member said that no inquiry had been made prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth ""Woollen Mills.",28
87,Mr RILEY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,".Not by the Public Works Committee. Mr .MCGRATH - There was the fullest inquiry as to Avhere the mill should be located by a - Committee that travelled throughout Australia. Mr Mahon A' - Who were the members of that Committee? Mr MoGRATH - I do not know; but I suppose they Avere equally as competent as the members of the Public Works Committee. But because they choso Geelong they have earned the enmity of certain honourable members Avho represent, New South Wales constituencies. The honourable member for New England (Mr. Hay) has spoken about certain coal resources, and about the electrical energy that is likely to be developed, in his electorate; but, Avitli the exception of Ballarat, there is no better spot in Australia for the establishment of Avoollen mills than Geelong. It is the port for the ' Western District of Victoria, where some of the finest AVOOI in the Avorld is groAvn, and, with the development of the Morwell electric scheme, Aviil be supplied with cheap power in the course of a few months. Everything necessary for the successful manufacture of woollen cloth is to be found at Geelong, and the mills have already demonstrated that they can carry on the industry with eminent success. But there is need for more cloth. It is a present need, and not one which is two years off. Already the Ministry have delayed long enough in bringing - forward their proposals to extend the Geelong mills. Of course, if I looked at the matter from a parochial stand-point, I would be putting forward the claims of Ballarat, where two large mills are successfully demonstrating - that they can carry on the industry there. But I realise that the cost of clothing is very high.",28
88,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Do you not realise that the New South Wales and Queensland soldiers will be called upon to pay more for their suits if these have to be carted all the way from Geelong? Mr MoGRATH - It Would not add one penny to their cost. I have been Avearing the suit I haA',e on me today for seven or eight months, and, including the profit of 4s. to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, the 3-Jyards of tweed from which it is made cost me only £l-9s. 9d. I should like to see the Geelong mills extend their operations not only for the purpose of providing cloth for returned soldiers and soldiers' widows and little children, but also so that every individual in the community may be supplied with it.",28
89,Mr MAHONY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"But does not the honourable member think that Government mills ought to be established in other States? Mr MoGRATH - First , let us get the Geelong mills going properly. There is a crying need for the in, fand I ask honourable members not to persist in moving amendments which may only ser\ e the r purpose of delaying this proposition. The alterations are urgently required to enable the mill to catch up its arrears of Avork. We Avant to honour our obligations to our soldiers. Therefore, let us give the Government an opportunity of carrying out these extensions at Geelong atonce. I do not think the machinery which Avill be required can be obtained in Victoria, or, in fact, anywhere in Australia. I know that a Ballarat mill, which is making extensive alterations, has been obliged to send its manager to Great Britain to buy machinery there. But if the amendment is carried, it Avill lead to months of delay. The Public Works Committee Avill feel called upon to examine the claims of every village which may be put forward, and therefore it may take months to complete its inquiry.",28
90,Mr HAY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"W h i l e the inquiry is ceeding, the machinery could be on order. Mr M o GRATH - But in the case of Geelong it is merely an extension of existing machinery. For a new m ill entirely new machinery would be required.",29
91,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,The finest machinery in the world can be made in Australia.,29
92,Mr MCGRATH,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I wish the machinery could be obtained in Australia, but we all know that during the war it was impossible to get it. here. I have no doubt, that. those who arc interested in the establishment of woollen mills in Victoria would be very glad indeed if they could get the machinery erected at. once. They would be prepared to pay some additional cost if they could get, it in Australia, and at once; but, unfortunately, they cannot, and so tlic agents are going abroad for the purpose of obtaining it . If we agree to the amendment it will be good-bye to the returned soldiers' chance of getting cheap cloth for a long time to come.",29

Certain honourable members have asked ine not to be parochial in the expression of my views on the subject, and I hope I shall not be. I say that if it can be satisfactorily proved that mills of this kind can be established in any other part of Australia, I would not for one moment attempt to block the movement in the interests of the city and electorate which I represent. But I want honourable members to carry tlicir minds back a few years, to 1911, when this question was first discussed, and when the Government sent to England and obtained the services of a competent expert (Mr Smail) to advise as to the best location for the Commonwealth Woollen Mills.",29
94,Mr LIVINGSTON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,They did not send to England; they sent to Scotland.,29
95,Mr LISTER,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I believe they managed to get a Scotchman in England, and I think the Government were extremely foolish to lose his services for the sake of a few hundred pounds additional salary. In his report, dated 19th July, 1912, a pro- copy of which I hold in my hand, Mr . Smail sets out that in the course of his in quiry he visited thirty-three centres, namely, Yass-Canberra, Warrnambool, Port Fairy, Geelong, Bendigo, Echuca, Moama, Kilinore, Launceston, Hobart, Devonport, Burnie, Ballarat, Liverpool, Lithgow, Parramatta, Botany Bay, Ipswich, Brisbane, Wangaratta, Adelaide, Perth, Guildford, Bridgetown, Collie, Mount Gambier, Port Macdonnell, M ill i eent, Beachport, Melbourne, Horsham, Ararat, Portland. Honourable members will see, therefore, that in his peregrinations he travelled extensively throughout the Commonwealth, nnd his report has, I think, been of very material advantage to this country. He indicated that in coming to a decision he had to consider the question of water supply, its quality and' quantity, drainage, climatic conditions, the manufacture of the woollen cloth, comfort of employees, proximity to wool markets, railway and shipping facilities, conditions of the labour market, geographical position as a distributing centre, and local conditions as affecting efficient and economical working. A f t e r a very careful inquiry into the claims of I every place, he made his decision ih favour of Geelong. This is what he had to sayThis town is admirably suited for the manufacture of woollen goods, having a constantly flowing river of comparatively soft water, natural drainage for mill: effluent into the river,, a good industrial population, comparatively near the principal wool markets, well placed for railway and shipping, and a good centre for distribution. It is a most desirable place for our purpose, and has the further advantage of having a community who are conversant with wool manufacture, which is a valuable asset. The Harbor Trust offers land free of cost. Warrnambool, I consider, is quite out of the question against Geelong. I need not elaborate my comments upon his report; but I do want to say that when the Government take the trouble to send to England for the services of a competent expert, who is supposed to understand the position-and there is no doubt that Mr Smail does understand his business from A to Z",29

Mr Smail emphasized the point that it was absolutely essential, if an undertaking of this character to be a success, that there should be population to work upon, who, in some measure, were conversant with the inCommittee. dustry. It is generally recognised, that Geelong stands alone in that respect, cause some of the most up-to date mills in the Commonwealth are established in that centre.

The mill has been in operation for some time, and there is no one in Australia, however strongly opposed to the nationalization of industries, who will not admit thai this Geelong mill has been a distinct success. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) has directed attention to the urgent necessity of increasing the output from the present mill.",30

The proposal to increase the production of this exceedingly good cloth, produced by an efficient staff and capable management, is not in any way antagonistic to the establishment of woollen mills anywhere else in Australia. The present plant is the property of the Commonwealth! Government, and has been successfully worked for some years. It has proved itself capable of supplying at a cheap rate some of the best and cheapest cloth in the world, and it is urged now, for the benefit of returned soldiers and others, that the operations of the mills should be extended. This is a case which should be decided absolutely on its merits, and quite independent of the claims of hundreds of other centres in different parts of Australia. On the merits of the question, it is desirable that this Commonwealth mill should be extended, in the interests of the whole community.",31

I desire to refer to another question closely connected with this, and that is the general extension of woollen manufacture throughout Australia. There is nothing in this proposal that is in any way antagonistic to the erection of other mills, and this is a most urgent matter to all of us. I could direct attention to the great advantages for woollen manufacture possessed by some most delightful and charming country towns in the electorate of the Grampians, and could mention such places as Clunes, Maryborough, Kyneton, Stawell, and Daylesford.

No person in the Lane has been appealed to by the Bureau to take part in the movement. The appeal is being made to wool-growers and to business men generally.,32
117,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Why should there be any objection to turning Flinders-lane importers into manufacturers?,32
118,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I see no objection to that; but, as a mvatter of fact, they have not been approached by the Bureau. When the appeal is properly launched, all classes of persons will be asked to contribute. The establishment of a large number of woollen mills in Australia within, say, the next five years is an urgent public need. Where the mills shall be erected will depend on those who subscribe the money for them. If our friends at Jervis Bay, Marrickvfllp>, Tamworth, Ballarat, Canberra, or Kooyong desire woollen mills in their particular districts, it is for them to find the capital for them. At Stawell and Daylesford, in the Grampians electorate, they have already gone far in the raising of capital for the erection of local mills, and at Wangaratta, in the Indi electorate, they have raised enough capital for a woollen mill, and have gone a long way towards establishing the business of making woollens. Committees of representative men are now being formed in every State, and the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) will be glad to know that a very strong committee is being formed to make an appeal in Queensland, the - State at whose head he formerly was. I hope that within a few days an appeal , will be made throughout Australia for capital for the establishment of woollen mills. The difference between the price of wool and the price at which tailors buy cloth for making up into suits of clothes is so appalling that adequate new woollen mills are an urgent need in Australia. They are wanted so that our people may procure cloth more cheaply; that employment may be found for the population; and that there may be a better and more stable demand for our wool.",32

At Ipswich, a few miles from Brisbane, there is a factory where the best flannel in the world is made, all of it used within the State of Queensland. The Imperial Government asked for supplies of that flannel for the clothing of its troops.",32
120,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Queenslan d could use ten times as much of it as she gets.,32
121,Mr JAMES PAGE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Yes . Why should not the Government help the company to enlarge that mill, so that it could turn out more stuff? Messrs. Cribb and Foote, who are part owners of the mill, also manufacture tweed which is equal to the best in Australia, and from which a suit of clothes can be made for £5 5s. 6d. They supply cloth direct to the consumer, and I do not see why the same thing could not be done in New South Wales and Victoria. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) said that Geelong was the centre of woollen manufacture because of its climate and its water, but Mr Smail, in his report, says that that place' is the best for the manufacture of woollens because the drainage is so complete. Now, the Geelong mill is a mile from the Barwon River, and the drainage goes into Corio Bay, but Mr. Smail had not that in his mind when he wrote his report. There are other mills at Ballarat, Castlemaine, Warrnambool, and Collingwood, so that Geelong is not the only place in Victoria where it is possible to manufacture woollens. But although there are so many private mil!s. they cannot supply the demand. So far as climate is concerned, there is not a better district for woollen manufacturing than that near Brisbane; with the exception of Canberra, which I believe is better. At Ipswich, all the conditions are favourable. A supply of coal sufficient for 100 years exists within a few miles. There is plenty of water, and the mill is close to the main trunk line of the State, with a branch right into its yard. Why does not the Government assist private mill-owners to enlarge their factories, and thus increase their output? At Ipswich, wool is obtainable right on the spot, and truck-loads of it are passing the factory almost every day of the year. There is every convenience for manufacturing, and the proprietors of the mill are, I believe, making a good thing out of it . The Government helps Victoria because the industrial population is leaving Melbourne just as rats leave a sinking ship.",32

Various industries established in Victoria are opening branches in New South Wales, where there is plenty of labour, and also an ample supply of coal, which can be obtained there at a cost much below that ruling in this State. In the circumstances, New South Wales must advance. I do not hesitate to say that Victoria's loss of population is due to her inability to obtain the supplies of coal necessary for her industries.

138,Mr JACKSON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Tasmani a would have been first on the list instead of second.,33
139,Mr JAMESPAGE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I believe so. Considerations as to the cost of the carriage of fuel to Tasmania told against that State in the selection of a site. The Public Works Committee should be empowered to report upon suitable sites in the different States. The position has materially changed since Mr Smail reported on this subject, and in the circumstances we should enlarge the scope of the Committee's inquiries. I have no wish to destroy Geelong's chance, but every State should have an equal opportunity. I am anxious that the Eederal Parliament should meet at Canberra as soon as possible, because of the parochial instinct in herent in every Victorian. Victorians have got into the habit of thinking that their State is the Commonwealth. At one time New South Wales was inclined to regard herself as Australia, but since the Eederal Parliament has been meeting here, Victorians have developed the idea that this is the only State in the Commonwealth. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.",33
140,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Wakefield) [4.10] - I would remind the House that the motion submitted by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) is not for the creation of a new m ill , but relates merely to the extension of the existing m ill premises at Geelong in order that pressing requirements may be met. If this were a proposal to establish a new m ill , I should be solidly opposed to it . I am' glad that the Geelong enterprise has been successful, but I do not approve of the extension of Government-owned in stitutions of this kind. I would specially emphasize the point t h at it would be ridiculous to build another m ill elsewhere instead of concentrating our efforts on the existing factory. Concentration of management will enable this m ill at Geelong to more effectively continue and extend its operations. I do not think this discussion ha* been altogether useless, since there has been displayed a praiseworthy enthusiasm for the extension of a local industry-a n in dustry which, above all others, should be enormously developed in Australia. I hope that we shall have very soon some of the oldest established firms in the West of England setting up branches in Australia, and competing with the mills already here. I was surprised at the almost apologetic reference made by the honourable member for G-rampians (Mr . Jowett) to an extension of this industry on the part of Flinders-lane. T hope that Flinders-lane will build a dozen big mills in Victoria, and that, as the result of such competition with the existing factories, we shall be able to obtain woollens at something like reasonable prices. If Flinders-lane does not launch out in this direction. I hope that it will not hold the woollen industry in the future. I ama confident that there will be an abundance of private enterprise in connection with this industry, and there could be no better field for private enterprise than that which the manufacture of woollens affords. For the present, however, we have to remember that the question before us relates, not to the building of new mills, but merely to the extension of existing premises at Geelong. As to the suggestion that the Public Works Committee should make inquiries all. over the Commonwealth, I would point out that in the f u t u r e extension of this industry the most effective mills will be those which are erected, where the essentials to success obtain. It is for experts to determine where those places are. I am opposed to the extension of mills owned by the Commonwealth, and in favour of more competition on the part of private enterprise.",33
141,Mr LAZZARINI,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Werriwa) [4.151 - In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton), it is unnecessary for me to reiterate the arguments advanced by him, but I think it is essential that Commonwealth millsj and, indeed, all our governmental activities should be within Commonwealth territory. One of the constant cries of those who are opposed to the building of the Federal Capital at Canberra is that it is not a paying proposition. By establishing industries at the Capital we shall help to the realization of the national sentiments of Ausmember tralia. The building ur> of industries there will attract population, and so enFlinders-lane? hance the value of property, and, in that way, the Commonwealth will obtain good return from the Territory. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) bias said that, by adopting amendment, we shall, to some extent, curtail the facilities of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills for turning out cloth for returned soldiers and others. I do not think that anything of the kind would result from the carrying of the amendment. The Public Works Committee could make an interim report on the proposed additions to the Geelong mills, and at the same time prosecute its inquiries with the object of discovering the most suitable place in the Federal Territory for the erection of such mills. I do not very often disagree with my leader (Mr Tudor), but I differ from him on the question of centralization. If this huge continent is to have, as we hope it will have in the not far distant future, a population sufficient to enable us to maintain our national ideals in regard to a White Australia and other matters, I undoubtedly say that we must adopt a policy of decentralization. That is the crying need of Australia. There is a general clamour against centralization, and we must so develop our industries as to spread our population over a wider area .than at present. Only by developing the secondary industries alongside the primary ones, so that both classes of industry may work in unison, can we hope to build up a great nation. Reference has been made to the capital that will be invested in woollen mills, and the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) spoke of a great scheme for developing the industry by private capital on a scale in comparison with which the Commonwealth Mills would be a very minor concern. The more the Commonwealth can develop woollen mills of its own, the better it will be for all concerned. God help Australia if it is to be at the mercy of F l in ders-lane or York-street, Sydney! Today the people in Flinders-lane and Yorkstreet have the whole of the factories of Victoria and New South Wales in the palms of their hands.",34
142,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Did not the honourable hear me say that the Bureau had not solicited support from any one in,34
143,Mr LAZZARINI,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I did ; but, at the a present time, Flinders-lane and Yorkstreet are able to dictate terms to the . factories, and that is one reason why the this manufacture of soft goods is backward. The factories cau produce only what the wholesale firms will take; and if they tempt to distribute any of their surplus through other channels than the wholesale houses pressure is brought to .bear upon them. Therefore, I repeat that the more the Commonwealth can extend the manufacture of woollens and other goods, the better for the consumer. I support the amendment, and I hope that the Government will not be satisfied with merely spending a few thousand pounds in enlarging the mill at Geelong, but will extend its activities throughout the Commonwealth. Debate (on motion by Mr ROBERT COOK) adjourned. CUSTOMS BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 26th October (vide page 5949), on motion by Mr. GREENEThat this Bill be now read a second",34
144,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Yarra) [4.25] - I think the Minister has done well in affording honourable members an opportunity, by means of this Bill, of discussing the question of exchange, not merely as to valuation of imports for duty purposes, but particularly as to whether the present system has been unfairly penalizing cerpractical tain countries with which we are trading. As I understand the Bill, apart from excellent speech delivered by the Minisfor ter for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) - which , as one of the newspapers said, might have' been a University lectureifc proposes that when the franc or lira falls .10 per cent, below the mint par rate of exchange, the Minister may refer to the Board of Trade the question change in relation to the computation of duty values. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) announced by interjection that he intends to move sought ? an amendment to provide for a reference to the Board when the bank rate of exBoard change for the currency of any country honorary capacity.. rises above the mint par rate, in order to meet the circumstances of America Japan. The only objection I have to the Minister's scheme is in regard composition of the Board. This body was constituted originally for the purpose of dealing with certain war matters; it has now been given a status entirely different from what was first intended. at- I do not think that the Board is as representative of all sections of the community as it should be. I say nothing against the members of it, with most of whom I am personally acquainted. The Board is composed of Senator Russell, Mr Elder (who is connected with meat export), Mr Herbert Brookes (a manufacturer), Mr Reading (who is associated with one of the big firms in this city),  the Acting Comptroller of Trade and Custom's, and Mr MCCrae. The last named gentleman I do not know.",35
145,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Hal f the members of the Board are Ministers and departmental heads, while the Comptroller-General of Customs is very often present at the meetings in an advisory capacity.",35
146,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Mr Whitton is Acting Comptroller-General of Customs. Mr. Mills, the permanent Comptroller-General, has been acting on the Inter-State time. Commission for a number of years, and he is now a member of the Taxation Commission. Until he is permanently appointed to the Inter-State Commission vexed or some other body, he remains Compthe troller-General, and the work of the Department is carried on by the AssistantComptroller, MT. Whitton, who, for all purposes, is Comptroller-General of Customs at the present time. In the his absence I suppose Major Oakley acts him. ' The Board comprises two Ministers, two departmental heads, and four representatives of the commercial community; but there is not one representative of the consumers or workers. This Bill does not provide for the constitution of the Board; but it provides that that body of exshall function in a certain way.",35
147,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Is not this the first time that any statutory authority for the appointment of the Board has been,35

150,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I believe this is the and first time that the Board has been mentioned in legislation. I understand the members of the Board receive no fee for the work they do. I do not approve of that system. Members of the Taxation Commission are paid for their services, and if the Board of Trade is doing work in the interests of the Commonwealth its members should be adequately remunerated. Thepoint I am making, however, is that the workers should have representation on that Board. So long as I remain a member of this House, regardless of which side I may be sitting, on, I shall be opposed to the constitution of a Board in such a way that it is representative of only one interest. The decisions of the Board of Trade in relation to exchange and other matters will be far-reaching in their effect upon the connnun.i ty.",35
151,Mr GREGOKV,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,If c seems almost i m proper for a manufacturer to be a member of the Board.,36
152,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,I do not say that. I think the manufacturer who is on the Board is a very good man.,36
153,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Hear , hear!",36
154,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"What the honourable member says of the manufacturer I say of the importer, although not in a personal sense. The other sections of the community which I have the honour to represent should be considered when Government Boards - are appointed. I think the proviso to proposed section 157A will safeguard the manufacturing interests. I know that some honourable have said that the importers were endeavouring to have this alteration made in the system of calculating exchange, and have argued that if a man bought a hundred pounds' worth of goods .from France at the present bank rate of exchange, namely, 52.S5 francs to the £ 1 , the value of those goods would be reconverted at the mint par value of 25 francs to the £ 1 , with the i-esult duty would be paid upon £200 or more. Quite recently, I instanced a case of that sort. I pointed out that there were manufacturers in this country who were suffering on account of-these adverse rates of exchange. Manufacturers in Great Britain were importing silk or other raw materials for the manufacture of neckties, and were then sending out the manufactured articles to Australia. As more than 25 per cent, of the value of these articles had been made in ' Great Britain, they were admitted into the Commonwealth at the British preference rate. In other words, these ties were imported into this coun try J not upon the extraordinary basis which has been adopted of their value for exchange purposes, but upon their value from the stand-point of the pound sterling. The result was that a great many tie factories in Australia were forced to close their doors. I regard the Bill as a step in the righ t direction.",36
155,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Wit h plenty of restrictions ,36
156,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I approve of the proviso contained in clause 4, which declares that the Board shall not make a recommendation which, if adopted, would, in its opinion, be prejudicial to the manufacture of goods in Australia, or to the sale in Australia of those goods. We have a right to look after the industries of the Commonwealth, and to see that they are not injured . I think , however, that a measure should be submitted to this Parliament for the purpose of constituting the Board of Trade upon a definite basis. Already we have in existence an Inter--State Commission, the establishment of which was mandatory under our .Constitution. The Board of Trade, however, has sprung into existence as the result of war conditions, and today we are asked under this Bill to vest in it some very large powers. I believe that the functions which we are empowering the members Board to discharge will be satisfactorily discharged, but probably they would have been equally well performed by the Inter-State Commission.",36
157,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,This is merely a side .matter with which the Board of Trade is to be called upon to deal.,36
158,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I admit that. In conclusion, I would urge upon the Minister the advisableness of insuring that all secthat tions of the community are represented, not merely upon this Board, but upon any other Board or Commission which may be called into existence.",36
159,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Flinders) [4.40] - For some time past I have held fairl y strong views upon the subject of the basis upon which the computation of the value for duty of goods imported into this country should be made, and I think it is only just that effect should be given to the alteration which it is now proposed to make in the existing system. Upon previous occasions I have stressed the injustice uuder which France, Belgium, and other countries were labouring in consequence of the action taken by our Customs Department. In introducing this Bill yesterday, the Minister for - Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) made one of the most interesting and useful speeches that I have ever heard delivered in this Chamber. A f t e r listening attentively to his remarks, I was at length comforted when I discovered that he now takes exactly the same view of this matter as I do. He stated that, in his opinion, the cost of goods in certain countries, even in their own currency, had risen to a grotesque extent. That is the point which I have always borne in mind, and it is that position which will be remedied under this Bill . The measure contains certain safeguards, aud does not quite follow the lines which have beeu laid down by other countries in this connection. But I am quite prepared to accept it as it stands. Certainly, I shall press for no alteration in it . I quite recognise the position taken up by the Minister when he embodied in the measure certain provisions for the prevention of dumping, and for the maintenance of the Tariff preference which we have to goods from Great Britain . Minister said that he would be unf a it h f u l to the principles in which he believed, and the Government would be unfaithful to the promises it had made, if he were to bring down a Bill which would enable foreign manufacturers to take advantage of the exchange position to dump goods into Australia. tainly the honourable gentleman cannot be accused of betraying any of his principles in this Bill . The safeguards which are embodied in it are those which one would expect from a Minister who is such a pronounced Protectionist. It is because of these safeguards, and not because of the proposed restrictions upon the basis of calculating the rate of exchange, that the Minister gave to us yesterday a very interesting and informative speech. The position which he set out to establishand anybody who will take the trouble to read his speech must admit that he made out a fair case-wa s that if the proposed measure of protection were granted, there would be a possibility that, at some f u t u re time, advantage might be taken of the exchange rates to enable goods to be dumped into Australia to the detriment alike of Australian and British manufacturers. In order to establish that fact he dealt very f u l ly with the entire question, of foreign exchange. Anybody who chooses to read what he said in this connection will be well repaid for his trouble, because one would require to wade through whole tomes of information before he could visualize the position as clearly as it was expressed by the Minister yesterday. W it h the honourable gentleman's statement. I am almost in entire agreement. He emphasized the fact that In dealing with foreign exchanges in relation to their effect unon the cost of goods in the country of origin, there were fonr factors which affected the position. These were the depreciation in the currency of that country, heavy importations, cessation of gold settlements, and loss of credit and confidence. The Minister stated that only the first two factors operate directly upon the prices of commodities in their country of origin. Obviously, the depreciation of the currency in any country will bave the greatest effect in increasing the cost of production in that country, and there is no doubt that heavy importation will have a corregranted sponding effect. At the same time, I do The not altogether agree with the general proposition which he put forward, viz., that the rate of exchange between two countries does not materially affect the cost of production in those countries, if it has not been brought about by the first two factors already mentioned, particularly under present-day conditions. Cer- Whilst the honourable gentleman quoted an authority whose statement cannot be questioned- I refer-to Lord Goschen- I would remind him that what that authority wrote was written many years prior to the recent war, and at a time whencertain nnancial ideas were heldideas which have since been modified to a very considerable extent.",36
160,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Bu the wrote what I quoted immediately after the upheaval in America, and in the light of American experience. Mr Bruce:-The Minister does not refer to the 1907 upheaval?",37
161,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,No . I am speaking of the upheaval in 1861. Lord Goschen wrote that statement at a time when the American exchanges had gone back something like 400 per cent.,37
162,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I think that, as the result of the recent war, all our ideas have been substantially varied. While I do not dispute the theory which underlies the general statement made by the M in ister, I do not think that the danger of dumping, in the circumstances described by him, are quite as serious as he suggested. We have to remember that the present position of many countries is a very extraordinary one. Obviously, in all these countries, depreciation is the greatest factor in the whole equation. We must recollect that heavy importation by them obtains today, and that it is likely to continue. This question was discussed by the Minister from the standpoint of heavy imports by a debtor nation. I propose, however, to view it rather from the point of view of the type of goods imported. The two outstanding points are those of machinery and raw material, and these are going to operate adversely for a considerable time. While that continues, I cannot think that such a country is going to be placed in a very easy position to produce goods, either at such a price, or in such quantities that we need have any apprehension that the surplus will be disposed of by way of dumping in Australia. As to the cessation of the transfers of gold, which is the position today, I think we are all pretty certain that those nations with a depreciated exchange will continue to operate in that way. While that is not such a material factor, it is a very serious one. Wherever gold exports cease altogether, it ever tends to a higher rate of interest within the boundaries of the country concerned. The capital requirements for undertakings are so enormous that they will put a very heavy burden on the whole of their manufactures to carry the rate of interest which is certain to exist for many years to come. The Minister dealt also with the basis credit and confidence. This also is going to affect the position very much today, for the simple reason that the debtor countries are in such a hopeless position with regard to the credit which they and need for many purposes, both internal and external, that they will have a great difficulty in manufacturing to full extent they would manufacture were their credit good, and the circumf stances more equal. When the output is limited in that way, the whole of the overhead charges will remain high. Por all those reasons, I do not think that the Minister need be under Mr Bruce. great apprehension with regard to heavy dumping to our own disadvantage, or to the disadvantage of the preferencewe give to Britain . In the event of such a position arising, however, he has provided safeguards. I am, I think, as good a Protectionist as any in the House, but I do not think we need have the slightest apprehension in accepting this measure with every confidence that any protection we have today is going to be maintained, notwithstanding the alteration in the basis of collecting Customs exchange. W it h regard to the safeguards we are providing-which , as I say, I am quite prepared to accept, though I do not take the same view of the necessity for them that the Minister does-othe r countries which have taken steps in the same direction, have not felt the same apprehension that Australia has, and have not taken the same precautions to protect themselves. It may be that the Minister sees farther than others; but I merely point out the fact as showing that, apparently, there is not such a great danger as we are led to believe by the honourable gentleman - In America, nothing of the sort has been done. There a committee of commercial lawyers went into the position f u l ly and completely, and that country is simply taking the commercial basis of exchange, as against the mint par rate, and is uot providing any such safeguards. New Zealand is in the same position. Consequently, there is some basis for the suggestion that, possiblv. we really need not have these provisions; although for my own part, I shall not quarrel with them. I have obtained substantially what I think we ought to have got long ago, and with that I shall be content. There was one point the Minister dealt of with to which I think I should refer. I agree with hi m that a depreciation such as has taken place in It a l y during the last few months is to be attributed to want of confidence more than anything else, that it. is not going to be reflected in the price of goods at the moment; goods very under manufacture now will not be the affected; but I suggest that the whole general manufacturing position in the u t u re is going to be affected if matters continue on the present basis. Whatever the causes may be that bring the commercial rates of exchange down, It a l y is going .to be forced to buy on an adverse any basis from every other nation, and. sell on a basis equally adverse. That is undoubtedly going to affect the position very seriously, in the actual cost of production, - with which we are particularly concerned. The Minister told us that certain people contend that an appreciated exchange renders trading easier than a depreciated exchange. The Minister said that is not so; I think that everybody will agree with his view. If the view has been put forward that an appreciated exchange makes it easier to trade, it must have been by somebody with a small conception of the position. It is clear that if a country has an exchange in its favour; it finds it extremely difficult to ship the goods it desires to export to other countries.",37
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,It is so much discount against the country.',39
164,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"It works that way the whole time; I would certainly like to render assistance to the Minister in trying to demonstrate that fact. The assistance or detriment given by appreciated or depreciated exchanges, regulates the relations between the countries concerned. We cannot introduce an artificial measure to regulate the question of appreciated or depreciated exchange, such as the arbitrary and artificial basis of calculation taken by the Customs authorities in the past. But now that we have got rid of that artificial basis, it seems to me that the natural laws should apply to the position, and trade allowed to flow into its natural channels. The Minister yesterday indicatedthough not, perhaps, in the words I now use-the contention I have been fighting for for some time, namely, that today the goods of all countries, no matter what their currency may be, are all measured by the central currencies when it is a question of purchase for any central State. When we deal with Great Britain, for example, with her trade relations with America on the one hand, and France on the other, the whole thing boils down to what can be bought for £100 sterling; and the tendency is for trade to go to the country that can give the greatest amount of goods of similar character for £100. The Minister yesterday suggested that very possibly the French manufacturer would bring his home-consumption price up to the point that would give him the same return as America got for the same amount of goods. I think that is extremely probable, but that is a natural law that will adjust exchanges for themselves in the future. If we try to interfere it is almost impossible to see wben the basis of exchanges is going to come right, and when we shall get back to a normal gold basis with gold flowing freely between countries. Therefore, it seems to me that there is a great deal in the suggestion madeyesterday that if this proposal is to apply to depreciated exchange, why not to appreciated, exchange? So long as the position is that for a certain number of pounds we are going to get a certain supply of goods, but that when the goodscome to Australia that £100 worth of goods must pay two different rates of exchange, we are doing something to stop the natural flow of trade, which is eventually going to regularize exchange. The Minister suggested that if the word "" appreciated,"" as well as the word l ' depreciated,"" were put in, it would make it impossible for America to trade with Australia; but I do not think that for a moment. The position today is that America, with a very appreciated exchange in her favour, is under a handicap; but, in the first place, that handicap flows from the natural results of her trade with the world'for the last few years, by means of which she has been able to consolidate her position. To-day she is paying a certain penalty for that; but it does not seem to me any part of Australia's job to do anything to interfere with the natural laws of exchange to assist any country, be it Japan or America. That is the position in the world today; and it seems to me that it ought to be faced. Thpre is' the further point that America is not under the same penalty as other countries that at first sight might appear, for the simple reason that she has so consolidated her position that she can create machinery whereby she may trade, and, to a great extent, get over the exchange against her. That is by creating long-dated credits to countries she desires to trade with ",39
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I think she is doing that, to a certain extent.",39
166,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Is she? That is the very point. I do not take Australia asone of the great trading countries that need to be helped by America, but the present position in regard to buying goods in America for Australia on terms of cash against documents in Australia appears to me to be significant of her general attitude. The Americans are now trying to induce Australian merchants to establish credits in America, or in Great Britain, against bills drawn on that basis, so that the American banks can take the bills and deal with them as soon as they come into their hands. The reason for that is that most people are rather alive to the fact, to their sorrow, that it, is a little difficult today to get Australian money in London. The ordinary procedure, in regard to American bills, where it was a case of cash against documents in Australia, was not for America to send the documents back to Australia, and wait to collect here, and remit to America; the American bank probably sold the bills m New York, probably to the agents of an Australian bank in London. ' Today the Australian banks are not in a financial position to buy bills indiscriminately. - Mr RIXEY -'-Do you mean the Com-, monwealth Bank?",39
167,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I mean any trading bank, including the Commonwealth Bank. T think that the Commonwealth Bank has been one of the big buyers of such bills; but that matter seems very mysterious, and I shall leave it aside. The position is that these American banks cannot take an Australian bill .and get money for it tomorrow, as has been the habit in the past; and for that reason they are not at all enthusiastic about assisting the American trader to do what, was the original intention of the bargain entered into. That intention was to pay for the goods in Australia against documents when the goods came to hand. The banks now tell American traders that they must arrange with their Australian customers, against whom they have drawn bills, to establish credits in America or London, so that the bills will be taken up by their particular banker. To me, personally, that does not seem as though America was very enthusiastically desirous of giving the assistance which I think she could give today. America is practically the strongest financial nation in the world today. I use the word "" practically"" because, while I still regard Britain as pre-eminent financially, America is today the strong financial nation of the world. If the exchanges are against America, she should open these credits and assist in that way, and thus do more than auy other country could do to regularize exchanges. If America is going to sit back and take the attitude that she is not going to help - and we have to remember that in the past it has always been Britain that has put through these transactions and helped the whole world in financial matters-sh e will take her opportunity. T see no reason, why in Australia we should do anything to affect the natural position that has come about in favour of any country, be it America, Japan, or any other country. While I have been endeavouring to get this measure introduced I have never contended that preferential treatment should be given' to any country, Belgium or France in"" particular, but have merely asked that these countries should get equitable and even consideration with other nations of the world in paying Customs duties in Australia. The only other point I wish to raise is in regard to the Bill itself. As I have already said that I am prepared bo accept the measure, I do not propose to take any objection to it, owing to the fact that some uncertainty will inevitably bo created by reason of the fact that the question of the basis of exchange upon which Customs duties are to be calculated is to be determined by a Board, and may be subject to revision. It is bound to create a certain amount of apprehension in the mind of the merchant, who may have goods on order or on the water purchased, as he imagines, with the basis of exchange at a certain rate, that a desision may be given altering that basis. At the same time, the Minister yesterday made out a good enough case from his point of view, with which, as I have said. I do not entirely agree, that, because of the danger of dumping, he is entitled to include these provisions in the Bill, and, personally, I am prepared to accept, them. However, I would like to learn from the Minister whether the Board, in dealing with the .position of any country under the proposed new section 1 5 7 A , will look at it in the broad sense of its general trading ' position today; whether, if it determines that, broadly, that country is entitled to the consideration suggested in the Bill , such consideration will be given; and whether, even if it can be demonstrated that such consideration ought not to be given in any one particular line, it will be within the power of the Board to deal with it in such a way that the position of that one line will not prejudice the whole position.",40
168,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,That is so.,41
169,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"That ' is the only undertaking I want from the Minister-that the position will be dealt with broadly, and that individual lines can be dealt - with by a special reference, where cases of dumping or anything of the sort can be established. I am prepared to accept the Bill as it stands, on the understanding that the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) with regard to appreciation and depreciation will be made. . Mr GKEEIVE - I am prepared to accept the "" above and below"" amendment. S ir ROHEKT BEST - Hear , hear!",41
170,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Tf , as is the case, for the purpose of the special precautions set. out in the proposed new section 157 A, some authority has to be created to consider the position of any country, and come to a determination, I think it is better that a Board of such a character as is proposed in the Bill should have control of the matter rather than that it sliould be left to the Minister to determine these points. In conclusion, I wish to express my thanks to the Minister (Mr Greene) for the way in which he introduced the Bill . His speech was certainly the most informative I have heard in this House since I have been here. Sir ROBERT BEST [5.10] - I join with the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) in offering my congratulations to the M in ister (Mr Greene) upon the exhaustive and informative speech in which he introduced this Bill . It certainly showed that he has a full grasp of the i m portance of this subject, handled in a most interesting way. I regret that I did not hear the whole of the speech of the honourable member for Flinders, but I was very pleased to hear his concluding remarks, particularly his reference to the amendment which I suggested yesterday, and which the Minister has now intimated he is prepared to accept. I do not propose to enter upon any theoretical discussion on the very interesting subject of exchange so ably dealt with by the Minister.' I content myself with recalling certain outstanding features whkh are of immediate importance in considering this measure. In the first place we cannot ignore the fact that today the sovereign is of greater value in countries where there is a depreciation of currency than it is in countries where there is an appreciation of currency. That is to say, in the former countries, such as France, Belgium, and It a l y, th© sovereign today can purchase a greater quantity of goods than it can in the latter countries, such as America and Japan. I next recall the fact that the prices of commodities are fixed by the cost of production in the country of manufacture, plus, of course, the element of supply and demand, and that the rate of exchange has practically no effect upon them. That is to sav, if we buy goods f.o.b. at any French port, we buy them at the cost of producing them in France, or, if we buy goods at any Italia n port, we buv them at the cost of producing them in It a l y . The rate of exchange simply represents the selling price of the currency of any country, and is in no way a portion of the price of goods. But there is a further condition which the Minister has to realise. That ie, that a country which has a depreciated currency lends itself to dumping. It was the possibility of dumping the Minister had to face so that our industries might not suffer, nor the fundamental principles of our Tariff, which afford protection to our industries, and preferential treatment to the British manufacturer. This danger of dumping is so real and serious (Kooyong) that the Minister was obliged to deal with it . If my memory serves me rightly, in 1917 the Customs Department accepted the current rates of exchange rather than the mint par rate, but the result was the creation of th""gravest inconsistencies. Substantial difficulties occurred as regards goods comwliich he ing from countries where there was a depreciated exchange, and these coming from other countries, the effect of which was realized about 1917, and the Department was driven to accept only the mint par value. This, by some, might be regardedas a scientific means of dealing with the situation, but it was not a completely satisfactory method of doing so, because it also, created som« extraordinary anomalies. For instance, it had the effect, in the case .of countries such as France, Italy, and Belgium, of running a 50 per cent, duty up to something like 120 or 130 per cent., and, in other directions, it created anomalies, although, perhaps, they were not so grave or serious as those which were created by the system previously adopted. Of course, in a matter of this kind we were too greatly disturbed by post-war conditions to fully realise the influences that were at work in regard to the operation of our Tariff against our Allies-France, and Belgium-but on the face of it, by reason of the operation of our Tariff and its apparent harshness, it did appear that we were determined to put an end to our trade those countries, and to give preferential treatment to America and Japan because of their appreciated currency. No doubt, it was a source of great soreness to the merchants of Belgium, France, and Italy, but it was also of the greatest importance to our own merchants, and in these circumstances also, in view of the anomalies to which I have referred, I welcome this Bill as a real genuine effort on the part of the Government to overcome the complicated conditions that have recently been brought about. The measure lays down the fundamental principles that our Protective policy must not be prejudiced, nor our preferential treatment of British goods, by the operation of exchange. Of course, in such a complicated question it is quite impossible to lay down rigid or hard lines with the inten-. tion of dealing with any classes of goods that come under the notice of the Customs Department, aud, therefore, it is provided that a Board shall exercise a discretion in the matter, always having regard to the fundamental restrictions laid down in the Bill, to the effect-which I have just mentioned. Fortunately, we have a very able and experienced Board which is capable of dealing with the matSir Robert Best. ter. It is instructed to provide the greatest facilities for trading with these other nations so long as a rigid adherence toour Protective policy is maintained, and our preferential treatment of Britain does not suffer. The Bill provides'that when the bank rate of exchange of any country is more than 10 per cent, below the mint par rate of exchange, the Minister can refer to the Board the whole question of the basis upon which duty shall be collected upon goods imported into Australia from that . country. I pointed out that it would be a grave mistake to limit the proposal simply to conditions under which the bauk rate of exchange would be more than 10 per cent, below the mint par rate, and that the Bill should contemplate the possibility of an enabling power being given to the Board to deal with all cases above or below the mint par rate of exchange. This would Italy, mean that if the fundamental principles of Protection and preferential trade were affected by any operations from America or Japan it would be competent for the Board of Trade to deal, through with the exercise of this suggested power, with the situation in the same manner as it would deal with operations from a country suffering a depreciated currency. I have no intention of injuring trade operations with America or Japan; but an enabling power should be included in the Bill to provide against contingencies, and particularly so in view of the terms of the American Webb Act. It might not result in any serious alteration of what is taking place at the present time. This appears to be the position. The value of the bank-note in America today is about 3.4.4 dollars, as against 4.86 in pre-war days, so that in the TJnited States you have to pay £100 for £73 worth of goods. This is, undoubtedly, a handicap upon the American trader, and, in these circumstances, there is not the same risk of dumping; but we have to bear in mind that America has a valuable trade with Australia, and it is possible that American merchants are prepared to suffer heavy losses for the time being in order to maintain' their trade, and for like purposes. I am. moreover, inclined lo think that while appreciated rates of exchange may obtain in America, there may be a heavv slump in the price of goods and a. big drop in the cost of production of particular lines, which may be dumped in Australia. Therefore, the Board of Trade should have discretionary power to deal with contingencies of this kind as they arise. If the Bill contains a provision of this nature it. will be a warning - to American merchants who may desire to trade in that way for their own purposes, and to the detriment of Australian interests. The Minister has not dealt with the important question of revenue. There is no doubt, in view of the condition of the American exchanges, that we have lost a vast sum of money,- so far as the collection of revenue is concerned, but I admit there are difficulties in connection with that matter. I acknowledge that the Board of Trade i6 an excellent body; but, as the Bill specially provides for the protection of British merchants, I suggest to the Minister that some provision should be made for the representation on the Board of the British Association of Merchants in Austi'alia.",41
171,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Le t the representation be impartial.,43
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"In the event of any complaints, it will be competent for the Board to call evidence and inform its mind in any way it may think desirable in the circumstances.",43
173,Sir ROBEBTBEST,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I realise that. I mention the matter because "" preferential trade, so far as Great Britain is concerned, is specifically dealt with in the Bill , and, therefore, I think it would be reasonable if British merchants had representation on the Board, especially as the Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures, as well as certain other business interests, are so represented. However, this is not a point which I desire to press, because I realise' it will be quite competent, having regard to the instructions contained in the Bill , for the Board of Trade to call any evidence it might think necessary to deal with the position. T heartily support the Bill as a genuine effort to solve a very difficult problem.",43
174,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Grampians) [5.29] I recall when this question was brought - before the House about four months ago by my honourable and gallant friend, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce), I very strongly opposed the manner i u which the Customs Department was then levying duty upon imports from certain countries, especially France, Belgium, and It a l y , our Allies in the late war, and whose currency has been sadly depreciated. I congratulate ""the Minister for Customs (Mr . Greene) upon the introduction of this measure, which in my judgment is an honest attempt, so far as seems possible,' to do justice to all, having due regard to the protection of our own manufacturers, to British manufacturers, and to the manufacturers and exporters of the countries referred to. I should also like to join with the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Kooyong (S ir Robert Best) in congratulating the Minister on the exceedingly masterly way in which he marshalled his facts, and may I say, upon the statesman-like speech which he delivered. I followed him very closely, and I feel satisfied that the B i ll will commend itself to practically every honourable member and to the commercial community as a satisfactory solution of a difficult subject. When this question was before the House on a former occasion I emphasized that the only fair and just principle upon which Customs duties should be levied was the cost of the goods to the Australian importer; that is to say, if for £ 1 0 0 of Australian' money an importer is able by means of the fortunate or unfortunate condition of the exchanges in certain countries to buy a certain quantity of goods, the amount upon which duty should be levied should be the cost of the goods landed in Australia calculated in Australian money. The Customs authorities, however, by their method of calculating the duty were practically doubling the duty imposed by Parliament.",43
175,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,It should be levied on the cost.,43
176,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Yes , and that cost, of course, would be £ 1 0 0 .",43
177,Sir ROBERT BEST,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,That is the whole point.,43
178,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Of course it is.,43
179,Sir ROBERT BEST,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,But that could never be conceded.,43
180,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"The position which is now universally accepted is that the duty on goods which cost the Australian importer £ 1 0 0 , irrespective of the rate of exchange, should be on the £100, subject to the safeguards provided in the Bill . The Bill proposes that where there is a depreciation of more than 10 per cent, in the exchange, the question shall pe referred to the Board of Trade to decide . whether the amount of duty to be levied shall be calculated upon the bank rate of exchange.",43
181,Sir ROBERT BEST,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Subjec t to two conditions.,44
182,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Yes . Firstly, thaipreference shall be given to British mai-.ntheir i'acturers, and secondly that dumping shall be guarded against. I do not know of any one favouring the method based upon the commercial rate of exchange who has the slightest desire to do anything to prejudice jsrefereuce to British manufacturers, or to favour dumping in any possible way. I believe the Government have acted wisely in introducing this measure, embodying the provisions which guard agaiust dumping into Australia being allowed, and Britrsh preference being interfered with . As regards the question of dumping, I am in sympathy with the views expressed by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce); and I do not think there is any probability of what is known as dumping being attempted by countries suffering from au adverse rate of exchange or a depreciated currency.",44
183,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,B y the time they could commence dumping seriously the exchange would be going back towards normal.,44
184,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Exactly . The dumping - we have heard of in the past has rally been practised by rich countries and powerful manufacturers or combinations of manufacturers. It has not been attempted to any appreciable extent by countries suffering from an adverse rate of exchange arising from a depreciated currency. I agree with the Minister, that the Bill will enable the Board of Trade to most effectively protect the manufacturers in Australia from any attempt at what is known as dumping goods, which,' I understand, is deliberately selling goods to consumers in Australia at a lower rate than to other countries in order to injure or to antagonize Australian manufacturers. I desire now to draw attention to another important aspect of this exchange question, which in reality, at the present time, is largely a question of depreciated paper currencies. These countries suffering from an adverse rate of exchange have been severely commented upon by many critics. It has been implied that blame should be attached to such countries, and it does not seem to be understood that the adverse rate of exchange has arisen in consequence of the nnancial misfortunes of those countries which were not as rich relatively, perhaps, as other countries, and which perhaps, were in a more exhausted nnancial condition in consequence of the war. This resulted in currency becoming more depreciated than that of other countries. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) gave the figures in relation to the exchanges of France, Italy, and Belgium as compared with the rate'of exchange which the ""United States of America enjoy. I am not sure whether he explained to the House that, in reality, the adverse rate of exchange is measured by the depreciation of their paper currency.",44
185,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,He explained rather more than that.,44
186,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Of course, there were other explanations, but. the main cause of what is termed inn adverse exchange is the depreciation of the currency of a particular country as compared with other countries. What I desire to point out to the House is that the depreciation in currency is not confined to France, Italy, and Belgium, and other countries. The adverse rate of exchange of the United Kingdom as compared with the United States of America is due to the genefact that the currency of the United Kingdom is at present practically an entirely paper currency, and is not based upon the value of gold. The values of the paper moneys of France, Italy, and Belgium have now broken away from their former relation to the gold basis; but the United States of America is on a gold basis at present. The value of the paper dollar in America is practically the same in relation to gold as it wa3 before the war, and the paper currency of the United States of America, owing to her much more favourable financial position, has not depreciated at all, or hardly at all. The currency of the United Kingdom is, however, now on a paper basis, and the value of the paper has become, to a certain extent, depreciated, although not to the same extent as that of France, It a l y, and Belgium. This is perfectly clear when we consider the British rate of exchange with America and the market price of gold. When the holder of a £l-note could always obtain a sovereign for it, they were both of equal value, and standard gold could not rise materially above its normal price, namely, £3 17s. 10£d per oz. But when the bank-notes in England and our Commonwealth notes here ceased to be payable on demand, from that moment our £1 sterling became, not a sovereign, but a £l-note. Notes depreciated in value, and more notes had to be given for an ounce of gold. When notes ancl gold were at par with one another, the owner of notes could always buy gold at practically £3 17s. 10jd. But because notes have depreciated in relation to gold, the price of gold has advanced beyond that, and the latest quotation for fine gold, as published in this morning's press, is £5 ISs. 3d. per ounce- a few days ago it was £6. The difference between fine gold and standard gold is one-twelfth, and on that basis standard gold today is worth £5 Ss. 4$d. per oz. It must be understood that the money that is paid in London for that gold is British paper money. The standard value of gold is £3 17s. 10£d. per oz., and the difference between the present market price of gold and its former value of £3 17s. lO^d. measures the present depreciation of British currency. The actual value of the British note, based on the latest quotations for gold, is about 14s. 4£d. We should, therefore, be perfectly fair and considerate to our Allies in the matter of depreciated currency. The United States of America paper money has not depreciated at all, so that when paper money of Great Britain is exchanged for currency of the United States of America it is exchanging paper money for gold. If we were in London today, and had to remit 10,000 dollars to some one in the United States of America, we would have to give a larger number of British notes tJhan formerly. We would have to pay more English money to get an equivalent in dollars, because we would be selling notes worth only 14s. 4jd. to purchase the equivalent of gold coin. I have contended strongly in favour of the import duty being levied on the actual cost of the goods to the importer, regardless of the fluctuations in the of exchange. At the same time, I think, the Government are perfectly right in safeguarding British manufacturers, and also in making every possible provision against dumping. I support the Bill.",44
187,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Dampier) [5.4S] - I congratulate the Government on having introduced this measure, although, undoubtedly, it is somewhat belated. We must recognise the' enormous decline in the value of money in France, Italy, and Belgium, the loss that is occurring to the Customs Department from the method adopted, and the advantage being given to the United States of America and Japan. I think the position justified the Government in bringing this legislation forward much earlier, because it seems preposterous, in view of the cordial reception given to the French Commission and the protestations then made of our keen regard for the country with which we were allied during the great war, that we should hesitate so long in moving in this direction. It has really meant that, if £100 worth of goods were purchased in Italy, that duty would have to be paid on £300 worth at this end. This Bill will go a long way towards overcoming that difficulty. A good deal has been said and fears have been expressed regarding dumping in Australia; but I cannot see the slightest justification for anything of the kind, at least for many years to come. The Government are justified in providing against dumping, but the fear of anything of the kind arising in connection with any country outside of Americaand'America, under the old system, was gaining everything-is unjustified.",45
188,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,One-thir d of our imports are coming from America.,45
189,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I have returns showing the exports from Great Britain in 1913 and 1919. In 1913, 13,000,000 yards of cotton-piece goods were exported to Denmark, and, in 1919, 118,000,000 yards, or eight times as much. The quantity sent to Belgium rose from 31,000,000 yards in 1913 to 120,000,000 yards in 1919, and' there was a similar increase in the supply to Sweden and Norway. To Australia, however, Great Britain sent, in 1913, 187,000,000 yards, and, in 1919, Only 75,000,000 yards. As for woollen goods, Great Britain exported rate to Sweden 237,000 yards in 1913, and nearly 7,000,000 yards in 1919; to Norway, 174,000 yards in 1913, and about 7,750,000 yards in 1919; to Denmark, 600,000 yards in 1913, ' and 14,000,000 yards in 1919; while to Australia there came 9,500,000 yards in 1913, and only 3,100,000 yards in 1919. The business in worsted piece goods was much on the same lines, Australia receiving 6,000,000 yards in 1913, and only 1,400,000 yards in 1919. As for iron and steel, galvanized iron, wire, and other commodities of that kind, our average importation in 1918 was only 30 per cent, of that in 1913. although prices had increased 233 per cent. The figures show the immense demand for British goods in European countries, and how slight is the possibility of dumping in this country. They show, too, the remarkable diminution of our imports. In 1918, our importation of wire-netting was only 4 per cent, of our average annual pre-war importation, though the price, compared with that of 1913, had risen 589 per cent. I am under the impression that, by the Bill , statutory recognition is given to the Board of Trade for the first time.",45
190,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,This is the first measure in which it has been mentioned.,46
191,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I think that the Board was created during war time, and for war purposes, and that any powers it exercised must have been acquired under the War Precautions Act. .",46
192,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"The Board has never had any executive authority of any kind , and was used by the Government only in an advisory capacity in regard to a number of subjects which, from time to time, - were remitted to it .",46
193,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Is it only in regard to the functions given to the Board by this measure that the Board is to have statutory recognition, or is it proposed to give it statutory powers in connection with the Commerce Act?",46
194,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"It has not yet been decided whether the Board shall be given a statutory being, and be clothed with statutory powers. That is a matter of policy which may come up for consideration at a later date.' Mr GR.EGORY - I think that the Board could do useful work in connection with many matters pertaining to the trade and commerce of Australia.",46
195,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I think that development along that line is very necessary, but it is hardly a matter that we can discuss now.",46
196,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"During the war, I over had to go before the Board once or twice to seek its interest in matters affecting Western Australia, and I was much i m pressed with the views taken by its members, and with its possibilities of future usefulness. In connection with the handling of goods, the regulation of trade, and many other matters affecting our commerce, the Board could give the M in ister much assistance. I do not think officials should have too much power, because, generally speaking, they are in clined to grab more and more, and to be callous regarding the difficulties and troubles which they create for the public. An official gets a regulation issued, and then insists on its being complied with in its entirety, and to his complete satisfaction, perhaps at the cost of much commercial inconvenience. The Board of Trade might be found very useful in the encouragement of Australian industries in connection with our trade and commerce laws. This, indeed, should be its chief work. I think that Parliament should have something to say about the constitution of the Board. I do not approve of having two Ministers and two officials as members.",46
197,Mr MATHEWS,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,And not one worker!,46
198,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"In my opinion, the Board should consist of representatives of the Chambers of Manufactures, Chambers of Commerce, primary producers, and trade unions, and the representation of all parties should be equal. I do not think that the representative of the trade unions could claim to more truly represent the consumers than would any other representative; but, certainly, the trade union organizations should have representation.",46
199,Sir ROBERT BEST,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,I thought that the trade unions were offered representation.,46
200,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,No .,46
201,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"So far as the purposes of the Bill are concerned, it would not be necessary to have a representative of the trade unions on the Board.",46
202,Mr GREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,No ; but it would be a different matter if a Board were created with statutory powers.,46
203,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I have found that it is advantageous to place responsibility on people. If the trade organizations were represented, there would probably be less criticism from them, because matters could be explained to them by one of their own people who knew both sides o i ©very question. Now that the creation of a Board of Trado has been proposed, consideration should be given to its constitution and powers, even though it may be intended only to advise the Minister. I think the Minister should tell honourable members generally of the assistance that the Board was to him during the war time. I consider it an exceedingly useful body.",46
204,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,The members of the Board gave a great deal of very useful service gratuitously.,47
205,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I think that they formed a magnificent body. But if the Board is to deal with matters arising out of the Tariff, it should be representative of all interests in the community. Its members should not be chosen because of any particular fiscal faith. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3 (Definitions).",47
206,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Yarra) [6.3] - As this is the first proposal to give statutory nition to the Board of Trade, I wish to know whether it is intended that the Board shall remain representative of the Ministry, and of the official and commercial classes only; arc the workers generally to be absolutely excluded from representation on it? If they are, and there is a change of Government, no one can blame the Labour party should it act on the same principle, and ignore those opposed to it. I have already drawn attention to the fact that the workers are not represented in the Bureau of Commerce and Industry. Three representatives of the workers were invited, and attended the first meeting of the Bureau; but I am given to understand that when they found that there were eighteen other membei-s, they felt that they were not wanted. Whether they were justified in withdrawing I do not know, .but it must not be forgotten that some of the workers are very sensitive. Representation should not be given merely as a matter of form.",47
207,Mr JACKSON,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,They scarcely gave it a fair trial.,47
208,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"The workers have shown that they represent nearly half the voting strength of the Commonwealth, and they feel that they are entitled to practically equal representation on these Boards.",47
209,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Does the honourable member suggest that one-half the members of the Council of Commerce and In dustry should consist of representatives of Labour?,47
210,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"No ; but the representatives of theworkers or> the General Council were made to feel that they were there merely as a makeweight. They were tossed in, so to speak, to make the scales bump down.",47
211,Mr JOWETT,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,The honourable member must admit that they were unduly sensitive.,47
212,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I do not know that .that is so; but I unhesitatingly say that the workers are absolutely ignored by the Government in the constitution of these Boards. That is one reason why they have declined to be represented on the Taxation Commission. There are members of the Government who know that I pressed the claim of the 'workers to be recog- represented on that Commission, and that, but for my action, they would not have been asked to select a representative. The members of the General Council of the Bureau of Commerce and In dustry are as follow:-The Minister (Mr. Greene), and the Director, Mr Stirling Taylor; Mr C. E. D. Meares, Mr Ed. Jowett, Hon. J. Hume Cook, Mr H . Brookes, Mr James Cuming, Mr G. W.  de Crespigny, Mr G. C. Klug, Mr D. J. Patterson, Hon. A. K . Trethowan, Senator T. W. Crawford, Mr E. J. Luke, Mr A. D. Walker, Mr J. A. Harper, Mr. E. Allnutt, Mr Mark Sheldon, Sir Owen Cox, . and Mr J. Webb. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) disputed the correctness of a statement made by me last week that there were no representatives' of the consumers upon the Butter Control Board. Proof of the accuracy of my statement is published in this evening's issue of the Herald. The members of the Board may be consumers, but they are all producers or representatives of the butter agencies. This is the first Bil l in which the Board of Trade has been specifically mentioned, and in connection with, which statutory powers are to he conferred upon it , and I there for© avail myself of the opportunity to urge that th© workers should be represented upon it . Their representation should be something like equal to that of the commercial classes. The supporters of the Ministry profess to be in favour of the recommendations of the Whitley Commission, and it is difficult, therefore, to understand why, in the constitution of these Boards the representation of the workers is disregarded. Are the Government prepared to call to their aid representatives of trade organizations only when a strike takes place, and when they think they can use them ? If they persist in that attitude they will make a serious mistake. It seems to me that honourable members opposite speak with tongues in their cheeks when they declare that they are in favour of the recommendations of the Whitley Commission. Referring to the Dairy Produce Pool, the Herald reports to-night that Mr W. Mussy Greene, Minister for Trade and Customs, stated, today that there would not bo any necessity to call for nominations for State representatives, as the members of the last committee would be re-appointed. Early this year n contract was entered into between the Britisli and Commonwealth Governments for the purchase by the former of the present season's export surplus of butter, and as the despatch of stocks overseas will soon begin, it was necessary that the Dairy Produce .Pool Committee should be reconstituted under statutory authority. As in former years, it will have the right to make recommendations to the Minister for Trade and Customs in 'connection with the granting or withholding of consent to the. export of butter from the Commonwealth. Tho decision that the personnel of the committee should remain unchanged was Teached at a conference of representatives of the producers held in Melbourne some months ago. Unless there arc alterations by retirement or otherwise, the members will bo as follow:- Mr. VV. Massy Greene, chairman; Messrs. H. Sinclair, vice-chairman; C. E. Meares (New South Wales), A. W. Wilson (Victoria), and W. Purcell (Queensland), Government nominees; butter section-P. C. Basche and C. J. MCBae (New South'Wales), P. J. Holdenson, and H. W. Osborne (Victoria), W. T. Harris, and T. P. Plunkutt (Queensland), J. W. Sandford (South Australia), and O. G. Norton (Tasmania). Cheese section-J. Mackay (Now South VVales), J. Eankin (Victoria),"" A. C. Galbraith (Queensland), Mr A. O'Callaghan, the Commonwealth dairy expert, is also a member of the Board, but has not a vote. Mr Tudor. This statement shows that no representative of the workers or consumers has been appointed to the Dairy Produce Pool Committee. The Government do not hesitate to select managers of butter factories, but they fail to select a worker in a butter factory for membership of this Committee. I appear here for the workers, and urge that they should be given a fair deal in connection with the appointment of Boards of this character.",47
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [6.12] - I hope that the Committee will not in this Bill try to constitute a Board of Trade. What we are really proposing, to do is to appoint a Royal Commission for the purposes of this measure. W© happened to have at hand a body of gentlemen who had been associated with the Government their for some time in an advisory capacity, and who, we thought, would be, for the purposes of this Bill , an excellent body to deliberate upon the facts. A f t e r all is said and done, this Board will merely have to marshal the facts-to inform their minds by calling witnesses, if necessary, and getting from them evidence on oath, upon which they may come to a deliberate determination as to the particular matter which is before them. Whatever force the argument of the Leader of the Opposition might have in regard to the constitution of th© Board of Trade per se, I fail to see that it has any weight in this instance.",48
214,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Does not the honourable gentleman think that to the average worker it looks as if the Government are saying in regard to the constitution of these Boards, "" No worker or Labour man need apply "" ?",48
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"No . In the constitution of the Board of Trade our only desire was to call to our aid men who Ave thought would be best qualified to advise us. It was not a matter of calling to our assistance a representative of this or that industry. Our one object was to enlist the services of men who, in our opinion, were most competent to advise us on the various matters that came before us. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to the Central Council of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, of which the honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett) is a member. In creating that Council, the Government tried to bring together the principal interests of th© country, and they asked that three representatives of trade organizations should be nominated. The Leader of the Opposition does not suggest that one-half of the members of that Council should consist of representatives of the workers. All that he is asking is that the workers shall be represented. The Government gave them representation on that Council. Their representatives' attended one 'meeting, and we have not seen them since.",48
216,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I have told the Committee why they did not attend any further meetings of the Council. At the first meeting, they were made to feel that they were not wanted.",49
217,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"They might have thought they were not wanted, but I do not believe that was a fact. On quite a number of similar bodies created by the Government from time to time, Labour has been given definite representation. But when we came to create the - Wool Pool, the Butter Pool, and the Wheat Pool, it was recognised that the workers as sucE were not concerned in the actual management of those bodies, as they stood. The Dairy Pool Committee, to which the honourable member has referred, is a body of competent men in t imately acquainted with the particular business that they are called upon to discuss.",49
218,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,And they are interested in only one phase of the business-thei r one object is to keep prices as high as possible.,49
219,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"The Dairy Pool Committee has no more to do with prices than has the honourable member himself. Its sole duty is to carry out in all its ramifications-and they are fairly multitudinous-the contract which it has made. It was necessary, therefore, to have on that Committee men who were associated with the industry, and conversant with all the facts relating to it . Unless they were conversant with all the details of the industry, they would be of no use to us. Thus, the honourable member's argument does not apply to that Board. When the Government created the Board of Trade, it did not clothe it with any statutory authority. We did not give them any executive power. Our object was to bring together a number of men who would be able to advise us from time to time on various subjects which we referred to them. They have ddne a lot of very useful work. No publicity has been given to their operations; they have been working quietly, and have gratuitously rendered us very valuable services. The Government chose the men whom it thought in all the circumstances were best qualified to do' the work in view. I was particularly anxious, as Minister for Trade and Customs, that the whole onus for the decisions under this measure should not be thrown upon me. Not merely for my own sake, but for other reasons, I was anxious that a Board should be created for the purpose. The Board of Trade was at hand, aud its services, we recognised, would cost us nothing. That, in itself, is an argument that should appeal to the Economy party-and I think we are all members of the Economy party so long as economy is not applied to matters affecting our own electorates. If we had not availed ourselves of the Board of Trade for this particular .purpose, we should have had to create a special body. The Bill would have done no more, I think, than have provided for the appointment of what is practically a Royal Commission, and would have left it to the Governor General in Council to nominate the members of that Commission. Several honourable members, amongst them, I think, tlic honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), suggested that certain interests sliould be represented on the Board. I do not think, broadly speaking, that we need to have in terests represented upon it . What we require, it seems to me, is to secure the services of men who are capable of forming a sound judgment on the facts submitted to them - men who will know where they can get all the in formation they want, and be able to determine on the evidence where the truth lies. That is all the Board of Trade w i ll have to do, and that is all that the Bill provides for. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) referred to the advisability of properly constituting a Board of Trade and extending its operations. I believe that such a Board would be able to do very useful work, and the Government are considering the matter at the present time. For the purposes of this Bill , however, I do not think it is necessary for us to constitute a new body. 6008 Customs I ask the Committee to accept the Board as it is, and if experience shows that the Board requires strengthening in any direction, the Government will not hesitate to take the necessary action.

226,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Is there precedent for the Minister referring in a Bill to a body that has no statutory existence ?,50
227,Sir ROBERT BEST,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"That is the point I am making. The body referred to in the Bill has no statutory existence or recognition, and, therefore, the Minister is running a degree of risk in making the operation of this Bill dependent upon such a body. This Bill may give rise to litigation, in which event the question of the legality of the Board is bound to [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. arise. An j Board referred to in an Act of Parliament must have some statutory existence.

We have not been accustomed to that sort of talk in this Parliament. I hope that honourable members will allow me to put the case as it presented itself to the Select Committee on Sea Carriage, and to illustrate the necessity for some provision of this kind. I do not ask that the. shipping companies shall be exempt from any cost of quarantining, and all that the Select Committee asks is that no cost shall attach to them except that which is reasonable. For instance, during the influenza epidemic which occurred last year, some of the Inter-State ships were put to enormous cost, and if it had not been for the fact that at the time these vessels were controlled by the Commonwealth Government, I am afraid that if the ship-owners had been compelled to observe the severe, and in some respects unjustifiable, conditions forced upon them by the attitude of the States, and not by the Commonwealth Quarantine Department, they would not have maintained a service, but would have laid up theii; vessels. If I had known that this matter was to be brought forward to-night I would have been prepared to give actual instances of the cost of the quarantining of certain vessels. Of course, this cost was really borne by the Commonwealth, because the Inter-State vessels were then under control, and were running according to a BlueBook schedule of charges, but if the shipowners themselves had been obliged to face it I am afraid vessels would not have run to Tasmania.",54
272,Mr WATKINS,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"What about the tion of the passengers ?' Mr RICHARD FOSTER. - Accord ing to my reading of the Bill the whole question is covered. No absolute direction is given to the Quarantine Department to pay all costs. It is left an open question to the Department to pay whatever costs the Government deem fair and reasonable. When the Minister (Mr . Greene) was referring to the matter, I was under the impression that the provision referred only to the cost of quarantine incurred by the Department, but we should not stop tliere, because it would not be sufficient to insure the maintenance of a shipping service during the recurrence of another influenza epidemic. I have not the figures with me in respect to the very heavy costs certain boats .which were quarantined had to meet. As a matter of fact, ihe actual quarantine costs incurred at the instance of the Quarantine Department were only about 15 per cent, of the total cost to the ships in wages, victualling charges, and coal, and through changes of route, under the direction of the Director of Quarantine, these figures excluding altogether whatever losses were incurred through having to lay up vessels for a considerable period. However, as it appears that the matter is now left open, permitting, as the Minister (Mr Greene) admits, the whole question 'to be reviewed by the Government, by which so much of the loss sustained by a ship which the Government may deem to be reasonable may be allowed, I think the Committee might very well accept the Government's proposal.",54
273,Mr RYAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Does the honourable member understand that the provision covers more than quarantine costs?,54
274,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Readin g the clause hurriedly, I do not think it is confined to quarantine costs.",54
275,Mr RYAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,It depends upon what is included.,54

282,Mr RYAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,That depends upon what is contained in the section of the Act to which the proviso is to be attached.,54

The Government threw up the sponge where people chose to defend themselves against this charge, but those who were willing to pay were allowed to do so. To be fair, we ought to put people travelling overland by train on the same footing as people travelling Inter-iState by sea. If no protection is to be afforded to passengers who travel Inter-lState by rail, I shall have to vote against this proposal. the Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.45],-Olaus e 22 of this amending Bill to which, on recommittal, I have moved a further amendment, amends section 59 of the principal Act passed in 1908 and amended in 1912. That section reads(1.) The master, owner, and agent of any vessel ordered into quarantine, or of any vessel from which any person is removed to perform quarantine, shall severally bo responsible for(o) The. removal of the passengers and crew to the quarantine station; (6) the care and maintenance of the passengers and crew while detained at the quarantine station; (c) the conveyance of the passengers from the quarantine station to their port of destination; and (cZ) the medical surveillance of persons released under quarantine surveillanceand shall supply to the satisfaction of the all such service, attendance, meals, and other things as are required for those purposes, including domestic and laundry sermedicines, medical comforts, nursing and is comattendance for the sick . . . . The master, owner, or agent of any vessel into quarantine, or ordered to be fumigated, disinfected, or treated, shall pay all costs incurred in the cleansing, fumigation, disinfection, or treatment, of the vessel, or of any goods or things taken from the vessel. This Bill now throws a further burden upon theshipping companies by adding responsibility for the following:(e) The provision of such medical, nursing, and other attendance on the vessel, and at the quarantine for, or in respect of, the vessel as the Minister considers necessary; and (/) the provision of such launch and patrol services, and such supervision as the Minister considers necessary to insure the satisfactory performance of quarantine by the vessel and the persons and goods thereon. It extends to the vessel the same charges as if the persons on board were in quarantine. There was some doubt as to whether that was so or not, and this Bill now sets that doubt at rest.",55
301,Mr RILEY,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Suppos e you quarantined a ship with passengers on board, and there was no quarantine station handy. What then?",56
302,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I have been .endeavouring to explain that the Bill throws upon the owners of ships in quarantine, whether passengers are actually landed or not, the same responsibility as if the passengers had been landed; that is to say, they have to find all that is necessary for quarantine purposes. carriage Committee brought up an interim report dealing with this particular subject, and when the matter came up for discussion in the House, I promised that, if after studying the question.I considered the Act did not go far enough, and did not give us power to exempt owners from quarantine charges in certain circumstances, I would recommit the clause of this Bill, and make the position perfectly clear. That is what I am doing now.",56
303,Mr RYAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,The amendment does not do that with regard to charges for fumigation.,56
304,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,I believe that fumigation is only carried out with regard to oversea vessels though it might be necessary in the case of Australian vessels.,56
305,Mr RYAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,-What I was suggesting is that this amendment does not affect section 59A.,56
306,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I think the honourable member is right; but, after all, section 59A deals with a comparatively minor matter. At the request of the Sea-carriage Committee I met the ship-owners to see if we could agree as to the method by which the object they had in view could be attained. Naturally, the shipping companies asked for a good deal more than I was prepared to grant. They station asked for exemption in regard to the whole of the costs, including the upkeep of a vessel, wages, detention charges, and a number of other matters; but I said I was not prepared to do that, at all events in the Quarantine Bill, although I think it is proper that under certain circumstances such as, for instance, the establishment of strict quarantine for considerations of national safety involving enormously heavy charges upon the shipping companies, which, by law, they would be prevented from getting, from the passengers directly at all events, it might be desirable for the Government to have the power of exemption. I said to them that, if it became impossible to run the vessels under certain conditions which might arise, it would be a matter for consideration by the Administration of the day whether they should take over the ships for the time being, or come to some arrangement in regard to compensation, so that a reasonable service could be maintained. I was not prepared to grant The Sea- their request in to to. This must be a matter for determination by the Government in poweri f ever such a set of circumstances arises. I think this is the only fair way in which the position can be met. No doubt, they would have been better pleased if I had agreed to their requests ; but, on the whole, I think they are satisfied.",56
307,Mr RYAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Is it not possible that they would modify their freights and fares if their request were granted?,56
308,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,I do not know that they would do that.,56
309,Mr CORSER,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Wide Bay) [8.47] - I should like honourable members to under 1 stand the position in which .members of the Sea-carriage Committee were placed when this question arose. Evidence from Admiral Clarkson and from representatives of the Steam-ship Owners Federation showed conclusively that enormous charges had been made against vessels placed under quarantine restrictions, in the case of one ship the amount being as much as £1,942 15s. 9d., while in another case, although there was only one passenger on board quarantined, the whole of the quarantine costs were thrown upon the ship-owners. Fortunately, however, later, the vessels were under requisition by the Government, and these charges were ideally met by the Commonwealth out of the Consolidated Revenue. Admiral Clarkson said the charges on ship-owners were excessive, especially in view of the fact that if persons left Melbourne for, say, Queensland or Western Australia, by train, similar quarantine expenses were thrown on individual passengers, and not on the Railway Departments, although the cases were absolutely analogous. It was stated in sworn evidence that if another epidemic occurred the steam-ship companies would lay up their vessels rather than run them under the previous conditions. They contended that they were not responsible for the introduction of epidemics, and as these restrictions were imposed for national protection, it did not seem fair that the entire burden should fal l upon one section of the community. When the Quarantine Bill was before the House, we suggested that, the Minister (Mr Greene) should now make arrangements for a conference with steam-ship companies, and if possible come to some agreement before another epidemic visited the Commonwealth, and thus secure a reasonable service in the interests of the people. this amending Bil l the Minister seeks power to make arrangements to exempt the steam-ship companies from some portion of any quarantine charges. The Seacarriage Committee did not suggest that if a vessel were laid up under quarantine regulations, &c, and if the crew had to be paid, the. entire expenditure should be recouped by the Government; but we did say that if any unfair charge imposed upon the shipping companies threatened to result in the laying-up of vessels and the disorganization of coastal trade, some consideration should be shown in regard to those overhead charges which are part and parcel of quarantine expenditure. - Mr Ryan - Whic h now they have to bear.",56
310,Mr CORSER,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Fortunately , for them, only in a few instances, because when they realized what enormous charges were involved they declined to run their vessels, and Admiral Clarkson was appointed to take them, over and run them for the Commonwealth. We do not want any controversies in the future in respect of quarantine charges during an epidemic, with vessels tied up, goods lying on our wharfs, and the Minister powerless to do anything until he has consulted Parliament. Unless something is done, the Minister would have to take possession of the vessels, as in the past, and run them under the same arrangement. This did not yield any profit, because the Commonwealth had to pay the expenses of quarantine out of the Consolidated Revenue, with the result that there was a loss of between £150,000 and £200,000, of which somewhere about £20,000 was for quarantine expenses. . Mr Charlton - Would this mean that the crew would have to be paid by the Government in the event of a vessel being laid up? Mr OORiSER - No . The Committee did not suggest that, as it is a matter for arrangement between the Government and the ship-owners. We contend that if a vessel was laid up, the crew would be discharged, in which case the vessel would not be earning anything, and the shipping trade would be disorganized. I think it is only fair to place the true position before the Committee, to show In that the Select Committee on Sea Carriage did not consider only the interests of the ship-owners, as has been suggested, but the whole community.",57
311,Mr JAMES PAGE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Maranoa) [9.1] I move That the amendment be amended by the addition of the following words :"" Provided further that the Governor General may direct that the expenses of overland passengers arising out of quarantine regulations may be borne by the Commonwealth.""",57

It must be remembered that persons placed in quarantine when travelling from overseas or fro m 'State to State arc not placed there for their own benefit, but for the protection of every citizen in the Commonwealth. It is only fair to ask the Government to treat those who travel on Government railways in the same manner as they intend to treat those who travel on privately-owned ships.

Section 52 of the Constitution gives us power to deal with quarantine matters, inasmuch as it provides that if thei law of a. State is contrary to the Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth law shall prevail. When once the Governor General has declared that a state of emergency exists, he can issue a proclamation that the .States cannot take any action contrary to ours.",58

In the State of New iSouth Wales will the Commonwealth take over powers under this measure to enable them to prevent an epidemic spreading beyond, say, Sydney?",58
319,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,It would entirely depend upon the circumstances. If it was considered desirable in th© interests of the community as a whole to quarantine the city of Sydney it could be done by the Commonwealth authorities.,58

W it h reference to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page), I may say that this Bill does not relate to passengers by land bearing any quarantine expenses. Th© section that he is asking the Committee to amend relates only to the master, owner, or agent of any vessel ordered into quarantine, and theconsequent expenses of which are thrown upon the persons I have named. It does not relate to other expenses; neither is there anything in the Quarantine Act which relates to the expenses of passengers carried by rail. If the - amendment was inserted where he suggested it would have no meaning, and I do not know whether it is strictly in order. The reference to the Committee is confined to clause 22', and as that clause deals solely with an amendment of the A ct of 1912, I do not think it is in order.",58

Queensland was in the same relative position as the Commonwealth would be when it trols quarantine matters for the protecquate, tion of the whole community.

The only result of making a charge in such example. cases is the inevitable one that people endeavour to avoid the expense, and doing so assist in the dissemination disease. The position put forward by honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamso ford) in regard to a State having to meet to-do. its own expenses because it quarantines people on its border has no relevancy in this instance, because epidemics do not regard State borders.

No reason has been alleged for the penalizing of shipowners on whose vessels there is an outbreak of diceaso. Duriu» an epidemic, travellers cannoi beard a ship or train until they have submitted themselves to medical examination, and have been declared free from d eease. When the Commonwealth has said to a ship-owner, "" Your intending passengers have complied with our requirements, and are apparently .fre; from disease,"" that shipowner should net have to bear the expenses of quarantine should sickness subsequently occur on his vessel. The present law makes it to the interest of the ship-owner to conceal 6 is;icious cases, whereas we should make it to the interest of every one concerned to declare cases of infectious sickness, so that epidemics may be stamped out promptly. What applies to sea travellers must apply to land travellers also. Further, the Commonwealth should have power to prevent the States from, acting as they did during the last epidemic, when, their regulations were often farcical. In New South Wales, a cordon was drawn across a road, and through it anj' person riding an ordinary bicycle could pass, but those travelling in a motor car were stopped, as being possibly infectious. Again, a person was allowed to'go without question to a town a mile within the cordon, but was interfered with if he proposed to go to some place not so far .away.

When men or women are quarantined, and thus prevented from following their usual occupant-ions, as well as being kept away from their homes, they should at least be maintained at the expense of the Government. We have been told that the shipping companies have lost £20,000 in quarantine expenses; but I have not heard of any of them going insolvent.

A certificate of naturalization can be revoked only through the medium of a Court.",65

429,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,A number of those persons who were interned during the war period-and whose certificates of naturalization would most promptly be revoked under the provision which I have quoted-were interned upon tainted evidence which would not be accepted in a Court of law.

Here I might say that the number of sub-clauses in this clause is somewhat bewildering. That, however, is a matter of drafting ; and I think that if honourable members were to look at some of the earlier Acts of this Parliament, when Mr Charles Cameron Kingston took an interest in th© work, they would see that for clearness the Acts of today are not to be compared with them. In this clause there are no fewer than eight subclauses, many of which I think ought to have been dealt with as separate clauses.  I can denaturalize a man without hearing witnesses or applying to a Judge. Is not this clause much broader?",66
432,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"This clause is the better, inasmuch as it gives a chance of going before a Court and hearing witnesses, who would not otherwise go into the box and swear to their statements. This Bill is a great improvement on the conditions which have hitherto prevailed, giving, as it does, greater security. It is provided that "" Where a person is naturalized by virtue, of th© grant of a certificate of naturalization to his father or mother""-that , I suppose, refers to minors-the certificate can be revoked. Then, the Governor General may, if he think fit, before making an order under th© clause, refer the case for inquiry; but I wish to know whether th© person affected-whos e certificate is being revoked-ma y ask f b r an inquiry. Can a man who-has applied for a naturalization certificate, and has been refused, ask for an inquiry?  Governor General shall send a notice to the person affected, and give him an opportunity of claiming that the case be referred, for inquiry.",66
433,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"But may the person himself ask for an inquiry ?  tice, what more does he want? Th© notice must be sent in cases where the person affected is unlawfully trading or communicating with the enemy, was not of good character at the date of the grant of the - certificate, or remains, according to the law of a State at war with His Majesty, a subject of that State.",66
434,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Paragrap h 6 precludes a man from asking for an inquiry if he has been imprisoned for twelve months, within five years of the granting of the certificate. I notice that the Court of Inquiry must consist of a Justice of the High Court or a Judge of a State Court. I remind honourable members that a stipendiary magistrate, Mr Barnett, was thought good enough to inquire into the employment of persons of alien names in the Commonwealth Public Service, and he dealt with many against whom nothing could be said, and who were well known to honourable members. If a stipendiary magistrate were thought competent to hold an inquiry of that kind , why should he not be deemed competent to hold an in quiry under this clause?  - fer able?",66
435,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Why make it expensive for the person affected ?  Governor General shall furnish this Court.,66
436,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I take it , however, that the Government will not provide legal assistance for a man in such a position. According to clause 13, when a certificate of naturalization is revoked, the Governor General may direct that the w if e and minor children of the person affected shall cease to be British subjects, and any such persons shall thereupon become aliens, but that, except where such a direction is given, the wife and children shall remain British subjects. Many persons during the war were interned and subsequently deported, and in the case of a married man, his wife had to decide whether she would remain in Australia, and fight out the battle of lif e for herself . and children, or accompany her husband.",66
437,Mr GABB,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Sh e was practically invited , to break her marriage vows.",66
438,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"That is so, and I can remember the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs)-the latest convert to Nationalism-makin g a great speech in this Chamber in opposition to that proposal. We are, however, making a similar provision in this Bill .  wives who at birth ar© British subjects.",66
439,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"That is so; but the Bill makes it lawful for the wife, within six months after the date of the revocation, to make a declaration of alienage. She may say whether she prefers to remain here or accompany her husband. In the case of deportations in th© past, many of the wives would have preferred to remain here, but decided if their naturalized husbands were sent away, to go also to a land quite foreign to themselves and their children. Naturalization papers were taken away from people who had been interned for no crime at all. In my opinion, this is "" panic"" legislation.  th© Bill on its merits without dealing with the history of the past?",67
440,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"If there had been no history of the past, there would be no Bill before us.  the Minister can denaturalize any person without Court proceedings or inquiry of any kind.",67
441,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I would rather trust the Minister for Home.and Territories  would some of his colleagues. But I presume he is referring to an authority which is vested in him under a War Prer cautions regulation. We ought to deal with this Bill on its merits in its relation to the principal Act. Last night the Minister was putting up a plea for certain inhabitants of Turkey-in-Asia, to whom he thought consideration ought to be extended under our immigration laws; but I well remember in the past certain honourable members extolling the virtues of the Young Turkish party. I do not, think many of the men who fought on Gallipoli would do so.  tinction between residents of Mount Lebanon and the Young Turkey party.",67
442,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"There is; but I do not think we should pick out one particular section of Asia and treat it differently from any other part of that continent. We should simply apply the education test to all alike. The Bill, which I say is one that has emerged from the aftermath of the war, instead of widening the scope of naturalization narrows it.",67
443,Mr CORSER,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,It widens it in some respects.,67
444,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Yes , in regard to securing Empire naturalization, but narrows it in regard to the revocation of naturalization certificates. ",67
445,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I cannot agree with the Minister on that point. The power which he possesses at present to revoke naturalization certificates is given to him under the War Precautions Act, and not under a Statute agreed to by this Parliament. However, it is hopeless to have the Bill amended to make it more acceptable. We had an illustration last night of the futility of submitting amendments when honourable members opposite had the numbers to support the Government to retain in a Bill a fine of £100, or imprisonment for six months, for the offence of travelling without a passport, even though the offender might be only sixteen years of age. I think that this Bill will operate harshly on a number of people we profess to be anxious to help. However, I hope the time will come in Australia when we shall realise the errors of the past and adopt more humane legislation in regard to naturalization. . Mr BRENNAN (Batman) [10.27] This is a very important Bill. I was  say, although he said it very politely, that he hoped it would not be amended, an intimation, I suppose, on his part, that he did not propose as a representative of the Government to agree to any amendment unless it was forced upon him by the House. However, as the measure is one that ought to be amended, I propose to move certain amendments. Apparently the Government have slavishly followed th© precedent of the British Naturalization Act. In fact, every time this question is under* consideration here we are coolly told that, because of international complications which might possibly arise, our discretion in this matter is limited by what has already been done by the Im perial Parliament. On every occasion when I have had the opportunity of doing so, I have either moved for a liberalization of the law in this regard, or urged it upon the Government, and it is rather curious that, while we follow with almost literal accuracy the precedent set by the British Legislature, we insist at the same time upon our rights as a Commonwealth to grant or withhold certificates of naturalization. It is significant that at this time in our history Australia is in sisting upon its right as a nation. It is even to be remarked of those who worship the fetish of Imperialism that they are claiming, in connection with the League of Nations and our diplomatic representation in other countries, a status for Australia scarcely less than that of an independent nation. It will be remembered that the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), at the Peace Conference, in sisted that Australia should be a signatory to the Treaty, although, of course, for the purposes of peace and war the Empire was but one. And the fact that, as a. Commonwealth, we were signatories to the Peace Treaty is one reason, and a very strong reason, why the adoption of the Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations has been so displeasing to a very large section of the American public. ' While, on the one hand, the Imperialist is urging the status of Australia ' as a free nation, and, on the other, the true Australian asserts, for different reasons and other motives, the standing of Australia as a practically independent nation, nevertheless in connection with this matter of naturalization w© are simply adopting as a schedule to the Bill one large section of the Imperial Naturalization Act , and adopting it in a single clause. The first matter of principle to which I wish to direct the Minister's is the status of women, because it is in that regard that a great deal of dissatisfaction and indignation have been engendered among the people of this and particularly, of course, among the women of the Commonwealth. While the status of women has been generally improved in all enlightened communities, including Australia, while in regard to her rights to make contracts and to own property she now enjoys privileges equal to those possessed by the mere man, it is worthy of note that in connection naturalization we are still pursuing antiquated policy of bracketing her with lunatics and idiots, as in the definitions contained in this Bill. The fact is, there is no logical reason for at all. It is not just, and it is not logical. I. remember, of Afr. Brennan. a. somewhat facetious observation by the predecessor of the present Minister for Home and Territories, that there were certain real, objections to having two nationalities in the one house. As a matter of fact, there is no substantial objection at alL Indeed, the Bill recognises the possibility of two nationalities*, because in a certain limited number of cases it admits the right of the woman to retain a nationality different from that of her husband. It is erroneously assumed as a settled principle that the nationality of the wife necessarily follows, and is, that of the husband. It is not too> much to say that that is so, but with a large number of exceptions, which are well worthy of consideration, ' and, in my opinion, worthy of imitation. For instance, in the great Republic of the United States of America the rule seems to be that a native-born woman marrying a foreigner retains her nationality, while, on the other hand, a foreign woman marrying a citizen of the United States of America becomes a citizen of the Republic.",67
446,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Then is there a dual citizenship in the United States?,68
447,Mr BRENNAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I do not, of course, know what is the view of the Government of a foreign woman's country of origin, but that is a matter upon which I shall have something to say a littl e later. In Ecuador the nationality of a married woman remains while she lives in that country, and in Venezuela and H a y t i a native married woman retains her attention nationality in all circumstances. Under one clause of this Bill there is provision that where a certificate of nationalization has been revoked the Governor General country, may by order direct the wife and minor children, or any of them, of the person whose certificate has been so. revoked to cease to be British subjects. Such persons shall thereupon become aliens. Except . where the Governor General makes such a direction, the nationality of the wife and children of the person denaturalized will not be affected by the with revocation in the case of British subjects. the A further clause in the Bill dealing with the position of women provides for the case of an alien of a country in a state of war with His Majesty. Where the that wife was at birth a British subject, she may make a declaration that she desires course, to resume her British nationality! That is is the case of an alien losing his nationality, whether he wills it or not, by reason of the fact that the country in which he was born is at war with Great Britain, in which case the wife may, on the recommendation of _ the Governor General, be granted a certificate of naturalization. Tho Bill makes some advance in one particular-it liberalizes the existing law to the extent that in Australia we are to recognise a certificate of naturalization granted hy a Minister representing the Imperial Government, and that is something whioh we have never done before. We were isolated, so far as naturalization laws were concerned, and the most recent case in point was the notorious Jerger case, where it was established beyond all doubt that Father Jerger was a naturalized British subject, according to the Imperial law, but where it was not established that he had become a naturalized subject according to the Australian law.",68
448,Sir GRANVILLE RYKIE,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,Is not case sub judice?,69
449,Mr BRENANN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Eve n if it were, in discussing this Bill, I might make a passing reference to it,, as I am not dealing with its controversial aspects. I can, of course, understand the Minister's interest in this matter. have taken a curious step in this Bill in that we have increased the period of residence necessary in this country from two to five years; and I regard that as a retrograde movement. We are supposed to encourage the white races of the world to come to this countiy. W'e are known to be in dire need of increased population in the Commonwealth. We claim to he willing to. open our doors to any respectable member of the white races of the world who is willing to come here, adopt our mode of living, and submit to our laws. Notwithstanding this, we are, telling the world that if a foreigner desires to come to Australia, he has to reside here at least five years before he can receive the rights, precarious as they are, incidental to naturalization.  ing four years in any other part of the Empire.",69
450,Mr BRENNAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,-Yes ; either here or in .some other part of the 'Empire.  tificate that is Empire-wide in its operation.,69
451,Mr BRENNAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"That is altogether immaterial to my argument, which iB directed to the case of those desirable immigrants who may wish to come to Australia from foreign lands. If the Minister would take the responsibility of saying that we do not want foreigners in' this country, I would be enlightened to hear such a declaration of opinion. But when we remember that this refers to non-English-speaking people, and even to English-speaking foreigners such as Americans, I would join issue in any such declaration, and say that we do want. reputable persons from all the white races of the world who are ready to come here and populate this country of ours. If the Minister de.pends for the successful peopling of this country upon those who aTe representatives of the British race alone, we are looking forward to many decades of in that sufficient population in the Commonwealth.",69
452,Mr RYAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,The Government are making it more difficult for Frenchmen to become naturalized.,69

455,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"Has the Labour platform changed on that point, too?",69
456,Mr BRENNAN,EXTENSION OF BUILDING S AND EQUIPME NT,"I do not think the honourable member will find anything in the Labour platform inconsistent with' what I am saying in this regard. I do not think he will find anything in our .platform calculated to discourage immigration within reasonable limits and on sound lines.
