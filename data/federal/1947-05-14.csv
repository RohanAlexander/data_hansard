Is the right honourable gentleman yet in - a position to inform me of the recommendations of the Cabinet sub> committee?",7
1,Dr EVATT,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"Previously, the honourable gentleman raised this subject in connection - with the International Children's Emergency Organization and post-Unrra relief generally. As the Prime Minister announced on Monday, Cabinet proposes' that atotal sum of £4.000,000 be allocated by Australia in the current year towards those and other objects. That sum includes the grant to the International Children's Relief Fund and general commitments for relief in the post-Unrra period, because the activities of Unrra will terminate in June. It also covers our contribution to the International Organization and educational rehabilitation work by TJnesco.",12
2,Mr HAYLEN,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"Has the Minister for External Affaire read the press statement that over £30,000,000 has been lost by Unrra owing to ra-ckets and mal : jidininistration? Will he make a staternent on the position and inform the House, and the country, what precautions are being taken to prevent wastage of Australian money already in the fund'? Will he also indicate how the Australian taxpayers can be protected from international racketeering in the new fund created to supersede Unrra, particularly in relation to it.? operations in China and the .Far East?",12
3,Dr EVATT,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"I ' have not seen the details of these charges, but I have-seen n general statement in relation, to them. J also saw yesterday a denial by.the Unrra organization of some of those charges, or a statement that they were gmrtly exaggerated. However, . 1 snail look into the ni-atter, and the departmental committee that will foe appointed to suggest a method of administering the post-Unrra relief fund will be made aware of the alleged deficiencies in the organization of Unrra. The administration of Unrra in certain respects was r-riticized by its own director, Mr La Ouardia. f t should be possible to avoid the recurrence of causes for such criticism' in the new organization. BUTTER.",12
4,Mr FADDEN,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether it is a fact that Australian butter is still being sold unlabelled in Great Britain? If so, as Australia should receive full credit and publicity for this product of which it is justly proud, what action does the Government intend to. take to introduce a proper branding system ?  orable gentleman knows, Australian butter is .'now sold to the United Kingdom in bulk; and, possibly, under that system it looses its identity on the British market. The preservation of brands of Australian butter is an old problem. It is a very desirable objective, and anything' that my department, or the Government, can do in that direction when normal trading conditions are restored, we shall be ready to do. In the meantime we shall watch the matter closely. 1 PUBLIC WORKS.",12
5,Mrs ULACKBUR,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"2S"" ---I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government is prepared tn expend a generous sum of money on a programme'of developmental works throughout the Commonwealth? In purticulav,- how much does the Government propose to expend in order to investigate the BradSeld-Idrjoes water conservation scheme for. the inland portions of Australia?",12
6,Mr CHIFLEY,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"All developmental works, with the exception of those carried out exclusively by the Commonwealth itself in Commonwealth territory, such as the Northern. Territory or the Australian Capital Territory, are financed through the Loan Council. The States make application for their respective programmes. These programmes ave prepared by the . .State Co-ordinators of Works in consultalion with the Commonwealth Co-ordinatov-General of Works,, and an overall programme is presentedto the Loan Council. It then rests with the Loan Council to decide what money will be made available through, that hody for particular works in each particular year. The establishment of. the National Works Council somewhat extended that scheme. Although that body has not the status of the Loan Council, Governments rely upon it to prepare a series of works for a number of years ahead. The money made available at the last meeting of the Loan Council'for various works will not be full y expended this financial year. A. review of all works submitted hy the States will be made at the next meeting of the Loan Council which will probably be held in August. GUIDED WEAPON'S.",12
7,Mr HOLT,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"I ask the Attorney General whether it is correct as reported in a section of today's press that he told the federal executive of the Australian Labour party that a move to declare "" black "" the Australian guided weapons testing range, launched by certain trade union leaders, was inspired and directed from sources outside Australia? Is it also true that lie told the executive that he had a.™pi e evidence to prove this? If so, will he now say what that evidence is?",13
8,Dr EVATT,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"I have not seen the newspaper report referred to. It is correct that I discussed, at the request the federal executive, the recent threat by some organization to declare this ject "" black "". I was not making a public address, and no note was made of it, far as I know. I said that, in opinion, the objection to the project not hased on concern for the welfare the Australian aborigines, but was part I of a plan to prevent the scheme f r o being operated at. all. I. also said pamphlet which was being circulated Australia by the Communist party .showed clearly that, their objection was to defence preparations, and was not. spired by concern for the aborigines. paper:That is, in itself, a very serious matter, and the Prime Minister dealt with it in answer tb a question yesterday. The pamphlet referred to, completely misstates the intention of the Government. The project is not an aggresive threat hy Australia, but is directed simply to the defence of the British Commonwealth, so that criticism of it is quite unjustified. That is the substance of what I said. IMMIGRATION. REFUGEES IN AUSTRALIA-S.S . "" M is",13
9,Mr DUTHIE,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"In order to allay anxiety of certain Tasmanians, will Minister for Inunigration say how many of the total number of refugees who have settled i h Australia since the outbreak of war, have gone to live in Tasmania since the end of the war, and what are their nationalities?",13
10,Mr CALWELL,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"I have no idea how many persons admitted as refugees since the war commenced have gone to live in Tasmania, but I do know, from figures furnished to me by the Commonwealth Statistician early this year, that of the 700 refugees admitted to Australia on landing permits issued since I became Minister for Immigration, the number who went to reside permanently in Tasmania was precisely four. I do not know that Victorians or South Australians or Tasmanians or Western Australians or people living elsewhere in Australia are justified in feeling anxious ' about any migrants who come to this country. Such persons are admitted if they are in good health and of good character. Those who seek to discriminate on racial or of religious grounds between various sections of people who come to Australia proare themselves not good Australians. Recently the Leader of the Opposition so asked me a question about conditions my on Misr and suggested that I might was have investigations made of the comof plaints of some of the passengers. have had reports prepared by m officers of my department who travelled that a on the vessel between Fremantle and in Melbourne.

13,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"In view of the very greats importance: to> Australia of the wool industry, whichin pre-war years was responsible for approximately 42 per cent, of the. total value of' exports from Ausr tralia,. and having regard to the fact that the. United States; of America is at present the second-largest purchases-of) Australian wool',. I ask. the; Prime Minister' whether the Government has taken any action to protest against, the , bill now before the United States Congress providing, amongst other things, for the imposition of an import fee of up. to 50 per cent, acl valorem on all. wool imported, into the United States of America in addition to the existing tariff of 34 cents per lb.? f f such a protest lia.s been made, was : : it only directed through the Australian delegation to the International Conference on Trade and Employment? In view of the fact that Mr Douglas Boyd, chairman of the Australian Wool Board, is reported to have stated' that if the measure was passed by Congress "" It might easily sound the death knel'l of the use of' Australian wool in America"", I ask-- the right honourable gentleman whether any approaches have been made to tlieother great wool exporting countries; SouthAfrica-, New Zealand and Argentina, with a view to making a.' common protest' to the United S'tates' Government against the'measure? If not, will the Government immediately take up the matter with the governments of those countries?'

Apart from 1 that', of course, the present rate of duty on wool enteringAmerica is 34 'cents per lb. I have no doubt that, if such 1 WOOL. a provision were made, in regard to wool, ifr would probably apply also to woollen piece goods: The honourable gentleman asked whether a protest would be made to t'he United States Government. I do not know that it is thediity of the Commonwealth Government, to make public protests to any othergovernment as to the type o£ legislations that it passes. That is not usually done.. That is a matter for determination! not by the Government,, but by the people through 1 their Paiiiam-eat.. Australia has delegates at theGeneva conference; at which this matterhascomeunder discussion. . The. honourable gentleman may rest assured that the views of the Commonwealth Government, and, 1 imagine, of the other DominionGovernments, have been made perfectly clear on this subjjpct. If thelegislation should be passed: it could have, very r serious effects on the. general negotiations at/ Geneva. The honourable gentleman, asked whether representations had been, made on, a ministerial plane. I myself, and the. Minister for Post-war ; Reconstruction, who is handling this 1 matter, have made clear in the proper way, not only to representatives of the United States of America but also to British Ministers, that this proposal would,, in our opinion, seriously affect general negotiations at Geneva. In relation, to ministerial: representation at the Geneva. Conference;. I point out that during the last few weeks very little progress has been made in any direction at Geneva.. I imagine that no great progress will be made until some time during J'une. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) is ready to go to. Geneva as soon as if is. considered tha.fr minisr terial representation! is. desirable. In the meantime, the leader of the Australian delegation, Dr Coombs, is returning to Australia at his own wish in order to consult with the Commonwealth Government, probably next Monday or Tuesday. The honourable member also ashed whether the Government was prepared to send a special delegation to confer with the American Government. The answer to that is "" No"". Any representations made to the United .States Government or its representatives will be made entirely on a governmental plane. I believe that there would be much resentment in America if a special . delegation were sent from Australia in order to try to exert pressure on the American politicians who are dealing with this subject. DEFENCE.",15
14,Mr MENZIES,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The Minister for Defence will recall that, on the 27th March, I put a question to him about the peucc-tvme study of civil defence problems and the preparation of civil defence measures. He then indicated that, some time after Easter, he hoped to - be in a position to make a statement on a number of defence matters, including the one mentioned. Can the Minister inform rue. when lie expects to be in a position to make this statement?",16
15,Mr DEDMAN,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"I did say prior to the Easter recess that I hoped at an early Australia. date to make ;i statement in regard to defence policy generally, including the mat- he bad said- . ter mentioned by the right honourable gentleman. However, some complications have intervened, and, as a result, it has not been possible yet to bring a submission to Cabinet in relation to WMIdefence policy a3 a whole. I trust that this will he done within a week or two, and I . hope that, before the end of this month, T shall be able to make a statement in this House on the subject of defence, with ""particular reference to the matter mentioned by the right honourable member. ARMED FORCES. lK0i.isnu.KN CAMP DEMONSTRATION.",16
16,Mr RUSSELL,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"Has the Minister for the Army seen the report in the Sydney Daily Telegraph today that 700 soldiers at Ingleburn camp yesterday refused to eat breakfast as a demonstration against an alleged shortage of rations? The report proceedsThe men filed through the mess huts, made no attempt to eat food on the tables, and returned to their quarters. When senior officers ordered them to breakfast an hour later about half the men again walked through the mess huts and refused to eat. Is there any truth.""in that statement?",16
17,Mr CHAMBERS,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"That report was brought to my notice earlier and I am already investigating the position. I do not think any shortage of rations is due to thefailure of the QuartermasterGeneral to forward supplies to the camp. I am confident that sufficient supplies reach it. I visited the camp recently, and not one complaint was made against the quality of the food that the men were receiving. If there is a shortage, it is evidently due to some men in the camp taking advantage of the rations sent there. Colonel O'Brien has-informed, me that he is already investigating the position. I hope to have the matter cleared up in a few hours. JAPAN. AUSTRALIAN REPRESENTATION.",16
18,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"Some time ago, Mr Herritch, a member of General Mac-Arthur's staff in Tokyo, visited It was reported in the Australian press after his return that Tn Australian' political circles there is a lack of complete information about the aims and progress of the occupation. He WHS also reported to have said that {>ostAustralia's representation in Japan was not so complete as was desirable and that it should he more adequate and on a permanent - basis. Some time ago the Minister for External Affairs said that lie would set up a. committee to study our position in relation to Japan. I take it that lie referred to a parliamentary committee. In view of the apparent need for more parliamentary knowledge of the position in Japan I ask the right honourable gentleman when he proposes to set up-that committee.",16
19,Dr EVATT,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"It , is quite correct .to say that representation of Australia in Japan is not yet on a permanent basis. That is because the occupation period is continuing. Our representatives are in. .Japan in a temporary capacity. With regard to the suggested committee I hope to place proposals before the Cabinet before the present sessional period ends in order that work on the project may be started during the recess, if the Cabinet and the parliamentary leaders approve.

20,Dame ENID LYONS,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,I ask the Minister for External Affairs whether discussions have taken place and decisions made among the Allied nations on whether a limit is to be set for the period for the apprehension and trial of suspected war criminals?,17
21,Dr EVATT,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"As far as I know, no time limit has been fixed. I take it that honourable member's question is directed to the long period of time elapsing before completion of the trials. That, of course, is a matter for concern, but it is equally H matter for concern that the defendants should be given an adequate opportunity of presenting their case at the trials. As an example, the trial of major war criminals in Japan, presided over hy i Sir William Webb, has lasted many months longer than was anticipated. No time lii.n it has been fixed for the completion of those trials and I . fear that they will not he completed for some months yet.",17

24,Mr MCEWEN,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"I notice that, the British Government has found it necesThe sary to impose an additional duty of 50 per cent, on imported tobacco in order to conserve dollar resources in the United States of America. Tobacco-growing is an agricultural industry and one which should he natural to this country, In view of the necessity for Australia to conserve dollar resources, will the Prime Minister consider appointing a special committee, including representatives of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, State "" departments of agriculture, growers' organizations and other persons considered appropriate, to exniuiiie the possibility of increasing production and of growing a. type of tobacco suitable not only for,home consumption but also for export to the United Kingdom?",17
25,Mr CHIFLEY,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"As the honourable, member knows there is a long story attached to the growing of tobacco in this country. Tobacco was attempted to be grown in a number of districts, and even American tobacco interests undertook extensive the experiments in an effort to grow suitable tobacco in Australia. Unfortunately, the attempts proved unsuccessful in most districts, principally in New South Wales. The industry has .made some progress in Queensland, but there are complaints that the quality of leaf grown is such that it cannot, be used for manufacture unless it is blended with imported leaf. During the last few years it has been necessary to curtail the importation of American leaf, with tke result that there have been complaints regarding.the quality of tobacco manufactured in this country. I will consult the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to ascertain whether anything can be clone to improve the quantity and quality of Australian iobacco. MR. A. W. RUDKIN .",17

NA .(.ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1947. Motion -(by Mr LEMMON) agreed toThat leave 'be given to bring in - a 'bill 'for an act ito amend 'the Northern Territory .(Aamin-istnation,) Act 19.1.0-19.47. Bill presented, and read - a ;first time. SEGOWD READING. Mi'. LEMMON (Forrest-Minister for Worksand Housing) [11.Iff]' - by leave - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of this bill is to confer a measure of self-government on the residents of the Northern Territory. Por many years prior to the war the Territories of Papua and New Guinea had legislative councils. The Government believes that the time Has now arrived when there should be a Legislative Council in the Northern Territory also. Up to the present, all ordinances and regulations relating to the Northern Territory have been made - by the Governor General in Council. The residents of the territory have had no-say in the legislation but as they live and work in theterritory, their experience and local knowledge would be ofreal value in the framingof"" legislation governing the country. The people of the Northern Territory and< the northern parts' of Australia, have a real, live interest in the progress' and' development of the country. Tliey may be relied upon to elect representatives whowill cooperatewith the Government' representatives in the passing of legislation which will be for the benefit of, and' .in accordance with, the requirements of the territory. There will be considerable developmentin the northern parts of Australia in. the near future, and the people livingthere should, have some say in. the framing of its legislation, as is the-Gase in the a.dj.oining States-. Jin view of the fact that the Northern Territory is not self-supportingfinancially, and - that the greater part of the expenditure on its development, must be provided by the Comirronwealt-hj the bill; pi-.ovides that there shall be a. slight majority of. Government members im the Legislative Council. It is further pro/ videcii that; an ordinance, vote, resolution; of; question, the object or effect of which, is to-dispose of or charge-any, part of the revenue of the territory, shall not be proposed in the-Legislative Council except by the-Administrator,,unless its,proposal has been, expressly, allowed' or directed by him. .Estimatesof expenditure for the territory will continue to be provided irn the estimates of the Department of the-Interior.. The Council will consist of the Aduunistr.ator, seven official members, appointed' by theGovernor-General on the nomination of the Administrator, and six elected members-.. The preponderance of. official membens will, therefore^ be two. The majority of the official, - members will be heads of departments. In the Legislative Councils of Papua and New Guinea there was w larger preponderance of official members and the non-official members' were nominated, and not elected^ Consideration was given by the Government to the nomination of the - non-official members of the Legislative Council! of the Northern Territory, so that the various interestsand classes in the territory could' be represented. It was decided^ however, that the members should' be electedand' efforts have been made todividetlie territory into electorates which will returnmembers representingall' the' various' industries andclasses. The territory willbedivided into five electoral districts; viz-.:-Darwin ; Batchelor; Tennant Creek.. Alice Springs, and Still art. The Darwin District will be represented'by two members, and each of the other, districts by one member. The Darwin District will! comprise the town of Darwin and the country immediately""surrounding it, as defined"" in the Darwin Land's Acquisition Act, 19'4'5. Darwin is the capital of the territory and' t'he seat of the Administration. It contains a large percentage of the total' population of the territory. The Batchelor District' will comprise the whole of that pai'fc. of. the territory north of ""the 2.0th paralleL with the exception of the town of Darwin, and its surroundings and the town of Tennanti Creek. The greater, pant of this district is occupied, under, pastoral lease.. The Tennanifc Creek District; wi-li comprise an area, within; acircle having' a radius of twenty miles'measured-from the' Tennant Creek; Post Office. This is apurely miningdistrict. Thepopulationconsists of persons engaged in. miningand the commercial - community associated 1 therewith-. The Alice Springs District' will comprisean area* within as circle havinga radius, of ten miles measured from' the Alice Springs post office. Alice Springs is the second largest town in the territory. The composition of its population closely resembles that of Darwin. The Stuart District will comprise all that part of the territory south of the 20th parallel, but omitting the Alice Springs District. The population of this district consists in the main of pastoralists. There is also a small mining community. It is considered that the division of the territory into the five electoral districts mentioned should result in the elected members being fairly representative of. the various industries and communities. Members will be elected, whenever practicable, at the same time as the member for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives is elected. The first election, however, will have to be a special one. No salaries will be paid to members. The elected members will receive fees for the days they attend meetings of the council and travelling allowance for the period they are away from their homes. The provisions of the bill have been drafted as closely as possible on the lines of those of the New Guinea Act. The Legislative Council will have power to make ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the territory. Every ordinance must be presented to the Administrator 'for assent, but those relating to (a) the granting or disposal of crown lands; (i ) the leas,e or grant of land or money or any donation or gratuity to the Administrator; or (c) aboriginals or aboriginal .labour, must contain a clause suspending them from, operation until the Governor General's pleasure has been signified. Every ordinance must be laid before each House of the Parliament. For a considerable number of years, the residents of the. Northern Territory have been asking for some measure of local government. They have protested against the existing procedure, whereby legislation for the territory is drafted and enacted in Canberra. The bill will confer upon them the power to enact their own legislation and the necessary precautions have been taken to ensure that the finances will he protected. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. NA BILL 1947. In committee: Consideration resumed from the 13th May (vide page 2266). Clauses 2 to 4 agreed to. Clause 5Suction twenty-three of the principal act is amended(«) by omitting From paragraph (wi) the word "" forty-seven"" and. inserting in its stead the word "" f if t y - t w o "": Seatioii proposed to be amendedThe following income shall' be exempt fromincome t i m :[m) income derived prior to the first day of July.

I am sorry that it will not be possible for the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Blain) to be present until this afternoon. From a conversation that I had with him last, week, I am sure that he proposed to say something definite on this clause. I put it to the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) that it might be convenient to postpone the consideration of the clause until this afternoon.",18

33,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Onl y the reductions.,20
34,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That being the attitude of the right honourable gentleman, we know where we stand. Making a request of the - Treasurer may be likened to addressing oneself to a block of marble, which is smooth and hard. Polish granite as much as one may, its heart retains its tough consistency. The time has come when better consideration must be given to the position of the Northern Territory than is proposed to be given under this measure. The Minister for Works and Housing (Mr. Lemmon) has just moved the second reading of a. bill dealing with the administration of the Northern Territory. That 'measure will be received in the territory with as much enthusiasm as greeted Guy Pawkes after he had attempted to blow up the House of Commons. I do not think tliiit the Government has cause to feel very happy about its prospects in the Northern Territory. That is not a poor man's country - Any one proposing to start in the grazing industry up there would need to have many thousands of pounds, and the man who proposed to engage in prospecting also would need a considerable amount of money, because financial risks would be encountered from the outset. Exemption from income tax for only five years would not be sufficient to induce people to invest their money in such ventures when they can do so much bettor, especially from the viewpoint of living conditions, in the southern States of Australia and Queensland. This proposal does not meet,the situation.' A point that I raised last night, and I am emphatic upon it, is that when exemptions from income tax of this character are .made, the Government should provide that a certain amount of the money which the individual saves shall be devoted to the improvement of his property. The effective settlement of the Northern Territory should be the first objective of the Commonwealth Parliament. Income tax exemptions should be granted not merely as such, but also with a view to obtaining a better and closer settlement of the territory. This is one matter which really ougbt to be postponed. It ought also to be referred to a. committee for proper investigation, because there is at sta.kc the future of not only the Northern Territory but also New Guinea, and the islands in the South-west Pacific. Such subjects cannot, he considered very carefully in a committee of this House today. There I leave the matter for the time being, feeling quite sure that it will be raised again in due course.",20
35,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Richmond) [11.26]. - The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain ) has frequently discussed this, matter with Opposition members, and I presume also with honourable members who sit. on the other side of the chamber. He advised vnfi, to my regret, that it would be impossible for him to be present this morning. The concession granted by this clause is an extension of the period of exemption from income tax from 1947 to 1952. A period of five years passes very quickly, especially to a grazier or leaseholder in the Northern Territory, who has to invest considerable capital in order to produce a reasonable income. Mr R. G. Casey, who recently visited the Northern Territory, has said that he would not recommend any one to go there, unless he had a capital of not less than £15,000, and that even that amount would be insufficient to meet the adversities which a settler might encounter. The Government might well study Mr Casey's report; because, when all is said and done, whether he is a political opponent or not, he is an observer whose opinions are worth considering. Mr Casey has pointed out that the present population of the Northern Territory is only about S.000. that the Payne report stated that if the territory were properly bandied its ""white population might be increased to about 30,000 within ten or fifteen years, and that under present conditions there did not appear to be much hope of a large increase. Those who reside in the territory have extremely adverse living conditions. They are occupying that part of. the continent to the advantage of all Australians. I believe that there is only one woman to four Or five men, which is a very small ratio. The consequence is that men bave to "" bury "" themselves up there for very many years, deprived of the companionship of wives or other womenfolk. In order just to preserve the Northern Territory and to maintain the ""White Australia policy, and in order to have aii answer to the teeming millions of the East, who want to know what, we arc doing with our empty spaces, we are expending upon the territory approximately £3,000,000 a year. That is the cost of the territory to the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth must be prepared to bear it ; but the insignificant amount of total taxes which can be collected in the territory makes the imposition of tax hardly worthwhile, particularly if such imposts discourage settlement in those remote areas of persons who would otherwise go there. A possible inducement, to settle in the territory is that, after spending fifteen, or twenty years, or a. lifetime there, one would have assets which would be readily realizable Slid thus be able to dispose of tbem :and spend the remainder - of one's liife in retirement in the eastern States. 'One of-the major inducements - for the possible settlement of .the .Northern Territory would 'be:comipleite.exemption fromincome tax-for a period-of years that-.would make the concession really .worthwhile. The Government has idone a very .praiseworthy thing in extending the .exemption for 'another five years:; but Izhe .Treasurer (Ma-. Chifley), yesterday, mentioned - that ithe 'Government took a long range view of taxation to a greater degree than the .Opposition suggested that it might. I :d:o not believe that, in - respect of - the Northern Territory, the granting of an exemption - from income tax of five years represents a very long-range view,, having regard :to - the outlay involved in stocking nip, fencing and improvements. I do not expect .the Treasurer to accept an .amendment at this stage, but I hope that,as the result-of suggestions made in this idebate, he will - consider - extending the proposed period .of exemption. When all is said and done,, the amount of tax - which can be collected in the Northern Territory is insignificant,; hut the territory itself, in relation to the rest of Australia, is - of .transcendent 'importance .and we must encourage its .development. Mr Chifley ' [(Macquaiiie-rP-rini e - Minister and Treasurer j) .[11.333 - I agree that certain -.difficulties matter. The exemption from income tax of certain .primary producers .in the Northern Territory also anomalies. .That is .borne out hy the statement-.cited by - the honourable member for Richmond .(Mr .Anthony) that a settler would require .a .capital of .between £1-5,0.0.0 .and £20,000 to establish himself in the territory. When this matter came up for - consideration, I leaned to the view just expressed by the honourable member for Barker i(Mr .Archie Cameron),, that profits made in the Northern Territory should to some degree'be applied in building' .up .the territory. However,, a good deal of the money invested in the .territory and the return therefrom belongs to - people who do not live there. Those persons are, in effect, absentee owners. My own thought in the first place was that the .exemption 'from .income tax should apply .only in the case of a company, partnership or property, provided 75 per-cent, .or J80'per .cent. 10'f the shares, or interest - was held :by .persons residing in the territory. It is anomalous that. persons receiving sdividends - from companies established in the 'territory., but. living 'under (the fsame .conditions 'as other citizens should receive this ;benefit. However, 'the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Johnsoni) .agrees that a settler .in the Northern Territory 'requires more than the - normal amount of .capital. Therefore, talking the (view that'.sufficient capital may '.not (be attracted unless some .exemption from - income tax be granted, ithe - Government (decided to 'extend the .period of exemption - for another (five years. The matter 'can Jbe a-e-iexamined at the .expiration --of that term. Tihe points (raised Iby the 'honourable member for .Barker were fully considered. There is .substance in wihat koifti he <and ithe /honourable member for Richmond have said. The latter iremuaiked that, in-any case, the amount <of tax that'could be (collected in ithe territory would be insignificant. !However,, Treasurers nalturall-y take fthe view that everybody should malke - some contribution, to public 'revenue. There may be .reasons why ^certain 'concessions may be given to certain '-people, but complete exemption of 'any section of the fcommiunity from .'tax is 'not 'sound. All of 'the - points made ""by ho'th 'the honourable members have been 'carefully considered, and will .arise in this be further 'considered. '. Mr MCEWEN (Indi) [11.35] - I recreates gret that the .Prime Minister and 'Treasurer ,(Mr Chifley) will not accept the suggestion to postpone consideration of the clause until this afternoon, 'when the honourable member for the 'Northern Territory -(Mr Blain), - whose health is indifferent for reasons of which we are all aware., intends to be present. This is the one clause in the measure which is 'of particular concern to him,' and one in respect of which, perhaps, 'he - coald '.possibly make the most usefE'l .contribution in debate - I have some-knowledge of this maftter 'because it was on -.my recommendation in l'ft'38 fcat .the provision which tfhe clause amends was inserted in the principal a;ct. At an earlier stage, the view - was he'ld - that :some 'concession in respect <©f income tax 'to persons /establishing themselves in the Northern Territory >would - be a useful ' - and powerful coii'ttr-i'buti'oii 'to - the develbpinerit 'b""f 'tfliat part of fihe Commonwealth; 'rind it became 'Government - policy to 'exempt If r'Om tax 'incomes derived, 'in - the first, place, from - primary industry - for 'a por-io*d of five .years.

37,Mr MCEWEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Then I nius.t accept : ytiiuruling. I believe that the incidence of taxation might be varied to induce people to engage in industry 'in the Northern Tewwtoity, and to go there to 'live.

In the Northern Territory 'tb=-'day there ar""e r many successful pastoralists who have not married. The other kind of pastoralist' is poles apart from the one I have just described. I refer to the great pastoralist enterprises that have established themselves with vast capital-quite often, overseas capital. This kind of enterprise has riot contributed much to the development of the Northern Territory. It has exploited the territory, but has not contributed to its development or to the development of Australia. I have in mind one pastoral company which holds leases the size of Belgium, and the total area is worked by 30 white men. Mr SCTJL'L'FN - And the owners mostly absentees.",23
38,Mr MCEWEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Yes . Mr..Scuixv - And they are still wanting to extend.,24
39,Mr MCEWEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"1 . do not know about that, but. I say that they are not the best kind of settlers. They have not devoted themselves to developing .the country. In fact, I think that their influence has been had. I have in mind one property from which, at the time. I visited it , not one female beast had ever been sold; they had all died at the waterholes. On some properties, rather than erect fences; the management preferred to leave unwatered' a strip of country twenty miles wide in order to hold the stock. I have nothing to say in favour of pastoralists of fiha.t kind. I believe that the territory needs a kind of Australian who has hot been attracted to it ^yet-on e who has had experience, and who possesses a reasonable amount of capital. If such men iire not willin g to go there themselves, at least they should be' encouraged to commence enterprises there. The Northern Territory is not the place to which a man can go with a few hundred of even a few thousand pounds, and expect to establish himself in a few years. A man s'artiug on the ground floor would have to spend half a lif e time there in order to achieve success. The territorv - needs experienced men with £10,000 or £20,000 or £25,000 to begin enterprises there, backed by the Government. I have discussed pastoral possibilities in the Northern Territory with experienced men possessing the necessary capital, but they will not go there because livin g conditions are harsh. In the territory amenities are meagre, and the people have to live in places remote from the centres of civilization. Therefore, a man with as much capital as is needed to settle in the territory prefers to invest it in some pastoralist enterprises in the more populous areas. I believe that something should be done to attract these people to the Northern 'Territory. Many young men' with experience and with capital, although not prepared to live in the Northern Territory, would be walling to establish a pastoral enterprise there, to put a manager in charge, and to visit the property are periodically. Such enterprises would be most useful. So, I put it to the Government that it would be well worthwhile to try the experiment of giving a general immunity from taxation on income derived from private enterprises in the Northern Territory, qualifying it not by residence, bin, by some formula which would require the re-investment in'those enterprises of a certain proportion. of the revenue derived from them. Mr SCUU:.IJ< -.How could such a provision be policed ? . Mr MCEWEN - That would be difficult, I admit,'but surely not impossible. As the right honourable gentleman< is aware, there a.re innumerable laws that are difficult to police and which, in fact, are not full y policed. Something worthwhile might well result from, the experiment that I have suggested, even if events prove that we were not able to police the concession completely.",24
40,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,24
41,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) f 11.52] - The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) has put his finger on a point, that I think should be discussed by the committee. The right honourable 'gentleman referred to the fact that some people who own property in the Northern Territory but do not actually live there are exempt from taxes on income derived from the Northern Territory. On the other band, as the law stands today, we have this state of affairs, particularly in regard to mining companies: A man who bas gone to the Northern Territory to carry on an. enterprise may have exhausted his capital, and having definite prospects before him, he may have been obliged to secure outside assistance. A company has been formed and registered outside the Northern Territory. The result is that this man who may live with his wife and family, under the most difficult conditions, in one of the most inaccessible and inhospitable parts of the Northern Territory, and has done an excellent job, is.called upon'to pay full Commonwealth income tax on all he earns from his property because the company of which be is a big share-bolder is not registered in the Northern Territory. Mr Scuixra - The . company could register in the Northern Territory if it so desired.",24
42,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Un fortunately, in cases like that, the lender is always right. If the lender wants the company registered in his own State, he tells the borrower that he must either agree to that or do without the money. A simple amendment of the Income Tax Act would get over that difficulty and still provide' for what the Treasurer has in mind. In the main, I agree that the purpose of the exemption from the income tax of Northern Territory incomes is to encourage the development of the territory, and the residence of people in it, and not to encourage people to hold properties in the Northern Territory whilst' residing in Melbourne, Sydney or Adelaide, and enjoying the advantage of exemption from income tax on income derived from their investment in the Northern Territory. On the other band, a slight amendment would provide for the case of a man who is associated with a company registered outside the Northern Territory, but who derives his living and his income from inside the territory. These are two points that might very well be examined, and a solution of the problems involved might facilitate a very much better understanding of the position than I have observed in certain Northern Territory transactions that I have dealt with in the last three or four years.",25
43,Mr MCEWEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Indi) [11.57] - The ever, point I wish to make is this: Immunity from income tax today is enjoyed by the people for whom the concession was primarily designed, namely, those who live in the Northern Territory, and engage in enterprises there; but it is also enjoyed by companies-som e of them controlled overseas-whos e capital structure is big enough to enable them to maintain a board of directors in one of the capital cities, and to comply technically with the law by sending a director to the Northern Territory for sufficient months of the year to be regarded legally as establishing substantial control and management of the affairs of the company within the Northern Territory. I understand this matter has been resolved in the courts. I hardly think that the Government desires to perpetuate this state of affairs. I sympathize with the Government in its difficulty in devising some formula to ex-clude these companies from this concession. I have no doubt that it was the intention of the originators of this provision to exclude absentee owners. However, with their resources and ingenuity, these organizations have been able to avoid exclusion and to entitle themselves to the benefits.. If they cannot be excluded, wby not extend the benefits to the Australian citizen with moderate capital, who, for perhaps family reasons is not prepared to live on the Barkly Tableland, in the Wave Hill district, or in some other part of the Northern Territory, but would be prepared to invest his money in a Northern Territoi-y enterprise and visit.it now and again, provided, his income from his investment were tax free? After all, is our primary purpose to induce into the Northern Territory, people who own land there, or only people who will live there? It seems to be the policy of the Government to encourage people to live in the Northern Territory, rather than .to induce landowners to settle there. That is exemplified by the Government's policy of resuming all the land in the Darwin area from the original private owners, and transforming it into crown land, thus making it possible for residents of Darwin to be only lessees. I trust I shall not be misunderstood and be interpreted as arguing in favour of having non-owners there, because that is the very reverse of what I favour. Howif we cannot otherwise induce owners to live in the Northern Territory, and that has apparently been proved over the years,,let us-widen the provisions of.this legislation by granting tax immunity to the kind"" of people ! ' have described, the. managers,, employees, and those who would, iii. the circumstances I . envisage, invest their, capital in. and. make, available their experience for the development, the territory. I*, am convinced that the Northern Territory could' produce vast quantities of live-stock,, much of which could be killed in fat condition, the remainder being brought to the adjoins ing States for fattening and' ultimate killing, so contributing t'o the wealth this country. The Northern Territory desperately needs a railway, not north from Alice Springs' where the pastoral country is"" not rich, but across"" the border from"" Queensland' to the Barkly Tirblelike. land' I trust that the construction of 1 such ft railway will be' tacffled' as one the first steps' of"" tile Government's way construction programme: 17 have moved an amendment'tt> t'lie'cla-use'for the reasons-"" I ' have sta ted!

46,Mr BEALE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT, [12:9] - I propose to submit an amendment to. this clause.,27

48,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,-The honourable member is entitled to refer to. the. clause in general.,27
49,Mr BEALE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The amendment which t foreshadow proposes to, add. a newsubsections to section, 2-3 of the principal act. The proposed new sub-section isi n the following terms:income arising from a scholarship, held by a person receiving full-time instruction a.t a university-, college, school orothereducation establishment; either in orout' of Australia, shall „bo. exempt f.rom income trcx and no account shall, betaken of' any such, income in computing the amount of income for the purposes of this-Act. In this section, the-expression -''scholarship"" includes an exhibition, bursary. or any, othersimilar education,endowment,, whether payable, periodically or in a lump sum. Theamendment, isdesigned to. bring; before, the committee the. matter which I raised last nightidiu-ing the-secondrreading.' debate. Underthe: present' practice, of the: Taxation Department}, not the-, previouspracticej recipients. of scholarships tenable in England and. elsewhereabroad, are taxed, a. substantial part, of their' scholarship moneysat, the source;. Although, the statute hasi remainedthe same over, therelevant period; the department, has changed, its attitude on this matter only in. the last few years-. Irefer to. a precisecase, the Gowrie Scholarship, which totals £47-5 per. annum,.and is intended to benefit, the sons: and daughters of pooaipeople by enabling them, if they, are sufficiently knowledgeable, and skilful, to. go abroad, aind study, so that they may return, to. Australia and serve, their country more adequately than would otherwise bepossible. The Oonxmissioner of Taxation. torday takes no l'essthan £12:6 from t'le total osE £47.5 per. annum., leaving the recipient, after the payment of ex^ change, the g<rand sum of £262 per annumwith which to. live;, pay hisboardaaid his university fnes, buy text-books, and.defi'ay all the: other expenses which he hast to meet. Studentsare not ahle to live on the amount which, isi left to them after the Commissioner' of Taxation has taken his share. I particularlydraw the attention of Government, supporters to the. fact that this'means-that only tha sons, and daughters, of well-to-do? citizens .can afford to, take up these, scholarships.. Within myknowledge, more-- than, one SOIL of. poor parents' has had. to refuse, one or. other of these scholarships because of the high rate of tax.. In Great Britain, scholarship moneys ha-ver never''been, taxed. The-British Go^ vermnent. has at all times taken the Liberal, intelligent, and only reasonable viewthat scholarship, money, first of all, is not income and; in any case, should not' be; taxed'. Therefore, it has refrained' from doing so, as Commonwealth Go*vernments-' did in Australia until 1941. In 1930; in order to put the-matter beyond doubt; theBrutish Government inserted a new section in the FinanceAct in the terms of the amendment which I now propose. Thetaxing of scholarshipmoneys by the Commonwealth Government is, in effect, one step in the process of' committingnational suicide as a democratic community. Theamendment has no party political, significance. It is designed to be more favourable to the sons and' daughters 1 of poor: parents than to thechildren of rich parents-. Forthat reason, I believe that: it should commend itself* to honourable members on: both sides of the chamber: as a. measure that should be enacted. In another scholarship, onefromtheUniversity, of Sydney; the sum of £375 per annum is granted by the trustees to enable a student to study at oue of the English universities, always with the view that the student will return to Australia to serve, his country. After the deduction of tax and exchange, the student is left with the grand sum of £1S0 per annum. The amount of £475 per annum granted to Gowrie scholarship holders is considered to be large. Normal scholarships from the University of Sydney provide amounts of about £375 or £350 per annum. Honourable members will realise that, even with a gross amount of £375, any student would have a great struggle to make ends meet. The reduction of that amount by a wicked tax impost leaves many scholarship holders in an impossible position. The result, is that a poor man's child barred from benefit. Australia is the only country in the world, as far as I know, that does this ridiculous and wrong thing. That a Labour government should insist, upon this pound of flesh, to use a melodramatic phrase, is beyond my comprehension. Of all governments in Australia, surely a Labour government should be the first to yield to my proposition! My proposal has been submitted to LabourMinisters again and again during the last three or four years, but each time they have waved it aside. I spoke last night of the "" official mind "". I do not know what influence has prevailed upon the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) and his colleagues in this matter, but every effort that we have made to secure some amelioration.of the position has failed. If you tax ing, you do the worse thing that can be done in a democratic community. thermore, the practice is full of anomalies. 'Some scholarships are taxed,, and some are not. Obviously, the Commissioner of Taxation has a guilty conscience. He realizes that the practice is wrong and unfair. In respect of scholarships tenable in America, of all places, he does allow certain concessions which have the indirect effect of making the scholarship moneys not taxable. In the case of scholarships tenable in England he does not do so. He concedes something for the cost of books and university fees, but, as I have said, about nine-tenths of a student's expenses Mr Beale. are, not for books and fees-thos e items are extremely small-bu t for living expenses. Because of this, the son of a poorman is penalized. I am repeating much of what I said in the second-reading debate last night, because I feel very deeply about this matter and I consider that all honourable members, and the public of Australia, should have the facts brought, to their notice. I make no apology for dealing repeatedly with these anomalies. The taxation authorities make an extraordinary distinction in relation to the Rhodes Scholarship, the fund of which is abroad and therefore not readily accessible to them. If it can be proved that n Rhodes scholar is no longer a bona fide resident of Australia-in other words, if, although he was born here and domiciled is de- here, he goes abroad and it can be assumed that he does not intend to return to Australia-then , for reasons best known to himself-n o doubt because he bas a guilty conscience-the - Commissioner of Taxation does not tax the scholarship payments. However, if a Rhodes scholar happens to have married in Australia and to have left his wife in this country, thus remaining a bona fide resident of Australia who is only temporarily absent, the money is taxed. That is a ridiculous position. All these anomalies point to the one thing: that this impost is utterly unjustifiable. Another anomaly is that if the scholarships are granted in a lump sum, the Commissioner does not tax them. The difference between a periodic payment learnand the payment of a lump sum, as far as taxation is concerned, escapes Fur- me. Someone in authority, flourishing his stick, has said, ""We will tax these people""; but, as the result of pressure, some concessions have been granted, and they are entirely illogical. Better legal minds than mine contend that the impost is probably illegal, because the money that winners of scholarships receive is not "" income "" in the normal sense. The recipient of a scholarship does not earn anything. What he receives is a gratuity or a donation to him for having qualified against competition to receive a scholarship. He cannot appeal against the tax because with cunning .and cleverness the Commissioner taxes the income at the source. He directs the trustees of the Sydney University, the Gowrie Scholarship Fund, the Walter and Eliza Hall Trust Fund, and other trustees of funds from which scholarships are provided to hand over to him the amount of tax levied and only the balance to the student. The result is that no one has the means or right of appeal. The student bas no. link with the Commissioner of Taxation. So he cannot appeal, and the trustees of the funds have no right of appeal, either. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to have this tax challenged, but I suggest that if some student had the money to challenge the tax in ' the High Court it would not stand for a minute. The' final anomaly is that the Commissioner taxes the money on the basis of income earned from personal exertion, whereas any one familiar with the income tax law knows that if it is taxable at, all it is taxable as income from property, which carries a higher rate, because the money is paid out of earnings from investment in property. That again -=hows the guilty conscience of the Commissioner. Of course the money is not - turned from persona,] exertion. It. is a gratuity, a g if t , an allowance that the scholar bas won. If it be taxable at all, it must be taxed as income from property. This condition cannot be allowed to continue one moment longer. If the Commissioner of Taxation, backed by the inertia of the Government, iij not prepared to revert to the practice that prevailed before the ruling of August, 1941, it. is time that we placed on the statute book the amendment that I have foreshadowed in order to protect learning in Australia. B y protecting learning we protect democracy.",27
50,Mr BERNARD CORSER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"W;de Bay) [12.24] - This clause exempts from tax for a further five years income derived by residents of the Northern Territory from primary production, mining or fisheries in that territory, and the amendment moved by the honourable member for Tndi (Mr MCEwen) would increase the period of exemption to ten years. The concession is granted to promote the development of the territory. I support the amendment because I consider it desirable that the people who will benefit fro m the concession should have a longer period of exemption assured to them in the hope that it will encourage greater development. I consider, however, that the concession has failed to achieve the development that it was hoped it would achieve. It has not led to greater investment in the territory. I think greater progress would be obtained if the exemption were extended' to income derived from investments in each of the three fields by people who do not live in the territory. I regard it as reasonable that' if income earned by residents of the territory fro m mining, fishing or primary production is to be exempt from tax for five or ten years, whatever be the case, income earned from the same sources by people who do not live in the territory should 'be exempt too. Such an exemption would undoubtedly encourage investments in the development of the territory hy people with considerable funds to invest, but with other interests that compel them to live in another part of Australia. Of course, I do not advocate a system that would merely provide people with a means of escaping income tax, but I do think that if my suggestion were adopted it. would lead to considerably more development than has been achieved so far. There are vast mineral resources that could be developed. Even if those who make the investments that would lead to the development of those resources found it. inconvenient to live i i i the territory themselves, their investments would create employment and greater population. It is illogical to say that people should live where their capital is invested. Some investments flourish and others perish by the wayside and are forgotten, but successful investors in industry are not forgotten by honourable members opposite. Indeed, they are remembered with rage. They are regarded as cormorants that must be destroyed, instead of praised for the industries they have developed and the employment they have given. People who invest in the Northern Territory know what lies ahead of them-eithe r loss of their capital or success that will be the envy of their fellow-men. They have to have courage to meet either, and we sbould give their courage stimulus by extending to them the concession of exemption from - tax on income derived from the three categories of production provided for in 'this clause. My 'purpose to urge 'the 'Government to 'accept may be-- the proposal - lor 'extension of - this privilege. If Ave want to develop the Northern Territory, why - should it necessary to - insist on a 'man bringing his family with -'him and residing there'? - Many men - who might invest their capital in' the 'Northern Territory have homes in other-parts of Australia, where far greater amenities are available to'their wives and families.

52,Mr CHIFXJEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The best joke we have heard in this chamber for months past was when an honourable member who is a lawyer spoke last night of ""simplifying taxation "" ! Mr EYAN"" - I appreciate fhat. However, all I want the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) to explain is why paragraph q is not to be - omitted altogether from section 23 of the principal act. The effect of leaving it in the act is simply to cause further confusion an the minds of taxpayers. Although no explanation has been offered for its retention, I assume that the Treasurer has some reason for retaining it. However,, in the absence of an explanation, it is quite incomprehensible to me why the clause .should be allowed to remain.",31
53,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Reid) T12.40] - The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale) stated that .a ruling of the Commissioner of Taxation will debar a brilliant son or daughterof poor parents from taking advantage of the benefits of a university exhibition. I remind the Treasurer '(Mr Chifley) - that *he fe-st Labour Government'in New'South Wales, giving - effect to the policy of the Labour party, introduced, in the face of considerable 'hostility, legislation providing for the granting of 'bursaries to enable brilliant children of poor - parents to attend and graduate at the university. This excellent legislation has been a great credit to the Labour movement. If other countries financially assist brilliant students of poor parents to attend a university, it is improper that the Commissioner of Taxation should effectively debar them in Australia. As the result of the attitude .of the department, this class of student must stand .aside, and his place is taken by, a less clever student whose parents are able to pay for his university education. I cannot believe that the Government, after having - been informed of the position, will .decline to - rectify it. I .shall be glad if the Treasurer will examine .this matter, and have the Taxation Department .alter this ruling. One of the proudest boasts of the New South Wales Labour party was that the legislation which, provided for the grant-, nig of bursaries to the brilliant children of parents an comparatively poor circumstances enabled the son of a miner on the northern coalfields of that State to attend high school and eventually the university. Ultimately, he became Professor "" Jobnny "" Hunter. Had it not. been for that legislation passed by a Labour government, this brilliant mind would have been lost to Australia and the world. Unfortunately, a greater Power than we are called him away while be was still a comparatively young man, and 'we shall never hnow where his brilliance would have taken him. If the obvious anomaly created by the department's ruling is not corrected, a grave injustice might he done not only to a brilliant student but also ito Australia. Ar. one period, critics of the Labour party declared that .our principal purpose was l..o protect the interests of ""Bowyangs"" and that we were opposed to intellectual development. The lie .complete has been given to that view., because w.e realise that democracy, in itself, is not sufficient, and that we must have an educated democracy. Therefore, the Labour party believes ith.at those who ..endeavour ,to impi-iove our intellectual standards should receive fivery possiHe .encouragement, and that no barrier .should be erected to prevent the brilliant ,son or daughter of the humblest person in the community f-nom obtaining the highest education. In the ciEcuimstances, I urge the Treasurer to give careful consideration to the suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta. Silling suspended from IB45 to 2.15 p.m.",31
54,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I consider that portion of the clause will stultify one of the finest pieces of legislation ever passed by any Australian parliament. I refer to the legislation - which enables the child of the humblest parents in the community to pass tli rough the schools to a university. The system of bursaries enabled a brilliant son of humble parents on a northern mining field to pass through the State schools to a university, and eventually to be appointed to a professorship where he was able to teach the professors who previously taught him. .The brilliance of Professor ""Johnny"" Hunter has been . recognized throughout the world. In its present form the clause is likely to disfigure that great principle and, therefore, I cannot believe that the Treasurer will allow it to remain. I am confident that he will, either by accepting an amendment or by a direction to the Commissioner of Taxation, ensure that a. paltry few shillings shall not stand in the way of the continuance of thus excellent system.",32
55,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.17] - The honourable member for Flinders . (Mr Ryan) referred to paragraph q of section 23. Those who study it closely will know that originally it was thought that the paragraph applied to income derived from sources outside Australia, excepting dividends. Ex-Australian income, other than dividends, is exempt, from Commonwealth tax if it is taxable in the country of origin. It was also thought that ex-Australian dividends were taxed by section 44, unaffected by section 23 (q). The effect of a High Court ruling was that .dividends were covered by paragraph q of section 23. Consequently, the act is being amended to give effect to the original intention of the Government and the ruling of the Commissioner of Taxation. The proposal now before the committee is to adjust matters in the light the High Court's ruling. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang)' referred to the taxation of scholarships and bursaries. That matter has been mentioned to nie on varions occasions by several Government supporters,, including the honourable members for Parkes (Mr Haylen), Fremantle (Mr Beazley), Hindmarsh (Mr. Thompson) and Lang (Mr Mulcahy). I listened carefully to the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta on this subject last night. He repeated his points a number of times probably in the hope that I would eventually see eye to eye with him. I remind the honourable member for Parramatta that this matter has a wider incidence than its effect on scholarships and that therefore it calls for careful examination. As new points have been raised during the debate, all I can promise is that they will be carefully considered. Indeed, I discussed some of the points raised with the Commissioner of Taxation last night. At this stage, the Government will not accept amendments; but the representations of honourable members will be carefully examined before the next, session of tbi-> Parliament, and it may be that administrative action to meet their desires will be taken, or that legislation will be introduced to meet the position.",32
56,Mr BEALE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"""Will the right honourable gentleman accept an amendment? - Mr Chifley - Not at this stage. This legislation was given much thought before it was introduced. Moreover, before agreeing to amendments I like an opportunity to examine their implications. As I have a suspicion that there has been an attempt, at stone-walling during this debate, I intimate to the committee that this measure cannot be unduly delayed, especially as ful l opportunities were provided to discuss financial matters generally when the financial statement was under review.",32
57,Mr MCEWEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"This bill had not been introduced when the financial statement, was under discussion.",32
58,Mr OBTFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Tb e contents of this measure have. been, known to honourable members for a considerable time, and of could have been discussed in connection with the debate on the financial statement. I merely - mention now that what appeared to be an attempt at stone-walling did not pass unnoticed.",32
59,Mr TURNBULL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wimmera) [2.21]. - In spite of the warning by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) that the bill must be passed quickly, and his statement that no amendments will be accepted, I rise to support the amendment that the period of exemption in the Northern Territory should be extended to ten years. There was a time in the history of the United States of America when the popular cry was "" Go west, young man "". Many persons do not know that the complete couplet reads- - Go west, young man, And grow up with the country. As the result of that advice, large numbers of young men did go west, where they grew up with the country. They learned to love and understand it . Sound advice to a young Australian would be, "" Go north, young man and grow up with the country "". Only by offering inducements to young men with the right spirit to go north shall we be able to populate the northern parts of this great continent. A much greater population is required there. The experience of many countries has been that those who have pioneered new lands have learnt to love them. I am reminded of the words of the Australian poetFor those who love it and understand 'I'he salt bush plain is a wonderland. Those who have lived for any lengthy period in theNorthern Territory and have learned to know the country, have also learned to love it . They w i ll do more for the territory than can be expected from people who visit it for short periods hut do not make their permanent homes there. I therefore support the amendment.",33
60,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"New England) [2.25]. - I.suppor t the remarks of the honourable members for Parramatta (Mr Beale) and Reid (Mr Lang) in regard to the necessity for the exemption of scholarships from income tax. I emphasize the fact that, when travelling. scholarships and bursaries, particularly, the Rhodes Scholarship, were first made'available to enable students to go overseas to enlarge' their knowledge, the value of them was no greater than would permit of a bare tence, and certainly no margin was proby vided which would cover the very heavy income tax that is levied in Australia today. The levying of income tax on students who have won scholarships places a bar on. higher education entering the homes of young men of poor parents. Recently I have been reading a work entitled The American Rhodes Scholarships. In the first chapter, "" The Vision of Cecil Rhodes"", the author, dealing with the seven wills which Rhodes made shows the' development of Rhodes's views on the desirability for the foundation of the overseas scholarships, which have meant so much to the world and have bound together the British and American peoples. Rhodes's idea was that these scholarships should be awarded to men who bad outstanding qualities, not only of scholarship but also of leadership. In a letter that he wrote to Hawksley, his solicitor, who was responsible for the drafting of his AVIIIS from time to time. Rhodes gave directions for the drafting of the sixth will , in which he showed how one idea led to another. He reasoned that the residential college in South A f r i c a for which he had provided might, if successful, tend to prevent South African students from going to England to study, and thus promote a feeling of separation, which would run directly counter to all his ideas. The remedy which he proposed was to supplement that bequest with a provision for scholarships at Oxford University. In his letter, the whole of the scholarship scheme was outlined, often in the very words of the sixth and seventh wills. The author has quoted the letter, in these termsOn thinking over my will I discover that 1I have made a mistake, in fact made a gift, which if not supplemented may rather defeat my ideas. I refer to the foundation of a residential college at the Cape, which if successful might lead to check. South African students from coming home for three years to our University and therefore, lead rather to promote the feeling of separation through want of intercourse. I therefore propose to add to the gift that every year three scholarships should be given 'and that the amount should be £250 a year for three years for each or £750 per annum and that the successful winners should . matriculate and reside for three years at the University of Oxford in England. exisTbat quotation from the letter written Rhodes to Hawksley, used in the preparation of the drafts of his sixth and seventh wills, shows, that the idea in his mind was that, scholars from. America,. South Africa,. Australia^ New Zealand', and other parts of the. British Empire, should mingle together, and. at the expiration of their scholarships should return to their homelands well, equipped to play a prominent part with their qualities of leadership, knowledge and ability. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) has pointed out that the Commissioner of Taxation, has ruled that if an unmarried man, when about to go overseas,, can convince the Commissioner that be proposes to' relinquish his domicilein. Australia and to make his residence abroad after he has completed his university cour.se at Oxford, he. will be. exempt from income tax; But a married man who leaves a wife in Australia is forced to pay income tax here, and it is a very heavy impost on the comparatively small scholarship which the Rhodes Trust is able to give him. The. Treasurer (Mr Chifley) is actuated by a. paltry spirit when he merely says that the matter will-' be looked into.. ""Wby can be not do the straight and honest thing by those men who have won travelling, and other scholarships, included ih whose ranks was the late Professor John Hunt'er, one of the most distinguished' scientific men which this country has ever produced ? While be was in the. second' year. of. his medical course a-tthe University of. Sydney, Hunter coached men who were in.their fourth year, in work that he had' not yet done: Be'was so far ahead of every otherstudent that he wascapableof doingthat work. When lie graduated, he brought to the study of medical' science acapacity for original thought, which, this country had never, dreamed waspossessed by any man produced' by the University of' Sydney or any. other Australian university.

I hope that the' honourable member will canty hist amendment to. a division, so that the people of Australia may realise that there is considerablehypocrisy among those who; are always pleading: that the sons of poorparents should have^ every opportunity to-enlarge, their education, and yet would deny, to our.most:brilliant sons'oppor.tunities to go: overseas to. the. fountains, of research andlearningand to. return to, Australia better, equipped' to> playaleading r.ole. in the development of"" this young Commonwealth.",33
61,Mr THOMPSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Hindmarsh). [2.33]. - I should' not have taken part in this debate but for some of the wild' statements that have-been made. Governments supported By the honourable member for New 1 England (Mr Abbott) did not do the right thing towards the poor section of our people ih regard' to education. I was a member of the-finance committee of - the University of Adelaide for about: fourteen years; during the whole of which period'not one case was liaised of incometax having the effect alleged by honourable members opposite.,34

(Mr Beale) on bringing forward this matter. I.believe that many honourable m.ember.s opposite, Tike those' on this side of the chamber, agree with the honourable .member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) that an excellent ease has been made - out for setting aside the present practice in respect of this inatteir. There .can be wo doubt that taxation seriously limits the power of 'these trusts to advance the cause of education. .1 also believe that many honourable members share the vision of an Australia of the future which will be not (only -« centre in the South Pacific of social legislation in advance-of'that of the rest of the world, but also a centre of science, - culture and art. The day when that ideal can be realized will be 'very much - more quickly reached if we have contact .with other parts of .the world.

63,Mrs BLACKBURN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Bourke) '[2.40]. - I am content to accept the assurance , given by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) that the proposal foreshadowed by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale) will he looked into. I agree with the. honourable member for Hindmarsh (Ma-. Thompson) 'that we can safely leave it in the bands - of the Treasurer. A great many honourable members feel deeply - on this matter: I rose simply to place on record the fact that I am in favour of the 'amendment. However, .1 accept the assurance given by the Treasurer.",35
64,Mr BEALE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,".Parraanatta.) [-2.41] - I should like to .remind the committee of the terms of the amendment which I foreshadow, and also to state what I propose to do in view of the undertaking given by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley). The amendment I have drafted follows:That the following new sub-clause (s) be inserted:(s) Income arising from a scholarship held by a person receiving full-time instruction at a university, college, school or other ment, either in or out of Australia. In this section, the expression'-scholarshi p - include s an exhibition, bursary or any other - irnilar education' endowment whether payable periodically or in a lump sum. The Treasurer has exhibited a glimmering of sweet reasonableness in this matter, and in those circumstances it would not be fitting that I should fail to exhibit at least an equal degree of sweet reasonableness. The Treasurer, - having said that rhis matter will be carefully examined, » nd having, I believe, by a hint, indicated that my proposal will receive something more than sympathetic consideration, supported as it undoubtedly is by a strong body of opinion among honourable members opposite as well as by the Opposition us a whole, I do not propose to press my amendment at this stage. I do not want rhis extremely important matter to become the subject of party hostility which might result in my objective being defeated; because, the Treasurer, so I am told, has a habit of what, is colloquially known as "" getting his back up"". I do not want to get any one's "" back up "" in this matter. I want to ensure that income in respect of scholarships for Australian students going abroad shall be exempt from tax and, regardless of the. method employed, I shall be content so long as that objective is achieved. Therefore, in view of the Treasurer's assurance, I shall proceed no further with the matter. I am obliged to the honourable member for Reid (Mr. Lang). I do not agree with his politics. Indeed, I dislike his politics and his past political history; but when he spoke ro-day as he did, he spoke with the authentic voice of Australian Labour at its best. There is no doubt about that; and I am. grateful for the support which he gave to my proposal. I am equally grateful for the support which has been expressed by the honourable member for .Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) and the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs. Blackburn), and also the unspoken supMr Beale. s is as port of honourable members opposite-. 1 hope that it will not be long before my proposal is implemented. Indeed, even an amendment is not required; it can be implemented by a departmental directive that the conditions which existed in 1941 education establish- be applied.",35
65,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That , alone, would require examination.",36
66,Mr BEALE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Maybe , but it was good enough from the time Commonwealth income tax was first introduced until 1.941. No one did, or could, challenge it, and T should like to know why we cannot get back to it again. I have been accused by the Treasurer of repetition. In this I have been merely imitating Labour tactics. Members of the Labour party have made a speciality of repetition. Very often what they repeat is not worth repeating; the difference between them and me is that what I was saying was well worth repeating, and I trust that it will produce a favourable result.. A m end m ent n pgatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 6 to 8 agreed to. Clause 9Section fifty-four of the Principal Act - is amended by inserting in paragraph (6) of. sub-section (2.) after the word "" purposes "" (second occurring), the words or structural improvements, bores or wells expenditure on. which has been allowed or is or has been allowable as a deduction under paragraph (g), (h) or (i ) of sub-section (1.) of section seventy-five of this Act from the assessable income, of any year of income, of the taxpayer or of any other person "".",36
67,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party.) [2.47] - I move That the words "" o r of any other person"" be left out. This clause contains one of. the most objectionable provisions in the bill, and my amendment is intended to correct an anomaly. The effect of the clause as drafted may he illustrated by quoting the case of a. primary producer who sinks a bore which might cost £3,000, £4,000 or more. He can get a deduction in the year of expenditure and, if the expenditure is excessive for that purpose, the resultant loss may be carried forward for seven years. Upon the sale of the property, the taxpayer who sank the bore would not be assessable on any amount which lie might receive in respect to the bore, but the purchaser, and any subsequent owners, will not be entitled to any depreciation on what they pay for the bore. At first sight, it would appear that, the Crown is entitled to some consideration cause of the full allowance in the year of expenditure, and that it should not be obliged to make a further deduction. If that be so, it is an open question whether it would be more equitable to require the one who sank the bore to submit to taxation what he received for the bore upon sale, but .not exceeding the amount of his expenditure, or whether rhe Government's proposal ought to deny the deduction to purchasers. The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) may have chosen his method because the tax on the sale of i lie bore, even when subject to the averaging provisions, may be very high. However, in my opinion, the Treasurer should not seek any quid f r o .quo for the allowance which, after all, is the Government's contribution towards encouraging primary producers to provide against all-toofrequent droughts. Tf expenditure on water improvements is contrasted with expenditure already allowed and now proposed to be allowed under section 75, e.g., preparation of land for agriculture, clearing and cultivation, draining of swamps, erosion and preventive measures, it will be seen that the Treasurer is prepared to allow as a deduction for income tax purposes such expenditure which is admittedly of a capital nature; and he allows such capital expenditure without seeking any quid 'pro quo other than what he would indirectly get as a result of the greater productivity of the land. Consequently, the Treasurer ought to be similarly satisfied with regard to bores, and should reconcile himself to the one loss as lie does with regard to the other expenditure under section 75. A highly artificial position will be created if depreciation is denied, on certain asset3 that normally carry depreciation, and intending purchasers will not know where they stand for taxation purposes. The secrecy provisions of the act will forbid the department to give information on the point.",36
68,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [ 2 . 5 0 ] - I do notagree with the interpretation placed upon this clause by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden). I believe that the provision affords some additional relief to primary producers, particularly graziers. .1I have asked th: be- officials to make a particular note of hi - remarks, .because 1I have no doubt that Ii -- 1 believes that there is some substance in them. The matter will be examined.",37
69,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) [2.5.11 -.1 . am not sure how some taxpayers will stand under this clause as drafted. It is clear that the Government has at hist given way, and accepted the proposal of the Opposition that money spent on the construction of bores ami wells should be an allowable deduction for income tax purposes, but the claufidoes not make it clear .whether this concession will extend to expenditure or. reticulation schemes which, of course, are necessary in connection with bore sinking. 1 should also like to know what will be the position of the taxpayer who has spent money on such work in the past. Under the net as it stands, he is allowed so much a year for depreciation on a diminishing scale. This clause abolishes the allowance for depreciation in respect of expenditure in this and subsequent years, but the position in regard to past expenditure is not clear. I should be glad if the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) would explain the point.",37
70,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It is not intended that the legislation will be retrospective. i do uot profess to be able to give a technical interpretation of the provision at. 'this stage, but I shall have the matter looked into.",37
71,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I do not suggest that an allowance should be made in respect, of capital expenditure undertaken on works of this kind in previous years, but I should like to know whether the taxpayer who has in the past been allowed depreciation on such expenditure will continue to receive this benefit.",37
72,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.55] - The Commissioner of Taxation indicates that the clause will be read in such a way that the allowance for depreciation will he continued. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 10 and 11 agreed to. Clause 12 Section seventy-five of the Principal Act is ii mended(6) by inserting' after paragraph (/) the following paragraphs:- .

73,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) [2.56} - Paragraph ' h of the clause deals with soil erosion and specifically excludes from exemption expenditure incurred on fences used for preventing or combating soil erosion. I am accustomed to living in. various parts of Australiain which soil erosionis one. of the great curses inflicted on the farmer. One of the means by which it has been possible to stop soil erosion has been by the erection of brush fences or the expensive; type of cord fence-. I cannot sea why expenditure on fences should be excluded. The whole question of soil erosion is of such importance to the Commonwealth that money expended to combat it, either on thei planting of trees* shrubs or grasses, on contour ploughing, on the trenching of hillsides or on the erection of fences, barriers or ditches, should be an allowable deduction. In. view of the many methods, which, may be employed, according to the. varying circumstances of soil erosion in various parts of Australia, I would be obliged if the right honourable gentleman would indicate why fences should be excluded while expenditure on other methods of prevention are allowed.",38
74,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"New England) [2.57]. - I , too, believe that the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) should explain exactly what is meant by the term "" fences ""'. Recently, 1 had a small lucerne paddock which was being rapidly eroded. In order to counteract the erosion, I put in two dolphins where the water changed its course. These dolphins could be classified as a fence. They were built of timber and had logs thrown upagainst them. They were not used for the purpose of holding stock in a paddock, but solely for the purpose of diverting water.. For the ""purpose of preventing sheet erosion taking place as theresult, of gulleys forming in the hills above-,, another means of preventing erosion of that kind is by the erection of a wire, fence which collects the: rubbish coming down with the water and. forms, a.kind of: dam thus, diverting the water to its proper course-. That, too-, might, be regarded as. a fence within the meaning of 1 the clause. Unless there is a clear definition of what is meant by the term ""fences"" the Commissioner may classify a dolphin such as-1I have described, or a wire structure intended to, create a small diversionary dam,, as a. fence-.",38
75,Mr SCULLY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,How is it possible to give a practical definition of the term?,38
76,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If it be not possible to givea practical definition of the term-, why not omit the words- "" otherwise than by theerection of fences "". If the Vice1 President of the Executive Council (Mr-. Scu-My); does, not know what is meant by ""' fences"", why leave the words in the bill? The. honourable gentleman admits that the word- ""fences:"" is incapable of bpin-fi defined', but he proposes that it 1 should, he: left in the bill'. Should the taxpayers be. taxed in respect of expenditure they incur on something, the:-Minister himself admits is. incapable, of definition ? If. the. words are toremain, let, us have an accurate' definition, of what is meant by "" fences-"" so that people will not be called upon to pay tax on structures used solely for the prevention of soil erosion which may otherwise be regarded as fences.",38
77,Mr BERNARD CORSER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wide Bay) [3.0] - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie-Cameron) and'the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott). A fence is one of the great preventives of a class of soil erosion, particularly erosion of the type which, perhaps more than anythingelse, is troubling the farmers of Australia. The greatest advocates of protection against erosion urge that certain portions of a property be fenced off from time to time and be regrassed. If money expended on the erection of fences for that purpose is not made an allowable deduction, how. can the farmer afford to carry out the regrassing? AH expenditure on fencing erected solely as a preventive against erosion should be an allowable deduction. It is of no benefit to the-., farmer for. the, commissioner to grant;, aconcession, in . respect; of expenditure,- on. preventive measures one type-.and.to refuse, it,in relationto another.

I - suppose-. that to'all aspects, of .taxation-; I foresee, all sorts-of ridiculous - claims being lodged - The rhonorable member for Indi. (Mr .MCEwen) knows - that.an .allowanceis - alreadymadefor the. depreciation, - and that expenditure-- on dog? of proof andrabbit-proof . fences! is also a. .of deduction;- Every one must .admit that some, oftheerosion has arisen from the carelessness, ofproperty-owners who have no over-stocked, particularly <- on lightlygr-assed areas -. Their ""bad husbandry has produced' the - state of - affairs .that we now proposes to assist them to remedy. That does notapply to all ' land-holders, of course;- but i many - of ' them . have been, guilty of over-stocking, and, thereby they have caused erosion. I know considerable stretches of country where the owners have got the last penny out of it, by over-stocking. dry period followed by heavy rains has then caused erosion that could have been avoided had owners not been guilty of bad farming. One sees fairly steep hillsides from which every true, has been cleared after ringbarking. That has invited erosion, because the soil has been left without protection. Even nuw one can see great stretches of country in which the trees have been ringharked before clearing. Of course, the owners will get a far better return for a while from their land, but the ultimate result will be erosion. Any fair man will agree that this concession is open to grave abuse. Our intention, is to assist people to overcome the troubles that they have brought upon themselves by their own bad management. I have been asked by the honourable member for Indi to examine the exemption from tax of money expended on the erection of fences to keep stock off areas prone to erosion. I cannot promise to give the honourable member's request favourable consideration, but it will be examined when the Income Tax Assessment Act is under review again.",39
79,Mr HAMILTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Swan) [3.11] - Soi l erosion has been dealt with considerably by other honourable members. I merely point out that regardless of the money expended and means of expenditure in the fight against soil erosion it should be receiving consideration from the tion Commissioner because of the serious nature of the problem, which is yearly becoming worse. I entirely agree with the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) that it is .difficult to police income tax concessions in respect of expenditure on measures to provide against soil erosion. I also know how difficult it is for local governments, State governments and even the Commonwealth Government to induce primary producers to adopt protective measures against soil erosion. The right honourable gentleman said that if consideration were given to desires pressed by honourable members difficulties of policing would .be increased, Mr CKLFI.EV - The way would he open for abuses.",40
80,Mr HAMILTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes , but the local governing bodies could, I think, act as agents for the Commonwealth GovernA ment in the policing of the scheme. It must be borne in mind that each district has its own problem. 1. suggest that any scheme for combating soil erosion that is acceptable to the local governing authorities should be acceptable to the Commonwealth Government. The local governing authorities could police the provisions and prevent abuses. Mr CiirKLEV - They arc very often interested parties themselves. The honourable member is conversant with the responsibilities of shire councils.",40
81,Mr HAMILTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes . but I remind the right honourable gentleman that the State governments and the Commonwealth Government are also interested parties, sometimes.",40
82,Mr CKIFLTSY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes , they provide the money.",40
83,Mr HAMILTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"My main reason for speaking is. to deal with allowable expenditure on the sinkiug of bores and wells. Men prospecting for water sonictimes employ water diviners and sometimes, at greater cost, geologists, but more often the ordinary farmer bores till he finds water. After having lost two or three drills, he may find water that is too salty for the stock. That is an unsuccessful bore. Honourable members may know the quantity of .salt that stock will take. Four or five bores may be sunk before suitable water is found. That costs money, but no allowance is Taxa- made for expenditure on unsuccessful bores. I know what it means, having had several unsuccessful attempts at boring for water myself. Provision ought to be made to cover expenditure on unsuccessful bores. Water is the greatest need in any farming community. Soil conservation is second. Speaking on the financial statement which the Treasurer presented to the House recently, I urged the right honourable gentleman to grant as an allowable deduction money expended in combating the encroachment of salt on properties. ex- The Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon) will confirm my statements on this subject. In parts of Western Australia and Victoria, the encroachment of salt presents a serious problem. Primary producers use various methods of combating it in order to maintain the prolific productivity of their farms, and the Government should give every assistance to the men who are fighting this battle, not only .for themselves, but also for posterity. Combating the encroachment of salt is a big task, and considerable sums of money are expended annually in this way. I should like to hear the Treasurer's opinion on this proposal, I . have written to him about the matter, but I have not yet received a reply, I should also like to hear his views regarding my suggestion that expenditure on unsuccessful bores should be an allowable deduction for income tax purposes.",40
84,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [ 3 . 1 6 ] - I in form the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) that under this provision, expenditure on unsuccessful bores will be an allowable deduction for income tax purposes. Several honourable members, including the honourable member for Swan, have urged that expenditure on combating the encroachment of salt on properties should also be an allowable deduction. This is a comparatively new problem.",41
85,Mr HAMILTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It is not a new blem for the farmers. Mr Chifley , - The Murray River irrigation area in South Australia has experienced the problem since 1927. In Western Australia, the encroachment of salt, has occurred in rather peculiar circumstances on the light lands, as the result of a wash-off apparently from the higher areas. The problem has also arisen in the Murrumbidgee area. I am not able to promise that the honourable member will receive an early reply to his letter, because 1 must examine all aspects of this matter. However, I shall reply to his communication as soon as possible.",41
86,Mr MCBRIDE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wakefield) [3.17] .! congratulate the Government on its decision to grant the concessions set out in proposed new paragraphs g. h and i of sub-section 1 of proposed new section 70 of the principal act. time, when we are looking forward to great developments in Australia, it is appropriate that the Government should encourage people who arc prepared to expend money on developing their properties. These concessions become even more important at the moment, because the heavy rates of tax which have been imposed for a number of years, have prevented land owners from saving money to pay for the development of their holdings. The decision to allow as a deduction money expended in combating - or preventing soil erosion or in constructing dams, bores and irrigation channels, on land used for primary production, will give definite encouragement not only to land-holders but also to those people who would like to settle on the land. In the long run, the Government will reap the benefits of these improvements to the land, because it will be an annual source of income which will be taxable for many years. I invite the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) to answer the request of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) for elucidation of the proposed concessions. I should like to know whether the concession, applicable to the construction of dams, bores, wells, underground tanks, irrigation channels or similar structural improvements, will be extended to piping. If it will not, the Treasurer pro- should give earnest consideration to the advisability of allowing expenditure on that kind of improvement as a deduction for income tax purposes. Once a person has expended a large sum of money in establishing a dam, well or bore, he may possibly use the water to better advantage by reticulating it to surrounding country than by sinking another bore or installing another tank. He might also reticulate country where he is not able to construct a dam or sink a well. This suggestion is worthy of careful consideration, because people to an increasing degree are making better use of existing Water supplies instead of providing additional ones. The Treasurer, if . I understood him correctly, is rather obsessed with the idea that the bulk of soil erosion in Australia has been deliberately caused by land holders. At this",41
87,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I said that it had been caused by careless land-holders.,41
88,Mr MCBRIDE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"When settlers originally came to Australia from the northern hemisphere, 'they - encountered an. entirely'different type of'country, and different .climatic ""Conditions ..from those to which 'they'ha'd boen'acGustonred.

Obviously, that is natural erosion. 'Now that we have acquired greater'knowledge of what erosion. - can be.done with different types of country, it is gratifying .to see that the lem of soil erosion has impressed itself upon the.public mind to-such a degree that the.government of the day is encourof-jmeasures aging primary producers to combat this definite menace. I am in entire accord with the .proposal. However, I agree piers with those honourable members who-stated that one of the methods of combating soil erosion is to fence the affected areas. that means, those lands will be reit""would generated. During the last ten or fifteen years, this Parliament has heavily subhe sidized settlers in the marginal areas. Therefore, this Parliament has a definite interest in combating erosion. One of tke best methods is to fence off the affected areas and prevent stock from intruding on them. I. am not'impressed by the obthousands jection voiced by the'Treasurer , that penditure on fencing for the purpose of - combating and .preventing soil erosion, would be difficult to.police. .All methods for combating soil erosion will be .diffiment, though '«not cult to police.

This would . mean, in broad terms, that it would take twenty years to recover the capital cost of the plant.",41
89,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It would never be possible to write it all off.,43
90,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is so; but I do not desire to go into fine decimal points. I remind the Treasurer that one assurance that the Government bas that there would be no abuse in this regard is that the farmers themselves have to pay for their irrigation plant. Land-owners should be encouraged to install plant and machinery, apart altogether from government installations of such plant and machinery.",43
91,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,There is no reference in this provision to machinery.,43
92,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I shall not pursue, that point, but I earnestly ask the Treasurer to provide, in a future amendment of the act, for a more liberal depreciation deduction.",43
93,Mr RYAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Flinders) £3.30]„- One of the most serious problems of the man on the land today is soil erosion. Every year millions o£ tons-of top soil are swept into the ocean, and so the earth's surface becomes denuded of itsbest growing quality.. This is true of the United States of America and also of Australia. All possible encouragementshould be given to land-owners to do everything, they canto counter the menace-. The amendment of section 75y which we are considering,, provides that expenditure incurred by a taxpayer engaged in. primary production' in('#) preventing or combating soil erosion on the land otherwise, than, by the erectioni of. fences, shall 'be an. allowable deduction. If by the erection of fences' soil erosion, may be minimized-, why should not the amount expended for that purpose's be deductible?En my experience, and I know also in the experience of other land-owners; the erection of fences of onei kind and another' is' most, valuable for: the prevention of soil erosion, in at least threeways:- The first wasmentioned by the honourable member forIndi. (Mr MCEwen)-,- when he referred to fences. which; would prevent animals; from entering on' the land. The' secondis' the erectioni of fences' a-round' 1 areas that havebeem planted'with suitable T811 crops in order to bind the surface of the land. The third is hy the erection of more solid fences, probably of timber, which would prevent stormwater from cutting gullies in certain areas. Why does the (Treasurer (Mr Chifley) baulk at allowing deductions in respect of sUch fences as these? I agree that there might be some possibility of an abuse of the provision, ""but seeing that committees are active in various parts of Victoria and, I daresay, in other States in relation to the prevention of soil erosion, their services could be invoked to ensure that abuses did not occur. Mr Oir.iiFi.EY -- I have already dealt with this subject, ",43
94,Mr RYAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"But not m the way that I desire it to be dealt with. I sincerely trust that the Treasurer will give the subject further consideration and not decide, in an off-hasid way, to reject the requests that are being' made.",43
95,Mr TURNBULL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wimmera); [133""]. Most honourable members who have addressed themselves to this subject; have referred to erosion by water, but innorthern Victoria, and"" also in many parts of South Australia, a great deal o;f soil erosion has occurred through wind. In some of those areas there are great; hills of sand as high as this building: Surely if the erection of fences would prevent erosion of that kind', an assertion with which 1 do not agree, & deduction should be allowable in respect of the dost. Does the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) really mean that all expenditure incurred in the prevention of soil erosion "" otherwise than by the' erection of fences"" shall' be an allowable deduction ?' I bring, to the notice"" of the right honourable gentleman the VaTue of the sowing of rye corn for this purpose. Rye corn, is growm in our northern a'reas as"" a means of countering soil' erosion with very good results, but,, generally Speaking it is not a payable crop. If a farmerplanted an area to rye corn, would he he permitted' to claim adeduction in. resp'ect of it'? The' iht'erttion. musthave; been ; to"" include'' the* sowing' of rye co""Kn,- other-wise' it would have been' speeificaHy' excluded.

Those"" who"" are"" tf-y> ing tocombat"" soil' ewsitm throughout* the northern parts of Victoria will agree, with that statement. I do not hold the view that fencing assists very greatly to combat soil erosion in northern are areas. Those who most need relief do by means of a deduction in respect of the cost of fencing have properties in areas in which soil erosion is considerI able, and causes their fences to become covered.",43
96,Mr SCULLY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That would be taken into account under the heading '""' repairs "".",44
97,Mr TURNBULE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The matter is not one of making repairs. The fences appear. I should like to take the President of the Executive Council (Mr. Scully) to parts of my electorate in which the fences may be 10 feet under the face of the sand. Many fences are only about 2 feet' high. It is on record that 7-ecently some men in a certain district spread the wire preparatory to erecting a fence and then went to their dinner. ""When they returned, they could not find the wire, because, during their absence, it had been covered by dust. The knowledge of soil erosion that is possessed hy many Government supporters is conproposals fined to the mud with which their cars become covered in the city after a and rain storm. - I have visited what a few years was a very productive farm, on which dairying operations were conducted. construction of a water channel through the property put an end to natural drainthe age, with the result that the salt is coming to the surface and nothing can be grown on it. Such a. condition of affairs can combated only by drainage. The unforof tunate farmer has to have the land specially drained, and that is very costly. I should like the Treasurer to state whether or not he is prepared to allow this cost to be a deduction from income. The problem is very serious, and I urge him to give the matter his kindliest sideration.",44
98,Mr HOWSE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"(Calare) [3.41] - I understood the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) to say that a reason for disallowing the that cbst of fencing which had been erected to combat soil erosion would be the difficulty of policing the matter. That is a sound reason. Nevertheless, the objection could be overcome through the instrumentality of officers of the State Departments of Agriculture, who do not belong to local governing bodies or committees. They the best type of public servant. 'They a remarkable job, by advising farmers , as to the best methods of dealing with soil erosion, and are completely unbiased. f they were to recommend the erection of fencing to cheek soil erosion, they could give a definite estimate of the probable cost, and when the work had been completed they could make certain that their recommendation had not been exceeded. I therefore ask the Treasurer to consider disan amendment to include the cost of Vicefencing authorized by such officers.",44
99,Mr THOMPSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Hindmarsh) [3.44] - I am pleased that some assistance is to surbe given in regard to soil erosion. In South Australia, an expert has been appointed to give advice on the subject, and quite a lot of work has been done - through the agency of State officers. Any action recommended, apart from the erection of fences, will be taken. Honourable members opposite have complained that the existing income tax return is complex, yet they are now submitting which, if given effect, would increase its complexity. The honourable dust, member for Calare (Mr Howse) has asked that the cost, of fencing erected on ago the recommendation of officers of State departments of agriculture should be The allowed as a deduction. That would necessitate a statutory declaration that fencing had been erected solely for the purpose of combating soil erosion. - There are some honourable members on be this side of the chamber whose knowledge soil erosion is fairly considerable. Many land-holders consider - that one of the best methods of preventing soil erosion is to subdivide their land into small paddocks, keeping the stock on one paddock and growing feed on the others. What would happen if the cost of fencing conwere allowed as a deduction? When a man went on to a big area, he could subdivide it and then claim that he had done so solely for the purpose of preventing soil erosion. It is well known subdivision considerably increases the carrying capacity of a property. The difficulty would be to prove that the subdivision had been carried out merely to prevent soil erosion, and not to increase the pi'o-ductive capacity of the land. Take a property which has a small sandhill in the centre. If stock were allowed to pass over that hill, the sand would gradually drift and there would be soil erosion which would embrace the surrounding area. If the owner of the property were to erect a fence around the sandhill, he could claim that he was preventing soil erosion, and that consequently he should be allowed to deduct the cost. Yet the probability would be that he had purchased the property ax a reduced price because of the existence of the sandhill in the middle of it. The only way in which to prevent soil erosion in many places is to subdivide the land and keep the stock off those portions of it fhat are likely to erode. I do not doubt that legitimate claims can be made that fencing has been erected for the purpose of combating soil erosion. If the cost of fencing were an allowable deduction, the person making the return would have to produce evidence which would satisfy the department that the fencing had been erected solely for the purpose of combating soil erosion, and this would add to the difficulties and complexities of the situation. The proposals of the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) will be of great assistance to those who want to take measures to combat soil erosion. I compliment the right honourable gentleman, and appreciate the difficulties with which he is confronted. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) has argued that allowance should be made in respect of all that is done to prevent soil erosion. I point out that the - object of erecting fencing is not solely to combat soil erosion; it is essential if farming generally is to prove successful. We on this side of the House appreciate what soil erosion, means, and the need to fight it. We also appreciate the difficulties that will be encountered unless some limitation is enforced in respect of fencing for the prevention of soil erosion.",44
100,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) be [3.51] - I move That, at the end of paragraph (B) of the clause, the following new paragraphs be added:"" (;) the case of areas of land planted timber trees deemed by a State Department of Forestry to be able to the growth of such trees an amount equal lo live per centum of the capital value of the laud upon which such trees are growing; and (A-) the case of land planted with olive or walnut or other trees of a variety approved by a State Department an amount equal to ten per centum of the capital value of the land on which such trees are growing tor - fifteen years from the 'planting of the trees: "". It"" that amendment be agreed to I intend r.o move that the following new subsection he inserted in section 75:(1A. ) Where planted forest trees have been sold there shall be allowable as a deduction from the total price realized for the trees a sum equal to three per centum for each year in which the trees were owned by the seller thereof; and The need to increase supplies of both softwoods and hardwoods in Australia is very urgent. In today's Adelaide Advertiser there is a two-column article on the production of timber in South Australia, and it is published at an opportune time. In that State it is proposed to produce from 60,000,000 to 75,000,000 super, feet of timber within three years, and 150,000,000 super, feet within nine years. This may seem a large quantity, but less than J per cent, of the total area of South Australia is under forest. Even in Western Australia, where there are large forest areas, only one acre out of-every 1S7 carries forest of a suitable kind. When we compare Australia's timber resources with those of such countries as Norway and Sweden, and the countries in the neighbourhood of the Carpathian mountains, we realise how much better off. those countries are than is Australia. I believe that the Commi-iwealth Government should do more to assist afforestation projects by private enterprise. Private land-owners should be encouraged to plant trees on country in suitable rainfall areas which is not pa.rticularlv suitable for grazing, hut which is suitable for the production of timber, and special taxation concessions should granted to them provided the trees planted are of a suitable type approved by State forestry authorities. In the Kuitpo area of South Australia, near Adelaide,- where the rainfall is satisfacwith tory, the forestry department, about 25 years ago, tried broadcasting the seeds suitof forest trees.' Nine different kinds of eu'caiypts and pines were left to grow under naturalconditions,, and it was found that certain varieties of pine and the spotted gums showed - the - most prolinegrowth. Our afforestation enterprises' are .'of ""two"" kinds, 'one for the production ofsoftwood,, and the other for the production of hardwoods-. In this country,, the softwoods are mostly of pines, which give a return in about 35 years . Thisp-rbcess is comparatively 1 1 simple' as e'ompared with the' growing of hardwood's, some 'of wfecli take over 100 years' t'o - mature. The 'Treasurer -(Mr. Chifley) may thin'kr that we are 'looking fa.t ahead,, but 'it should' be remembered that - Austra]>is is worse off* for timber : than almost any other part of the world, except perhapsthe Gobi and Sahara deserts,, the Pamirs and pairts of Tur-kistan. Every year,, timber is being used for more andmore industrial' purposes. Scientists are always devising - new ways for manufacturing plywoods, boards, - Professor Wood has published a: book on this - subject,, carrying, a foreword by ' Robinson,, so that it'ought to receive the approval - of, the Attorney-General (Dr. E v at t ) , at least. .. At page 163 of this book, Professor Wood writes-*'Important instances of the substitution, of Australian-grown timbers, for .previously im-p'orted mafe'ri'al in'clii'de scented satinWood for 'Aireh in aftrcraft plywood', and 'for walnut in r'ifle fnrcnitiire, 'hoop pine for 'Port'Oxford cedar in . battery separators, Queensland - maple - for maliqga'ny in aircraft propellers and boat: 'l/uiTdrhg, white birch arid, fadlata p'irie 'for kaftan in in a'tches, spo'tlte'd gum for 'Hickory 'in 1 axe - and 'hammer liaindles, ''silver - qunmdo'ng and hoop p'ine for spruce in spoon-bladed - oars, Queensland maple and scented satinwood'for G'a'boon mahogany rtri'd birch'in plywood'panels, ulid slfe-oak tirid niyrfte beech 'for maple ih 'boot lasts.

103,Mr RYAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,".Elinders)' [4.2] - I support: very warmly the amendment, moved by the. honourable member for Barker (Mir. Archie Cameron,), and I hope-that it will; receive'the serious-consideration-of the Government. We started off with, a country bearing valuable forests, but dining the last hundred years"" we have been despoiling-these forests-at a terrific rate, and not replantingthem. Forests have three main functions. The> first is closely connected with the subject which we have* just been discussing-erosion . The Treasurer (Mr Chifley)- must 1 realise the enormous amount of erosion which has taken.place-in various parts of 1 eastern' Australia;, including Gippsland ; w-herer-forestshavebeen', destroyed. Once the-teees are removedthe rain, washes' the soil off the hillsides: and downinto the rivers; thus causing; damage not! only: in the - immediate area'j buti also in-, other places'; remotefrom the.: highlandsthenr-r selvesa Eorestshave.' am effect* on. the watersupply,;, and in Australia we: are naturally.'short ofwater. In forest.areas, the:.water;which falls^as rain-is absorbed by the accumulated humuson. the. forest floor, and: only gradually seeps into: the waterways.. When the: forests', are destroyed;, the ., water; flows rapidly down 1 the-hillsides;- and makes its'way. along-the risers to' the sea, doing very little goodi to'- the' land"" owned by pasitoralists. or. agriculturists: Thethird function'of forests, is to provide-timber. 1 We are dependent for hardwood on. our own forest's, while for softwoods we' are dependent on imports from other countries. We' know to - our - cost the price which we have' to' pay for imported softwoods for. the.' construction of houses and for hundreds' of other purposes. There have been increases inth'e past in a num'1 berofsoftwood forests planted; but these increases' have not represented anything like whatv isi required. If we are to continue? the heavy use of timberwe shall have to fall backon our own resources, and' we will be able to dothat only bycarrying' out anintensivesystem o."" afforestation. F'ew governments-cer tainly not the. Commonwealth' Govern-r ment-hav e encouraged the conservation and' restoration of our forests, the planting of new forests or of new woods. It 1 is-mainly the responsibility of' the State governments to look after these matters, and' at last, they are beginning torealize the necessity for afforestation work. In Victoria, recently, an organization known as'the ""Save the forests"" organization; was formed with a membership spread over the whole of the State-. Amongst other things the organization issues - propaganda designed to teach the-people of Victoria the value of their forest's in the three senses^ B have described.' It also sends out to its members young trees ; and plants and endeavours to keepthe forests growing and replenished with young: seedlings:. The Commonwealth Government-has not'done anything in this direction. In proposing this' amendment 1 the honourable member for' Barker' has rendered the country a good service, and 1 I*, trust he has planted', in the mind of the Government a thought whichone daywill bear good-fruit. As the honourable member forBarker hassaid, consideration, must begivem to 1 the long' and shortrange aspects* of our forests policy. The long-range aspect - includes the replenishing of our forests, particularly our hardwood forests which have been seriously depleted and which in many cases cannot be restored to their former plenitude of wood for many years. The conservation and restoration of our forests should receive every encouragement from the Government. restoration of our hardwood forests is a problem which concerns, not only the State governments, but also private individuals. ""Within a short distance of my home, there are a number of plantations which have been developed during the last 30 or 40 years by private persons. These are mostly planted in Pim.us radiata and have done exceedingly well. Such plantations are of tremendous importance to. Australia. Although there are large areas of land not suitable for other than the growing of trees, little, or no encourcases agement is given to the people to develop them and grow timber to supply, our future needs. The suggestion of the - honourable member for Barker that money expended on the extension of our forests should be an allowable deduction for income tax purposes is very sound because such expenditure will not be reproductive for many years. Planting trees is not'an inexpensive process. Pirst, the land must be cleared, then the holes dug, then the trees bought and planted, and after all that has been done the trees must be looked after. When the timber is finally cut and marketed only then do the owners of these forests receive a' dividend on their investment of time and money. One man who in the last few years.cut a very large area, of Finns radiata was taxed by the , income tax authorities on the whole amount received for the timber, notwithstanding that it represented the accumulated value of trees planted over 35 years ago. The taxation authorities took the greater part of the revenue derived by this man from that source. That, is grossly unfair. A reasonable and realistic attitude should be adopted in connection with this matter. The proceeds of sales of timber from privately owned forests should be spread over a number of years for income tax purposes. I support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Barker and trust that the Government will give it serious consideration. Mr Ryan. - Mr FALKINDER (Franklin) [4.10]. - I strongly support the amendment pro 1 posed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). A great deal of the field has already been covered by the two previous speakers, but there is one matter to which I should like to refer, namely, the position of Australia in relaThe tion .to timber for case-making. The fruit industry particularly is dependent to a large extent upon imported timbers for the casing, of fruit for export. At present our hardwoods are . suitable for the making of clump and picking cases. We have used hardwood cases for exports in the past, but they have been found not entirely suitable for that purpose. At present we are dependent largely on Canada for the supply of pine woods for the making of fruit for the export crop. The amendment seeks to encourage the production of our own pine timbers and, at the same time, to reduce the cost of export cases byproducing the suitable timber in Australia. Canadian pine timbers sell at high prices, and many fruit exporters, not being able to afford Canadian pine for their cases, exported their fruit in hardwood cases to the detriment of good advertising for the Australian fruit-growing industry. In order to conserve our markets abroad our export fruit should arrive ar its destination in good condition and be marketed in the most attractive condition possible, but that is not always possible where hardwood cases are used. The amendment has a most desirable objective and accordingly I strongly support it.",47
104,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Darling Downs-Leade r of the Australian Country party) [4.12]. - I , too, support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), _ and I associate the Australian Country party wholeheartedly with it - Any one with a knowledge of Australian .timbers, particularly of the softwoods of northern Queensland, must realise that this amendment is not only timely but also desirable as a means of stepping up reafforestation and giving encouragement to the harvesting of the stands of timbers that are available. As the result of the war, the softwoods of northern Queensland, were rapidly cut down, to meet defence requirements, thus rendering future supplies doubtful. During the war our forests were rapidly denuded but, because of the shortage of man-power, it was impossible to carry out reafforestation schemes. Any one with even a meagre knowledge of. the timber industry knows that the heavy demands of the war detrimentally affected the future timber resources of this country. The forests of northern Queensland produce some of the beautiful and useful softwoods in the world. A sympathetic implementation of the principle of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Barker will provide a desirable fillip to the production of Australian timbers. I and members of my party tender our thanks to the honourable member for his far-sightedness in bringing forward his amendment.",48
105,Mr HOWSE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Calare) [ 4 . 1 5 ] port the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr . Archie Cameron), and in doing so I should like to raise one or two matters. We are all agreed that Australia is perately short of suitable timbers. Not only have we to replace timber wantonly wasted in the past, but, we must also increase the forest areas because timber is used for so many purposes. Australian supplies are now very low and accordtralian ingly we must utilize every possible means for increasing them, not ""only through State instrumentalities but also - by encouraging private persons to plant forests. In the big timber-producing countries of the world, Sweden, Canada and the United States of America, for every tree cut down two trees are planted in its place. The governments of those countries are full y alive to importance of replacing their stands of ensure the conservation of timber. timber. In Canada that policy has handsome dividends. In looking through an American magazine the other day saw an advertisement inserted by a firm of tree surgeons, indicating important trees are regarded in that country. These tree surgeons operate, on trees and advise growers as to the best methods of treatment and cultivation.",49
106,Mr BERNARD CORSER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wide Bay) |'4.J 7 ] - I support the amendment. shortage of timber in Australia is able and accordingly every assistance should be given to people to plant private forests, engage in the production of commercial woods, and to foster their timber resources, even though they obtain no return fro m their investment for many years. The amendment proposes to grant to such people some measure of assistance by relieving'them of some liability for income tax in respect of the proceeds of most the sale of their timber. All aspects of the timber industry, and of the tax levied on the sale of timber, should be thoroughly reviewed. The Treasurer will remember that some time ago I brought before him the case of a. ""man who sold over 30,000 super, feet of timber which had been growing on his property for t h i r t y years. This man was compelled to pay income tax on the whole of the proceeds of the sale, yet had he sold the timber as it stood in his paddock I suphe would not have been taxed on the proceeds. Surely that is an anomaly which should be rectified. The Treasurer will surely agree that in such circumstances no tax should have been levied. desI f the person concerned had held his timber until it matured and disposed of it as a job lot in his paddock he would have escaped a heavy load of tax. Timber growers should be relieved of income tax on this form of production. All Ausgovernments are concerned about Australia's timber resources. The Commonwealth Government has expended more than any other government, on reafforestation and on forestry research and the instruction of scientists and forestry officers. The assistance advocated in the proposal of the honourable member, for Barker would be a small addition to what the Commonwealth Government has the already done in the national interest, to I paid hope the Treasurer will accept the amendment in order that there may be 1an added inducement to people to hold timber until it has matured to the cutting how stage for the nation's benefit.",49
107,Mr MCBRIDE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wakefield) [4.22] I. support the amendment moved by, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). I am confident that, knowA ing the scarcity of timber in Australia, inevitthe Government will do everything possible to encourage tke planting of trees for .the production of timber/.w.hich is not only a long-term project, but.also involves considerable rishs. A person might grow trees almost to maturity and then lose them in a. forest fire. The Commonwealth Government is aware of that risk because only a few years ago a fire swept through and destroyed thousands of pines it had planted above the Cotter clam in the Australian Capital Territory. It i is unreasonable to expect private people to engage in this form .of production on any scale without reasonable .assistance, because it is not only expensive but also risky. I am sure that mowing to our desperate need .for timber anything that the Government does in the way advocated by the honourable member for Barker will give a return-to the nation.",49
108,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) (4.27=] - The Government cannot accept - the - amendment of the honor n'Me'in ember for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron); but some of the aspects raised by him'.will be examined. We do not propose to alter the act proposed by him. There are many arguments against doing so; but I will not weary the committee with them jnow. Forestry work is more and more devolving upon the governments - of .Australia. Very little reafforestation is done by timber-getters, .unless they are compelled to do it.",50

I accept the challenge spectacularly offered last night by the: Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman),; but. I desire no. mistake about, the circumstances and conditions.

State, taxes, including: the dividend tax, amounted to £11 4S. Sd. per. capita -. In. 1.942-43, the first year, of uniform income taxation, the amount increased to £20 13si 2d. In . 1943-44,. it further increased, to £25 9sl i d . , and in 1945-46. to £29 Is. per capita. If I desired to quibble-and , this submission is quite within the bounds of the challenge-at is obvious that the taxpayers of Australia are not better off under the rebate system compared with their position before the introduction of uniform taxation. That is conclusively proved by the facts.",51
114,Mr DEDJIAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The Leader of the Australian Country party is twisting my statement.,52
115,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am not taking advantage of the Minister, or twisting his statement. He was guilty of most dishonest advocacy in this House last night. He asked the people to believe that the basis of his comparison - was a true one, and he invited me to accept a challenge on a basis which he knew was absolutely wrong and impossible, having regard to the way in which he presented it. His offer was like that of Sir Harry Lauder who agreed to pay £1,000 to the widow of the Unknown Soldier. The Minister asked me to accept the challenge on his figures that the system of rebate-£150-whic h nrevails today is comparable with his, deduction basis of £50. He presented a table, calculating a deduction prior to the introduction of uniform income taxation on the basis of £50 for a dependent', wife, and he made an unfair and dishonest comparison with the proposed rebate system of £150 for a wife. However, I shall use his own figures, and make comparisons which should be true and acceptable to a reasonable man. I apply the rebate of £150 and the deduction of £150 to the figures which he presented. ""What do I find ? Under the rebate system, a man in receipt of £250 a year would pay £3 7s. in tax, and under the deduction system he would not pay any tax. Therefore, there is an advantage of £3 7s. in that instance. A man in receipt of £300 a year would pay under the rebate system £11 2s. and under the deduction system£5, so that the advantage in favour of the deduction system is £6 2s. A man in Teceipt of £350 would pay £21 under the rebate system, and £10 16s. under the deduction ' system-a n advantage in favour of the deduction system of £10 4s. A man receiving £400 per annum would pay under the rebate system a levy of £30 6s. and under the deduction system £18 14s., the difference in favour of the deduction system being £11 12s. On an income of £500,. the tax under the rebate system would be £50 6s. and under the deduction system £38, so that the advantage in favour of the deduction system would be £12 6s., The Minister, in asking me to accept a basis of comparison of only £50' under the deduction system, and £150 under the rebate system, was most unfair. However, I shall use some of his own ammunition, and regard the deduction as £100 as against a rebate of £150. What do I find? On an income of £250, under the rebate system, a taxpayer with a dependent wife would, pay £3 14s. and under the deduction system £5, which is a variation against the deduction system of £l-6s.",52
116,Mr CHIIXEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Will the right honourable gentleman repeat those hypothetical figures ?,52
117,Mr DEDMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,They are completely hypothetical.,52
118,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Of course, the figures which the Minister presented to the House were not hypothetical! He is a greater comedian than Sir Harry Lauder was, and he is not paidhalf as much.",52
119,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I am nottaking part in the fight. I am only seeking information.,52
120,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The Treasurer will obtain all the necessary information if he will agree to the incorporation of my tables in Hansard. I am applying a deduction of £100 and a rebate of £150. The advantages in favour of the deduction system in these circumstances are: on an ""income of £300, 4s.; £350, £2 6s.; £400, £2 6s. and £500, £1 14s. However, I shall discard that, and use the basis which the Minister used, having particular regard to the wording of his statement. I ask honourable members to follow this very carefully. He said - 1 The levy payable under the deduction system has been calculated in accordance with the law as it applied to assessments for the financial year 1941-42. It does no such thing.",52
121,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT, Order ! The right honourable gentleman's time has expired.,52
122,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"As no other honourable member has risen in his place, I shall take my second period now. The Minister used only a part of the law. He used the law as it is applicable to the allowances for a wif e and child. Under the deduction system, before the introduction of the uniform income tax, there was a special deduction that the Minister or his advisers, either inadvertently or wilfully, overlooked. I refer to section 81 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which provided what it described as an ""allowable deduction"" to any person, other than a company, of £200, less £1 for every £1 by which the income exceeded £200. This section was' repealed when the uniform income tax was introduced. However, that is a deduction under the law as it applied before the introduction of uniform income taxation. It was a deduction that, the Minister, if he had been an honest advocate, would have included in his calculations. Therefore, on the basis of that consideration and the facts it behoves the Minister to pay £100 to a .charitable institution, and I nominate it .",53
123,Mr DEBJUAX,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The right honourable gentleman is not, to be the judge of this matter. Does he propose to nominate an arbitrator?",53
124,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I shall nominate the c 11: i r it a hi e institution. Mr ABCHTE OA.MBUO.N - I order. I should like to know whether the Minister is entitled to lose his temper as well as his money.,53
125,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT, That is not a point of order.,53
126,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I suggest that the Minister should pay £100 to the Scottish primary schools in order to encourage a proper utilization of the simple arithmetical tables. Hi s logic is as odd as an elongated Eskimo in kilts. He asked me to foolishly accept a challenge on the basis of a deduction of .£50, compared with a rebate of £.1.50 in his favour. he was only displaying his shrewd Scottish caution, but I refuse to f all for that. In - addition, I remind the Minister that 1I have not, taken the full advantage that I could take of his suggestion because he statedThe levy .payable under the deduction system has been calculated in accordance with the law as it applied to assessments for the financial year 1041-42. Under the law! I remind the Minister and his advisers that the Commonwealth income tax law was not the only law that operated up to 1941-42. He has used only a part of the Commonwealth law. He neglected the State income tax laws that allowed deductions and statutory exemptions. If I wanted to take that point, I could do so, and where would he be? He spectacularly and blatantly threw out his chest, and issued a challenge to me. It behoves him now to pay £100 to a charitable institution. I emphasize that the Minister stated that the levy was computed in accordance with the law as to deductions as they operated before 1943. when the uniform income tax took effect. T shall give him the advantage of applying only the provisions of the Commonwealth income tax law to the deducshall tion system. The Commonwealth law provided a deduction of £50 for a dependent wife, £50 for the first child, and a speciaf deduction to any person other than a company, the sum of £200, less £1 for every £1 by which the income exceeded £200. The honourable gentleman must not take half the argument. He cannot say - "" I . shall take a. deduction of £50 and nnnly it "" , particularly as he applied rise to £150 to support his own case, and allowed me only £50. He cannot ignore the statutory allowances, namely, the deduction of £200 on a reducing scale. Let us apply the provisions of the Commonwealth income tax law to the exact terms of the challenge, and I shall show where he has failed. He declared that in respect of all incomes up to £500 per annum, a taxpayer is much better off under the rebate system than under the deduction system. If I prove that in one case the. deduction law was. more beneficial, the Minister must lose his challenge according to the terms in which he issued it . Now, a taxpayer in receipt of £350 a year, No doubt with a dependent wife, would pay under the rebate system, according to the table which the Minister incorporated in Hansard/, an amount of .£21. He then applied , his .own version of the law .relating to deductions prior-to - thejintroduetion of uniform .income taxation. In fact, ihe took only part of the Commonwealth income tax law, providing for a deduction of £50 in respect of the wife. He subtracted ;'£50 from the income of ;£350, leaving ;£30O, looked at'.therrates.proposed for 1947-4S for .an .income -.of £300 per annum, - and discovered that the .tax would be £28. Therefore, :he gave as his view that under the rebate system, a. tax of £21 is better than the deduction 'system, involving, a tax of .£28 on a comparable in come of £350. Unfortunately for the Minister, lie overlooked some allowable deductions which operated before the in troduction of the uniform income tax. Under section 81 of the-Commonwealth Income Tax Assessment Act, .which was the law-and-the Minister referred ito tie law-the-.su m - of -£100, which was the allowable .deduction, must also be taken into account. That leaves an-amount .of £200. Applying the Minister's own formula, T find that the proposed levy on the 0.947-48 rates ^wouI.d 'be:£10 l;7s. under the .deduction system,-or-£10 3s. 'less than he would have to pay 'under the present rebate system.on a comparable income of £350. j - do not consider .that there is any necessity for me-to .cite further instances. The Minister either wilfully misled 'this committee, as !he ;accused .the honourable member .foiReid i.(' Mr .Lang) last night of .having id one, or'ignorantly stated'what he believed to .be the facts. Whatever the the explanation, the is 'a dangerous man for the Government to isend :abroad ,to represent Australia atian important international conference. £Btr. THOMPSON (Hindmarsh)) lH.SQi\. - When the Header .of the Australian Country party .(Mr lEadden) spoke 'on this subject a few .days - ago, ;before the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) issued the challenge, I told '.him .that .he was using, figures unfairly.

""IThe right honourable gentleman/jinidealing .with this matter previously, - inadvertently referred to men twith an income of .£300 instead of ;'£35!0.

131,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I again ask the honourable member for Richmond to confine his remarks to the clause before the Chair.,56
132,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The subject is concessional deductions in respect of which a challenge was issued by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction.

133,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.0] - I am hopeful that honourable members will be ready, at once, to return to a consideration of the clause. I wish to refer briefly to the remarks of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) regarding taxation in Canada. I said last night, when l dealt with this subject, that it was not possible to give satisfactory comparable, figures for Canada, such, as had been asked for by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt), because the taxation system of Canada, like that of the United States of America, was not properly comparable with"" the Australian system. In both America and Canada the State and provincial governments levy taxes which they collect altogether apart from the collections made by the Federal Government and there is no satisfactory way of obtaining full information in respect of the total of 'both the State and provincial and federal taxes. In response to requests""! gave to honourable members comparable figures in relation to the United Kingdom. New Zealand, and Australia.",56
134,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Were the currencies also comparable ?,56
135,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The figures were all given in comparable currencies. In each of the three countries all the taxes were - levied by the Central Government.,56
136,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Was account taken of the compulsory savings in the United Kingdom?,56
137,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No ; but allowance was made for the national insurance contribution in the United Kingdom, and .for the contributory social service tax of New Zealand. The systems of taxation in the three countries are properly comparable. I assume that the figures cited by the honourable member for Richmond referred only to the federal tax imposed by the Canadian' Government. In regard to local government taxes, I gave figures last night which I believe were clear, although they were not given in the form of a schedule. I said that, in Australia, indirect taxes, including local government taxes, amounted to approximately £23 per capita, and that, the comparable impost in New Zealand was £27 10s. per capita, and in .the United Kingdom £42 per capita, including borough taxes. 1 did not give the committee the figures with any intention to deceive anybody. I-did not. give the Canadian or American figures because the systems there are different, in that, as I have said, both the federal, provincial and State governments levy taxes. The comparisons that I made related to three countries in which, the whole of the taxes were' levied by the central governments and could not be - disputed.",56
138,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Fawkner) [5.5] - I had another matter to raise on this clause, but deferred dealing with it until honourable members hod dealt with other matters which preceded it. I shall comment first on what the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) has just told the committee about the comparative rates of income tax in this and certain other countries in respect of which he has supplied figures. My comments will be brief, because I believe that most honourable members are familiar with the arguments that have been advanced. My first comment is that the Treasurer has supplied details in respect of three countries which have Labour-Socialist governments. It is natural to expect that a very considerable proportion of the expenditure in those countries will be governmental expenditure. ' I believe that the people of Australia will be interested to learn what the proportion would be likely to be in countries in which private enterprise is the system favoured by the Government; for example, in the United States of America, in Canada-to which reference has - just been made-in South Africa, and in many other countries. I understand that even in France the rates are very much lower than they are in Australia. If we are to have a balanced picture of what is a reasonable quantum of tax for a government to take from the national income in order to provide those essential services to which so much reference has. been made-protectio n by way of security, the provision of social services and of essential utilities, and matters of that kind-w c must look to what is happening in other countries which we believe possess a comparable degree of civilization and a standard of living which, broadly speaking, is similar to ours. We shall not obtain such a picture from a study of the figures in relation to three Labour-Socialist governments. The United States of America consistently pursued, right up to the war years, the policy of comparatively low taxation, yet it has been able to give to its people the highest standardof living, generally speaking, that is known to the world. If the Treasurer wants to convince the people that, having regard to the responsibilities of government today, our taxes are no greater than they should be, he should place before them a balanced picture which would show what is occurring in those other countries to which I have referred. My second comment is that, even if we' narrow our examination to the figures which the Treasurer has presented to us, his argument cannot be sustained; because, in order to make his case he has had to include social services contributions in Great Britain and New Zealand. Of course, the figures in relation to those services in Australia also have been included. But the right honourable gentleman has ignored the fundamental point that if a man with a substantial income in the United Kingdom or New Zealand contributes to the scheme of social services .in either of those countries, he becomes entitled by reason of 'those Contributions to the benefits which the scheme provides. But that is not the position in .Australia, where the so-called .social services contribution is, in point of fact, a direct tax, from which no benefits can be obtained unless a means test can be satisfied. Only a small proportion of the people of Australia - I believe that I saw it estimated some time ago at about one-third of the population-woul d ever become entitled to the benefits for which contributions are made at the present time. Mr CHI:B\LEY - Sixt y per cent, is means-test-free now.",56
139,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The social services contributions in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, countries which the Treasurer has used to bolster up his case, can lightly he claimed to be social services contributions, because they confer benfits as a right. In Australia, on the contrary, the social services contribution is a tax, from which some may not benefit in the future. The Treasurer has said by way of interjection that 60 per cent, of the people who make this contribution will be entitled to the benefits of the scheme.",57
140,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"What I said was that 60 per cent, of the benefits are free from the means test.",57
141,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The figure that I have been given is very much lower than that. But even if we accept that figure, 40 per cent, of those who are.now making what - is called a social services contribution will never receive any benefit. I invite the Treasurer to examine the matter further. Let him ascertain how many of those who today are making the social services contribution will, in the ordinary course of events, if the law as it now stands remains unchanged, become entitled to social service benefits with the present means test provisions operating. I come now to the third test that I apply. I ignore indirect taxes so far as the detailed figures are concerned. The test which can be applied in order to determine whether the Government is taking more than a reasonable proportion for governmental expenditure is that proportion of the total national income which is. flowing throng-h, governmental hands. I invite the Treasurerto produce figures : which will provethat in the United. dom and.. New Zealand an amount equivato lent to approximately one-third of total, national, income is devoted vernmental purposes as_ is the case this country, in Australia, notwitha. standing the alleged, remissions toes, thequantum, of. taxes, collected volving heavy expenditure.. today is. in excess of that collected the years of the war,, when our war. penditurewas at its peak. Can the sure!! claim, that in the United Kingdom or Newt Zealand approximately one-third of the national income is devoted to, vernmental expenditures-? I aon certain that he cannot produce such figuresin respect, of Canada, the United States America, or South Africa.. Mr CHimBY, - I shall have informawith tion prepared) for the honourable, member. Mr HOiLT - Perhaps , we shall then be able to exchange challenges. The other matter which arises on clause relates to rebates for medical similar expenditure. I understand that some liberalization of the present condifortuneof tions is proposed'. But I again raise the committee the removal' of the limit of the amount which may be claimed by way of reba te where such expenditures have been properly incurred for medical, dental and similar services. We have pointed out in the past that those persons who have the most serious illnesses, and consequently the heaviest expenditure, ceive proportionately the lightest relief. If the expenditure of one-year amountsregard 1 to £50} the taxpayer receives a rebate the total sum. But if one has undergone one or more major operations, involving a long period of. hospital treatment, at cost of £100-or more, one can obtain a bate in respect of only £50'of that amount. With income tax at the existing high rates, the seriousillness of any member of a family, particularly one in the fields, middle ranges of income, can be a disaster to the whole family. If proper medical treatment has to be given after operations have been performed, the charge for hospital care is high. Many persons in the middle ranges of income, from £500 to £1,000 a year and even reflect higher, have experienced the unhappy fate that one or more of the. mem-bers, of their families has had a serious, illness Kingin theone year and they have been; unable meet the expenses incurred.. No. one the would seriously suggest that any person to goincursheavy medical expensesvoluntain rily; that, becausea rebate is given, person would prolong, an, illness of or undergo, a major operation inHardduring ship exists,, and it willcontinue to exexist as. long, as the present provision ret Treamains, unaltered. If the Government were returning to our. citizens in the middle ranges of income a higher proporgotion, of their total, incomes, insteadof takingfrom them-, as much, as it does by way ofincome tax, it would, not be necesof sary to press this point.; but thelegislation having become not merely ar taxing Instrument but also a social' document; all sorts of provisions, to. meet, the ' anomalies that arise, pressureof the point is necessaa-y. I know of no* objection, in principle to the proposal that I havemade. The cost to; the revenue this would be very small, and advantages and would accrue to. those persons who. have nob merely to> undergo the pain and misa. serious illness or operation; with but alsoto shoulder the very heavyexpensesthat are associated' with it.",57
142,Mr BURKE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Perth) [5.18] - I have considered for a long time that the politics of this country in respect of income tax have become badly out of proportion. Elections may well be fought on reprinciples of taxation or the expenditure of tax proceeds, but a bald statement ih to a reduction of rates is a fatal on ground on which, to stage an electoral battle. From time to time, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt.) has a compared the tax laws of Australia with rethose of other countries, and has sought to show that Australia is the most heavily taxed country in the world. As he has been challenged and defeated in those he has regularly shifted his ground"", until today he has resorted toa comparison of countries that are not comparable. Having been shown, on perfectly legitimate grounds, that, the tax systems of the principal British countries which axe somewhat alike incharacter in favour of this.' country,, he has. sought to compare Australia, with the United States of America and the Dominion of. Canada, in which the conditions are such as to - allow of no comparison. In the United States of America, there is a direct income tax which. is fairly new in character. It was not possible of implementation until the American Constitution had amended. There are other taxesj such as the federal income tax, the State taxes and the city tax, which are so - diverse in character that they cannot be compared with income tax in Australia. They have all the ordinary taxes as we know them, and, in addition, other complicated and onerous, taxes,-, such as the general property tax, which are unknown in this country.' The honourable' member introduced this discussion to save face, but it has not strengthened his. argument, and certainly he-has not proved that people in Australia are more heavily taxed than people elsewhere. Asa matter of. fact, taxation systems in the United States of America are very much more complicated: than ours. In the House of Representatives, in the United States of America, a motion was tabled recently de.nianding the introduction of a more simple system of taxation, just as the honourable member suggested here, but it was. done with more reason in the. United States of America. We come back, therefore, to the question whether the Government istaking from the community mora in taxes than is necessary. In order to decide this, point, we, should amine, not the total national income, nor even.the quantum-to use the word which he loves so much-of revenue collected by the Government, but the incidence of taxation on each, individual, having regard to his family responsibilities. We should then examine how revenue is expended. I believe that if. this is done, every honourable member will, be forced.to agree that present government expenditure is. fully justified. No one will suggest that existing social services are undesirable or unnecessary. In fact, they make possible a greater revenue return, because they represent latent, purchasing power in the hands of the community. So far. as taxation, is concerned, Australia, cannot be compared, in all particulars, with any other country, but conditions here probably resemble more, closelythose in the. United Kingdom and in New Zeal and; The position in. South Africa'is different, because there the. economy of the country is dependent so largelyupon mining,.and. much of the national revenue is derived from that source. An.examinaT tion of - the figures shows that in Australia been taxpayers, in the lower and middle income ranges pay less per head tOrday than they did. before the war in both Commonwealth and State taxes. This is true,, despite the fact that very heavy expenditure was incurred for war purposes, and that social service benefits have been increased. Mr HOT..T - Does - the honourable member include indirect taxation when he makes, that statement? Mr BURKE;-No , that, is something completely different. L referto income tax assuch. If the honourable member wishes to include indirect taxation we might.have a profitable discussion on that; also.. The honourable member for Eawk? ner,. when a. Minister, introduced, some valuable social services . and that, is 5 tohiscredit,, but, they were financed by a. pay-roll tax, something, which is completely, bad in principle, because among other faults it. penalizes^ the good employer of labour. The employer who pays the minimum, wage to his-employeesis required to pay. lesstaxthan the employer who treats his workers-well. During 1 the life of. the last Earliament the honourable member, I believe, suggested that ex- the pay-roll tax should beincreased in order to endow the first child under the child endowment scheme. As I'have said, those in, the lower and middle income groups pay less income tax now than they did before the war. If Ave ""accept the challenge of honourable members opposite, and separate social service contributions from income tax proper, the position in. regard to income tax, so far as the bulk of the population is concerned, is found to be. still morefavorable. Honourable members opposite have repeatedly stated that any social services system should be contributory. We can fairly claim that this Government has granted greater exemptions than has any previous government.",58
143,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,But the overall taxation is a great deal higher.,59
144,Mr BURKE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That ; does not enterinto the matter. There are more people in employment today so that, although most of them individually are paying less than they used to, the total revenue is greater. There is nothing extraordinary in that. Before the war, 500,000' men and women were out of work. Had they all been in employment, the total revenue collected would have been much greater. The real question is, how much tax does each citizen have to pay, and how does it affect his domestic budget? I maintain that, haying regard to its heavy commitments, and the expanded social services, this Government has done a remarkable job in reducing taxes by as much as has been done. We frankly admit that, on the higher incomes, taxation is greater than ever before. If those in receipt of high incomes were not taxed so heavily, they would make a greater demand on the limited quantity of commodities at present available. They would, of course, also stimulate the demand for luxury goods, something which should be encouraged only when the supply of basic goods is assured. By improving social services, we fulfil a social need, and by increasing the general purchasing power of the community we also stimulate business. Every person whose pension has been increased from 21s. to £2 a week is able to buy more basic goods than he could before. This must necessarily stimulate industry, and this, in turn, will increase the national revenue. At the present time, when government expenditure is high, we believe that taxes should be imposed first on those who suffer least by it, and social services sbould be provided for those who need them most, and who, by spending the money in their possession, will most benefit the community. I maintain that the Government's approach to this matter has been eminently sensible and practical. The whole problem must be examined carefully in order to discover by how much taxation can properly be reduced. To talk about the national income, and the total volume of taxation returns, without considering the ordinary financial requirements of the Government, and the nation's commitments in the way of social services, is to show a lack of appreciation of the fundamental issues involved. Mr Burke. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [5.30]. - Las t night, I directed the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) to certain matters in the hope that he would give consideration to a suggestion which I then put forward. However, as I have received from him no intimation that he proposes to do anything about it, I have prepared an amendment which, I think, will meet the situation. At any rate, it .should provide the Treasurer with a basis for a further examination of the position. I move That, after paragraph (h) of the clause the following new paragraph be inserted:"" (ha) by inserting after the first proviso of that paragraph the following further proviso:-'Provide d further that, in the case of a female taxpayer whoso rate of remuneration is lower than that of a male taxpayer performing similar work, the rebate oE tax allowed under this paragraph shall be equal to the rebate ivhich would be allowable had her rate of remuneration hceii the same as that of the male taxpayer: ' : "". As I intimated last night, women are limited, at least in the field of industry, to the earning of only a fixed proportion of the male rate of pay. Gf course, the reason for this provision lies in the assumption that the male is the breadwinner for the family, and that on him devolves the responsibility for their sustenance. , Unhappily, it is true that in many instances the mother of a family, through widowhood or because of desertion, becomes the sole support of her children. I wish to point out how great are her difficulties in those circumstances, and under the further economic difficulty which she has to face under our present system. All my life I have wondered why the Holy Scriptures paid such attention to the widows of the community; but - having myself become a widow, 1 realise, as perhaps many others cannot who have not passed through that experience, the great difficulties encountered by any woman who has to make provision, either through the acceptance of a widow's pension, or by her own efforts, for the material welfare of her children; who must give them the guidance which she would normally be required to give as a mother, and in addition that guidance which the father would normally .give; and who must give them that physical care necessary for their full development. Last night I cited the case of a. Penvale school teacher, who is paid less than a male tea cher similarly classified in the department, who pointed out that if the male officer were married and had two dependants' he would be in a position similar to her own in that she is a widow supporting two children. A man with two dependants normally would support a - wife and one child and would, therefore, get a greater tax concession than the woman supporting two children. Yet, under our law, she is not permitted to receive the same remuneration as the man.. Not only has the married male teacher, or a person similarly circumstanced in another occupation, anadvantage by way of income tax concession, he also enjoys the further advantage that one of his two dependants' provides certain services in his home for which the woman either must pay some one else nimust herself exert a tremendous effort in addition to keeping on the work she has to do. That, of course, presents a great difficulty to her. I suggest that it is well within the capability of the Treasurer to meet this situation, partly, at any rate, through the income tax legislation. I know perfectly well all the demands that are made upon-the right honourable gentleman to meet this, that, o:- the other situation; but, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) in connection with concessions relating to medical expenses, the sum total of a concession such as this' should not be very great. To each individual concerned, however, it would represent quite a considerable amount. After all, if this woman were to relinquish her employment and accept instead the widow's pension, as would be her normal right, the charge upon the Treasury would be very much greater than the granting of such a concession as I have suggested. I commend the case to the Treasurer, and hope that he will give it his earnest attention. I believe it will' at least have his sympathetic consideration.",59
145,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.38] - I have already given some consideration to the matter raised by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) since she spoke about it last night. I regret to say that her proposal is impracticable. The rates fixed must have general application. If special rates were fixed for. widows with dependants it would becomt* necessary to fix similar rates for widowers with dependants. I regret that I am unable to accept the honourable member's suggestion. When I looked at it last night I was amazed that she should, think that I was likely to accept it.",61
146,Dame ENID LYONS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Will the right honourable gentleman consider granting concessions to such widows?,61
147,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is a different matter. I regret that I am unable to do what the honourable member wishes.,61
148,Mr RYAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Flinders) [5.40] - The clause with which the committee is now dealing is designed to effect certain amendments of the rebate system, particularly as applied under section 160 of the principal act. In general, I agree with the Treasurer (Mr Chifley)- that the clause effects some desirable improvements; but there is one further amendment which also has relation to section 160 of the act which the Government might well have considered. I refer to rebates on gifts made for the relief of our kinsmen in Great Britain. To-day the people of Great Britain are in distress and a number of public institutions' and organizations in this country are doing their best to obtain funds to relieve that distress. One of these institutions, the Australian Red Cross Society, is placed at an advantage by comparison with others in that gifts made to the society are subject to rebate of tax under section 160. Donations made to the fund conducted by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne and to other funds established for similar purpose are not subject to rebates. Some time ago, I raised in the Parliament the question of admitting such gifts to the income tax concessions group, and on the 30th April last the Treasurer sent me a letter which reads, inter aliaAs you arc aware, there is no'provision in the law under which the desired concession may be provided. An amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act, involving an extension for the 'concessional allowances for gifts, would., therefore, be necessary to enable the concession to be granted. It is impracticable for the Government to adopt this course, however, owing to the serious difficulties which stand in the way. The right honourable .gentleman then proceeded to. enumerate ihe difficulties. It is on this particular point that I should'like to make a few observations. The letter continues.Foremost among these difficulties is the fact that the provision of the concession would involve the ..departure ""from .a long established principle 'of .taxation. This principle is that, to the extent that concessions are provided for gifts, they should he restricted to - gifts for application tto specified 'public 'purposes within Australia. The desirability .of strict adherence to this principle is evidenced, firstly, by the ff act that the piiinciple has .been observed by successive .governments in .Australia irrespective of .their political views, .and, secondly, by the fact that no other country, as far as I am aware, iprovides income tax concessions in respect of gift* .for application outside the country concerned. What taxation principle is invdlved'? - Surely it is merely a question of the opinion of the government concerned .as to whether taxes .should he applied for purposes wifh'in or without 'the country. There are many cases in which taxes applied in 'this country are utilized abroad. Our contributions to Unrra - represent .a case in point. There is no hard .and fast principle in this - matter. We aie dealing Tw'ith a situation today which las never 'previously arisen in the history of Australia. It is mot as .though we were contemplating - sending money to - a foreign country devastated 'by an earthquake, a famine, or by warfare 'or some - ofher calamity, to a country which has ""no direct relation to ourselves, either materially or of *blood. ""We are sending help to a .country 'to - which we owe - our very :secur""ity and .a great deal of our prosperity. I 'ask 'the Treasurer why, in this - case, 'he --will not consent - to an amendment, to meet this extraordinary situation 'which exists today and winch may continue to exist for some months to come. T see no difficulty in the way - of 'principle. It is apparent that the 'Government has decided that it does not want to accept my suggestion and .that it is'resolved not to do:so. What I ask Tvould not involve very .much.; the Government-would not lose a large sum'of money i'f my proposal were agreed to. The .greater proportion of these .gifts .is contributed by individuals in the .community and the - amount of tax due in respect of the gifts would represent probably only a small proportion of the tax Mr Ryan. imposed* - on their iiidicvidual (incomes. Further, the acceptance of - my-suggestion would - encourage donors to increase their contributions to this wonthy cause. I vf'eel sure fthat my proposal has 'the support, not only of members - on this side of the chamber; hut also of many honourable' members opposite. I trust that before very long the ^Government will .review its decision .and .grant this small iailleviation of tax. Amendment negatived.",61
149,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Richmond) |[5.4-7] I .should like .an - opportunity to :reply to certain statements made by the Treasurer .(Mr Chifley.) and other honourable members. I do not suggest that in presenting his comparative .statement of the taxes levied in Australia, New /Zealand .and the - United Kingr dom, ithe Treasurer intended to mislead the committee.; but I do. .say that the right honourable - gentleman did not give the whole - iacts - which were available. In my earlier .remarks I traversed what had been ;done in the m atter of tax reductions by the Canadian - Finance Minister, Mr. Abbott, only as recently .as the 30th April last. In making his comparison between the differing . taxes imposed ""in Australia, New Zealand ,and the iTJnited Kingdom, the Treasurer sought to .show that the Australian taxpayers enjoyed an v advantage over those in'.New - Zealand and the United .Kingdom.

150,Mr CHTFL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"EY - Did the Canadian Finance ""Minister make any reference 'to taxes .imposed b.y 'the 'provincial governments'?",62
151,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes . The Trearelating surer charged - me with having submitted an unfair argument. I 'limited .my comgovernments parison to 'the rates applicable in 'the United - Kingdom 'and Australia because those .two countries have an identical system of taxation, neither consider taxes imposed by provincial govenjments. It was ""a levy by the centhe tral government on all the taxpayers. The Prime Minister said in reply to argument, "" You cannot say that of Canada and, therefore, you cannot make a hasis of .comparison "", but I point out touch upon that the Minister for .Finance in 'Canada saidIf six of the provinces are included in .the uniform taxation scheme and if the three maining provinces - entered - into - the 'tax ments effective ""this - year federal expenditures Treasurer. would be increased by £33;840,'1'53. Six of the provinces - are Included in this over-all tax, and if the remaining three were included, it would increase 'the central government's expenditure by about £33,00q,000. I point' out to the Treasurer that the surplus budgeted .for 'by the Canadian Minister for' Finance on 1 the basis of the reduced taxation is £58.,000,00Q. 'If-allowance is made for the other three provinces :on the 'basis of a uniform 'tax, the surplus is about £25 000,00.0. That .is the answer to the J statement that Australian income tax is comparatively low.

165,Mr BOWDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That does not matter. It can be brought to the surface. Water is a natural resource that is probably much more valuable to Australia if used in the proper places, than all the base metals that may be discovered. It would be a simple matter to insert a provision covering calls on shares held in such companies. I think the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) need have no fear that that concession would get out of hand or be the subject of claims by people not entitled to it. No one would incur the risk of losing capital merely to bore holes all over the country in places where there is no likelihood of striking water merely to .obtain a rebate of tax. The only claims that under would be lodged would be legitimate. 1 do not think that the country's finances would he jeopardized by that concession.

170,Unknown,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m: Mr BOWDEN"" - Australians, , generally, know that very' large tracts of country in central Australia are barren wastes because of the lack of water. The Government freely offers tax concessions to those who prospect for gold, silver, base metals, rare minerals or oil. In certain parts of Australia, water would be much more valuable than any one or all of those minerals and oil. I have not submitted this amendment facetiously, although certain honourable members appear to think that I was trying to be humorous in doing so. I know of a company of engineers interested in prospecting for water in Central Australia. They claim that they have already established that Cooper's Creek and other streams, which ran freely 50 or 100 years ago and which are now silted up as the result of wind erosion, are still running underneath the surface of the earth. If they could be tapped by artesian boring and the water raised to the surface in those barren areas where no human being can now subsist, Australia could support a larger population, which would be distributed throughout the length and breadth of the country. Under existing conditions, the people are confined to the coastal fringe. I submit this amendment in the sure knowledge that it will not make any demands on the Treasury. People who are altruistic enough to expend their money in the search for water will not waste it on boring holes in the hope that they will receive a tax concession. The money will be expended for the purpose of finding water, and only when boring operations are unsuccessful will the company possibly ask for this concession. I am being frank with the Treasurer when I say that I have been requested to submit this proposal to him, because certain people are interested in the matter. The request is simple. Prospecting for oil is no different from prospecting for water, unless we believe that oil is much more valuable than water. I submit that it is not. In these circumstances, water would be more valuable than all the minerals which I mentioned and oil. I hope that the Treasurer will accept the amendment.",64
171,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [8.4] - A promised, I have examined this matter, but I am not able to accept the amendment. I have not been able to discover any instances of companies which are engaged in prospecting for water other than those which hire on; their plant for sinking wells or constructing clams, and some large manufacturing organizations which make provision for their own supplies of water on their own properties. Primary producers who"" expend money on providing water are adequately covered, first, by the depreciation provisions of the taxation law and, secondly, by the amendments contained in this bill. I mentioned this afternoon that money which a primary producer expends on unsuccessful bores is an allow- able deduction. In this instance, primary producers in the position which the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Bowden) described, are adequately covered. I am not able to visualize an ' organization prospecting for water for purely altruistic reasons. As I study this proposal, oil and water will not mix. The honourable member has selected a bad combination. However, that is not the reason why I am unable to accept the amendment. Perhaps there are some aspects which I have not had an opportunity to examine. I congratulate the honourable member on having made a completely original proposal, but the most I can say now is that I shall ascertain whether there is any justification for giving _ to the proposal favourable consideration.",65
172,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"New England) [8.7] I support the amendment. I appreciate the assurance which the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) has given, that if any new factors can be adduced in favour of the amendment, he will re-examine the proposal. However, the attitude which he hajs adopted is rather narrow. On the eastern coast of Australia, there are extensive water-bearing areas in the sand beds. ""A good deal of discussion has taken place recently in the Newcastle and lower New England area regarding the use of the water in the Tomago sand beds. The word "" Tomago "" is becoming well known throughout Australia as the result of the fight to secure for Samuel Courtauld and Company (Australia) Proprietary Limis I ted the right to use water from the Tomago .sandsj. which. ar.e under the. jiuris--dictioni of the Blunter' District Water Board.. However.; theTomago sands not rare. Similar; sandbeds exist ranch of. die eastern, coast; of Australia. Artesian waiter engineers state that two-fifths of: thetotal rain that in fallsonthese sandheds is trapped by the impervious clays beneath the sandbeds, is held there, and forms reservoir. There isa. tremendous, scops for the development of these areas.. terday, I read the latest issue of: West Pacific. It: containssome glorious photographs of. the extensive underground lakes which exist; beneath, the limestone of the Great Australian. Desertparticularly the Eucla artesian - basin, adjacent to the Great Australian. Bight. there is tremendousscope, for. the development of. water both for-irrigation, and for general purposes. There are two theories: in: geology-' artesian: waters in. Australia. The: theory advanced by the late Baldwin-Spencer is based: on. the phi tonic origin, of water: to this view, the waiter is driven up, apparently through; the pressure of the rocks^; no one: quite understands how that occurs*.. The.se.cond.theory is that advanced by the late Professor Sir Edgeworth David with regard totheintake, of the waterbeds* on the western slopes of the DividingRange. addition to that is the intake of water into places like the limestone formations in the Great Desert. Just as engineershatve shown for; that two-fifths of the rain which isprement's-. cipitated, on. the sandbed areas is trapped, so a tremendous quantity of. the rain which falls on these limestone areas throughout Australia, admittedlyat frequent periods> but floods? do occur, there, is trapped and retained - in enorwell mous underground lakes. Wo country has so* much underground waterThe Treasurer (Mr Chifley) would grasp asAustraliaprobably has-. No company has? approached me to support the. amendi ment, submitted by the; honourable her' for Gippsland,. and I am not assoit. ciated with anyorganization, interested * in aatesian boring.

This-organization operates the R'aineysystem of boring in. Australia for the Raihey are Corporation of the United States of Ameover rica. The method is tosink ashaft, and then - put out radial horizontal drills in a star shape to trap the whole-of the waters the beds-- in the a-rea, and raise a much larger quantity of waterthan can be obtained by puttingdown a vertical shaft. a Therefore) I suggest to the Treasurer that, whilst' oil and water-will not mix; an Yesexcellent case has been adduced for reSouihr examining the amendment. Any company which proposes to prospect for water in the barren areas of central Australia deserves every possible encouragement. Amendment, negatived. Clause agreed, to.

The Commissioner also informs me that a' notice of amended assessment and a cheque in refund of the amount overpaid wil l he forwarded to Mr 'Paterson by the Deputy Commissioner of ""Taxation a;t Sydney at an early date. A returned soldier of whom I have some knowledge has also found difficulty with his - returns. That The CHAIRMAN - The honourable member is again a little wide of the clause. Mr HARRISON' - My puarpose in re- ferring to -.these matters is to indicate that some - degree of chaos --must exist ; even - within the Taxation Department, because it-would appear-that some of the officers - do not clearly understand - the provisions of the act. 'Very many taxpayers withhold from lodging complaints in - respect of their assessments because they find it so difficult to understand the details of the matters involved. This is not surprising .seeing that some of 'the taxation officers themselves are also in doubt as to the real import of the law. If people - who .consider that they have been over-assessed do not apply for refunds they can be sure - that - no -.refunds will be made in their cases, because errors in the department, .are not - likely to be discovered unless, by some means, the particular .assessments come to the notice of high-n-anking officials.

I am also dubious any measures that might leave the way America t open for tax evasions. The matter mentioned by the able member for Wimmera.(Mr TurnAmerican bull) has been the subject of investigaon tion, but it would take a considerable for me to place all the details before honourable members. Representations on rhe subject were made to me by Mr E. Tait, and all the relevant provisions the law were set out exhaustively for benefit, and for that of other theatrical entrepreneurs. I shall be pleased to the honourable member for Wimmera copy of the statement that was prepared.' As a matter of fact, the speeches both the honourable gentlemen to I have referred had nothing to do with rhe provisions of clause 27, which exclusively with the agreement reached between .the Governments of the United recomKingdom and Australia on double taxaThe amendments, proposed in the clause are intended to bring our taxing legislation into conformity, in certain respects, with the terms of that agreement. The agreement was reached only after the most thorough investigations. Extaxation officers of the United Kingdom and Australia have spent a great deal the of time on this subject, which was also taken up in Great Britain by the visitHigh Commissioner for Australia, Mr. pay Beasley, and the Attorney-General (Dr was Evatt). The negotiations did not seem to be proceeding very rapidly, so, when 1 to was in England, I took up the subject, in company with the Attorney-General, on . the highest plane, and, as a result of our discussions, an agreement was reached very with Dr Dalton, the Chancellor of the British Exchequer. I do not pretend that either Gpvernment considers the agreeit ment' to be perfect, for the subject is extremely complex; but an understanding has been reached and, so far as is necesthe terms of the agreement are heing incorporated in our Income Tax Assessmemment Act by means of the provisions contained in this clause. . The agreement' of must be described as a compromise, but 1I have reason to heliev'e that it is regarded affording relief to financiers in the abom United Kingdom who propose to invest industries in this country.",68
177,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Will a similar agreement, abour, be made with the United States of",68
178,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That matter has honorbeen mentioned to me through the legation in Canberra, but not. a governmental basis. A tentative time approach was made through the-legation on behalf of certain American business interests. It may be that, later on, the J. subject will be taken up on a governof mental basis. A somewhat similar agreehis ment may possibly then be made with, the United States. When Mr Walter Nash, show Finance Minister of the Government of a New Zealand, was in Australia, not long ago, he discussed with me the possibility of of making an agreement on the subject whom with the Government of New Zealand. I do not suggest that complexities would deals have to be considered in relation to an agreement between Australia and New Zealand, such as those which had *o be faced in the discussions with the United Kingdom. There would be much simpler issues in an arrangement between New Zealand and ourselves, but I believe that there would be great difficulties in many respects i u an agreement with the United States of America. As Australia is a young nation, and it is considered that many American industries will be establishing subsidiaries here, we shall certainly give favourable consideration to rhe making of an agreement with the United States of America. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr . Fadden) knows fro m experience that the matter of double taxation has proved very difficult. I am not attempting to blame anybody for not having reached iin agreement upon it, because of the great difficulty of making one even when taxation in other countries was not so heavy as it is now. I rose merely to make it clear that the clause has no relation to some of the other matters that have been raised, but is designed entirely' to enable the agreement to operate in relation to the principal act.",68
179,Mr WHITE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Balaclava) [S.32] - I seek a. little further clarification of the f la use. It is headed "" B e l i e f from double taxation"", and contains many proposed new sections. According to my reading, it will ultimately, if not immediately oh the passage of the bill, relieve companies, if not individuals, of double tax. Insofar - as it, does that, there is wisdom in 'the proposal. Encouragement will be .given to British industries to commence operations in Australia, because they will not be taxed in two places. should like to be clear in that regard, as well as in regard to the effect on the individual, because there is a good deal of point in the matter that has been raised by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) , who has asked for an explanation of the position of artists. We know that, today Australia does not get its f a ir quota:of artists and members of the legitimate stage. Australians find that, if they.wish to follow a stage career they have to go abroad, and it is quite unfair that they should be required to pay income tax in two countries. This anomalous position has arisen because that is the case. A Hollywood film star receives a colossal income. I would not say. that ir. is earned in every instance. I believe that Sinatra has an income greater than that of the President of the United States of America, and so have Laurel and Hardy, the reason being that, the making of films is concentrated in a few centres, aud they are circulated throughout the world, paying no more than a nominal rate of duty when they enter a country.",69
180,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order ! The honourable member is straying from the clause.,69
181,Mr WHITE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am sorry that the Chair cannot see the point that I am making. The- CHAIRMAN - Order ! The honourable member must make no reflection on the Chair. The clause refers to an agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Australia in respect of double taxation, and the honourable member must confine his remarks to that subject or resume his seat.",69
182,Mr WHITE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I consider that I have the right to state ray case in my own way. An English film artist pays no income tax in Australia; but a member of the legitimate stage or a singer who came to this country would be required to do so. I believe the intention of the Treasurer (Mr Chifley)' to be to remove an anomaly. He has not made clear to me whether that purpose will be effected. He was asked a question about an American artist. Will the agreement operate in respect of a company and an individual when the bill becomes law? I,69

184,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) [8.35] - This clause deals with the salary or wages paid in respect of any piece-work performed by an employee, or any services rendered under a contract which is wholly or substantially for the labour of the employee. It is rather tricky from the point of view of the employer. This is another excellent illustration of the desire of the Government that every taxpayer snail become' a> tax collector for the Commonwealth Treasury. It is not the. function of any man: who. lets, a contract! for a. lump-' to police, payment of. taxes* that' are. to the. Government: Furthermore, the statement that itisf "" substantially the labour of the employee ""- automatic cally admitsthat a certain* amount may not be for wages but maybe, inrespect'of materials supplied. It would not be for the employer in that case to. say whether the man concerned was even making fair wages. When a man undertakes to do certain work on contract,, he runs risks, r have had some experience in that respect. The employer,, or the man who arranges for"" the contract price, cularly should not be obliged t'o make tax deducconsidered' tions and supply wage stamps in conperience nexion with piece-work, and especially contracts. Tliat is asking too much. The compilation of tax sheets, and' t'he rendering of them at the; end' of year; require the use of a' rather' complito cated piece of clerical machinery. Many persons find that they havemuch clerical work to do apart from their normal' farmare ing and Business operations. We are reachingthe stageat which some' check ought to< be placed on the extenttowhich private persons should' be asked to do this sort of work, without payment, for the Commonwealth Treasury.

I know that it - is useless to* ask the Treasurer ag<ree tb an amendment, Becausehis bills,that although' they do notbecome lawuntil they passtheParliament andt receive the royalassent, are; like the? laws* of the Mcdesand Persians; not to be called' question ihi any shapeor form-..

Taxation' Department. sum, Mr Chifley (Macquarie-Prime due Minister and Treasurer)"" ,[8.39] - The matter with which the clause deal's, and for to which the honourable member for Barker (Mr ArcHie Cameron) ha's referred,, is concerned with the prin1 ciple' of the pay-as-you-earn system,, and the collection of income tax by instalments:. I believe that collection by instalment's from wage and salary earners was introduced under the auspices of the Leader, of the. Australian Country party (Mr Fadden),, or while he was a Minister ; because,, as tax rates crept up, partiin relation to individual's, it .was that many persons would exconsiderable difficulty in meeting their income tax assessments if they were presented at the end of the year.,, and' that it was far more satiseach factory to wage and' salaay earners have, deductionsmade from their incomes, periodically. The deductions, may not be the precise amount for which they liable-the y may be more or lessbut at least the taxpayers arei relieved of the difficulty of discharging a big liability at' the end' of 'the-, year. I may say ini passings tha* some employers, have spokento me about theneed, for.' greater in' the calculation of the deducbecomtions thatshould be made., Some emfind: at the. end of the year that, to for various reasons;, the deductions have not been sufficient, to meet the amount of the assessment,, whilst in other instances 1 the totall deductions exceed the assessment 1 and refunds have to be made -. The: United 1 Kingdom has adopted asystem under which the employer becomes the: assessor month to month. Thati places*a tremendous amount ofwork uponv him. In conversation with the representatives! of to one employer/not. long; ago,- 1! pointedout some.'of the difficulty might be: overcome, if ai measurecould be introduced providing, that the employer should be the assessor., something alongrthe-lines.of in thesystemi in the United Kingdom. One of the reasons; for, our not having toadopt such a proposal was present that im war-time much man-power or would' have? .been, needed, andan unjust burdem would have - been-, placed om the employer: The provision' in tihebill ""was made .necessary by the; fact thalv under the instalment"", plan, we have 1 'called upon> farmers and 'Othersi engaging laiboui!- to> make taxdeductions from' the payanents they have made, particularly in - connection wiifeh piece-work.. I understand that, the matterwas brought: to a .head because, .anemployee 'of a. gentleman named Broome had been engaged, in. the picking-of onions at piece-woiik rates. A dispute arose,, 'because St was claimedt that 1 in the circumstances the 'employer, should liothave'toKJoU'ect the tax-instalments-. The case went to the High Court of Australia. I believe that it isknown, asBroome v. Qfoen&weth, Ghenow-eth being the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, in Victoria. The court ruled that the employee received a salaryor wage because he was employed at piece-work rates, but that his employment did' not have any relation to a period of time. I believe that all honourable members agreed that tax deductions should be made from .wages or salaries wherever that was possible. That general principle having been agreed to, there cannot very well be an avoidance of its a pplication to cases such as this. Mr Archie .CAMERON (.Barker) [-S.44-] - The explanation of the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) ha:s not thrown a great dealof light on the matter. The right honourable gentleman has assumed that every honourable member on this side of the-chamhei: was in favour of the payas-you-earn. system. The records will dis.closethat I had quite a lot to say against that proposal when it came before the Parliament.. Mr - GuiFi/Hy - Not in. regard to the principle.",69
185,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes , the whole show.",71
186,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"We supported the principle, but not the scheme propounded by the present Government.",71
187,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I put it to the right honourable gentleman that, in relation to contracts, the time factor does not. enter intothe matter, except, in those very odd instancesi n which a time limit, may be imposed on a man. for the completion, of a contract. Mr CmarjiEv - This applies to work at piece-work, rates.. Mu. ARCHIE CAMERON - The clausedefinitely mentions the word "" contract. "".. It . is welll that we should - stick to the language of the bill; because - it is-on that, language-that, any poois devil who goes' before the; court will be condemned,, not on what we think it ought to be:. The-clause reads* "" in respect of any services rendered under a, - contract which is wholly or - substantially for the labour - of the employee "". A man may - take a contract for,- fencing, or clea-r-ing land, or: sinking, wells, or making dams. While doingIhe work hemay be separated by a. great: distance - from his. employer, who> will! not know hy just how many - weekshe should dividethecontract price in orderto> arrive at ai figure from which to make weekly tax deductions. TheTreasurersaid that; in some instances, it might turn out that too - much ""womld be deducted. That is one of the GOmip'IaiiUts-1I have against the income tax administration. Many people have complained to me that they are unable to get .squared up in regard to their annual assessments! It may be that at the end of the year, they have a credit with the ' department, but they are unable to get the money refunded. If a man owes something to the Taxation Department, and does not pay on the due date, he is Eable tocertain penalties. In the same way, i""f thedepartment owes a taxpayer money, and ref-uses to refund the amount within30 days, it should be subject to the same penalties. There appears to-be one law for the. poor devil who pays the tax, and another for the Taxation. Department,, from the decisionsof which there is no* appeal. It often, happens that the taxpayer,, to whom the department owes money, is - working on an overdraft on which he must pay interest from day to day; but no amount of writing or interviewing can get from the department the money it oweshim. A man might as well go to Moscow and try to get an audience with: "" Joe "" Stalin, as to get an interview with any of the chief officials of the Taxation Department,, unless he is: a member, of Parliament, and. even then he will, have to spend five minutes explaining who he is. Some time ago,. I asked a question on .notice inan endeavouri to. find out. in how many instances money washeld by the Treasury on behalf of taxpayers, but the Lord only knows when I shall get a reply. When I spoke last year about the delay in issuing assessments, I was told by the Treasurer to supply a list of those who .hud not received an assessment for three .years. I am not going to do it, because ihat is a matter for the taxation authorities. However, I know of cases in which no assessment was issued for two years, .and then it was eventually found that £100 had to be knocked off the assessment. I know wage-earners who have not had a settlement with the department for two years, although they have written asking for a refund of the money - due to them. Of course, the department handles over £100,000,000 a year, and - officials may believe that it is a small matter that a "" fiver"" or a "" tenner"" should be owing to this taxpayer or that. Those are small amounts in the total - accounts of"" the department, but to the poor fellows to whom the money is owed they may mean a good deal. Therefore, - t is high time the department, was forced to make prompt settlement in cases where it owes money to taxpayers. It cannot - claim ignorance of the fact that the ""money is owing because it sends out noticesto taxpayers stating the The taxpayer is just as much entitled to r.he money due to him at the end of 30 - days as the department is entitled to the money due to it, but in this instance what is sauce for the goose does not - appear to be sauce for the gander.",71
188,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer). [8.50] - I deprecate the attitude of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie - Cameron) and other honourable members who spend much of their time attempting to discredit public servants who have ""been rendering good service to the country under difficult conditions. It seems to be the desire of some to blackguard these officials. As Treasurer, I say that these men gave magnificent service to .the country during the period of the war, as can be vouched for by, other honourable members, such as the Leader - of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and the - Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden), who have themselves been Treasurers in the past. They 'know that these officials are honest; and are doing a difficult job in a very capable way. It must be i-emembered that the number of taxpayers has increased, very greatly. The honourable member for Barker seems to think that taxation officials take a fiendish delight in obstructing and frustrating people, and withholding money to which they are entitled. He said that if the taxpayer did not pay up by a certain date he was subject to a penalty. 1 should like him to cite one instance in which a man who had a reasonable case for an extension of time has. been refused time to pay.",72
189,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That does not help, because it turns the department into a court of inquiry.",72
190,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I should not be surprised if there are people in this House who have asked for, and have been granted, an extension of time in which to pay taxes, or have been allowed to pay by instalments. I have become a bit fed up with these ' continual attacks on officials. I do not say that they do not sometimes make mistakes. They may have their failings. Among any group of men there may be some who do not measure up 100 per cent., but as a body they no more fail in their duty than do position. members of this House.",72
191,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Fawkner) [8.53] - I was interested to hear the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) say that it, was the policy of the department, in cases where there were good reasons why a taxpayer could not pay the - tax. not, to exact the penalty immediately. ' Mr Giii.Fj.EY - I said that the department permitted taxpayers to pay by in-' stalments, and in many, instances did not exact a penalty.",72
192,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It is that point which requires clarification. At the present time, a great amount of tax is uncollected. In the main, it is due from business people and property owners whose properties normally produce revenue. However, because' of bad seasons, the owners were not able to meet their taxation commitments in a particular year. The general run of taxpayers who earn wages or salary are not in that position, because the tax is deducted periodically from their earnings. Even though there may be good reason .why the taxpayer cannot meet his commitment on the due date, the Taxation Commissioner may demand the payment of an additional 6 per cent, on the outstanding amount. As the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) pointed out, the department does not pay interest on the money which it holds on behalf of a taxpayer. When a taxpayer is required to pay interest on money due to the department, it represents a heavy burden if he is working on an overdraft. I remember bringing to the notice of the Treasurer, two or three years ago, the case of a proprietary company, of which the principal had an income of about £15,000 from the company.",72
193,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable member is getting away from the clause.,73
194,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I think the principle is clear.,73
195,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable member may not widen the scope of the debate.,73
196,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"This man was not drawing a salary. His income was drawn from his interest in thp business, but for the year under discussion the tax, plus the penalties, amounted to more than the business earned. That, admittedly, is an extreme case, but it shows what can happen. I hope that the Treasurer will view sympathetically the plight of those who, year in and year out, provide revenue for the Government, but who. in a lean year, arc unable to meet their commitments.",73
197,Mr BEAZLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Fremantle) [8.59] - I understand that the purpose of this amending clause is to close a gap which was revealed by a' judgment of the High Court in December of last year. In the case in question an employer was paying a man a certain price per bag to pick onions - Under the act, the employer could not be compelled to deduct tax at the source, because the contract did not mention any time, but merely, the rate to be paid per bag. That gap has now been closed by this amending clause, and the deductions must now be made whether the employee be engaged under contract or the piece-work system. As persons of this class will essentially be casual workers the rate of deduction, if they are working for, say, a fortnight, will be their rate of earning throughout the whole year. Consequently, their deductions are disproportionately heavy. They may not earn anything like the casual rate. throughout the whole year. People engaged in casual employment need their money very badly. If the casual work is very remunerative they find themselves subjected to heavy deductions, much of which will be handed back at the end of the year. I ask the Treasurer to issue an administrative order stating that where it is clear that a man is engaged on casual work the rate of deduction may be adjusted to meet his expected annual income.",73
198,Mr ADERMANN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Maranoa) [9.2] I had intended to refer to the same point as that raised by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley). I should like the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) to clarifv ' what is covered by the word "" contract""What will be the position, say, of drovers who sign contracts to drive stock from one place to another and who, in turn, employ one, two, or more men to assist them ? In such cases, is the owner of stock or the contractor regarded as the employer of the casual men and who would be responsible for making deductions from their wages? The same position applies generally to contract shearers. Is the owner of the sheep responsible for the deductions to be made from the wages of all the men engaged by the' contract shearer? Another type of contract over which difficulty may arise is that in which the owner of a threshing plant contracts to thresh the crops of farmers, going from one place to another as the work cuts out. Such a contractor may employ casual labour to assist him in his work. Who is responsible for the deductions, the farmer or the owner of the threshing plant who engages such casual labour?",73
199,Mr TURNBULL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wimmera) [9.5] Perhaps, of all people my constituents are most concerned in this matter. The dried fruits industry established at Mildura, Redcliffs, Mei'bein, Nyah and Woorinen employs large number of seasonal workers who come from Melbourne, and other parts of the country by special train or by any other means of transport at their disposal. Last season there was great misunderstanding in the industry becausegrowers did not know whether or not they had to make tax deductions from the wages of these - workers. "" Mr F. R. Messenger representing the growers .went to Melbourne and secured from the Commissioner of Taxation a temporary ruling on the point. That it was very temporary is apparent by the clause in this bill on which I am speaking, for under this amending provision fruit-growers .and others employing seasonal workers in large or small numbers will be compelled to collect the whole of the appropriate deductions from their employees, - notwithstanding the length of engagement, or conditions of employment. The men resent the deductions being made in many instances, for as many depend on the har-vest time for their chief income, their total yearly income may not be subject to tax. I protest strongly against the dried fruits-grower being called upon to act as tax collector when his full time is required in the management of his block, and when his management is a vital necessity to the 'reaping - of the full of 'his year's 'labour. Mr - HAMILTON (.Swan) [9.7] - I should like some information relative to the tax imposed-on living allowances paid to ex-servicemen .undergoing training courses .under the post-wiar .reconstruction training scheme. As honourable members ame aware, a single trainee - receives £3 5s. a week, .and there are various additional payments for married men and those with - dependants. Payments of living allowances :by the department are at present - subject to deductions for income tax, - notwithstanding <a ruling given-some time ago by - the 'Commissioner of Taxation that such .allowances constituted 'neither wage nor salary and because .of that there was no power to tax them. In ""Western Australia. I saw an instruction passed through the department to the effect that deductions in respect of these allowances, which were neither salary nor wages, were to be exacted until .such time as the ex-servicenien complained, whereupon the deductions were to cease immediately pending an alteration of the law to give to the department power under the Income Tax Assessment Act to levy ;such deductions. When I .questioned the Treasurer (Mr Cliifley) on this point tone fright honourable gentleman indicated that the Income Tax Assessment Act already gave the department power to do so. For the benefit of all ex-servicemen undergoing training I should like the right honourable ; gentleman to indicate whether there is power in the act enabling the department to make these deductions. Mr .CHIFLEY (Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.10] -.Hon orable members have raised a number of questions relating to the collection of income tax from salaries and - wages. The main principle is that the employer of the labour shall be responsible .for the collection of the tax. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr .Beazley) instanced the case of men employed on seasonal labour at high rates of remuneration for short periods and who at the end of the year may receive a total income 'below the taxable amount. T do - not know that 'there are very many people fruits so circumstanced. However, the Commissioner of Taxation - and the ^Deputy Commissioners 'have 'power ""to imake adjustments to meet cases of that kind. The points raised 'by other 'honourable members are covered by ""the main principle' fhat the employer of the labour is responsible Tor the collection of the tax. Since 1942, employers of labour with but few exceptions have, continued to make the deductions from the salaries and wages of their employees. It was only because some dispute arose, that a ruling was given 'by the High Court which rendered necessary the insertion in the bill of this amending - clause. I am aware that the collection of the tax imposes additional strain on the employers, hut 'the continuance of 'that practice is necessary for the working of the pay-as-you-earn system. I am surprised to learn that in some areas employers'have refused to collect the tax from casual workers. In ray own 'electorate farmers employing casual labour have been making these deductions ever since the --system was instituted. If employers decline to make these deductions that system Would quickly break down, if shall as'k 'the Commissioner - of Taxation to prepare a statement covering 'the points raised by honourable members during the 'debate on this 'clause. Clause agreed to. Glauses. 30 to 32 agreed to. Clause 33 (Annual notice by agents).",73
200,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Reid) [9..14] - Eve r since the. experts succeeded in making income lax assessment a science, the general public has found thai it has been blinded by science, and the more amendments, that have been made the more scientific it becomes and the more frustrated and helpliw. become the members of general community. Consequently, in their frustration they turned to experts for hi'lp. Sonic of the bright and more enterprising officials in the Taxation Department found that whereas they were earning hundreds of pounds a year in the department.they could earn thousands outside by going to the help of taxpayers. They formed a new profession. They became what are called "" t ax agents "". The tax agents are. now seen in the:r proper perspective. The department introduced registration of tax agents. The rax agent was supposed to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer. That was his duty and what he was paid for. When the tax agent became registered there enrered into the matter a new factor, because the tax agent: found that lie had conflicting interests. His job was not only to serve his clients-that was what, he was paid for and what he was supposed to do-bu t also satisfy the Taxation Department. If he fought too 11arcl for his client, the taxpayer, he necessarily came into conflict with the (lepurtnient. Fortunately, most agents regarded it as their duty to attend to the interests of their clients, the taxpayers. As the result some of them had their registration wiped out by the Tax Agents' Board. It may be said that, they were properly deregistered. I should expect that, answer to be given in the ordinary course of debate. But the tax agents who were deregistered appealed to the court, and they appealed successfully. That was the position until this further advance in the science of taxation assessment was produced. It now seems that the board proposes to meet the position in another way. Competent agents apply to the board for registration. They are registered. They fight [82] for their clients. They come into conflict with the Taxation Department, and they tax are deregistered. Against that injustice they appeal and the court upholds their appeal. Is the proposed amendment of the principal act. in clause 32 intended to defeat the court's decision? Is it designed, as other parts of the bill are - designed, to get. around the decision of the court and frustrate the court? If so. the committee should be very chary about overruling the rights of the individual by the making tax agents register every year. We do not do that to doctors, architects, dentists or any other professional men. Mr CONET.AN - But they have to pass examinations.",75
201,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"So have the tax agents. 1. wish the honourable member would follow what I say. Time does not permit me and it is too tiresome to go into every detail. I said that the Taxation Department was losing some of its ablest and enterprising officials, including its legal men, because they find the remuneration outside is better than in the department. Those officers are trained and skilled. They have been approved by the board. It had registered them. They a're qualified and their qualifications are attested. They have higher qualifications than some of their juniors, who now have their jobs. Yet they are disqualified. To defeat the court so that it shall never again be able to do terrible things to the department it says, "" We will just refuse to register them"". When it does that, it does a grave injustice. This is a bad thing. It takes away the rights of individuals. By making tax agents register every year the board will have them constantly under its power. Why, the autocratic British Medical Association cannot deregister its members unless they are guilty of infamous conduct! If doctors, lawyers, dentists, optometrists and other professional men had to come up every year for re-registration what tremendous power would be given to the little coteries in control for the time being. That is a power that I submit we would never grant to an autocracy. Why should we allow it to be in the hands of the Tax Agents' Board ?",75
202,Mr WILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Does the honourable member say that the right of appeal has been taken away? M i-. LANG - Yes . . Mr WILLIAMS - T but is the honourable member's view.,75
203,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"This amendment does take away the appeal, because the board will not, re-register some of them. If a man ix .registered as a tax agent and the registration is taken uway.from him, he has the right of appeal to the court; but, with annual registration, the right of appeal is taken away. It is a roundabout way of destroying the jurisdiction of the court. It is wrong if men of the highest repute, who become tax agents, and put up a fight for the people who engage them, can be crucified by the board for having done what they consider to be their duty. If an agent has to work under the everpresent fear that, he will not bo re-registered, the profession may as well he abandoned, because he will not even be able to pretend to be the agent ofhis client.",76
204,Mr BEAZLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Clause 34 provides for the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.,76
205,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Not , in the respect that I. refer to-annua l renewal of registration, 'rhe agent will be no longer his client's agent, but the agent of the Taxation Department. The Taxation Department, will be his muster, and will always have the power lo refuse him registration. What. I have said should be sufficient to convince the committee; but, finally, .1 submit that if a tax agent gets at crosspurposes with the board, or the Taxation Department, if he fights too strenuously and conscientiously for his client, who is the taxpayer, he will lose, his livelihood, and that is the worse, threat one can hold over the head of any person.",76
206,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.26] - The story told by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) would convey the impression that the Tax Agents' Boards consisted of officers of the Taxation Department. That is entirely incorrect. He implied that if a tax agent offended the department, the agent would not be reregistered. I can best answer that, statement by citing the names of the members of the Tax Agents Board in New South Wales. The chairman is Mr Williams. M.L.A., a. member of the State Parliament, and a public accountant, whilst the other iwo members are Mr E. H . Swift, the State Auditor-General, and Mr Weir, ihe ruder-secretary to the State Treasury. None of 'these gentlemen is associated with the Taxation Department. The Tax Agents' Boards in other States are substantially similar. It is apparent, therefore, that the Taxation Department has not - much to do with determining '---liethev tax agents should be registered or deregistered. The fact is that for a long lime it has been recognized that throughout Australia many people, by posing as tax experts, have been really deceiving the taxpayers. It is time that persons who elaim to be taxation experts should be obliged to prove their qualifications. The provision with respect to annual review of registration is made in order that the boards may exercise a more effective control over tax agents. That provision is a protection to the taxpayers, as is also the creation of the boards. That is why similar boards had been in operation in some States for some time, prior to uniform income tax. Mr ""FADITEK - The board in Queensland was established in 1920.",76
207,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The r e is nothing new in this proposal. No charge is made in respect of the annual review of registration. That provision is not unusual. Persons are not allowed to run a motor car unless they renew registration annually. In fact, one eannoi own a dog without renewing the registration annually, f simply rose to indicate that, the Tax Agents' Board in Now South Wales, in which State the. electorate of the honourable member for Reid is situated, - does not include anv officer of the Taxation Department.. I .regard it as a reasonable and impartial body.",76
208,Mr ANTHONY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Richmond) [9.80] ""Whilst on the surface the explanation given by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) might appear to be sati.sfnet.ory. he left ouite a number of matters unexplained. The legislative provision by the Commonwealth for the registration of tax agents was introduced in July, 1943. That is three years ago. It was then provided that registration should continue indefinitely until such time as the tax /-gent was found guilty of misconduct, or sonic ofl.it-r - offence, or was disqualified im the ground of bankruptcy or on ihat orJioi' specified grounds. Lsually, registration of an agent continues indefidentists nitely. The Treasurer has slated that the ohjoef of annual re-rogistration is enable, a cheek to bo made on agents: and he intimated that .an agent might be fused renewal of registration because unsatisfactory conduct. That is the only requirements, I ' submit, that, except when. reason that has been given for the annual renewal of registration of agents. view of the fact that the Treasurer has --tatod that the Tax Agents' Board is pletely independent of the. Taxation partment, it would be interesting to know who is to make the objection to the reselves newal of an agent's registration. Doe> the Taxation Department submit jection, or do clients of a particular agent submit if f 1 rather think that a. client's remedy is to refuse to do any more business with a particular agent, just as client withdraws his business from an unsatisfactory solicitor. Therefore, would appear that the only objection which can be submitted to the board of years. against re-registration of a tax agent must come from the department itself. Quite a number of applications for tration from persons in my'electorate, prepared income tax returns prior to the operation of this provision, were refused because the department did not consider that the applicants possessed the necesthe sary experience arid qualifications. Therefore, the most opportune time for the department to exercise its judgment, as to the qualifications of an applicant when the original application for regisjoin, tration is submitted. I shall require than the Treasurer's statement to condoctors vince me that once registration is granted it is really necessary to oblige the to apply for renewal of registration annually, because the o n l y authority a position to object to re-registration the Commissioner of Taxation. Commissioner is in much the same posifrom tion in relation to the board as the police authorities stand in relation to the sing Court. When an hotel-keeper applies for a renewal of a licence from time to time, usually objection against the applihonorable cation does not come from a member of forms? the public as a rule, but from the Police Department. I agree with the honourable member for Reid (. Mr Lang) one can apply the same reasoning r,o the ihe registration of solicitors, doctors, or other professional men. A rax agent is not compelled U> pass an to examination, but must satisfy the Taxation Department of his fitness to prepare, retaxation returns. Having satisfied r.hc of taxation authority with respect to those 1 an agent is guilty of some offence which f n ill-serves disqualification, his registration should continue without, further chalcomlenge. This is a further imposition by DeInireaeiMcy upon the community. Tax agents will be compelled to submit themto officialdom year after year in order to be accorded what sbould belong the oblo them a.* a matter of right. Mr BKAI.E - The official m in d!",76

210,Mr WHITE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Balaclava.) [9.36] - This regisproposal may contain a good deal of who merit, but I fail to understand why chartered accountants, most of whom submit' returns for taxpayers because they have the necessary knowledge to compile required information, should be required to apply annually for registration. The compilation of tax returns is often the principal part of their business, yet, is under this bill, every year, they must the form-filling class. Does the more Government propose to require lawyers, and dentists to re-register every year? Certainly not! Surely one regisagent tration should suffice. No honourable member desires tb see bogus tax agents in establish themselves, or people who deis fraud the Taxation Department, but, The rurely the Government should dismiss its mind the idea that it must conr stantly legislate for a nation of "" crooks'.'. LicenChartered accountants arc doing this work. The average sitizen .is not able to - fill in his income tax return. How many members fill in their own. tax Mr CoN.B.r.AN - I do.",77
211,Mr WHITE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Obviously , the only income which t.lio honourable member for Griilir.li (Mr Conelan) derives is his parliamentary allowance. If he had any other income, he would find that it, paid him to employ an accountant; to fill in his return. Yet. the Treasurer (Mr Chifley), ::cting on the advice of the Taxation Department, has proposed this alteration which will further regiment the business community. T'he honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) stated, that, no appeal will be allowed .if nn application for reregistration is refused: Mr A NT II ox v - Provisio n is made for an. appeal.",78
212,Mr WHITE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Once a firm of tax agents has established itself in the esteem of the Taxation 'Department, it should not, he obliged to submit to the humiliation to apply for reregistration every year. When Australia required a total war effort, all the activities of the people had to be related to those of the government, and . yet some ridiculous forms which existed during the war, still endure. If a person, required a tyre for his motor vehicle, he is obliged to fill in a form declaring that, in effect his neighbour does not possess a horse and jinker that he can use, state who is his doctor and give similar irrelevant information.. The Government, should - not attempt to restrict the activities of tax agents in this way.",78
213,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker) |9.:i.S | - I do not agree with, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) to any - substantial degree on. this matter, because I am mindful-of the fact that people in many callings suc'h as an auctioneer, butcher, wheat-grower and dairy-farmer, are obliged to register every year. A person must take out a licence for his dog or hull. My list of licences is piling up. I have not any particular objection to this provision which requires that tax agents shall register annually. For various reasons, these agents shall be subjected to some surveillance. A few years ago, I Had a disagreement with the Taxation Department regarding several people in. different parts of Australia. In one in stance, I discovered that a well-known firm of tax agents had been compiling returns for one of my constituents for a number of years. The agents had accepted payment, from him for their services; but, without informing him of what they were doing, they attached a certificate to his returns stating that, they did not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in them. If a lawyer acted in a similar maimer, towards one of his clients, he would quickly be summoned before the law society. That firm of tax agents was selling its client, and his interests behind his back. Tax agents should have a certain code of morality. If an agent is to be licensed and permitted to charge a fee for making out a return for a client, his services should be at the disposal of the man who employs him. Mr BEAI.E - The agent, cannot, guarantee the accuracy of the returns unless he audits the taxpayer's books entirely.",78
214,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Why did this particular firm of tax agents attach that certificate fo the client's returns? Mr ANTHONY. - The agents merely pointed out that they had not audited the client's books.,78
215,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The firm slated that it could not, guarantee the accuracy of the information contained in the returns. The taxpayer who employed the firm had complete confidence in it. He did not discover, until a. difficulty arose with the Taxation Department, that his agents had been selling him behind his back. As I stated, a code of morality should operate here. If a. tax agent accepts payment fro m a client for his services he should not act, in. the manner iiv which, this particular firm did without informing the taxpayer.",78
216,Mr BERNARD CORSER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The taxpayer would obtain, from the agent a copy of his return with a copy of the certificate attached.",78
217,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"A . copy of the certificate was not attached to the copy of the return. If honourable members like to take up the case of the tax agents. T do not mind, but I know where I stand in this matter. The first person that the agent, should tell that he is dissatisfied with a return is the taxpayer who employs him. If he fails to do that, he should be ""'rail-roaded "" out of his job. Therefore, when the Treasurer insists that tax agents shall register annually, I contend that, ori a few matters which have come io my personal knowledge, some of. the agents should not be re-registered, but de-registered.",78
218,Mr WILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Robertson) [9.43] 1 find it difficult to understand why some honourable members opposite object to this proposal. The sole purpose is to require a tax agent to inform the board in writing every year that he desires to continue as an agent. The board will obtain, from him all particulars regarding himself and any other information that it requires. A tax agent holds an important, position in the community. He has a f/7(r/,.v»-pi'ofessional position- a confidential position-and he is entrusted with all the business secrets of his clients. Consequently, tax agents must be reputable persons whom the public can trust. As the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) stated, this provision is designed for the protection of taxpayers. Therefore. I am astonished that honourable members opposite should quarrel among themselves about this matter, and object to a sensible proposal. The Board that has been referred to by the Treasurer has no connection whatever with the Taxation Department. It is an independent board of reputable people, who have control over tax agents. Tho Government is to be commended for introducing this simple amendment providing for an up-to-date register of these individuals who are in a position to collect substantial fees from clients for the handling of their confidential business.",79
219,Mr BERNARD CORSER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wide Bay) | 9.47] - I cannot see any great objection lo a register of tax agents. Everybody knows that the Government will squeeze out of the community the last oz. of tax. If tax .agents have escaped this imposition in the past they have been lucky. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) cited quite a number of occupations in - which people hove to register from year to year. Even the simple dairyman who carries on an industry of the greatest value to this country is called on to register each year, ;il the ugh I could never quite understand Ihe necessity for this. Once a property has been examined, there should be no need to make it a yearly event; but year after year officials inspect dairy farms to see that dairies are far enough away from milking sheds and so on. That costs a lot of money. I cannot, see anything wrong in insisting upon a register of tax agents. Even auctioneers have to register every year. ' This provision may do something towards keeping the occupation as clean as possible, and I am quite sure thai the Australian Country party is not. opposing i ! for that, reason. The honourable member for Barker has claimed that in some cases tax agents have been dishonest in forwarding returns which they have not verified on behalf of their clients. I : point out. however, that on taxation return forms is a question asking whether the agent certifies as to the correctness of ti;e figures that have been entered on the form. The tax agent replies in the negative, stating that the figures have been supplied to h.im by his client. I have no doubt that, that was done, in the case to which the honourable member for Barker referred. The client, himself would have received a. copy of the return sent in by the agent. If he did not insist upon that, he must be a curious type of taxpayer. I cannot see anything disc red i table to the tax agent in regard to that matter, because the form prescribes that he must make that declaration and that the taxpayer himself must he satisfied with the information that he signs.",79
220,Mr BEALE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"[9.50] - I have no particular objection to this clause. These days, we are all running round virtually with numbers on our backs and the addition of another number cannot, matter very much. However, \ ""cannot allow the observations of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) to pass without some comment. I am sure that honourable members opposite, including the Prime Minister. (Mr . Chifley) will be pleased to find honourable members on this side of the chamber at variance to some degree.",79
221,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It is a very minor point.,79
222,Mr BEALE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Nevertheless . I see a pleased expression on the face of the right honourable gentleman. I understood the honourable member for Barker to suggest that tax agents were acting wrongly, dishonestly, or improperly in stipulating in the taxation returns made on. Iichulf of client-; that the information given was not necessarily within their knowledge, 'thus excluding themselves from any personal undertaking or obligation in regard to that infor.nia.tion. That i« obvious, and . I cannot understand the objection that has been raised by the honourable member for Barker.",79
223,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I expect the honourable member to understand it .,80
224,Mr BEALE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"1 do not speak in terms ns .strung as that. \ ' have . sometimes been in the same position as the honourable member, but I have not. said so. What Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). I have to say now on the matter is uttered in any party spirit, but in the interests of truth. Surely no whether he be an accountant or a tax agent, or anybody else, can be expected give an undertaking with respect to mention the information that a client submits him. How can an agent undertake to that the details of his client's business pretences. are correct? How can an agent verify the facts that are submitted to him ? can only do that to the degree permitted by the documents, vouchers, receipts, tv.c, submitted to him by his client. could not go beyond that. He is only agent, and the taxation return itself contains a specific clause which makes that very clear. The honourable member for tax agents. Barker suggested that an agent should implicate himself by guaranteeing the information submitted to hi m by his client. Mr AKOH IK CAMERON - I did not make any such suggestion.",80
225,Mr BEALE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I can see, of course, that I have not the qualifications of honourable memberf o r Barker in matter; but I did understand him to professional men, such make the representation that there something dishonest or crooked about agents who prepared returns on behalf of their clients and refused to guarantee the information contained in them. Obviously, no man' who prepares a return on behalf of a taxpayer can guarantee correctness of the information that, client supplies. A solicitor, tax agent, or any other of the one hundred and kinds of agents with which we are familiar in the business world today, honourable member for Reid may prepare a return and put it before his client. The client; has to satisfy himself that the return is correct, and has to sign it. It does not go beyond that, and while I am a. member of this chamber I shall not, be a party to any attack, direct or indirect, on any person who acts as an agent for someone else, by suggesting that in preparing a document would not be necessarily makes himself responsible for the truth of its contents.

I ask the honourable - member for Griffith to refer to the subject, cf the clause, namely, the. registration of",80
227,Mr CONELAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The divergence of opinion amongst members of the Opposition on this clause is very interesting. The Opposition takes great exception to the proposal that agents shall be required to register each year. The honourable member for Beid (Mr Lang) and the the honourable member for Parramatta and. this some of his colleagues elaim that as doctors, was dentists, chemists and architects, do not have to do likewise. However, such men. have to carry out long years of study at, universities in order to qualify for their degrees, whereas tax agents can obtain registration without the undergoing training of a similar charachis ter. Many tax agents have left employment in the Taxation Department and one taxation agencies in order to engage all in that profession. I agree with the (Mr. Lang) that some of them did so for tliu sole reason that, although they had reached high positions in the department, they were not earning nearly as much in salaries as they now earn as tax agents. Any man who has served in the Taxation Department can resign and set himself up as a fax agent, whatever his qualifications may he. I object to the fact that such men do not have to pass examinations in order to start in business. I. sincerely hope that, in the near future, any person who desires to become registered a -- a tax agent will be required to pass an examination set by the Public Service Board. Any person who wishes to practise as a tax agent should be qualified to do so, and there .is no reason why he should not be required to register inch year, as certain other professional men are required to do. .",80
228,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Barker; |H.59J - T'sually . 1 a.m able to make myself understood in fhis committee, but apparently 1I have not been able to do so to-night. The casi;, which 1 stated simply, is this: If a man acting as a. tax agent accepts a taxpayer's money for preparing :-. tax lvinrn. and if he has any misgivings legnrding that return, his duty is to inform the taxpayer of the fact first, not, to submit the return to the Taxation Department together with private information which lie has not given to his client. None of my colleagues in Opposition caii justify a registered tax agent conveying to.the department information about a taxpayer's affairs, together with his opinions about, them, which he has not conveyed to the taxpayer. Such an agent 'is recreant to the trust reposed in .him by' his client. He is not paid by the Taxation. Department. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr* Beale) was most eloquent ' in his ability to misunderstand me. If he, as a barrister, went to a party opposing one of his clients and said, "" Look, I will give you some information, about, my bloke that you can use, but I will not let him know that 1I have done so "", I have a strong suspicion that any law society, with - the possible exception of the one in Sydney, would kick him out. 1I have had experience of dealings, with legal men in - Sydney. What L have said would hold good,. 1 believe, in any law society outside of that city. If a barrister or solicitor undertakes a case, he does not convey to his client's opponent information that he has not given to his client. In fact, he is not supposed to convey anything to the opposing party. He supplies his services for a fee to the man whose case he undertakes to fight. A tax agent is in much the same position as a. solicitor or barrister. He does certain work for a ""taxpayer and accepts a fee for doing so. The taxpayer places confidence in him. and, in my opinion, the agent should not convey any information to the Taxation .Department which he has not conveyed first to his client. If he does so, he is recreant to the trust reposed in him and should not be allowed to continue to act as a tax agent. ' Mr WHITE (Balaclava) LlO.2] Much of this discussion has nothing to do with the case. Under the existing law, any tax agent's licence can be cancelled. The proposal in the clause now before the committee merely provides that agents shall register every year. The point at issue is whether this clause should be agreed to or not. I remind the honourable member.for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) that a bad agent can be deregistered under the provisions of the existing law. I consider that the army of accountants, lawyers, and others who act as tax agents, should not be required to join the already overburdened ranks of government form-fillers. This clause should be considered in conjunction with the succeeding clause. If honourable members read both of them, they will realise that nobody may render a tax return for a fee unless he is a registered tax agent. Therefore, probably every legal firm in Australia will be required to register as a tax agent. Mr WIXI.I.AMS - That is right.",81
229,Mr WHITE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am glad that the honourable member agrees with me. He. did not appear to realise that fact when he addressed the committee. According to the succeeding clause, every lawyer, every trust company, and every other organization that makes income tax returns on behalf of individuals, will be required to register annually, and will be liable to a penalty of £100 for failure to do so. This provision is unnecessary. Bogus agents can be dealt with by calling them before the board which was ' mentioned by the Treasurer Chifley). The board appears to be a valuable instrumentality; it can attend to tax agents who do not do their work properly, f t would be wrong to put agents on the basis of subservience proposed in the clause. Mr LANG. (Reid) L 1 0 . 4 ] - - ™ g . 1 that so much debate has occurred over such a simple matter. The present law provides that the registration of an agent shall continue indefinitely until cancelled by a board for one of a number of specified reasons, such as death, bankruptcy, and misconduct. Therefore, the board now has the power to control all registered agents. If there be any misconduct on the part of an agent, his registration can be cancelled. injustice should be done, the deregistered agent may apply to a court and have justice done and may have his registratration restored. That has been done. A registration has been cancelled, there has been a successful appeal to the court, and ihe registration has been restored. The hoard now seeks to circumvent the court, by doing away with the right of appeal and compelling agents to annua lly.",81
230,Mr WTLLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Not to register, but to notify the board of the desire to continue to be registered. .",82
231,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"An 'honoraible member has said that tax agents have the right of appeal. According to my reading, they have not. The right of appeal lies to the County Court, the Supreme Court, or whatever may be the name of the court in any State, upon cancellation of registration. The board will be able to circumvent that, by refusing reregistration. The act does not state how the board is appointed. Those who compose it may be most reputable men. I want to know what is the justification for this amendment of the law. The explanatory note states that at present the board has certain powers, and goes on to say that it has been found in practice that the board should be given greater control. Why should it. be given greater control? It has been decided that tax agents shall be made to register annually. With one registration, the office file is complete; but, with an annual registration there (Mr will have to be a staff of officers, which will have tQ be paid-by whom? Later, there will be a demand that tax agents shall be made to pay for their annual registration, on the ground that it is only just and proper that they should pay for rhe upkeep of the board's staff. This is ret not imaginary; it has happened at other times in similar circumstances. Points will be raised, like that mentioned by the honourable member for Barker (Mr . Archie Cameron). In the ranks of lawyers, and among a ll classes of agents and auctioneers, it has happened that a 'miserable type of person ha""s acted dishonestly. Should that occur, there will be a demand for the protection of the person who has been robbed or otherwise If an despoiled. That will lead to the establishment of a fund similar to the existing funds to cover defalcations by an auctioneer, agent or lawyer. The staff will grow, and we shall have a complete bureaucracy. The committee should view the matter reasonably. Is this the first step towards the establishment of : - staff to deal with annual registrations? Will it do a very wrong thing, by cirregister cumventing the law of the land ? Will a bureaucracy be established which will Lave an appetite for power, and grow on that on which. it feeds? I contend that this is the first step in that process, and that this is the proper time to mention it. I shall not stand idly by when. I see the first step being taken, without stating my views, because I will not have'it said later that, in. the year in which this provision was inserted in the act I had remained silent. I enter my protest now, because I see that what appears to be quite an innocuous clause is a move towards the establishment of a bureaucracy, and the doing of acts of injustice.",82
232,Mr WILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Robertson) [10.10]. - The honourable member for Reid (Mr . Lang) has been misleading the committee. He would have us believe that the right of appeal which tax agents now have is being taken from them. It. is not. Under the position as it. stands, the tax agent is registered. Ordinarily, he would register once, and his registration would carry on from year to year. This amendment of the act will make-it-obligatory-that he shall notify the board every year that he desires to continue to be registered. There is no injustice in that. A solicitor has to register every .year, pay fees, and make provision 'for carrying on his practice. As I have pointed out, tax agents act in a quasi-professional capacity. They have the confidence of taxpayers, and their clients deserve protection. That is the object of this proposal. The board is entitled to have up-to-date particulars in respect of every tax agent.",82
233,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Does the honourable member say that refusal of a renewal to register would be a cancellation of registration?,83
234,Mr WILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"There is no provision for refusal to renew a registration. All that the proposed new section provides is that, in each year, the tax agent shall notify the board, in a form approved by the board, that he desires to continue to be registered, and that he shall furnish the board with the particulars that are specified in the form. The right of appeal which has existed is not to he affected. Even though a tax agent may be disqualified for the reasons set out in section 251K, he will still have the right of appeal. It is idle to argue that any injustice is being done. All that is proposed is that the board shall be placed in a position to obtain full particulars concerning any person who is carrying on the business or profession of a tax agent. To argue that the right of appeal will be affected, or that an injustice will be done, is to mislead the committee.",83
235,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"New England) [10.13]. - I cannot see any reason whatever for the enactment of the proposed new secmentioned tion, except that mentioned by the honourable member for Eeid (Mr Lang) - the establishment of another departsecret ment. It is easy for honourable members to smile when such a statement is made. Unfortunately for the people of Austhe tralia, that is continually happening. Under the principal act a person had make application to become a registered tax agent. Section 251K providesA board may cancel the registration of any appointed tax agent upon being satisfied that(a) any return which has been prepared by or on behalf of the tax agent 183] is false in'any material particular; unless the tax agent establishes to the satisfaction of the board that he had no knowledge of the falsity or that the falsity Was due to his inadvertence; (b) the tax agent*(i ) has neglected the 'business of a principal;. (i i ) has been guilty of misconduct as a tax agent; or (i i i ) is not a fit and proper person toremain registered ; Why have these agents to be registered annually? Apparently an agent was competent when he was registered by the - board. Is it proposed under this clause Ihat another section shall be added to provide for an annual examination by the board? The honourable member for Eobertson (Mr Williams) said that a solicitor has to register his office each year; but there is no question of testing hi3 competence each year to decide whether he is entitled to continue in practise.",83
236,Mr WILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It is not proposed tb d'o that under this clause.,83
237,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Then why is an agent required to register every year?,83
238,Mr WILLIAMS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is the same thing.,83
239,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No , it is not. A taxation agent has to register, and the purpose of that registration is to ensure that he is competent to practise. This provision will result in the establishment of a pretty little staff and there will probably be a fee charged for reregistration of an agent. I cannot see any reason why the agent should have to be reregistered. Then there is the case by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), in which a taxation agent was apparently sending information , to the department that certain taxation returns were not true. I am not altogether satisfied with composition of the board. There are two government officer's, one from the to Sub-Treasury and the other a nominee of the chief audit officer of the .State concerned. The third member is by the Governor General. If a question of assessment arises they might tend to encourage taxation agents to furnish secret information to the department, because those agents have to serve their masters. If any member of the board knew what was happening in the case mentioned by the honourable member for Barker he flagrantly violated his duty in that he did not ensure that the tax agent was deregistered. Tho only purpose I can see for requiring tax agents to reregister every year is to create an embyro department and to extract an annual fee from them. Clause agreed to. Clauses 34 to 37 agreed to.

Clause 38 sets out the assessments to which the several amendments to be made by the bill shall apply. The amendment proposed to be made by paragraph p of clause 24 is complementary to that proposed by clause 17. It was accordingly intended that both of these amendments should apply to assessments based ou income derived during the year ending the 30th June, 1947, and subsequent years. With respect to clause 17, this intention will be given effect by sub-clause 7 of clause 38. Through inadvertence, however, the complementary amendment made by paragraph p of clause 24 was expressed to apply to the same assessments as the other amendments included in clause 24. Thus the amendment to be made by clause 24 (p) has been incorrectly expressed to apply to assessments based on income derived during the year ending the 30th June, 1948, and subsequent years.

245,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am not offering any objection to the remarks of the honourable member for Darwin, hut I thought the committee had disposed of the clause.",84
246,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member for Darwin must confine her remarks to the clause under discussion, namely, the application of the amendments.",84
247,Dame ENID LYONS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I wish to reply to certain remarks which the Treasurer made concerning clause 24,85
248,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member is not entitled to refer to any previous debate, but only to the proposed application of the amendments.",85
249,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I rise to a point of order. I draw attention to the fact that sub-clause 5 of this clause provides that amendments effected by section 24 of the act shall apply to all assessments for the financial year beginning on the 1st July and all subsequent years. Therefore, I suggest that the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) is quite in order in offering reasons why those amendments should not apply to those assessments, and to do so by showing that the amendments made by section 24 are inappropriate.",85
250,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable member is not entitled to discuss whether the amendments are appropriate or not. The matter has already been decided.,85
251,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,But no decision has been made in respect of clause 38.,85
252,The CHAIRMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"A decision has been made on clause 24. Clause, as amended agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report-h y leave-adopted . THIRD READING. Motion (by Mr Chifley)-h y leaveproposedThat the bill be now read a third time.",85
253,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [10.27] - A great number of the amendments' written into the Income Tax Assessment Act are, as we have observed during the discussion on this and other bills of the kind, designed to get rid of the operation of certain decisions of the courtsto render them no longer applicable to a similar set of circumstances. [ take this opportunity to point out that this practice has done more than anything else to clutter up the income tax laws by converting them from a statement of general principle into a wilderness of single instances. In order to deal with one particular case a particular formula must be worked out. My experience, and that of most other persons who have had to consider these provisions in detail, is that every time we amend the legislation we add to the difficulties of construing the act, and of reconciling one provision with another. I do not say that by way of criticism of taxation officers. My experience of them has been very happy. I think they are a very able - lot of men, and in my own State, where I have my own modest transactions with them, the Deputy Commissioner is, I think, an uncommonly wise man. The only complaint I have against taxation officials is one which I could perhaps make against most of us in this Housethey have an easy disposition to believe in their own omniscience. When they find that the High Court has knocked out their interpretation of a section, their immediate reaction is to amend the act, hecause their view of the matter must be made right, whatever the lawyers have to say about it. The result is that a long list of amendments comes along to meet that particular case.",85
254,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Quite properly in some instances, I believe.",85
255,Mr MENZIES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"In some instances, yes; but as to others I have grave doubts. The result of applying this policy so resolutely is that a complicated set of rules has been built up, and the job of interpreting the act is very difficult. In 1934-35 a royal commission was established to examine income tax law, with the result that we made a fresh departure with what is now the principal act. Since then, however, the same policy has been continued. I beg the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) to lay a restraining hand on the powers that be in the Taxation Department so as to get them to consider that occasionally the taxpayer may be right, in addition to being told by the High Court that he is right; and to consider, also, that these attempts to alter the law to meet the one particular case may create confusion in. twenty other cases. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA AND ARBITRATION BILL 1947. Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.
