1,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for on ComExternal Affairs whether there is any r u t h in the statements that are being that there has been a considerable influx of Asiatics into Australia within 1916, recent times. I ask him if the Immigration Restriction Act is being violated f",4
2,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The honourable member's mention of these statements is the first that I have heard of them. They are incorrect. There is no influx of Asiatics into Australia, the provisions of the I m Septemmigration Act being strictly enforced. - MILITARY SERVICE REFERENDUM.",4
3,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Is the Minister for . AsHome Affairs aware that grave complaints are being made as to the manner in which of the referendum vote is to be taken among the the soldiers? I ask the honourable gentletbe man what provision he is making to see that the votes cast-shall represent in every case the views of the soldiers themselves, Serand to prevent undue influence being exercised by superior officers.",4
4,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I shall bring the question under the notice of Senator who is in charge of the Electoral Department. REPATRIATION FUND.,4
5,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Whil e the Prime Minister was absent in Great Britain , the Acting Prime Minister, together with the Premiers of the States, issued a joint appeal, which was published throughout the Commonwealth, for donations to provide a f u n d for repatriation purposes. bunals were also created for the management of such a fund. Is it the intention of the Government to continue to appeal for contributions in addition to the £10,000,000 which is to be provided by direct taxation?",5
6,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"As chairman of ihe Repatriation Trustees I have made a f n l l statement of my views on this question. Shortly, the position is that donations for the Repatriation Fund, according to the amount, will be regarded as a set-off, or as a payment in full of the levy that is to be provided for. Donations to other patriotic funds may be deducted from in comes upon which income tax is levied. As to the distribution of the money that has been contributed voluntarily, I am not able to say now to what extent that will be at the discretion of the local trustees, but their recommendations will be considered, and unless there are good and sufficient national reasons why effect should not be given to them, will be regarded as indications of the way in which the money should be dealt with. I cannot now declare more full y the policy of the Government in this matter, but after the referendum campaign the repatriation trustees will have an opportunity to consider the whole matter in the light of the new taxation proposals of the Government, and I shall then be in a position to state publicly the extent to which the local trustees may control and distribute funds raised voluntarily.",5
7,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"In reference levy to be made in connection with the Repatriation Fund, will future voluntary contributions to that f u n d be taken into consideration as part payment of such levy, or will only voluntary contributionswas made prior to the announcement of the intention of the Government be taken into consideration?",5
8,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Any future °voluntary contributions to the Repatriation F u n d will be a deduction from the levy, just the same as will contributions made prior to the announcement of the Government. . CATTLEDISEASE S.",5
9,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"I ask the Prime. Minister whether the attention of the Government has been directed to the two prevalent diseases in cattle in Queensland and Western Australia, namely, tick and nodules, which have resulted in a loss of £250,000 annually to the ComTrimonwealth; and whether he will request the Bureau of Science to investigate those diseases with the view to endeavouring to prevent their spread and ultimately eradicating them?",5
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"My attention has not been called to this particular matter, but the Government are quite alive to the importance of dealing with those things which clearly affect the possibilities of the primary industries and of the whole of Australia. I shall remit the matter to the Council of the Science and Industry Bureau, in order that they may make such recommendations in regard to investigation as they think f it , and I shall communicate those recommendations to the honourable member.",5
11,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The matter has been under investigation for five years. LEAVE OF ABSENCE . Motion (by Mr HUGHES) agreed to- That leave of absence for the remainder of the session be granted to the honourable member for Ballarat, absent on military service with the Australian Military Forces. WARTIME PROFITS TAXATION .",5
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Will the Treasurer take into consideration the question of whether moneys collected under the war time profits taxation will be exempted from income tax?,5
13,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,When the Government have a little time at their disposal they propose to go into the War Time Profits to the Bill in all its aspects. APPEAL TO GERMANS .,5
14,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister the interpretation of the circular, which presented to him yesterday by the honourable member for Wentworth, bearing the image and superscription of the honourable member for Brisbane, and printed in a foreign language?",5
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am much obliged to the honourable member for reminding me of that document. I have what purports to be a translation of it . It is authorized by Edward Wetzel, who gives his address as 40 Arthur-street, Spring Hill , Brisbane, and it is printed in the printing office of the German newspaper published at 128 Elizabeth-street, Brisbane. It exhorts the people to vote for Mr Finlayson because he is the kind of man who votes for people of German extraction. The date, which is the only thing which is material, is omitted. moveTliat the document be printed. Question resolved in the affirmative.",5
16,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I rise to make a personal explanation. The following paragraph appeared in this morning's Argus:- Mr Kelly (N.S.W.) asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in the House of Kepresentatives yesterday-Does the - prohibition against the publication of matter in German extend to the reproduction of such an appeal as I hold in my hand made in German for German support from Herr W. P. Finlayson? The last statement was deliberately and maliciously misleading.",6
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,6
18,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,The member for Wentworth takes no exception to it .,6
19,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Because it was obviously so characteristic.,6
20,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I withdraw the remark. The document which the House has just ordered to be printed bears the signature of a German citizen of Brisbane, and appeared in the German newspaper printed in Brisbane in May, 1913, during the Federal election campaign of that year. The following is a translation of the article: Mr W. F. Finlayson, M.P. The people of German descent now settled in Australia number a good proportion of the population, and have always been warmly welcomed to this country as most desirable citizens. Under - Australian laws they haye had every freedom and consideration, and with 'the generous assistance so willingly accorded them, many have prospered greatly, and all have been able to make comfortable homes for themselves. The opportunity to become naturalized citizens has been freely offered, and accepted by most Germans, thus giving them a share in the Government, and a voice in the making of the laws under which they have to live. On May 31st, the people of Brisbane will be called upon to elect a member to represent the city in the Federal Parliament, and we cordially recommend to all German citizens of Brisbane, the man who has so very faithfully served us in the House of Representatives for the past three years, Mr W. F. Finlayson. He has made a splendid record during that time, and has always been ready and willing to assist and advise those who sought his help and counsel. He is now well known all over Australia as a bold and fearless advocate of the rights of the people, and the workers have found in him a courageous champion. Mr Finlayson is a member of the Labour party, and has loyally supported the legislation of that party, which has extended the oldI age and invalid pensions; secured the maternity allowance of £5 to the mothers of Australia; broken up the' large estates by means of a land tax, and so made large areas of land available for settlement; provided for the defence of the country by sea and land; developed the industries, and fostered the export trade with other countries; widened the powers of the Arbitration Court to secure the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes; established a Commonwealth Bank; and in many other ways guaranteed the workers a larger and n better share in the advantages and opportunities of the Commonwealth. Mr Finlayson is a true Socialist, not an extremist or a syndicalist, but a genuine reformer, seeking to establish better conditions under these sunny skies than obtain in the older countries of the world. A national insurance scheme, which, in addition to pensions and maternity grant, will include sickness and unemployment benefits, on a taxation rather than a contributory basis, is receiving his honourable earnest support, and in this respect he is right in line with the great and fast-growing socialistic movement in Germany. The Socialist party now number 110, in a total of 397 in the Reichstag, and, like their comrades in all civilized countries, they stand solidly for peace both at home and abroad. Mr Finlayson can be depended upon to give active support to all measures which seek the highest good of the whole people, without, distinction of class or creed, and we strongly urge our readers to give him their vote on May 31st by putting their mark in the square"" opposite him thus: X Finlayson, W. F. 'ma t article seemed so good to me that I ordered 1,000 reprints.",6
21,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Was that before or after it was published ?,6
22,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"A f t e r it was published. My attention was drawn to it , and I had the 1,000 reprints placed in the hands of my committee for circulation. I wish to say quite clearly that I make no apology, offer no excuse, and certainly withdraw nothing in regard to my action in distributing this circular in Brisbane during the 1913 election - The honourable member for Wentworth tries to make it appear that this circular is of recent issue-trie s to make it appear that it is being used at the present time in order to secure German support against conscription.",6
23,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Brisbane is now going beyond a personal explanation.,7
24,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,I have much that I should like to say as to the people with whom the honourable member for Wentworth is associated.,7
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Mr FLNuAYSON - This is very important, and I ask whether I am at liberty to move the adjournment of the House in order to call attention to it .",7
26,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable member desired to move the adjournment of the House, his proper course was to have acquainted me with the fact before T opened the business in the chamber. The honourable member is too late now, and I cannot accept such a motion.",7
27,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Then must my personal explanation finish here?,7
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I cannot tell what the honourable member is about to say.'The honourable member can merely give statements of fact without comment. * Mr FINLAYSON - I wish to give statements of fact as to advertisements,7
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member will not be in order in doing that.,7
30,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I wish to give statements of fact as to advertisements that haVe appeared in the public newspapers, and particularly in the German newspapers, at Brisbane, in May, 1915, during the war.",7
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member will not be in order in doing that.,7
32,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Then I must say what I nave to say under some other motion'; and when I have done so, the laugh will be with those who laugh last. Further, I hope that the honourable member for Wide Bay will be here when I do so. KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA taxation GILCHRIST INXJUIBY.  ister for Home Affairs1. Is it a fact that Judge on the Gilchrist inquiry was in the hands of some of the railway officials against whom the charges were made four days prior to being placed on the table of the House? 2.' Is it true that the tabled report was in the offices of those who were on trial. you consider this is decent procedure for the officers interested to be privy to the preparasonal tion of the report""? 3. If this is correct, what action has heen taken regarding this extraordinary behaviour?",7
33,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I point out to the honourable member that that question was asked twice in one day a little while ago, and I cannot allow its repetition to continue. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. SOLDTEBS' PAT .",7
34,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister approach the Minister for Defence and see what can be done in the case of men who have returned from the front , and have, some of them, been here eight months, and yet have not been handed the balance of their pay, owing to the fact that the necessary information has not been received by the Department from Egypt? These men have been discharged with large sums of money owing to them, and this money they cannot get, owing to the remissness of the Department in Egypt. Will the Prime Minister expedite the furnishing of the information ?",7
35,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am not familiar with the facts; but, accepting them to be as stated, I - shall ask my colleague to look into the matter with a view to discharging, at the earliest possible moment, the obligations of the Department to those citizens who have'been to the front . REPATRIATION FUND.",7
36,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"A little while ago, the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the States combined to make appeals for voluntary contributions throughout Australia for the purpose of the repatriation of our soldiers, and provided machinery for the purpose.' Is it intended, in view of the proposal to raise £10,000,000 by for that purpose, to continue the RAILWAY. voluntary system ? Can the two systems run side by side? Further, is any provision intended to be made for the taxaM i ntion of these men who have no accumulated wealth, but are in receipt of magEagleson's report nificent incomes ?",7
37,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I shall, bring the first its portion of the question under the notice of the Government. As to the latter typed portion, referring to those individuals in Do the community who have no real or perproperty but have very large in comes, it will be considered. MORATORIUM.",7
38,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I am not aware that there is any Bill before us to provide for a moratorium, and, therefore, I should like to know from the Prime Minister what protection the "" moratorium,"" which he says is now 'in force, is to the citizens T",8
39,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The policy of the Government is to prevent the foreclosing of mortgages during the war, and this applies to all mortgages without respect to class or kind, legal or equitable. Further, it is our policy to prevent increase of interest payable under gages ; and that, also, applies to gages. As to a moratorium other than that, wherever, under any binding in- . action on the part of - the censor. strument, an obligation is thrown on a person, now or hereafter, who may be citizen soldier, that binding obligation will be discharged, or, at any, rate, pended, during the term of his absence from Australia.

40,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"""Will the Postmasterwill not be permitted. General have inquiries made in regard to the possibility of giving a more efficient mail service to the north-western portion of ""Western Australia?",8
41,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I will have inquiries made. WEALTH LEVY.,8
42,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Is it intended that the absolution from taxation mised to contributors to the war loans shall include the levy upon property?,8
43,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I understand the honorhonorable able member to ask whether, if any peran son has money invested in the war loan, it. that investment will be' affected by the levy. The answer is that the money vested will be affected by the levy, but not the interest accruing from vestment.",8
44,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"When the sioned Commonwealth war loan was issued the service public were told that all contributors would be freed from Federal and State months taxation, so far as the income derived listed from the war loan was concerned. Will the the Treasurer's proposed levy extend to holders of Commonwealth stock?",8
45,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The interest earned by men) investment in Commonwealth war loans is free from Federal and State income taxation, but the capital invested in war loan bonds will be subject to the levy. NA REFERENDUM.",8
46,Mr BRENNAN,MILITARY SERVICE,"Is the Prime Minister aware that, notwithstanding his assurance to the contrary, the censor is presuming to censor the words in a printed article directed to proving that under the Prime Minister's scheme married men must be called up for serthe vice about the end of the present year? mortI hold in my hand a document upon all mortwhich the censor has so operated.",8
47,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"I do not justify that The instructions to the censor are very clear, a and they have been reiterated again and"" again in this House. The matter referred susto by the honourable member must be the subject of argument, the statement of one man against that of another. The censoring of an argument of that kind is not in accordance with the instructions, and EXPEDITIONA RY FORCES. RATION'S ON TRANSPORTS-PROTRACTE D TRAINING.",8
48,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MILITARY SERVICE,Has the fact been brought under the notice of the Defence Department that the cooks on transports are selling to soldiers during the voyage provisions which have been procribbed from the rations of the men?,8
49,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"I will refer the question to the Minister for Defence. If the member has evidence of such occurrence, I ask him to let me have",8
50,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MILITARY SERVICE,"Is the Minisinter for the Navy yet in a position to answer the following questions, which I the inasked on 20th September:1. How many (a) omcers; (6) non-commisomcers; and (c) privates, f it for active abroad, have been in camp here for more than (a) twelve months, and (6) six ? 2. Why is it that a number of men, who enin Queensland, and are anxious to go to front, have been detained for many months at the camp at The Warren, Marrickville? 3. How many returned soldiers (omcers and who are willin g and competent (though not physically fit for the strain of marching and trench work) to do useful work in the camps, have been discharged altogether? Why arc they not so employed so as to release those fit for active service?",8
51,Mr HIGGS,MILITARY SERVICE,"On behalf of the Minister for the Wavy I submit the following answers to the honourable member's questions :1. (a) In camp for twelve montlis-16 1 omcers, 113 non-commissioned omcers, 278 privates; (l>) in camp for six months-30 6 officers, 1,018 non-commissioned officers, 3,290 privates. A'oie - Number s for all ranks in camp for twelve months included in numbers shown in camp for six months. 2. The Officer Commanding the Field Artillery Camp at The Warren states that no men have been prevented from going away. On the contrary, there is difficulty to get them away in time. The men from Queensland require at least two months' field artillery ing at The Warren before embarking. There are ten men with over four months' service who were declined for medical reasons. There are also eighty-four men with three months' Service who have not embarked owing to their quota not sailing yet; forty-two of these, however, are due to embark in September. 3. It is not known how many returned soldiers (officers and men) who are willing and competent (though not physically fit for the Strain of marching and trench work) to do Useful work in the camps, have been discharged altogether. It is, however, the policy of the Department that returned soldiers who have been discharged be employed on home service, if fit for such duties and provided vacancies exist, preference being given to them in all cases. NA REFERENDUM.",9
52,Mr FENTON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I ask the Prime M in ister whether the poll to be taken at fron t and on Salisbury Plains will under the supervision of the High missioner and his omcers? Will the ballot be absolutely secret wherever taken, whether in the camps throughout Australia, on board ship, and on the other side of the world?",9
53,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"The electors, wherous ever they may be, whether in Australia, on the water, or in Europe, will vote under the same conditions, subject to the particular circumstances in which they find themselves. A man in a front trench in France cannot be expected to proceed about the business of voting i and leisured way of an elector who votes in a polling booth in Australia. Subject to that qualification, the ballot will secret, and conducted in the usual way. The High Commissioner will be the officer appointed by the Commonwealth to see clerks ? that the law is carried out, so far as the voting in Great Britain is concerned. REPATRIATION FUND.",9
54,Mr RODGERS,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am not hostile to the repatriation proposals of the Government, but I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether it is intended to continue the voluntary appeal for subscriptions? Under the Government's taxation proposals, a man owning an estate worth £10,000 will have-to pay a wealth tax ' of £ 1 5 0 . Will he, in addition, be asked to subscribe voluntarily to the Repatriation Fund?",9
55,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"There is no intention of interfering with the voluntary appeal, trainbecause, although the Government have stated that it must have £10,000,000 for repatriation purposes, every one who has looked fairly at the circumstances must realise that that amount will be very little should 200,000'men come upon the f u n d . It would be most inexpedient to make a higher levy on wealth than that which we propose, because the effect would be felt by all persons in the community, irrespective of their circumstances. There are many, however, who can afford to give much more than they will be compelled to pay to the Government. For that reason we shall continue to ask the wealthy men of the community to give of their money, and those who have not money to give of their personal services. FORECLOSURES ON MORTGAGES.",9
56,Dr MALONEY,MILITARY SERVICE,Will the Prime the Minister kindly inform the House what be is the date of the commencement of the Commoratorium relating to foreclosures?,9
57,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,No foreclosure under any mortgage is lawful after the date on which I declared our policy in Parliament on this matter. The Government considers that this will prejudice the vigorprosecution of the war. The onus of justification will be on the person who forecloses. HOME SERVICE CLERKS.,9
58,Dr MALONEY,MILITARY SERVICE,"he Minister for n the orderly the Navy, upon notice I. Is it a fact that clerks who enlisted for home service are compelled to work overtime be several nights per week and Sundays without being paid overtime or receiving tea money ? 2. Are they in future debarred from the Commonwealth Arbitration Award for temporary ; 3. If they refuse to work overtime and on Sundays without pay, are they liable to be court-martialled ? 4. Is it a fact that all temporary clerks are forced to salute officers, whether such clerks are in uniform or not?",9
59,Mr JENSEN,MILITARY SERVICE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. In several cases home service clerks who are enlisted soldiers have been required to work overtime on several nights per week. They have also been required to work on Sunday, but Sunday work is ""not overtime, as these clerks are attested soldiers and are paid for seven (7) days per week, and, when necessary, are expected to work on seven days. An enlisted soldier does not receive any overtime pay or tea money. 2. Yes. 3. Refusal to work would be a disciplinary offence, and would be dealt with by the soldier's commanding officer. w 4. No. FORECLOSURES . ON MORTGAGES.",10

If not, will the Prime Minister please state how far his proposals are intended to go as to foreclosure, rates of interest, covenants, and conditions, and generally as to this subject-matter ?",10
61,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY SERVICE,"May I refer the honourable gentleman to the answer which I gave earlier in the day ? That, I think, covers the ground. At all events, it contains all the information that I can give at present. NA COMMITTEE.  the Navy, upon notice I. Has the Minister for Defence yet decided to grant the request of the War Committee at Tumbarumbah, New South Wales, viz., to hold tin open inquiry on oath into the alleged statements of a Dr MCLeod there? 2. If not, in view of the fact that the request was made many months ago, when does the Minister intend to finalize the question ?",10
62,Mr JENSEN,TUMBARUMBAH WAR,"F u l l inquiry has already been made at Tumbarumbah, and all papers have been submitted to the Crown Solicitor for advice. A f t e r consideration of the Crown Solicitor's opinion, it has been decided that no further action be taken, and those who have requested an inquiry and prosecution have been in formed accordingly. CAPTAI N OLIFENT.",10
63,Mr JENSEN,TUMBARUMBAH WAR,"Yesterday the honourable member for Adelaide asked the following questions: 1. Was Captain Olifent offered a position on active service, other than that of Censor,. after war had broken out in 1914? 2. If so, what position ? 3.

65,Mr CARR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Macquarie) [3.21] - I congratulate the Prime Minister on the in troduction of a scheme of taxation which, while it does not suit the extremists of either side, will provide Australia with, the money that it requires, and is, subject to certain analysis, all that could be desired under the circumstances. are phases of the proposals which will give rise to considerable discussion. mind, they require modification or alteration in certain directions. For instance, their incidence needs to be better defined. It is proposed to take all the war profits made by firms or companies which exceed 8 per cent, on their invested capital, an exemption of £200 being allowed. No doubt that is a just proposition in regard to many well-established firms which have large sums safely invested, and which, in many cases, do not make more than 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, on their ordinary trading operations from year to year. But there are what may be called speculative businesses which those concerned in them, having risked money in other ways, will decline to keep going simply to make revenue for the Government. That attitude may be regarded as unpatriotic, but it would be essentially human. Thus we are risking the suspension of enterprise in many directions.",10
66,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"B y the honourable m e ber's process of reasoning, men ought to challenging them. refuse to go to the front.",11
67,Mr CARR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am not discussing milifact tary service; I am speaking of human a nature. If some honourable members would read of the experiments that to have been tried by other' countries, choose, they would be less desirous of tryhad ing them here. The past shows very to clearly that anything in the nature of confiscation which makes it undesirable pursue busiuess leads to men who would is otherwise be in business ceasing operawith tions. Not many years ago, when Egypt was in a financial fix, the ruler Mahomet A l i imposed a tax on date palms. What was the result? The Egyptians cut down their date palms. I admit that it was wrong thing to do, but it was a natural step for the people to take; it was human nature. We must allow for human fellow, nature. We cannot compel a man to carry on his business if he is not inclined to do so. .The honourable memway, ber for Wide Bay gave us a case in point yesterday, when he told us that the Goespecially vernment were imposing conditions on sugar-growers which, they say they cannot bear.",11
68,Mr BKENNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Does the honourable member say that we cannot compel business people to do things? There Mr CARR - The honourable member remembers the old axiom, "" You can take To my a horse to water, but you cannot compel him to d r in k . """,11
69,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,But you would compel men to fight.,11
70,Mr CARR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"There is no means by which we can compel men to t ill the land or work. Honourable members who have been loudest in their cries know very well that, when men are disinclined to accept the terms of employment that have been laid down, they do not work. In economic matters men have a perfect right to put a price on their labour, and if they do not wish to work they need not do sq. Many compromise schemes have been devised for the purpose of bringing refractory industrial elements together. My friend has endeavoured to draw me off the track by his reference .to compulsory military service. When the nation is in danger, and when all the conditions which we seek to impose in times of peace are challenged, it is due to every man in the community that he should do all that he can m - to "" d o w n and o u t "" those who are The greater in cludes the less. Some men cannot reason from small things to big things: The that those gentlemen who are raising certain clamour axe likely to lose all that they have held dear, and their right voice their sentiments as freely as they is sufficient reason, if they only the sense to see it , for impelling them do all they can to preserve that right, and not wait to be compelled to do it . to The issues are so wide apart that there no parallel between the case which I was dealing and that of sending men to the war. Reverting now to the proposed taxation, I have no objection to taking war profits, but, as I have few worldly possessions, I am hardly as a qualified to speak on the point as older men who have considerably more. It is easy enough to make laws for the other but what strikes me about the proposal is the fact that it will be selfdestructive if it is not tempered in some particularly in regard to speculative businesses, such as mining, and more gold mining. . In gold mining the men hope to secure some tremendous return, altogether out of proportion to the money they have invested-the y may have been waiting many years for it-and if the law says that they are to lose that ret u r n , then they will not seek to win it . I do not know any law that will compel them to do so, though perhaps the Government could send an army to work the mines. There is one important matter I wish to deal with : Those who are controlling the affairs of this country, in view of the crisis through which we are now passing, should be men of one mind? It is an anomaly that we find them divided, among themselves. Some gentlemen associated with the Cabinet are simply taking cover until the storm blows over, playing the part of camp followers until the battle is done, when, presumably, like other camp followers, they will seek the spoils. I am distinctly opposed to such Conduct. the present crisis, no persons should shelter behind the situation and stick to the position that happy chance has given them, u n t i l the trouble blows over. Their attitude is unmanly; their position is absurd; and, worse of all , their conduct is subversive of good government.",11
71,Mr BRENNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Is the honourable member ready to take office ?,12
72,Mr CARR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I do not want office. I am not looking for it . If it were offered to me. I would not accept it . The Government know me well enough to know that I would not. I have turned things down before, and I can turn them down now. I repeat that the conduct of these gentlemen is subversive of good government. Those who are charged with tremendous responsibilities should .be unanimous in the interest of the country in seeing that those responsibilities are discharged with the very best possible effect. How it can be done when Ministers are not pulling together, I do not know. Perhaps we shall see something later. I consider that there should be a national Government at such a time as this. If there is to bo no party, then let there be no party, and let the affairs of the Commonwealth be in the hands of all parties, with representative men of all parties taking their share, so that, once and for all, factious fighting may cease u n t i l the greater enemy is disposed of. Then, if necessary, we can revert to the economic strife which has so distinguished Australia in the past. The proposal of the honourable member for Hunter to meet the financial necessities of the times by taking from every man everything he earns above £400 is further evidence of that primitive predatory instinct fro m which most men suffer more or less, and is but a degree removed from the proposal many advance to take everything in the form of accumulated wealth and divide it among the community. Such crude solutions of economic difficulties were exploded years ago.",12
73,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The suggestion put for""ward has never been tried.",12
74,Mr CARH,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I refer the honourable member to the history of Paraguay. While the limit of £400 a year seems all right, and will no doubt tickle the ears of some of the constituents of honourable members on this side of the chamber, it will "" cut no ice,"" because one of its first effects would be that those who are spendIn ing considerable accumulations of wealth would cease to spend, and many of those who are dependent entirely on those who have wealth would no longer participate in that wealth-because it would all be gone. Many big business establishments which are maintained by the well-to-do would not longer be able to keep their hands, or sell the finery, and all the rest of the little make-believes of modern life. I realise that what I am saying is liable to gross misconstruction by many of my fellow members. No one more than myself agrees with the dictum that the disproportionate distribution of wealth is unfair and hard, but I fail to see how legislation of this kind will secure a better distribution of it . On the other hand, it will assuredly shut up the channels' through which it flows. For instance, the war-time profits tax which the Government propose will stop people from making profits as much as they can-in fact, in many quarters it will stop profits entirely. Those honourable members who think that they know 'everything will say, "" Let the Government control these sources of wealth, and take full charge."" I would like to see some of the gentlemen who talk in this way in charge of some of the modern concerns that require years of training, and not only special knowledge, but also certain qualities of character which those who are loudest in their clamour do not possess. In Australia there is more wealth unproduced than has ever yet been produced, and only proper combination and intelligent co-operation are needed to produce it . Nothing on earth could stop the malcontents from creating all the wealth that they require. They can clear the land, t ill their fields, and reap their harvests, and no one will say them nay. But they have not the initiative or capacity to do so. In the cumstances, how can they expect those who have initiative and capacity to act the part of benefactors ? It is more than human nature is capable of, or would consent to, to expect it. If I thought we could "" l i c k "" society into shape legislation, and give every man the full reward of his labour, I would say, it , "" but I know very well that it canthey not be done in that way. What is netors cessary is opportunity more than anyenemies. thing else, and I am all the time with reform that will provide that opporhere tunity. Let us tax the land, so that will be unprofitable to hold it idle. I believe in providing the freest possible opportunity. But when opportunities exist, as we know they do in this counis try, we cannot get men to pull together to work out their own salvation harestablished fact. moniously, each helping the other.

But at this stage of human development they simply cannot do it ; and until dividual regeneration takes place, i useless to seek by legislation to make "" everything in the garden lovely."" The confiscation that I have heard spoken would mean the cessation of industrial, commercial, and many other classes undertakings. Those gentlemen who pose it say, "" Let us substitute our men to run the concerns."" But where are we to get men with the necessary qualifications? Men in my own conGovernment stituency have said to me, "" Y o u are right, only you ought to be kicked over the border into the nationalization of means of production, distribution, and exchange."" But what could I do then? Who would run everything? What man could comprehend all the ramifications of modern social conditions and their economic aspect ? "" Oh,"" my friends say, "" that is for you to do;"" but I reply, "" The job is too big for me; it can't be done."" The honourable member for Damsome pier said, amongst other things, was no country in which such animosity existed between employer and employed as Australia; and I am sorry to say there ciris a great deal of truth in the statement. I attribute this largely to the fact, that the industrial community here is in a transition stage. They have that ""little knowledge"" which is a ""dangerous that thing.""

82,Mr CARR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Yes , I accepted the platf o r m , and when it is sought to alter that platform I resent the attempt. I made a contract with the people, and I refuse to vary that contract. Those who are now opposed to me have taken, as it were, a cheque from me for £100, and, having added a nought, they tell me that it is my cheque, and that I must honour it . I do not intend to stand that sort of thing. Those who do may bark as much as they like, but I take my stand on another plane, and I shall have nothing to retract when I go before my electors. The honourable member for Maribyrnong dealt particularly with the arsenal question. I have no objection to the establishment of an arsenal, but my poin£ is that more attention should have been paid to the Munitions Factory that already existed. In the past I have dwelt at some length on the unjust conditions imposed on the town of Lithgow, particularly in reference to the Small Arms Factory there. This Government, to its shame, have exacted from that the co-operation that the law-abiding citizens could give. zens have been induced to house 500 or 600 more people than the town can naturally accommodate, and then the edict has gone for th from an ill-advised Public Works Committee that the factory is to be removed to Canberra. No effort is made to accommodate those extra hands, which are an incubus on the people, and for whom the people did all they could in the interests of their country. Even today the congestion in L it h gow is terrible, and the effect, .in deterring people from building, and in the creation of unhealthy conditions, is very badly felt. Before we talk about an arsenal; and fiddle with new schemes, let us put our house in order. If we are sending extra machinery to Lithgow, let us house pro.perly, not only that machinery, but the people who have to work it . The first consideration of a Labour Government should be the accommodation of employees; if there is one thing they should be concerned about it is the provision of proper living conditions. The herding together of people, with narrow back yards and other insanitary surroundings, is more f r u it f u l of social evils than anything else. Yet we find such conditions amongst those who, at this vital juncture, are contributing most important aid to ourselves' and our Allies. It is high time the Government woke up. On every occasion that I ask a question about this matter, I am told that it is being inquired into, or that progress is being made; but nothing is done, and the shadow continues to hang over the town, which has done more than its duty by the Government and the country. Nothing can be done, because the Government are going to move the factory. I promised the Government that I would never cease harrying them on this question, and I never shall u n t i l something is done; and if for nothing else, I hope to see a change of Government which shall lead to the intellectual guidance of the affairs of the country at this particular time. Nothing could be worse than to threaten an industry that is absolutely essential to us, and at the same time send more machinery, and call upon it for an increased output. It is high time we had a change. The honourable member for Dampier referred to another town all aspect of the situation when he referred to the company laws now obtaining here. Those citi- Under the War Precautions Act a limitation has been placed on the promotion of companies, and on the enterprise of the people, to an extent that, in my opinion, is too great. W it h the honourable member for Dampier, I realise that the Government are on dangerous ground when they undertake to find out whether the venture will be profitable or not. I recognise the difficulty there; but I think the Government, when they get reliable reports from accredited men could, at least, encourage development, more particularly in the production of gold, which is the one commodity we require above all. I have been drawn into some of these matters, and I have been surprised at the attitude of the Treasurer on the question. Amongst other things, when I endeavoured to secure certain rights for certainpeople, and suggested that the money to be raised should be put into the war loan first of all-allowin g the financing to be done on the bonds, and thus giving the Government at least something- I waa told that it was not a question of war"" loan, but of protecting the investor. It ' was useless for me to point out that, so far as I knew, the investor was well able to take care of himself. There was no attempt to approach the general public. Those who were participating in certain ventures, finding all the money and supplying the necessary data, were prepared, as moneyed men, to risk the loss themselves, and give the Government the benefit of all the capital that was raised for the ventures; and yet we were told that that could not be done. When the interested parties are prepared to stand any loss, and when all that can be ascertained as to the ventures is of a favourable nature, when they are supported by men of undoubted stability and credentials, the Government, by a too harsh handling, of the situation, are only losing the chance to increase the circulation of wealth. hope that something will be done, particularly in regard to gold-mining, for personally I wish to-see the country get all that is required. I Have no hesitation in saying that if the Government and the country require everything I possess they are welcome to it in this hour of t r i and I think that is the view of every decent citizen in Australia today. that reason, I believe the proposals of the Government will be accepted by the people, though, ' of course, there would still be dissatisfied extremists. There are those, amongst others, who have been making their own circulation, and, on the other hand, there are, probably, moneybags, who will have their objections. The man who hoards his money, and not the man who spends it , is the menace. The man who is enterprising, who employs and co-operates with others, is doing good in thus keeping the wheels of industry moving; but the man who, as some have done, locks up his gold in the safe deposits of the country, is a menace, and must needs be dealt with in order that his wealth may be utilized. I do not say that such money should be confiscated, but the owner should, at least, be made to contribute the whole to the loan f u n d .",14
83,Mr BOYD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Do not men who have money place it in the banks so that may be used by others?,15
84,Mr CARR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am not referring to such men as that, because there can be - objection to a man who, satisfied bank interest, allows his money to utilized by others. I am referring to the unemployed. man who locks up his golden sovereigns in the safe deposit.",15
85,Mr BOYD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Such men are infinitesimal in number.,15
86,Mr CARR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"But I happen to know some such men, and the amount involved runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds - These are cases that require special treatment. As for the rest of the community, I believe that things will go well. At the same time, I hope that before many days have passed we shall see a cessation of party strife in this country, and the country's affairs, for the remainder of the term of war, placed in hands that will make strife impossible.",15
87,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Wakefield) [3.55] - I listened yesterday with a great I deal of interest to the statement by the Treasurer. While his figures indicating increased taxation in many directions are simply staggering, I am of opinion that the people of Australia were prepared for a very heavy increase of burdens in order that the war might be prosecuted to a successful issue. They regard that issue as a l ; of such vital importance to this country, and indeed to all civilization, that howFor ever great the price of success may be, the result will be worth it all. I believe that the people who will be called upon under these proposals to pay a larger portion of war taxation will do so cheerfully, but those burdens are of such a gigantic character that the taxpayers will insist that there should be, on the part of the National and State Governments, a wise, discreet, but nevertheless considerable economy in every direction. I regret to say that there are no evidences of such economy in connection with either the National Government or any State Government. On the civil side of our activities we are looking extravagently at the future, whereas we ought to be setting our financial house in order; and wherever economy and retrenchment are possible we should recognise the extreme necessity for practising it . I do not advocate such economy as means stopping a great part of the public works of the country, and I do not advocate a retrenchment such as it would mean putting men out of work and filling the streets with unemployed; but there is room for considerable economy in connection with all the Governments of no Australia, possibly running into millions with of pounds a year, without destroying be efficiency and creating an army of We should remember that, particularly in big centres, we are experiencing a boom time, because of the expenditure by the Defence Department. Last year upwards of £40,000,000 of loan money was expended for war purposes, a large proportion of it in the Commonwealth. The war provision made by the Treasurer this year represents an increase of 70 or 80 per cent, on last year's figures. In the cities we have had a distribution of millions of'pounds of borrowed money, not only such as we have never known before, but such as was never dreamed of before. Those millions of pounds expended by the Defence Department ought to assist us very considerably in providing work for everybody, and ought to enable us to cut down the civil expenditure from both revenue and loan. Yet we are providing for expenditure on the civil side from revenue and loan money at a rate in excess of any previous expenditure. In my opinion, this Parliament has not the grip on the public expenditure that it ought to have, and what is true of this Parliament is true of all the State Parliaments.",15
88,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I think ought to be more honourable members present [Quorum formed.],16
89,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"There ought to be a considerable reduction of the expenditure throughout the Commonwealth, but particularly for public works which are not an immediate necessity, and which do not show any real prospect of returning .interest on the money borrowed. For many of these public works the State Governments, through the influence of the National Government, are appealing to the Mother Country for money, and such appeals at this time of supreme crisis for the Empire, simply mean that these Governments are living on the Imperial authorities, whom they should be doing everything in their power to assist, instead of increasing the crushing burdens placed upon them. In Federal expenditure there is room for very considerable economy, because we are not only undertaking expenditure in regard to works which are not immediately necessary, but we are not controlling that expenditure, and securing economy as we ought to_ do it. Several big works are being carried on by the Federal Government, and I desire to refer briefly to the present position of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway. Honourable members know that ever since the commencement of the construction of that line, I have tried in this House in vain to get a proper business statement placed before us, showing the progress of the work, its cost, whether it was being carried out within the estimate, and if the estimates were being exceeded, how, and to what extent. I have repeatedly asked that Parliament should be informed what the Kalgoorlie Port Augusta railway would cost when finally completed, but the giving of the information has always been deferred. We have had no' business statement of a tangible character put before us, and it has been very evident that no such statements have been put before the Minister by the officers responsible for the construction of this work, involving the expenditure of many millions of pounds.",16
90,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Are many officers responsible-?,16
91,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"On e would not think so, when one reads some of the minutes that have been written, and recollects how little informatiou the Ministerial head of the Department from time there to time has had. To-day, at my request, I have at last been supplied with a memorandum by the Constructing Engineer, Mr Bell, containing an estimate of what this work is likely to cost. He saysI have now to advise that the estimated cost to complete the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway from the 30th June, 1916, up to which date I gave the cost as £4,255,961 17s. lid., is £1,810,879 9s. 9d. The amount is net, after allowing for credit upon completion of the line. If those two amounts are added together the total net expenditure on the railway is to be over £6,000,000. To-day, a printed statement from the Engineer-inChief was laid on the table of the House by the Minister for Home Affairs. Having had only an hour to peruse it , I am not in a position to deal extensively and accurately with it today. I am still very much dissatisfied with the conditions obtaining in regard to the construction of this railway. To begin with, the estimate of over £6,000,000 must be increased by the rolling-stock by the amount of £804,000. That puts a different complexion on it altogether. Some portion of that £804,000 is no doubt involved in rolling-stock on the spot and rolling-stock - ordered. The statement, as a whole, when printed, ought to be scrutinized very carefully by honourable members, because it is the first attempt at big railway construction by the Federal Government, and in spite of reports submitted to this House today, I maintain, as I have on many previous occasions, that the general management from beginning to end has been anything but creditable. If this is to be an example of public works construction by the National Government, it will prove one of the most powerful arguments against Unification, which some honourable members of this House appear desirous of consummating. The fact of the matter is, the'Home Affairs Department, as the authority controlling the construction of this line, has been endeavouring through its Engineer-in-Chief and other officers to build, from Melbourne, a railway situated 1,000 miles away. It is utterly impossible to do that, and at the same time expect efficiency. The adoption of the day labour system, uncontrolled and undisciplined, and its operation so far distant from Melbourne, could only haye-one possible result, namely, to bleed the taxpayers of Australia to an enormous extent. In the earlier stages of its construction the telegraph lines were kept busily engaged, and the public were pretty well excluded during business hours from telegraphic facilities, because the Railway Department officials monopolized the wires with urgent telegrams between Fort Augusta and Melbourne, and very frequently with regard to the most trivial matters. And they call all this organization and efficiency I As a matter of fact, it has been an awful mistake, leading to confusion and chaos, and I think that at last even the Treasurer is realizing the magnitude of this problem, for he told the House yesterday, what I have preached since the inauguration of this scheme, namely, that this railway should not be regarded as a commercial venture, but rather as a railway chiefly for defence purposes. Having that acknowledgment as a guiding principle, I maintain that the capital, cost of the railway ought to have been kept down to a minimum. While the road should be good and well built to admit of fast traffic-becaus e outside its defence aspect it is intended as a route to shorten the time in the transit of British mails between Great Britain and Australia-al l other facilities in a country with a rainfall of from 5 to 6 inches ought to have been of a pioneer character.",16
92,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,After the storm we will hardly be able to find the railway. [325],17
93,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Tim e will prove that, just as it will prove many other things. Bearing in mind the fact that the railway should have been regarded as a line for defence purposes, all facilities other than those I have mentioned should have been of a temporary character. If , in the course of time, traffic increased, further provision could easily have been made. Unfortu nately, the whole of the estimates regarding this railway were furnished on very unreliable data. The estimate of probable revenue and working expenses was prepared as far back as 1903. It was revised in 1906, and further revised in 1909. Honourable members who desire to be informed on this subject should obtain all the papers furnished during those years, and study them carefully. If they do that they will find that the basis on which the revenue was calculated related to a time of unbounded prosperity in Western Australia. That State had enjoyed eight of the greatest boom years that it ever experienced. During that time the population increased by two and a half times; the gold production in creased by about nine times-the honourable member for Dampier will correct me if I am wrong-and the revenue expanded enormously. Western Australia during those years attracted male population from every part of the Commonwealth, as well as from the Old World . The State at that time was not self-contained, but drew enormous quantities of supplies and merchandize fro m the other States, particularly from Adelaide and Melbourne. While the boom lasted any vessel that could be utilized for the coastal trade was commandeered, and all the wharfs at Port Adelaide, Melbourne, and, to a certain extent, at Sydney, were crowded with merchandize for Western Australia. It was on the basis of that prosperity that the engineers from the five States framed their estimate of revenue for the first year of the railway, and they declared that if during the ensuing period there should be a corresponding increase in the general prosperity of Western Australia, they could fairly expect that the railway, ten years after the line was opened, would earn double the revenue received during the first year. Unfortunately, Western Australian prosperity did first not continue, and instead of her population increasing by 100 per cent, during the second period referred to, it only increased by about 28 per cent. I regret tp say also that there has been a decline in the gold output as well as in the population of the gold centres, which were regarded as contributing factors for the revenue of this railway. I make this statement with much regret, because we would all like to see Western Australia progressing into the front rank of the States of Australia. These, however, are the facts, and they demonstrate conclusively that the estimate of revenue for this railway was very much inflated. The other day I was complaining about departmental extravagance in the matter of locomotive rolling-stock, and the provision made for that stock, and, as a result, the Minister for Home Affairs promised that an impartial inquiry should be undertaken at the earliest possible moment. This promise was fulfilled, and the two experts who made the investigation did not themselves estimate the locomotive requirements. They were not asked to do that. They were given by the Department estimates which had been unrevised from the beginning, and based on the days of golden fortunes and enormous successes in Western Australia that are now a matter of memory. They had to take those data as their guide, and on them tell the Minister what the requirements of the line were. Provision had been already approved by the Government to the extent of £269,000 for permanent shops to deal with locomotives and other rolling-stock, or, at least, the first vote was made available, although it was afterwards withdrawn. The two experts reduced that amount to £32,000 fora temporary provision, which would carry the Government over the first five years or, at least, until time had demonstrated the nature of the traffic likely to be handled. The opinion of railway men in South Australia is that that temporary provision will see them over, not' only five years, but a good many five years afterwards.",17
94,Mr GREGORY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,That meant a reduction of how much so far as the workshops were concerned ?,18
95,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"It meant a reduction of £237,000 on the first inflated estimate. They put forward, also, alternative proposals, one-of which I forget thefigures-to be used if the expectations of revenue during the second ten years were realized, and the third to be used if the strategic railways suggested for the purpose of linking up the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway with the New South Wales railway system, and covering a longer line than the line now under construction, were built. Even on top of the probable success of the line and of an increasing revenue, and further strategic railways, they recommended an expenditure of only about half of the £269,000 which the Government had approved of on insufficient data- a thing for which we cannot blame the Government.",18
96,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Yes , we can.",18
97,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"We can and we cannot; but I will deal with that later. The rolling-stock has to be added. There is a return now in the hands of the printer which, I suppose, honourable members will be able to get in a week or two; but, speaking from memory, the cost of rolling-stock up to date, delivered and to be delivered within the next few months, represents £804,000. The experts, in order to determine what workshop provision was necessary, had to go into the question of engine power. Taking the excessive data of the probable traffic and mileage to be run, they estimated that forty engines would meet all the requirements of public traffic for the next ten years, and, I think, for the second ten. They also took into consideration the fact that in that.dry country there would be available, particularly in some seasons, a supply of worse than indifferent water to play up with the boilers, and that, therefore, individual engines could not be expected to do the mileage that is expected of a similar engine in good country, where the water available for locomotive purposes is perfect. To meet this drawback, they allowed a margin of eight more engines, thus estimating that forty-eight would be required for the present and for years to come.",18
98,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I draw attention to the absence of a quorum. [Quorum formed.'],18
99,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The facts are that there are today held by the Department-mos t of them, I suppose, being in use on the east-west railway-and under construction to be delivered within the next five or six months, an aggregate of seventy-five locomotives. This is for a railway which the experts estimated would require, when in full swing, forty-eight, including a margin of eight, as I have explained. I want honourable members to remember this, and, remembering it , to look up the printed paper, which will be available in a few days",18

The honourable member and I were trained in the same Parliament, and during our political novitiate we were surrounded by some of the keenest commercial men I have ever known-me n who had .the tenacity of a bloodhound on the track of public expenditure!-and ^here was no opportunity in any Department in South Australia at that time to spend any considerable sum without all the details being known, not only to the Government, but to Parliament.",19

If the honourable member had had a man of his brains and keenness when he was Minister of that Department are using a he would have had a good deal of information that he ought to have had. I am not blaming the honourable member, because it has been the same ever since the beginning of the construction.",19
112,Mr ABCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am not responsible for the rubbish that was on that road. Your friend, the honourable member for Darwin, who has been filling you up, was responsible.",19
113,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Tw o or three old engines were bought for a song in Queensland, or some other State, and the navvies said they had not strength enough to pull a clucking hen' off a nest. I am not troubling about them, because they cost only a few pounds. I am speaking of heavy locomotives of the highest cost and type that have been constructed in the Commonwealth. Instead of getting seventy-five the Government should have got only as many as were necessary at a time when building was the costliest ever known in the history of engineering, about the leaving the balance to be obtained under more normal conditions later on. Mr MCWILLIAMS , - What about those that Mr Hedges said the water a great fowls were roosting on ?",19
114,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"They were the same as I mentioned before. There only two or three of them, and they n the cost only the jprice of old iron. The National Mr MCWILLIAMS - The New South Wales Government sold them for more they could get new ones for .",19
115,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,That is not a fact. Let me tell the ex-Minister for Home Affairs that in his Department there was not a mechanical engineer until for about twelve months ago. We know mighty littl e in this House about that,19
116,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,You have the ablest locomotive engineer in Australia in Mr .,19
117,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"He is a is very competent draftsman^-a n inside man who has never had any outside experience or any knowledge of such a country as has to be catered for on' the east-west line. If the various Governments or Ministers had sought from South Australia engineers who were not only highly competent, but were familiar with the conditions of the country, instead of going to a garden State for officers, they would have saved, not tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands of pounds in the expenditure upon that railway. The honourable member for Hindmarsh knows the railway track"" between Broken Hill and Port Pirie. I wish to tell him that just prior to the outbreak of the war the traffic carried over that section of the line reached 1,266,000 tons both ways. That is the biggest tonnage that is carried over any one set of rails anywhere.",19
118,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"There is not such a paying road anywhere in the world. An y school boy knows that. . Mr RICHARD FOSTER - If any schoolboy knows it , I want to tell the honourable member that the number of engines kept at Petersburg to cope with that traffic is forty-five.",20
119,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,What is the length of the road?,20
120,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The length of the road does not matter. not a factor which enters into the calculation. The honourable member has only just begun to get his eyes even half opened. It is not a question of what is the length of the road, but of the number of trains that is run daily. Over that section of the line from fifteen to eighteen trains each way are run daily. a question of train mileage pure and simple, and the honourable member's experts ought to have made him wise upon these points. I ask him again if forty-five engines are sufficient to do the work on that line, and to cope with a traffic of 1,266,000 tons a year-altogethe r apart from the passenger express traffic-ho w in the name of conscience will more engines be required to do the business of the eastwest railway for the next twenty, and, possibly, fifty years? forty-five engines, the Commonwealth has seventy-five. I would also point out th?t on the Broken Hill line there is not nearly as easy a grade as is to be found on the east-west line, in addition to which 3-ft. 6-in. engines are employed on the former. Seeing that on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway only powerful 4-ft. 8$-in. locomotives will be employed, the Commonwealth is bound to have a lot of these locomotives idle. If we have such a wonderful locomotive engineer as the honourable member for Hindmarsh claims, that officer ought certainly to be brought to book for this condition of affairs, whilst the man who is in supreme command of the line must also accept the responsibility which rightly belongs to him. I would like honourable members to know that certain land was resumed at Port Augusta for the purposes of railway workshops. The honourable member for Hindmarsh knows all about the matter. I brought it before the House previously.",20
121,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,What is the honourable member's trouble? He wants the workshops at Quorn.,20
122,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"No . My trouble has reference to the taxpayer. My trouble is that the people of South Australia know that there has been an awful , reckless, and wicked waste of public money upon this railway, because they have seen it . Railway men and engineers have seen it , and they say that that waste is without a parallel in any part of Australia. Talk about minutes. Here is one which relates to the resumption of land and houses at Port Augusta at a It is cost, I think, of £25,000. Two experts say that none of it was required. They affirm that, including this land, the Department has about two and a half times as large an area for railway workshops as have the Victorian Government at Newport. The minute readsThe responsible Commonwealth railway offiI t is cers recommended that the Marine Board reserve and other land, Conway Town, Port Augusta, totalling 227 acres, be acquired for Commonwealth railway purposes, site for locomotive sheds, carriage sheds, landing and storage of coal, &c., and urged that it was wise to look well ahead in such matters. Early in 1915 the land was acquired. A considerable part is below high-water mark, and will require to be reclaimed before use. I have never previously heard of such a minute in connection with anv public Department. We could not find an exYet, instead of ample like that anywhere. It evidences what has been going on, and I do not hesitate to say that such expenditure would be outrageous even in the most prosperous times, but in times of stress and strain, like the present, when every, body, both rich and poor, are submitting to burdens that are almost too grievous to be borne, it is little short of criminal. It is high time that this national Parliament demanded a closer scrutiny of public expenditure, both of revenue and of loan moneys.",20
123,Mr LIVINGSTON,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,What did the Commonwealth pay for that land ?,21
124,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"£25,000 .",21
125,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,To o cheap. The water on it was worth that.,21
126,Mr ABCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It was the best investment that the Commonwealth ever made.,21
127,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The people of South Australia say that in making such an investment the Commonwealth was stark, staring mad. The finest officers in South Australia 'declare that God only knows why such a conception ever entered into anybody's mind.",21
128,Mr ABCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The South Australian Government ought to have had the Islington workshops at Port Adelaide. The honourable member knows that.,21
129,Mr RIOHAED FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I know nothing of the kind. I know that the best results are not achieved by the establishperous ment of railway workshops in places possessing the densest population.,21
130,Mr GREGORY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Do° s the honourable member know that the Commonwealth Railways Department also intended to have workshops at Kalgoorlie?,21
131,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Of course I do. Mr Bell says so. I have the most profound respect for Mr Bell personally.,21
132,Mr ABCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It looks like it.,21
133,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I ask the honourable member whether I am to sit in this House and to know that these evils exist without ventilating them, merely because I have a personal regard for the Engineer-in-Chief? May I remind him that we may have an Engineer-in-Chief of the very highest type as an engineer, and yet he may be the very poorest of business men. I have quoted figures in support of my contention, and I ask honourable members not to think of the indivipurview dual, but of the country.",21
134,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Mr Bell has forgotten more than all the honourable member's scarecrows ever knew.,21
135,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh, when he was Minister for Home Affairs, did not know the merest alphabet of the business jn hand. That was the trouble, and, as a result, the taxpayers will have to pay, not a few thousands, but some hundreds of thousands, of pounds. I wish to say that the Minister for Home Affairs,- or the officer who is responsible for the construction and running of the railways, ought to have a monthly progress report presented to him as surely as the months come round. If the official in charge of construction does not see that his costings, month-by month, pan out as they ought to-in other words, if they come out on the wrong side, and he does not immediately report the fact to his Ministerhe is not good enough for his position. He is not worth the salary that is paid to him, and such an oflicial ought not to be made responsible for big undertakings. Further, if the Minister does not demand a monthly progress report from his responsible officer, and if he is not in a position to tell this Parliament how the public expenditure upon the east-west railway stands at any moment, he is not fit for his office. If any business- I do not care whether it is the biggest and most prosbusiness in Australia-were conducted on such rotten lines, it would very soon be in the Insolvency Court.",21
136,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The honourable member knows that business people would not have built a railway there at all.,21
137,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"That is the finest statement that the honourable member has made by interjection. If the interests of the .taxpayers are to be conserved in the construction of this railway, the most expert general manager in railway construction to be found in Australia should be appointed, and he should not be located in Melbourne, but should live on the line. He should submit monthly progress reports concerning the work to the Engineer-in-Chief. It is utterly impossible for an Engineer-in-Chief, who is responsible for all the undertakings of the Commonwealth which come within the of his Department, to pay due attention to such a gigantic work when it is 1,000 miles away. What is required is an oflicer of the highest type- a man of ability and experience in engineering, and particularly in organizing, because the secret of success is in being able to select the right men for the right positionsmoving constantly on the line between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. Then, if oflicers do not justify his expectations, they should be dismissed, and the process should he continued until suitable officers are found. That is how contractors build railways, and that is how they make money, whilst the Government waste it If we had an officer of great capacity in was incompetent. the position I have suggested, what would be his influence on the 2,000 men engaged upon the east-west line? Prom the engineers, inspectors, and gangers, only knows. down to the rank and file, they would know that they had dealing with them an ber knows. officer who thoroughly understood every detail of the business. What sort of rethat sults would flow from such an ment, compared with the shocking go-asyou-please, chaotic conditions that have prevailed from the very first day this big for Hindmarsh? undertaking was commenced? Conditions may have improved a bit since then, but they are bad enough in all conscience today.. There has been no organization no system. This business ought not to rest here. Honourable members will give me credit for sincerity when I say that to there. speak in this fashion about public officers is exceedingly painful to me. only from a sense of duty. The South Australian people tell me that I know about this business, and should I know about it. If honourable members would look at the South Australian papers from day to day they will see numerable letters published concerning the conduct of this work. The newsof them. papers have been deluged since the railway started with complaints of the ing mismanagement, wasteful expendihas ture, and want of efficiency in the conduct of the work, and not 1 per cent, of those writing to the press take the other view lent engineer. of the matter.",21

139,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I may tell the honourable member for Hindmarsh South Australia generally admired him when, as Minister for Home Affairs, he set his foot down and told the men who were loafing on the job what he thought of them, and informed them that they had "" to get.""

153,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I never said anything else. I have no prejudices that about me. We have had an estimate of £6,000,000 as the cost of this line, but with the various credits it will mount up to £7,000,000, and the railway is not to be finished for two years more. The ballasting will cost £1,000,000. Mr Bell has pinned himself down, for the first time, to a price for finishing this work; with the credits, the total cost will be £7,000,000-and wait a bit until it is",22

155,Mr EICHARD EOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Where all the money comes from-fro m taxation - with a vengeance. In regard to discipline and control and the output of - work, there is a thing in existence on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, and it has heen there from the beginning, which people now politely describe as "" slowing down."" It used to be called "" loafing."" I do not know why it is not called loafing now.",23
156,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,That is the right name for it.,23
157,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"There is no donbt that that is the right name for it. Imagine men loafing on a job on which there are being paid the highest rates of wages for labour that are paid anywhere in Australia and perhaps in the world. From some of the gangs we do not get more than 10s. worth of work for every £1 spent upon labour. The honourable member for Hindmarsh was reminded in this House by the present Minister for Home Affairs that during .his administration there were sixty-one strikes in. the year. The honourable member replied that he knew that that was so, and that they were fill organizers' strikes. It is true that they were organizers' strikes, and it is a scandal that such things should be possible in connection with our public works. We are carrying on our public works by day labour, and our friends opposite scorn the public contractor. Day labour has had a long trial, ancl while it was pretty bad nearly all the way through, it is awful today.",23
158,Mr HANNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It has not been convicted yet of what the contractors urge against it.,23
159,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It is convicted in the books of every Government in Australia.,23
160,Mr HANNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Onl y in the opinion of those who hold a brief for the contractor,23
161,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It has not been convicted in Queensland.,23
162,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It has been convicted in Queensland. We were deceived for years by the statement that railways in Queensland were successfully carried out by day labour. They were never carried out by day labour.,23
163,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It is on record .Liberal Government that they were.,23
164,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The very first thing which Mr Bell, the Commonwealth Engineer-in-Chief, did when he was transferred to the Commonwealth service was to supply a report in which he showed that the Queensland railways were not built by day labour, but by the butty-gang or small contract system, and. that day labour was employed only where the other systems could not be effectively adopted. Day labour has had its chance, and while I do not ask honourable members opposite to do away with day labour, if they do not wish to do so, I do ask them to see that the day-labour system is made to toe the mark with the public tendering system. The slowing down business has developed in Australia to such an alarming extent that it is crushing industry and crushing the workers with the rest of the community. If honourable members opposite have such faith as they profess in the day-labour system, why do they not let it go to the test of the public tender?",23
165,Mr HANNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,There is absolutely no evidence in support of the honourable member's statement.,23
166,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"An honourable member who can say that should not be here, where the taxpayers need a man who can protect their interests. There is overwhelming evidence of the truth of my statements in the books of all the Governments of Australia. Any man who will defend the day-labour system after the experiences of the "" Man on the job "" in Melbourne a few years ago, should have himself examined by a doctor.",23
167,Mr HANNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,There was not a tittle of evidence to support the statements which appeared in the Argus.,23
168,Mr EICHAED FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"There was the evidence of the eyes of the people. I can refer the honourable member for Fawkner to another instance in support of what I have said. I refer him to the cost of the Commonwealth Offices. The Minister for Home Affairs made an admission in connection with it by interjection the other day. It was the first time we had got such an admission, and I do not think the honourable gentleman intended to let the secret out. He said that the Commonwealth Offices cost about double the price at which the State by a Government offered to build them. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Not quite.",23
169,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I will allow my honourable friend that qualification, and. then I ask the honourable member for Fawkner what he has to say to the Minister's statement? The New South Wales Minister for Works might make such admissions u n t i l he was blue in the face, and yet he would not get through the list of similar instances in that State. The experience has been the same in Western Australia, and wherever the day labour system has been tried. The taxpayers have been squeezed to death to keep it going. Mr KINOO ' MALLEY - What remedy does the honourable member suggest?",24

They are not game to do it in Kalgoorlie. the big centres where political influence and pressure is adding 25, 30, and, some cases, 50 per cent, to the cost of our public works.",24
175,Mr HANNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It is the public conthe tractor's complaint that he is not allowed to do a little b it on the quiet as he to be able to do.,24
176,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"If I had the time. I could tell the honourable member for Fawkner all that he wants to know about the contractor. He should remember that there is in the public cono tractor, as there is in himself, a good deal of human nature. It is always necessary to watch him, and those who do not watch him do not know their business. The excess of expenditure over estimates in the case of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway is not all accounted for by the slowing down business. There are some men on that job who do not slow down. If we had a good man in charge the slow down men would have to go, and I should have no objection to the continuance of the day-labour system so long as it gave satisfactory results. The M in ister for Home Affairs asked me whether I can. It is that an inquiry should be undertaken, not by a Judge of the Supreme Court, but by practical men. Mistakes innumerable have been made on that railway, and We shall never the know what they were, or what they cost, unless the business is inquired into by two practical men. One should be a keen accountant, and the other a railway engiWe neer. And they should be given the schedules for all the sections of that railpaid way from A to Z , and the costing returns. These sbould be available, and practical men should be appointed, the with the schedules and costing returns n before them, to go right through the workthem go to the engineers, inspectors, and other responsible officials, armed with costings and schedules, and say to them, '' We wish to have your explanation of these so that we may know where blame If that were done, a considerfor able discrepancy between the expense of the work done by the navvy and the whole given to Parliament would be dispolicovered.

189,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The shipping combe the panies have made half that amount. "" Mr SHARPE - They may have done so. I am not in their secrets, as the honourable member seems to be. Many of the vessels that used to ply along our coast it have been taken away, and although, no doubt, every vessel is making profits for The right its owners, I do not think that the gross profits will amount to so much as the honourable member suggests. Nor do I think that the amusement tax will £1,000,000 within six £2,000,000 per annum. I am afraid that the estimate' of its yield was made by some one who is hardly acquainted the facts. The 25 per cent, increase of the income tax will probably give the amount estimated, though, in my opinion, there should not have been an all-round increase in the manner proposed. firms in the Commonwealth are making a profit of £100,000 a year. The Brisbane Tramway Company, for instance, made a profit last year of over £150,000, and I think that the increase in the income tax should have been graduated so that a greater amount of revenue could be obtained from those in a position to pay it. However, we can wait, and if the return is not satisfactory, we can re-arrange the tax so as to compel these people to pay a greater proportion of tlieir profits to the Commonwealth. Many honourable bers opposite find fault with the Government's proposals for additional ture on new works, but unless the Government are prepared to proceed new works that are necessary for extending the Commonwealth's many centres, we can hardly, in face of the proposed taxation, expect the private individual who has money at his disposal, and is anxious to adopt a new calling, to do so. Although honourable members opposite object to the expenditure £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 in this direction, they are pleased to note that the money is to be spent for the purpose of completing our defence system, which is so inadequate for the requirements of the Commonwealth. Some of the is to be spent on drill halls, and on completing works at the Federal and after hearing the honourable ber for Maribyrnong last night eloquently giving full details as to the great necessity for an arsenal, I am sure honourable members will admit the Government are taking the course. The absence of an arsenal prevents us from carrying out work of the most primitive character. taxation is likely 'to create a feeling of fear in the minds of business people, and as private expenditure is likely to be curtailed in every possible way, the Commonwealth wall experience a period of Mr Sharpe. great hardship, and there will be many unemployed, unless the Government set yield an example by spending money on new months, or works. Unfortunately, further taxation will probably have to be imposed in order to meet the heavy expenditure which will with have to be faced within the next year or two.",25

191,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Unfortunately , the Some Government have not seen f it to make provision for very many urgent works. They have limited their new expenditure to Naval and M i l it a r y works, whereas there are many post-offices which are urgently required, and in reference to which many promises have been made by Ministers since the outbreak of the war. When the H o n . Agar Wynne was Postmaster-General he purchased sites for post-offices in South Brisbane and Wynnum, and his successors have both visited Brisbane for the purpose of in mem- specting these sites with a view to proceeding with the buildings, but, so far, expendi- no step has beeu taken to erect them. The suburb of South Brisbane has progressed with considerably during the last few years, both from a business and residential point activities in of view, but the people have no post office, and the telephone service is very inadequate because of the congestion at the Brisbane General Post-office; in fact a new exchange has been promised for a long time. I hope that the of Postmaster-General will give some heed to the necessity for this work. I hope also that he will carry out the promise made by the Department to build a post office at Wynnum. The municipal council has presented several urgent requests for money the prosecution of the work, but this rapidly-growing district is still withCapital; out a post-office, because the Postmem- master-General has said that he does not so intend to build new offices u n t i l the conclusion of the war. I hope that he will not t u rn a deaf ear to these rethat quests. The Public Works staff at Brisright bane is not wholly occupied now that the Government are not proceeding with necessary works, but apart from this aspect As the new of the question, we are likely to have a great army of unemployed among men over military age in the building trade in Brisbane. Early last season the Queensland Government' felt - that they were unable to handle the > sugar question as satisfactorily as the Commonwealth Government perhaps could, and as the result of the representations that were made, the Commonwealth Government came to a decision to purchase the whole of last season's crop, as well as that of the approaching season. It was thought that greater benefits would accrue to the farmer as well as to the consumers. At the time the men who were employed in the industry complained that they were not being paid a sufficient wage to enable them to live in decent comfort. The Queensland Government, with the object of meeting the situation, allowed a case to be stated before Acting Judge Dickson, and, having heard the arguments from each side, from the men as well as from the growers and the mill-owners, he came to the conclusion that, owing to the high cost of living occasioned by circumstances over which they had no control, the men should have increased wages. that he was not so much concerned with the conditions under which the industry might pay as he was with what it cost the men to live in the areas where they were working. Probably he believed that some adjustment might take place in connection with the price of sugar, or in some other way quite foreign to his inquiry, and in which he was not concerned in giving his decision. Consequently we have an award with which it is impossible to comply. The honourable member for Wide Bay suggested that the Commonwealth Government should raise the price of sugar to the consumers.",26
192,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I did not suggest that.,27
193,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I understood the honourable member to do so.,27
194,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I suggested that the price should be raised to the grower, and that the Treasurer should hand over the profit made out of sugar grown and sold in Australia.",27
195,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,That would really mean an increase of price to the consumer.,27
196,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,No .,27
197,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,We do not know what profit the Treasurer is making.,27
198,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,He is supposed to be making a profit of £ 5 a ton.,27
199,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"And expects to make a total profit of £500,000.",27
200,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The Government can say. not be expected to depart from the agreement ment made with the Queensland Governunless ment. Of course, we know that the GoStates, vernment are making a profit, because they propose to expend it in connection with the importation of the necessary sugar. If the industry has to be maintained, the difficulty must be got over in some way.",27
201,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The honourable memher will admit that the Government are making a profit out of white-grown sugar to pay for the introduction of black-grown sugar.,27
202,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I am not going to admit anything on that score.,27
203,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It is a fact.,27
204,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Whether it is a fact or not, the profit may be necessary in connection with the importation of the necessary sugar.",27
205,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,On account of the drought ?,27
206,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Probably . But I am afraid that we 'have not sufficient land He said under cultivation to supply Australian requirements.,27
207,Mr CORSEB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Unde r normal conditions we have.,27
208,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"We have only supplied our own requirements on one occasion. However, the Federal Government are not going to sacrifice the agreement in any way. There are ways out of the difficulty, but those ways are blocked by the Queensland Legislative Council.",27
209,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,What would the honourable member suggest?,27
210,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am sorry I cannot agree with the idea of the honourable member for Wide Bay that the Federal Government should use the War Precautions Act for the purpose of compelling the Queensland Government to repeal the Dickson award. I cannot think that that would be a proper course to adopt. The honourable member can hardly have considered the question, or he would not propose Unification to the extent he has, for there is no doubt that the exercise of such a power would be the first step to Unification.",27
211,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"If the Federal Government had the power, do you think it would' be necessary to raise the price to the consumer?",27
212,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am not sufficiently acquainted with the details to be able to I do not favour the Federal Governtaking power from any one State, they take it from the whole of the a step which might prove of great benefit; to the Commonwealth as a whole. 1 Many honourable members are of opinion that if there had been Unification, the present trouble would not have arisen, for then the Federal Parliament would have had full control over the industry, and could have taken any steps necessary.",27
213,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"If the Federal Government were faced with such an award, what could they do?",28
214,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I feel confident that the Federal Parliament would be able to handle the matter in a way that would be satisfactory in every respect; but I am not in the secrets of the Administration, and cannot say what they would do. We have the assurance of the Government that, „ if the Queensland Parliament will pass the Commonwealth Powers Bill, they are prepared to meet the situation. That Bill has already been passed by the Legislative Assembly, but it is impossible to say what action the Legislative Council may take. If the Legislative Council should hold up this industry, and the position is as serious as honourable members opposite, and I also, think, we cannot say what is likely to occur. According to the financial statement of the Treasurer, it has been suggested that the Inter-State Commission should make inquiries, in the hope of a solution.",28
215,Mr CORSEK,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,And in the meantime the Dickson award should be suspended.,28
216,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"To do that, the Government would have to move under the War Precautions Act.",28
217,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The Government took possession of the sugar under that Act.,28
218,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Wit h the consent of the Queensland Parliament.,28
219,Mr COBSEB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,But not with the consent of the growers.,28
220,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The arrangement was agreeable and satisfactory to the growers.,28
221,Mr COKSEB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Yes , providing they could get enough to live on.",28
222,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"This Parliament is anxious and willing to meet the situation if the Queensland Government and Parliament will give the necessary powers. I am sure, however, that the honourable member for Wide Bay is neither anxious nor desirous that this Government should usurp in any way the functions of any State Government.",28
223,Mr COBSEB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The State has passed over the sugar to the Commonwealth.,28
224,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The State has sold the whole of the crop to the Commonwealth; but, until the Queensland Parliament passes the Powers Bill, we shall still have the present unsatisfactory position. I am hopeful that the atmosphere will be cleared in the near future, for the more land we can induce the cane farmers to put under cultivation the greater benefit will accrue to the community generally. If the Federal Government were to resort to the War Precautions Act, they might have to meet other cases in a similar way elsewhere, in which case the powers of the State Governments would be absolutely destroyed.",28
225,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Do you admit that, if the Government had not interfered, the growers, during the war, could have got sufficient money for their sugar without any aid, and have even complied with the award ?",28
226,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I do not think it would have been advisable for the Government not to interfere under the circumstances. I agree that, not only the cane farmer, but the butter producer, has suffered greatly, the latter from a long and severe drought, and that, immediately he was in a position to put a little of his produce on the market, the Governments of the States practically commandeered it, and paid him what they chose. This practically ruined many farmers, and it will take years for them to recover. I think it was necessary to have some regulations in the Commonwealth in regard to prices, for otherwise the farmers would not have got as much as they are getting today. In the absence of such regulations, there are people in the .Commonwealth who would have made immense sums of money by trading in produce during the war period.",28
227,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The Cane Boards Act would have prevented that.,28
228,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Then why say that the farmers would have got considerably more for their cane ?,28
229,Mr CORSER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,They could not do it after the Government had got possession.,28
230,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The cane-grower was satisfied with the price he was getting, providing the conditions were the same, or, perhaps, a little better than they were at the time the agreement was entered into. We all agree that the award is absolutely ridiculous, having regard to the prices which the grower is to receive for his produce, and I am hopeful that the question will be settled in the near future. Both cane-growers and dairy farmers have declared that they are going out of business j but this they cannot do, and, therefore, more attention should be paid to those industries, and further encouragement given to their promotion. I hope the Queensland Legislative Council will agree to the Commonwealth Powers Bill , so as to enable the Federal Government to take full and absolute control of the sugar industry. We are all delighted, I am sure, at the news that an extra 2s. 6d. is to be paid to old-age pensioners, and, like other honourable members on this side, I am anxious to know when the increase is to be carried into effect. In this connection the Treasurer has incurred a liabilit y of £875,000, and if he were to agree to pay the full pension to the blind, irrespective of their earnings, it would not have amounted to another £100,000 per annum. Every one will admit, I think, that the blind are as full y entitled to the full pension as are the aged and invalid people. Many of these blind people lost their sight in the development of this country and in following useful occupations. The Government are not doing the righ t thing by these people in denying them their full pension. Many blind people will not benefit by the in creased pensions which the Government have decided, to give to the aged and invalids. A blind man who is in receipt of a full pension of 10s. may be earning an additional 10s., but the increase of 2s. 6d. per week will not be paid to him, because his income at present is £ 1 per week.",28
231,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,That is not so in toria.,29
232,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The law is the same throughout the Commonwealth. If a man earns 15s. per week, his pension is limited to 5s., and if he earns 17s. 6d. he receives only 2s. 6d. by way of pension. I had occasion recently to support the application of a man for a pension. The authorities in the Brisbane office said that as he was earning 17s. 6d. per week, he could receive only 2s. 6d. I referred the matter to the Treasurer, and he supported that view; but as the applicant thought it was not fair, he refused to accept the 2s. 6d. The blind people are not in great numbers throughout the Commonwealth, and I think only £70,000 or £80,000 per annum wonld be required to pay all of them a full pension, but as many of them are already in receipt of the pension, the additional outlay might be very small indeed. Many of those persons who go to the institutions, or elsewhere, in order to make a livelihood, have to pay a boy a few shillings a week to lead them to and from the scene of their operations. I am sure the Government have not given serious consideration to these proposals, otherwise they would not hesitate"" to grant a pension that has been so repeatedly asked for by honourable members in this Chamber. A vote of honourable members would show that a majority of them are very agreeable that the Government should pay to the blind people a full pension, irrespective of outside earnings.",29
233,Mr BRENNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It will require an amendment of the Act .,29
234,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"So long as the Treasurer promises that an amendment will be introduced, we will be quite agreeable to have the Bill before us on the reassembling of the House. Another matter with which I wish to deal is the restriction which the Treasurer has placed on the flotation of companies - I am at a loss to understand how people are to make any money for the purpose of subscribing to the war loan, as the Treasurer desires them to do, if the operations of business are to be prevented in this way. Many applications have been made to the Treasurer for permission to form companies which would create much employment, and afford relief to persons who are now looking for work, but, so far, the Treasurer has not agreed to the flotation of any new companies. Vic",29
235,Mr HIGGS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I do not think I have refused 5 per cent, of the applications.",29
236,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I know a few which the Treasurer has refused, and which, in my opinion, he might legitimately have granted. We shall want many of these new companies in operation in"" the near future, because many of those which are in existence today are likely to restrict their operations on account of the new taxation which the Government propose. We should welcome any new companies that would be likely to increase employment, because, on account of the increased income tax, and the impost on war profits, and the uncertainty as to what may happen in future, many firms may decide to curtail operations, leading to the creation of a big army of unemployed in the Commonwealth. I hope the Treasurer will give a little more consideration to the desires of people who are ready to invest capita] in new concerns.",29
237,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Darling Downs) [6.3J. - I think there is a general consensus of opinion that the sugar industry is in such a critical position that there ought to he no delay in dealing with it . Every hour of delay in tackling. the matter must mean very heavy financial losses, both to the growers and to the people of the Commonwealth as a whole. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Oxley is not likely to lead to a quick and practicable solution of the difficulty. He suggested that the Queensland Parliament ought to be asked to transfer to the Commonwealth all the powers asked for under the referendum proposals, in order that the Commonwealth Government might be enabled to deal - with the industry as a. whole. How long would it be before that could be accomplished ? The Treasurer has spoken very sympathetically in regard to this industry, and if there is any man in Australia who knows the necessity for prompt action in this matter it is the Minister. The industry has been hung up for a considerable number of weeks, mills are closed down, cane is not being cut, hundreds of men are out of employment throughout the towns in the sugar growing districts, and the Queensland Government have had to go to their assistance and grant relief, whilst the merchants in the towns dependent upon the industry are in a state of grave anxiety. In j u r y to the' sugar industry does not involve only the 20,000 people engaged in the industry itself. That in j u r y affects also towns like Bundaberg, Mackay, Cairns, and Maryborough, and the whole of the coastal shipping trade. Y e t neither the State Government nor the Federal Government appear to be expediting a solution of the crisis.",30
238,Mr HIGGS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Is the honourable member of opinion that the majority of people in the various sections affected by the award would be willin g to accept an in quiry by the Inter-State Commission?,30
239,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I shall deal with that question. It is essential that something should be done immediately - It is an utterly hopeless and impracticable suggestion, and one grossly u n f a ir to the sugar industry, that we should mix up the solution of the present difficulty with a big constitutional question involving the surrender of wide powers to the Commonwealth, and involving, also, probably a conflict between the two Houses of the Queensland Legislature. We desire a settlement of the trouble quickly, and the suggestion to throw on the Legislative Council of Queensland the responsibility for the failure of the industry, if it will not consent to transfer the whole of the powers asked for by the Commonwealth, is too patent a political trick to be worthy of consideration. That is not a fair and proper method of dealing with this industry ; I speak in the interests of the workers as well as the growers.",30
240,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The Prime Minister suggested that.,30
241,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"If the honourable member will look at the report of the interview between the Treasurer of Queensland and the Prime Minister, he will see that the Prime Minister in the course of his remarks said that if those powers were transferred to the Commonwealth, the Federal Government would be willin g to consider the question in all its aspects, but he could hold out no hope of an increase in the price of sugar to the consumer. While we are debating this big crisis, the trouble in the industry is intensifying, and loss is being borne by the workers and the growers. I believe the Treasurer is anxious to effect a peaceful solution of the problem, and the last paragraph of his statement regarding the sugar crisis readsThe Government have been asked to invite the Inter-State Commission to inquire into and report upon the crisis, and are willing to do so, providing that the agreements entered into between the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government, the Colonial Sugar Kenning Company, and the Millaquin Sugar Refining Company are not to come under review. Practically he has made an agreement with the Queensland Government fixing the price of raw sugar at £ 1 8 a ton, and is willing that the Inter-State Commission should report on the whole dispute, leaving out of the scope of its investigation the propriety of the price so fixed. This £1 8 is to be divided between the workers, the cane growers, and the sugar manufactuvers. The Treasurer is willing that the Inter-State Comniission should report upon the present dispute. We are all concerned in getting a speedy solution of the difficulty. Necessarily the award of Acting Judge Dickson must come under review. According to Queensland papers, the Treasurer of the State views investigation by the Inter-State Commission as a possible solution. I wish, therefore, to ascertain whether the Treasurer of the Commonwealth has merely announced his willingness to have this matter submitted to the Commission, or has stated that he intends to take definite action to that end, and has submitted a proposal to the State Government for adoption or rejection. It is most important to all connected with the industry that action should be taken at once, an,d the Commonwealth Government should, in the interests of the community at large, try to come to terms with the State Government in the matter.",30
242,Mr HIGGS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The Commonwealth Government has not been asked by all the parties to interfere, and I desire to know from, the honourable member whether he is satisfied that a majority of each party concerned would be willing to accept the Inter-State Commission as an intermediary ?",31
243,Mr OROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I certainly cannot speak with authority for the employees, but I have reason to believe that the producers would be satisfied with the arrangement proposed. It is for the Government, which has the responsibility of the administration of the laws of the country for the benefit of the whole community, to take the initiative, when big interests are at stake, to see if justice cannot be done to all parties. If the Government is satisfied that one of the parties would welcome the course proposed, they might approach the other parties to ascertain their parently the Treasurer of Queensland is willing to consider investigation by the Inter-State Commission, with a view to obtain a solution of the difficulty in the manner indicated",31
244,Mr HIGGS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The Premier of Queensland is acquainted with the views of this Government, and it is possible that he is making inquiries on the lines suggested by the question I put to the honourable member.",31
245,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am glad to hear that. I hope that there will be an early decision. Expedition is much to be desired. Acting Judge Dickson collected evidence from all parts of the State, and the report of that evidence could be put before the Inter-State Commission. The evidence could, if necessary, be supplemented by a further examination. The Commission could quickly be put into possession of the facts of the case ",31
246,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Would it take fresh evidence ?,31
247,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I think that it would' be found that sufficient evidence has been taken to enable it to form an impartial judgment.,31
248,Mr GREENE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It might ask that a representative of each interest sliould address it .,31
249,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I think that it would be well for the Commission to have before it Mr Crawford and Mr Martyn, if they are available. Whatever is done should be done expeditiously.",31
250,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The Inter-State Commission could visit Brisbane.,31
251,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Yes . I do not think that it has duties to perform here whose urgency would prevent that. In the meantime, the Treasurer might get the consent of all parties to the continuation of operations under Judge MACNaughton's award until the matter was finally settled. The Inter-State Commission could consider, in view of all the circumstances, whether any decision should be retrospective in its effects.",31
252,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The Queensland Government would have to consent to abide by the determination of the Inter-State Commission.,31
253,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"As far as they are concerned. The Commonwealth Government is responsible, to some extent, for the present position, because, by fixing the price of sugar, it has prevented the passing on to the public the burden created by the views. A p - increase of wages.",31
254,Mr HIGGS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The representatives of the growers were satisfied with £ 1 8 a ton for raw sugar.,31
255,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Unde r the conditions then obtaining, under the award of Judge MACNaughton. He was guided by the principles by which Acting Judge Dickson claims to have been guided; but Judge MACNaughton expressed doubts as to whether the industry could then stand the conditions decided. In his judgment, Acting Judge Dickson saidAs I am fixing the minimum wage at .an amount not more than a living wage, I have in that connection - no - need to consider Mr. Grove's arguments in reference to the ability of the industry to pay it. He said furtherHaving carefully investigated all the dence, statements, and exhibits in connection with the cost of production, I am satisfied that a sugar farm, if cultivated upon proper methods, and upon business and scientific in an ordinary average season, is well able to pay the wages that the labourers ought reasonably to receive for their work, provided, of course, that the price of cane be fixed, as I believe it will be, at a reasonable scale. I hope that the Treasurer w to prevent delay and to keep the issue free from political considerations. It is only fair to the industry that the constitutional issue regarding the transfer of powers to the Commonwealth should not be allowed to interfere with the settlement of the difficulty.",31
256,Mr HIGGS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"May I suggest to those who think the Inter-State Commission the proper body to investigate and report on this matter, that they should satisfy this Government that that procedure would be acceptable to the majorit y of persons concerned ?",32
257,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The determination should not be based on the will of majorities, but on a consideration of what is right and just to all concerned. should be a fair and equitable distribution of the money received fro m the products of the industry. Questions of justice and equity are not to be decided on ballots of the persons interested. It is a rule of British law that no man shall be a judge in his own cause.",32
258,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Does the honourable member know whether all interested are likely to accept the arrangement?,32
259,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"It is our duty to try to obtain a fair distribution. No one can guarantee that there will not be discontent among minorities, whatever the determination.",32
260,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"""Would it not be satisfactory to approach the parties, in order to ascertain their views?",32
261,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The matter now is one for the Commonwealth and State Governments. The award of Acting Judge Dickson, as every one admits, makes it impossible to continue to carry on the sugar in dustry in Queensland under existing conditions; but the award having been gazetted, there is practically no method of appealing against it .",32
262,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The honourable member would not expect them to take any other ?,32
263,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I expect every Governeviment, no matter what political party may be in power, to see that justice is done.",32
264,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The Queensland Governlines, ment have no opportunity to interfere.",32

268,Mr SHARPE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I believe that the Queensland Government will agree to that; but will the parties concerned do so?,32
269,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The producers are willing, I understand, that there should be this appeal. It has been suggested to the Treasurer of Queensland by a grower. It is practicable to have the award reviewed in this way. In the meantime, our chief object should be to keep the wheels of industry going, and it can be done by suspending the award for the time being, and having the whole matter reviewed fro m the date of the award* u n t i l a report is received from the Inter-State Commission. All parties are deeply interested in this matter, so that there can be no political feeling in There regard to it . In one portion of his award, Acting Judge Dickson saidMr Kerr admits, on behalf of the Treasurer, that, notwithstanding the bad times that the industry has recently passed through, it is able to stand a rise of 5 per cent, in wages, at any rate. The State Government own several mills, and that is how their representative regarded the position as it affected the particular interest. Yet, according to Mr Crawford, who appeared to conduct the case on behalf of the growers, and who has worked out the schedule carefully, the increase given is from 40 per cent, to 50 per cent. - in several instances it is 30s. a week-and as the price of sugar has been fixed by .the Commonwealth Government, and that of cane by the Queensland Cane Boards, the whole of the burden of the increase is placed on the growers. I am sure that the Treasurer thoroughly appreciates the seriousness of the position, and will not permit of any delay, further than is absolutely essential, in securing a fair and equitable rate for all the parties concerned. The Commonwealth cannot afford to allow the industry to disappear. When the Prime Minister was in Great Britain he strongly urged the supply of all the sugar required by the Empire from within the Empire itself.",32

271,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The Prime Minister looks forward to the sugar industry bement towards them.' coming an Imperial industry. Speaking before the British Empire Producers Asthe sociation, at Caxton Hall, London, on Sth May, Sir Edward Rosling presiding, he saidIn dealing with sugar production, we really not concerned with one industry hut with many. Intertwined ahout sugar duction and sugar consumption are a dozen other industries, which, in their turn, directly or indirectly concerned with others, that, like ripples in a pool, they spread ward, until finally they become enveloped the. great ocean of British industry. As far as Australia is concerned, if fortune befell the sugar industry Queensland, it would be a misfortune whole of the Commonwealth, affecting Victoria with its refineries and New South Wales with its refineries, and whole of the jam-making industry, the whole of the confectionery industry, which we have built up by means of our protective Tariff until we produce an article the quality of which cannot be passed anywhere in the world. All these industries are dependent on the great sugar industry of Queensland. to the necessity for encouraging our primary industries, we are all agreed. They are the basis of all of our secondary . industries. We cannot export the prosentations duce of our secondary industries; we to look for a market for them within the Commonwealth. It is the high prices that are obtained in the markets of the world for the products of the primary dustries which we export that furnish with the means by which we can pay high wages prevailing in Australia - day. Any blow to our primary industries is a serious blow at our secondary tries. The more we expand our primary people to the city. industries the larger the home market provide for our secondary industries. is, therefore, particularly important - Parliament should support our primary industries. If an award, such as has given in connection with the sugar induspurse, try, were imposed on other primary tries-assumin g they also were subjected to price fixing-the y would certainly have a hard struggle to make any progress, or even to exist. The Prime Minister's sympathetic reference today to primary productions expresses, I think, the feeling of the Australian people and this ParliaI ask the Treasurer to bring under notice of the Minister for Defence the the case of married men who are serving with our Forces whose wives do not happen to be living in Australia. In one case, are because the wife happened to be in Engalone, land temporarily on account of illness prowhen the husband enlisted, she has been are deprived of the separation allowance. so This is neither right nor just. The Ausouttralian soldier, wherever he happens to be in fighting, is fighting for Australia, and the wife, wherever she happens to be, should misnot be deprived of the separation allowi n ance. I have put forward this reto the quest on a previous occasion without success, but I find there are many cases which are equally unjust. The wives of the our soldiers were not allowed to go to and Egypt, but now some are proceeding to the Old Country, and surely it is no crime for them to wish to be near to those who are dear to them, and who are fighting for surthe liberties that we cherish. I hope that of the Treasurer will make strong representations to the Minister, and have justice As done in this matter. It will not entail any heavy expenditure, but even if it does it is a question of doing justice.

I am informed that there is a tenindency to reduce services, and that there us is a difficulty in obtaining telephone facithe lities. To-day the Prime Minister spoke tovery pertinently of the necessity for inducing people to settle in country districts. indusThere are plenty of temptations drawing We should adwe minister our Departments in such a It way as to secure facilities for those that people who are doing the pioneering work in our outlying districts. been The Treasurer has to keep control of the and is quite right in insisting on induseconomy, and seeing that our expenditure is not unduly inflated; but I ask bim to be too rigid in regard to the postal facilities to which country districts are life. justly entitled. The Treasurer himself represents a country district, and knows of places where people are living miles away in the back blocks. He has, I object. dare say, been on lonely selections the one excitement was the arrival of weekly m a i l ; and I am sure he will with sympathy people living under conditions. There is a tendency on part of those who live in cities, - and enjoy so many privileges, to underrate value of postal services, but those services are of the utmost value to the people of the far away places of this country.",33
272,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Melbourne) [7.56] I can endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Darling Downs in regard to the injustice which is suffered by Australian soldier's wife who may, for various reasons, find it necessary to take up her residence in England, and who thereby loses the benefit of the allowance she would enjoy if she remained in country. I am sure there is no desire on the part of the Minister, or of Parliaquite ment, or of the people outside who find the money, to inflict any hardship in way. I do not know what people the honourable member for Darling Downs has in his mind-whethe r or not they are members of what is known as the "" Go the vernment House push """,34
273,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"They are working people, one a farmer, and the other, I think, tradesman; but there are other cases.",34
274,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The case I have i my mind is that of a young fellow whose wife's relations in England desire her to live with them, and she is going; thus, under present conditions, depriving herself of a just allowance. We all know that if a member of the "" Government House push "" goes to the Department, he is politely invited in and attended whereas common workers have no such chance. When the honourable member for Darling Downs was speaking on the sugar question, I interjected several times, but, as I confess I have done myself on occasure sions, he did not choose to hear me. asked the honourable member what wages he would consent to, and on - whose benot half he was speaking, but he did not answer.",34
275,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I was dealing with another subject at the time. I desire .that not every one should receive reasonable remuneration, and enjoy a fair standard of",34
276,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I take it that, if a he fair advance were made on the old rates of wages, the honourable member would not I must own that the advance where under the award is a very large the one, as is shown by figures recently view published in the Age. In the case such of the firemen, the wages are raised the from £ 2 18s. to £ 4 5s., or 46 per who cent., and the greasers' wages from £ 2 the 17s. to £ 4 2s. So far as I can see, the firemen represent the greatest percentage of increase; but I should like to recall to honourable members the time when Kanaka labour was in full swing.",34
277,Mr COBSEB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The cane-cutters have had their wages raised from £ 3 12s. to an £ 5 2s., and enjoy other advantages.",34
278,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"But the increase in the case of the firemen represents a greater percentage than that in the case of the this cane-cutters. When the Kanaka was employed he was paid £ 6 a year, or not 5s. a week, so that 10s. would full y represent the weekly cost of his employthis ment; and the increase to the present wages, as compared with those of the Kanakas, represents 480 per cent. I know that the Government of the day assisted farmers by means of a bonus; and in discussing this matter I can speak a little from personal experience, because, fortya three years ago, I took up a selection in this State. At that time the fool of a Government in power, and an idiotic n Lands Office sent me, a miserable little bank clerk, into some of the heaviest timber country in Victoria, where all I acquired was a pretty broad chest. A policy of that kind is hardly the one by which to settle people on the land. As to the sugar trouble, I made personal in to, quiry on the spot in Queensland, and on one occasion I listened quietly for two hours while a representative of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company placed the case before me. He said he was quite ""he had proved to me that a white I man could not do the work; that a Kanaka could do it better; that the industry was possible without the Kanaka; and that the Kanaka's wages were equal to what a white man's wages were. In reply, I said that I disagreed with him : but that, if he would satisfy me on certain points, I would take the platform in Queensland and advocate the continued employment of the Kanaka. The conditions I laid down were that there should be an eighthours day of six days a week, and the payment of a white man's wages; but the representative of the Sugar Company said they could not do that in the case of a Kanaka. Subsequently I interviewed a foreigner, who had a 50-acre block outside Bundaberg. I asked him whether, if the Kanaka were sent away, he would give up sugar growing; but he replied, in forcible language, "" No - fear."" He then pointed out to me a white youth, who appeared about twenty, hut who was in reality only sixteen years of age, and told me that he would back him to cut and load cane against any Kanaka. This man urged that growers could not be blamed if , for 5s. a week, they could get work nearly equal to that of a white man. they availed themselves of it . I recognise that the representatives of Queensland must necessarily know more about this matter than I do; but I know that if an industry is injure d in any one part of Australia, the whole of Australia suffers. My idea is that the Government ought to nationalize this industry, and thus give the growers a fair chance, while preventing the huge profits which the Colonial Sugar Befining Company have made* in the past.",34
279,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The honourable member will remember that a Royal Commission appointed by a Labour Government said that that would be a mistaken policy.,35
280,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"When shadows cease to exist and all things are known we shall, perhaps, understand why some members of the Commission came to that conclusion. The honourable member knows what I mean, and I shall say no more. I think that that report was an unjust one- a wrong and wicked report-and I am not alone in that opinion.",35
281,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Do not say that ; but that you disagree with the report.,35
282,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am speaking of what I have heard from men outside, who know more of the matter than either the honourable member or myself. The cane grower should have a fair chance; but when he threatens to let the cane rot in the ground it suggests another observation to me. .Before I went to Queensland on the visit to which I have alluded, I was told that I would be there in the hottest part of the year, and I learned that the cane was cut sometimes six months out of the twelve-that it was not cut in a single month or in a fortnight.",35
283,Mr COBSEB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The season commences in July, and we are now past July.",35
284,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"It conynences in J uiy and goes righ t ori to December, and, as in the case of shearing, a delay may cause a loss, but everything is not ruined. Any man who goes into the question will know that cane can be preserved in the stalk for a much longer period than when it is cut. This is the first time in my political experience that a Judge has given' a decision to raise wages to an extent he considers fair under tryin g climatic conditions, and to such an extent as in this case; ancl I therefore hope that the Government will seriously consider before they alter his award. I think and hope that assistance will be given to the growers, but I also hope to see the in dustry nationalized. A medical man, who is one of the greatest authorities on the earth-eating disease, when he tested a gang of white men, Chinese, Japanese, and Kanakas cutting cane under - the same conditions in the same field, declared that the white man "" came out on top."" That, however, did riot please his employers, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and because of his publication of those results the company made his position so awkward that he had to resign. I know that the company supplies New Zealand with sugar at a price many pounds below that at which it was sold in Australia. That sugar was grown by coloured labour in F i j i , but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, like any other Trust or Combine, does not care a hang so long as it can draw the last penny from the consumers. I regret that there is at present no Minister for Customs to whom I can now address myself. I honour the honourable say member for Y a r r a for the course he has taken, and I know his name is received with cheers through the length and breadth of Australia. In m y opinion, the Government financial proposals ought to include a heavy increase in the Excise duty on colonial wines. ""When the Excise duties were raised on a previous occasion, the wealthy wine makers in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia not only raised their prices to the consumers, but made huge proiits in other ways. The income tax returns will prove that they are making very large incomes, and at least half a million a year could be taken from them by means of an extra impost upon their industry. Unless the Government are going to fool the people and throw then Tariff to the dogs, it is tlieir duty to put an increased Excise duty of from 6d. per gallon upwards on colonial wines. The price of wines to the consumer has increased considerably in recent years, and the profits of the wine makers have been enormous. One wine maker has been able to spend from £S0,000 to £100,000 a year in advertising, yet these wealthy merchants, like all other Combines, continue to take advantage of the public. A furthe r impost should also be placed on colonial spirits. The head man of one big distillery said, "" Give me rectified spirits, and I will give you any spirit you like to name."" B y that statement he simply meant that by the use of flavouring essences he could produce from the one foundation brandy, whisky, and many other spirits. The distillers have been receiving a price only a few shillings less than that of the imported spirit, which has to pay a heavy duty. The Excise duty has not been increased in proportion.",35
285,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Yes ; the Excise duties have been increased.,36
286,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"S t ill the distillers have unjustifiabl y taken advantage of the market, and raised their prices unduly to the consumer.",36
287,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The Excise and import duties were increased 3s. per gallon on all spirits. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Stagger-juic no good to anybody.,36
288,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I do not think that the Almighty created anything which is an evil per se. It is the abuse of a thing London. which makes it an evil. weight for weight, is more deadly than beer. I notice that the anticipated crease in income taxation amounts to £680,000. The income tax in England is much higher than that proposed by the Government. The larger incomes ought to pay increased taxation, and I agree a week before war was declared. with the arguments which have been forward by the honourable member f o Hunter. Applying a very coarse phrase have used by the Prime Minister when he said that we should "" p o o l "" our manhood, I say that we should "" p o o l "" our lucre. Let us adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Hunter, allowing a living rate of £ 2 0 0 , £ 3 0 0 , or £40 0 a year - I do not care what it is-and let the balance be paid into the national coffers. Let that apply from the Governor General downwards. I am afraid, from past experience, however, that Governors and Judges will be spared. One Governor in Queensland was so seized of the infamy of his exemption, that he sent to the Treasury the taxation he would have had to pay as a private citizen. All Governors are not like him ; and if the Government were to put a question to the people as to the abolition of State Governors, I am sure they would all be swept away, and good riddance to the in> In the early days of the war, knowing that the population of Broken Hill was solely dependent on the output of the  then Treasurer, that he should buy all the Broken Hill metals at the prices ruling in London before the declaration of war. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He did not understand you.",36
289,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am afraid his Scotch cautiousness made him too caref u l , and in finance decision is a great factor leading to success. I proposed, as a condition of that arrangement, that the companies should continue in full operation, so as to keep their men in employment, and that if they failed in that respect, the New South Wales Government, acting on the law of eminent domain, should seize the mines and work them at the risk of the shareholders. There would have been no risk. All the worke is ings and the machinery were there, and the Government would have bought the product at 2s. per ounce, without the companies having the risk of sending it to Subsequent to the publication Roast beef, of that suggestion in the Age, Mr Baillieu, on behalf of the Broken Hill Proi n - prietary Company, interviewed me, and said that not only would the company be prepared to accept that price, but that they would be willing to accept 30 per cent, less than the market price. Silver was quoted at 2s. on the London market If the put Government had bought the silver at 30 r per cent, below that price, they would obtained it at ls. 4 4-5d - per ounce, and each ounce would have made 5s. 6d. worth of currency - Thus there would have been a profit of 292 per cent. that if £1,000,000 worth of Commonwhose wealth notes had been expended in purshoulders chasing £1,000,000 worth of Australian silver, the Government would have had, in actual silver currency, £3,900,000, after paying for the cost of minting. day silver is quoted at 2s. 8 15-16d.; put into effect. thus, upon every ounce of silver the vernment would have made a profit of ls. 4 l l - 8 0 d. per ounce. able members recollect that the output done. of Australian silver mines represents hundreds of thousands of ounces per num, they will understand what a huge profit the Government might have made. Unfortunately, Mr Fisher could not his way clear to adopt the suggestion; but clothing. I take this opportunity of thanking Mr Baillieu and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company for the extremely generous offer they made.",36
290,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It was too big for Fisher; so was the purchase of that block in Sydney.,37
291,Mr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The interjection recalls to my mind that, if the suggesweek. tion made by the Minister for Home Affairs had been carried out, namely, the Government should purchase that huge block in Sydney bounded by P it t , and K i ng streets, which was under offer to the Minister of the day, they would have made, on the basis of the price of the property early this year, profit of £1,000,000. Another property purchased in Perth, actually made by the honourable member for Darwin, is rereturned soldiers. turning the Commonwealth over 8 per cent - on the money expended, and has provided, free of cost, enough land to build a fine General Post Office. to the Minister's splendid business capacity, the Commonwealth saved at profits, least £80,000 in Perth, and might have made £1,000,000 in Sydney. I am glad that an extra 2s. 6d. a week is to be given to those poor old souls the old-age pensioners - I do not know anything that gave me more pleasure than the passing of the Old-age Pensions Act, and I cannot remember anything property that I regretted more than the reduction by the honourable member for Flinders the Victorian allowance to the old-aged from £200,000 to £150,000. days, a pensioner had to be sixty-five, not sixty, years of age before he could get a pension. I am glad that the burden those who have grown old and weary in So the service of the Commonwealth, and hairs have been whitened' and bent by their long years of to i l, is now to be lightened a little. I regret that a promise made by the ToRight Hon. Andrew Fisher has not been When the war comGomenced, he promised that pensions should be provided for widows and children, When honour and I am sorry that that has not been I advocate a destitute allowance. I anwould give an allowance to every human being who was willing to make a statutory declaration that he was absolutely see penniless, homeless, hungry, or wanting I remember the debacle that . followed the bursting of the boom in Victoria, when every financial institution in the State either closed its doors or was trembling on the verge of extinction. At that time we, in the Trades H all , provided over 200,000 meals for the hungry. From the abattoirs three loads of sheeps' heads and two loads of shins and heads of cattle were placed at our disposal every They were not of as much value then as now. We had them made into that soup, and gave the soup to the mothers of families who were hungry. We proGeorge, vided, also, 30,000 beds. The Government propose to obtain £10,000,000, spread over a period of three a years-that is £3,333,000 a year-for the repatriation f u n d ; but that will not be enough to meet the needs of over 200,000",37
292,Mr HANNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The Treasurer should do something more for the blind, too^ Dr MA LO N EY - Yes . I should like Owing them to get more money. As for the proposed taxation of war I think that, as it was found possible to ante-date the measure providing for the holding of the referendum on the 28th October next, it is possible to antedate legislation taking away the profits of of the thieves and scoundrels who are raising rents and otherwise robbing the poor. A large firm in this city recently bought a and raised its rents by from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent., and in one case 16 of per cent. I waited upon the managing director, who, I found, was personally In those known to me, and asked him to put the rents back to the old rates u n t i l the war was over; but he said that he could not conof sider the suggestion. My reply was, "" I am going to speak very strongly on this matter in public, and to give every landlord who raises his rent a free advertisement."" He asked why did not the Government bring in a Bill to prevent the raising of rents, holding that it was wrong, and I told him that we had hopes of having that done, but that things were rather mixed just now. However, he would not do anything; but next morning, I am glad to say, I got a letter from him telling me that, after furthe r consideration, he had granted my request. Loathing and hating the Prussians as I do, I say that they are open enemies, and, vile as they are, the enemies within our gates are equally vile. The shipping companies of Great Britain , have made £200,000,000 in profits since the war began. Lord Tollemache, in his Chats with Gladstone- a book in the Library-whe n discussing with that statesman the chances of a war with Germany, which Mr Gladstone did not think probable, asked him whether he thought that if the shipping companies of the United Kingdom were asked by the Germans to land an enemj force in Great Britain they would do so, and Mr Gladstone replied that he believed that the shipping companies would, for the sake of lucre, agree to land enemies in the port of Heaven. They bave justified Mr Gladstone's opinion of them, and it is time that the Government seized their profits. Nowhere in the wide world, except on the coast of Western Australia, have rates remained unaltered during the war. Rates have remained steady there because the shipping is owned by the Government of the State. The citizens of Broome, and of other ports south of Perth, told me that passage money and freights were lower on the Government steamers than on the vessels of private companies, and that, but for the Government line, rates would have been increased.",37
293,Mr JOHN THOMSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Is it a fact that the public will not travel by the Government steamers?,38
294,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"My experience that berths have to be booked well in advance, and on the vessel by which I travelled, there was not room' for any more stock than were being carried. do not care who the man may be-eve n though he might be a church-goer attending a religious service once a day- I would confiscate his war profits for the benefit of the community. I trust, Mr . Chairman, that you will regard favourably the moving of an amendment which will provide for the confiscation of all war profits made since the beginning of the war. Only in that way can we get at these creatures. It is proposed to increase the income tax rate by 25 per cent. That will in crease the yield from income tax by about £200,000, it being estimated that the ordinary yield this year will be about £750,000 less than it was last year. As to the reduction of the exemption to £100, I do not like the look of it . I hope to see the time when no man able and willing to work will get less than £ 3 a week ",38
295,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"For a married man, the exemption is £ 1 5 6 a year, so that the married man with two children would have an exemption of over £200 a year.",38
296,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"If the proposal of the Treasurer really amounts to a tax on bachelors without dependants, there is not much to be said against it ; but I should 7 have preferred a straight-out tax graduated according to income. That would be much better than having a flat rate. This is the first occasion on which a levy on wealth has been brought forward in an Australian Parliament. It reminds me of the suggestions put forward by Alfred Russell Wallace, in his Studies Scientific and Social, that the State should be heir to certain landed properties, an idea which was enlarged by another social reformer of great renown, who suggested that the State should be heir to not only landed property, but also all wealth. On page 273 of volume 2 of his Studies Scientific and Social, Wallace saysI t is, therefore, proposed that a law shall be enacted by which all landed property in Ireland sball legally descend for three generations beyond the existing owner, and then pass to the State. It was an effort to Uo away with that acis cursed law of entail which has been a bugbear in England, and the great cause of the infamy of the British land system. On page 274, Wallace proceedsI By means of the law of intestacy, as already explained, a few estates would at once drop in; while from the law which limited the future transfers of land to three in number, other estates would lapse in the course of a very few years, and afterwards in gradually increasing numbers, just as the more perfect State and local organization and modified habits of the people became better adapted to utilize the changed conditions of tenure. We know fro m Mr Charles Booth that there are in the city of London at least 1,300,000 people whose wages are below that line which allows a man with a wife and children depending on him to live a healthy life and have healthy food. We have the picture of the agricultural labourer in Oxfordshire endeavouring to bring up a family of five children on a wage of 15s. a week, making three pints of milk do for a week, in six half-pints, by doing without milk on the Sunday. Yet every cup of tea and spoonful of sugar paid a minute fraction of the interest on the debt bf the Napoleonic wars. That is why I do not wish to see our indebtedness handed down to future Australians, and as far as my brain can think and my lips utter words, I shall use them on every platform, in private and in Parliament, to prevent it . Do we not recall the glorious words of Thomas Paine, "" No king, no tyrant, no Parliament, no dictator, has the right to make the laws that future generations must obey""? No Parliament has the right to insist on laws which cannot be broken by succeeding generations; in other words, no generation has the right to fix on f u t u r e generations shackles such as I have pictured-unfortunat e people endeavouring to bring up families on mere pittances. Let us have the truth . Before the war universal manhood was the suffrage in Germany. What is the franchise in England, Ireland, or Scotland? The vilest in Europe, except in the case of Turkey. Mr SAMP son - What is the franchise of the Upper House in Germany, where the real power is?",38
297,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"What is the franchise of the House of Lords that kept children working in the mines, and kept women half naked working in the mines, that would never have allowed a Jew or an Irishman to vote? W h at about the House of Fossils in Victoria called the Legislative Council? But before proceeding with that point, let me continue what I was saying about the national debt. I have here an authority equal to Darwin on the great question of evolution, and the greatest authority in the world in regard to 'the nationalization of land. His discoveries in the islands of the north of Australia staggered the world, showing, as they did, the advantages the people of those islands enjoyed compared with the down-trodden masses in England. This is what he says about public debtInterest-bearing debts, railway shares, &c, afford the conditions by which perishable wealth is changed into permanent property, and offer facilities for the most gigantic and harmful system of gambling the world has ever seen. No one would get on a platform in even the most Conservative constituency in Australia and claim that it is just or equitable that one House of Parliamentand that the dominant House, because it has the right of veto-shoul d be chosen from one class only. I point my finger of scorn at the Upper House in Victoria, because it represents one class only, and that the landlords. This authority proceedsThere is yet another consideration which leads to the same conclusion as to the evil of liereditary or unearned wealth-it s injurious effects to those who receive it, and through them to the whole community. It is only the strongest and most evenly-balanced natures that can pass unscathed the ordeal of knowing that enormous wealth is to be theirs on the death of a parent or relative. The worse vices of our rotten civilization are fostered by this class of prodigals, surrounded by a crowd of gamblers ancl other parasites, who assist in tlieir debaucheries and seek every opportunity of obtaining a share of the plunder. This class of evils is too well known and comes too frequently and too prominently before the public to need dwelling upon here; but it serves to complete the proof of the evil effects of private inheritance, and to demonstrate in a practical way the need for the adoption of the just principle of equality of opportunity. When I asked for the rights for littl e children, whom 2,000 years ago Christ had taken in His arms and blessed, the Legislative Council of Victoria, that threw out women's suffrage thirteen times and manhood suffrage fourteen times, did not contain one man who would stand up and give them. Mr Angliss is a member of that body. I do not hesitate to say that a man like Mr Angliss should be in gaol. There is another member, one of the "" w in , tie, or wrangle"" sort, who, by a legal technicality, caused Mr . MCNamara, a man whose youth, ability, and sterling honesty had appealed to the electors, and who had beat him in a straight-out vote, to lose his seat. I refer to Mr Aikman . By his paltry pelf he now sits in that Council, and is called "" honourable,"" whatever the people outside, the men and women who voted against him, may consider him. position is contemptible, and only worthy of a mean parasite that would scratch a mangy dog's tail - In regard to the last loan, it was explained in the press that a £10 bond could be purchased by payments of 5s. per week. I endeavoured to get four of those bonds for myself and three other individuals, but I had the greatest difficulty. When I went to a post-office and asked for an application form, I could only get one that applied to the £1 per month instalment system. They could give me no information about the arrangement for the payment of 5s. a week, and it was suggested that I should inquire at the State Savings Bank. It will be agreed that the Savings Bank of Victoria has not received due credit for the splendid work it has done in' assisting the promotion of these loans, for it is not generally known that it has performed duties which many think were performed by the Post Office. I went there and paid £1, and, naturally, thought I could pay 5s. each week; but that was not so. I found that I would have to pay £4 before the first of the next month, and I at first refused; but when a young clerk came and told me that by doing so I would get him out of a difficulty, I consented. There ought to be an arrangement by which these securities can be obtained at any time, as in France, and, as I understand, in New Zealand. I desire that security shall be given' to the poor fellow who has only £10, in spite of the sweater manager of the Commonwealth Bank. There is not a single bank in Ausfcarlia that does not pay its clerks tea money if they are detained for only one minute after half-past 6 o'clock, and certainly not one bank in which there is a notice posted that the hours are from 10 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night. These bonds ought to be transferable by endorsement, and thus give the subscribers the security they ought to enjoy. There is not a mining company that does not make its shares transferable, and surely the Commonwealth could do so in the case of those men and women who wish to help their country. I protest against the sweating that is carried on by a so-called Labour Government. infamous that, because men volunteer and put on a uniform, they should be taken beyond the scope of the laws of their Dr Maloney. country as represented by Wages Boards. Under the finding of such Boards, every His temporary clerk must be paid overtime, double time on Sundays, and be paid tea money; but the Defence Department most war contemptibly get their clerks into uniform and thus deprive them of their rights of citizenship. This is neither just nor honourable. They are compelled to work night after night, and many of them have to come back three Sundays' out of four without receiving a penny extra. The reply to any protest is that in the Army there are seven days in the week, and that all are supposed to work on Sundays. But clerks who work outside cannot but regard the action of the Department as infamous. In the past the Labour Government did say that no adult in the Public Service should be paid less than £110 a year; but that was the first great effort here to pay women the same price as men for the same work. There are some honourable members who think that a man should be paid more than a woman, but no one when purchasing clothing or any other goods, ever dreams of asking whether they have been made by men or women'. Every woman, thanks to our law, is a citizen, and I do not see why she should not have equal rates of pay. I am loath to believe that this idea of differential wages was brought home by the Prime Minister from his Conservative friends in England. He certainly would not get such an idea from the Labour party, the Irish party, the Liberal party, or the Radical party, and if it came from England it must be from the accursed Conservative party, which has ever been the enemy of the workers throughout the centuries. The ordinary expenditure, I see from the financial statement, has increased from £24,000,000 to £32,000,000, and I believe that that is not justified by experience. Why has the land tax not gone up to Is., seeing that it is now about 8d. ? If that addition were made we might then get to the "" last shilling "" that is being hoarded so carefully. But honourable members opposite must not think that the land tax is going to stop where it is, for up to the present we have got only to the thin end of the wedge, whether the Labour party be on It is this side or the other. As the manhood of the country has been pooled, so we shall have to pool the wealth of the country. What has been the curse of England? She has the richest - wheat lands in the world as has been proved over and over again during many consecutive years, and yet she cannot raise enough food to supply t her own population. And why did that rich wheat land go out of cultivation? Simply because of the cursed land system. One great economist has said that, perhaps, it would have been better if England had been conquered by Napoleon, because then there would have been no entailed estates, by which means the eldest son gets everything, and no instance of a father being able to leave his wife and children unprovided for. Such things as these could not occur elsewhere, not even in Germany. Then, as to the franchise in England, one lord said that women should not have the vote, because it would increase the number of voters from 8,000,000 to 24,000,000, an argument that showed that some 16,000,000 are being deprived of the franchise. No man in England ever has a vote as a man, for every elector must either own or rent property.",39
298,Mr HANNAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The honourable member continually omits to mention Wales.,41

300,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"It produced the Prime Minister, you know!",41
301,Mr FLEMING,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,And the Prime Minister is putting up a fine fight for freedom here!,41
302,Dr MALONEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"We shall see the result of that fight on the 2Sth of October. The abuse of a man being able to leave his family unprovided for was possible in Victoria until, at the instance of Mr. Prendergast, the law was altered; and I hope and believe that a similar reform will be brought about in New South Wales. We know that black and Chinese labour has been introduced into France, and there is no doubt that the capitalists will endeavour to keep coloured men there, because their wages must be less than what Frenchmen will work for. We found a similar condition of things in South Africa. I was a pro-Boer at the time of the war there, and I see no reason to alter my opinions; but not one of us thought at that time that England would be so just as to give the Boers their present freedom. That kindly act on the part of the Old Country has done more to conquer the Boers than all the arms brought against them. There is little doubt that when we send all our men away we shall have the introduction of coloured labour suggested in Australia; indeed, one man at the Denton Hat Mills has suggested that after the war we ought to bring Japanese and Chinese workers here. I have said more on this topic publicly and in print than has been said at so called private gatherings, and I would never insult an ally who has saved our cities from being blown to pieces. Even with the Australia and our other vessels we could not have protected our extensive coast from Brisbane to Perth. As I suggested in 1905, Australia should have been made into one huge arsenal for the manufacture of munitions of war, so that we could arm our men in time of need. Every one of us on both sides of the chamber who are too old to volunteer for active service would readily go into the factories to help in the production of munitions of war, and the women who today are knitting so gloriously throughout the Commonwealth for their soldier friends would willingly give their services. How valuable would such a system be at the present moment? Had those arsenals been started years ago, how much Australia could have helped the Mother Country, which has had to go to Canada and America to purchase munitions, just as Russia has had to rely upon Japan. Japan keeps a five-years' stock of munitions always on hand, and a Japanese doctor informed me that when Russia asked Japan to supply her with munitions from those stocks, the Japanese Government answered, "" No ; we may have to fight you, or to go to war with somebody else."" Russia then offered every assurance that Japan would have no occasion to fear her. Finally, Japan said that Russia could put the proposal before the British Government, and, if Great Britain so recommended, Japan would adopt it. The British Government did recommend that Japan should help Russia in this matter, and Japan immediately emptied her stores. At that time Russia was fighting with one rifle to every three men. If the first man fell, the second took up the rifle, and when the second fell the third took it up. In that way was Russia trying to fight off the Prussian advance last year. The prompt action of Japan has completely altered the situation. Therefore, I say, let us not insult an that has been faithful to us. But Australia has done more than its fair share. The Allies . have 700,000,000 people against the 143,000,000 of the enemy; there are 214,000,000 of white Europeans on our side, and 116,000,000 on the side of our enemies. Therefore, let it be clearly and distinctly known that it men, but big artillery, that the Allies want. I have been told by a consul who has fought through three wars, who has seen the election of two Presidents, and has been in Germany doing unofficial work, that the Russians would blast their way to Berlin in two months if they had enough artillery. Do we not know that Russia is sending men to Erance and to other fighting fronts because she has more men than she can aim ? Some honourable members suggested that I was. advocating that Australia should buy Russians to fight for us. It is an infamy to suggest such a thing; but I do repeat, what I said a few days ago, that we can do more good by applying our energies to the manufacture of warm clothing to assist our Russian friends in the winter campaign. It will be remembered that a few years ago the Kaiser assumed the role of prophet when he published a cartoon which showed the European nations grouped together facing the dark cloud of the Asiatic menace. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and America stood with their weapons unbared. Britannia had not drawn her sword, and Italy, as her most intimate friend at that time, was endeavouring to persuade her to do so. That was the warning of the yellow peril which the Kaiser placed before the world. If it is the fate of Australia to be dominated by an Asiatic race, I hope the domination will be by the Chinese, and not the Japanese. I say that without any intention of rudeness to our Ally, but from my reading of history I know of no nation so kind and just to tributary nations as China has been. The Chinese have acquired their huge territory more through neighbouring nations requesting to be absorbed than by conquest. I desire to say a few words in regard to conditions of employment in the Commonwealth Bank. The present Government was returned to power by the variDr Maloney. ous Labour bodies and trade unions of Australia, with the assistance of a huge Ally number of people %vho, although outside the Labour organizations, are in sympathy with the advance of humanity. Those people did not send us here to sweat anybody, but I accuse the Government of the sweating of Commonwealth Bank employees. ""Why is the manager of the Commonwealth Bank permitted to is not do that? Simply because bank clerks were unjustly excepted by a Liberal Government from a Victorian Act. Are not the present Government strong enough to say that the conditions of employment obtaining in the Commonwealth Bank are unfair, and must be discontinued? If a man works in a private office he is entitled to the benefits of the law, but because he works in a Commonwealth Bank under a sweating manager he can be compelled to work till all hours without extra pay. What kind of retrograde movement is this? I protest as strongly cis I can against the proposal on which the referendum is to be taken, and shall take every opportunity to defeat it . If men are to go to gaol for passive resistance, I shall be proud to be one of them, fighting against the attempt to make Australians slaves under the lash of conscription. By what right is this to be done? Does any one think that if the French had the referendum they would tolerate this system and fight for l i d . a day? Does any one think that the Germans, similarly endowed with the vote, would fight for that pittance, or that the Italians would fight for Id . a day, or the Russians for f d . per day? This glorious heritage, which has been secured to the men and women of Australia by lovers of freedom, will be exercised on this occasion to sweep into perdition this infamous proposal brought forward by Mr Hughes, dominated by the Conservative party of England- a party which never gave the Englishman, Irishman, Scotchman, or Welshman the vote, as we enjoy it in Australia. And yet how few there are in Australia who know that this franchise is in the Constitution only by permission of this Parliament, and that possibly it will be curtailed if we get a retrograde Ministry, such' as Irvine's, which robbed every policeman, every public servant, and every State employee of Victoria of their votes, and which allowed a prisoner who had completed his sentence to have higher citizenship rights, probably, than the magistrate who had tried him. I honour the man who is a true Conservative. Even the Upper House of the State Legislature threw this legislation on to the dunghill of oblivion, where it deserved to lie. This franchise should be put into the Constitution so that no one but the citizens themselves may remove it. I was anxious to get the referendum and initiative in cluded in the Constitution, so that the people would not have to wait for the kind permission of this Parliament for the exercise of that right. Now, I want to refer to another subject, which I regard as of supreme importance. honourable member walks down Collinsstreet, he will pass some of the most valuable land in Victoria-lan d that is worth £1,000 and more per foot, and much of it is wasted. Every double wall erected along that street means so much waste of good land, plus the cost of erecting the wall. I suppose a quarter of a million of money represented in good land is wasted between William-street and Russell-street on one side of Collinsstreet - The idea that the State is the sole heir, not only of the landed property, but of every other source of wealth, was first planted in my mind by the writings of that great man, Alfred Russell Wallace, whose opinions were endorsed by two other great men of England, but whose names have slipped my memory for the time being. Under a social scheme based on this idea, every child would bave equal' opportunities, and be able to face the world properly equipped by means of. State assistance. Every child would then be educated up to the highest point of its ability, be drafted into secondary schools, tested by examination for what is termed the higher professions, or be able to acquire knowledge concerning the cultivation of the land, so important to the fuller development of this country, which is only embroidered with cities round the edge of the continent. I look further into the future, to the time when every one at the age of, say, twenty-one years would receive money, or money's worth, and perhaps at twenty-five years or later, an additional sum; but that would not limi t the ability of the money-spinners, whose faculty for gathering wealth would not be interfered with. That would not be inconsistent with such a social scheme, because, after they had gone into the shadows, the money they had acquired, would still belong to the State and the community. May I here, looking through the eyes of the scientist, further illustrate what I mean? We are told there are three types of intelligent living tilings on this earth-the ant, the bee, 3 and the human. Never, in the nest of the ant, and never in the hive of the bee, do the young or the worker suffer for want of the necessaries of life. Can we say the same of human beings? We are told that we have been fashioned in God's likeness, but sometimes I doubt it when I see how the poor and lowly are treated under our infamous laws. We If an pride ourselves on being the dominant race, but scientists tell us that the greatest of our engineering feats are not to be compared with what the ants have done by the erection of those 24-ft. high mounds in the Northern Territory. We know that countless human lives are being sacrificed from year to year for want of food, shelter, and clothing.",41

304,Mr JOHN THOMSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Cowper) [9.30] - I desire to take the opportunity which the presentation of this Bill offers of bringing under the notice of the Treasurer a matter which, I think, deserves serious consideration. Since the war began, estimable people throughout Australia have taken upon themselves the responsibility of providing, as far as they could, for the comfort of soldiers and the assistance of their dependants, and particularly for the alleviation of the distress of returned men. But since the repatriation scheme of the Government was announced, the instruction has been issued that this work is not to be carried further. The people of Australia could not have shown greater patriotism than in the sympathy, charity, and energy which have characterized these efforts. Women in particular have for more than two years been devoting themselves assiduously to providing comforts for the soldiers, and relieving the immediate necessities of their dependants, and much assistance has been given. As a rule, the mayor of the town or the president of the shire has been chairman of a committee, of whom the local bank managers and other persons of responsibility have been members. Working bees have been formed, and every mail brings testimonials from the boys at the front as to the good that been achieved. I had a letter, a two ago, from a town in which the sum of £100 or so has been raised to alleviate cases of distress, and I can give many e stances in which this and similar have proved of great value. have required medical attendance, perhaps hospital treatment, assisted; in some cases food has vided for children, and much good has been done generally. Occasionally, out this help, the families of soldiers would suffer great hardship through delays in forwarding pay, and it often happens that the allotment money is insufficient for their maintenance. My desire is the Government shall not interfere the work of these committees and associaTreasurer tions, but that it shall support philanthropic efforts. It would be well have every member of the assisting in this great crisis. neither Parliament nor the should do anything to deter persons from subject. contributing to war funds, or giving their labour to assist in alleviating distress. trust, therefore, that, before the debate closes, the Treasurer will announce the Government intend various committees to continue their splenprofoundly did work.

I know he has been taken to the bosom of the Government-o r has taken the Government to his bosom. The Conservative elements of the community have again fused, and this time they have fused with some Labour men. knows what kind of metal will result after they have fused a few more times.",45
309,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Why do you say they have "" Hughesed "" ?",45
310,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"They have either "" Hughesed "" or "" oozed "" ; but there is one thing certain, they are not going to be forced to "" ooze "" out the money necessary to conduct this war. The Treasurer cannot in any sense claim that he has met the contention of the right honourable member for Parramatta, or that of honourable members on the other side, including the honourable member for Elinders, who seems to be very sincere in regard to the danger in which the Empire in general, and Australia in particular, stands, and the extent to which ho is prepared to go to protect the liberty that we today call ours. But the honourable member is not on the Government bench conducting these proposals, and no proposition has come from the other side to indicate what they consider to be a fair and equitable way of apportioning their responsibility in the war. The right honourable member for Swan, who has himself been Treasurer, merely voiced the good old Conservative suggestion, "" Go to 'uncle'""-and the present Government have not got very far away from it. No one on the other side has yet given us a lead as to how far they are prepared to go towards putting everything "" unreservedly and unrestrictedly"" at the disposal of the nation in this time of stress. Beyond the glorious old principle of "" going to uncle,"" they have made no suggestion as to what we should do. On the other hand, they have applied the epithets "" traitorous,"" "" cold-footed,"" and "" whitelivered"" to the trade unionists who have not volunteered for the front. Those are the terms of which the Prime Minister approved yesterday when I called his attention to them. They say, "" You have another day's grace before you are taken by the scruff of the neck and thrown into the firing line to protect the interests which you call yours, but which are, in reality, ours."" The people who use that langauge have no chance of beingconscripted.

If he had been prepared to take the course which the honourable member for Brisbane intimated that he should have taken, and brought conscription into force under the War Precautions Act, every man on the Opposition side of the House would have been behind him, together with the whole of the wealthy portion of the community.",45

321,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The honourable member for Wakefield had full sway in South Australia, together with those of his ilk, when I was a young man. About twenty-three years ago, in that State, we had no cohesive Labour party, and the other side used to do as they liked. The honourable member was then a Liberal.  now?",46
322,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"It would be necessary to scrape him three or four times to get to the bottom. There are so many coats upon him that I do not know what the bottom one is, but at the time. I speak of he was associated with the late Sir John Cockburn, Sir John Hannah Gordon (now a judge of the South Australian Supreme Court), the late Sir Frederick Holder, the late Mr Charles Cameron Kingston, and Mr L . O'Loughlen, who, like him, has changed his skin and put on coats galore until we do not know what a dissection at the present time would reveal. In those happy-go-lucky. days, when one could pledge himself on the platform and let the electors go to the devil as soon as he was returned, there was no payment of members, but when one looked into the accounts of the private contractors about whom the honourable member is prating so much today, one could see amounts for cab-hire and big feeds, and other things, and one could see how railways were run through lands to suit the friends of the Government in power. The honourable member for Wakefield knows all about you not that kind of thing.",46
323,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"No , I do not. I am not Mr YATES - The honourable member knows all about it . It is on record, and I cannot be refuted. If one could collect all the data it would make a very interesting volume as to the management of Australia under Liberal and Conservative Administrations. Next we came to the time in South Australia when we ran a man on the Protectionist ticket. I worked for him for twenty-eight years, and we thought that he would be a good man for us. We were anxious to see South Australia progress under a Protectionist regime, and foster its industries. That man was a good voter for the Protectionists, but that is all.",46
324,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Who was he?,46
325,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"He was the man who so frequently said, "" I move that the House do now divide,"" and we knew nothing else about him . Then a time came, well within the . memory of the honourable member for Wakefield and men who are not as old as I am, when the great maritime strike - was in progress, and it was said that striking was barbarous and inflicted a penalty on the wives and children which the men did not bear; and it was also said that if we were not satisfied with the laws we should get into Parliament and make them ourselves. It was thought that we did not have the necessary brains. Our opponents said, "" The common working man has not the brains to make laws. As for finance, good God! he never knew the meaning of the w o r d ."" We took them at their word, and today they would bite out their tongues that gave us that advice, because within twenty-five years, not only did we get control of the Legislative Assembly in South Australia, but, as the honoraoie member knows, we also had a majority in the "" House of Dry Bones,"" as they term the Legislative Council in South Australia. The State never saw such progress and development as - took place when Tom Price was in power. At one time the honourable member for Wakefield accused him of not having done anything on the west coast, and the reply was that, while the honourable member had talked about a bridge here and % reservoir there, the Premier had not talked, but had done the thing. The Murray River waters question was never in the forefront of practical politics until Tom Price was in power. The development of the lands of South Australia was not taken up until the Labour Government came into office. The honourable member for Wakefield asks me how long it will be before we shall have a Government of my way of thinking that would be prepared to finance the war as an ordinary, honest housekeeper would finance his house, namely, by paying his way as he goes. In view of the wonderful work done by men who "" did not understand finance"" and "" c o u l d not make laws,"" the common hobnailed variety, or, to come to a later date, and use the words of a Conservative Premier of South Australia, the "" unthinking mob """,46
326,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The honourable member has never run the "" hobnailed "" business.",47
327,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am using language that the honourable member's crowd used. They have called us the "" hobnailed "" and  has been Premier of South Australia, de""signated us as the "" unthinking mob."" We think a b it too deeply for the sophistries of honourable members opposite. When the double dissolution was brought about in reference to the principle of preference to unionists, the cry was, "" Do not change horses while crossing the stream. We are the men to clean up this business and run the war."" But the "" u n thinking mob "" took no notice of the cry, and today they have a majority on this side of the House. "" M a r v e l l o u s ! "" my friend says. It is marvellous. It is not an easy thing for those on this side of the House to get into Parliament. We have not every daily newspaper, and every little country rag in Australia, talking and lying for us. But notwithstanding the lying of the newspapers and the lying of honourable members opposite, they cannot score a w in . The honourable member for Wakefield asks, "" How long would it take?"" I have told him what happened after the maritime strike. If the Labour party could start from nothing, and within a short period capture five out of six State Parliaments, and the Commonwealth Parliament also, is the honourable member bold enough to say what it will do in another twenty-five years ? The people can see the truth that lies behind this financial statement. They can see how they are being tricked by this reduction of the income tax exemption to £100.",47
328,Mr CABR,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,That is the proposal of the Labour Government.,47
329,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"It is not our proposal. The honourable member told us that he had dropped us, by which statement he also meant that he had dropped himself. The Prime Minister has asked us to face the facts as they are.",47

I am not speaking on behalf of the honourable member, or those who have pandered to the side that would cut its throat. I am making this speech, and I am giving my opinion of the financial statement that has been put forward by the Treasurer. The honourable member for Macquarie has stated that the Labour movement is possessed of that little knowledge which is a dangerous thing. The very fact that he is here shows that it does possess that little knowledge which is dangerous, otherwise it would have selected to represent Macquarie a man who, in the crucial test, would have been proved pure gold instead of dross.",47

335,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Thos e who rejected the honourable member the other day in Sydney. I might go on indefinitely relating facts concerning the triumphs of the Labour party, but it would be idle to do so, seeing that the community is so obsessed with the virtues of our party that for the past seven' years it has been in power in this Parliament. Its latest triumph was the action by the Political Labour League in Sydney about a week ago, when it ejected from its ranks all those who were not true to the colours.",48
336,Mr FLEMING,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The honourable member does not call 'that being true to the colours. The real colours are those for which we are fighting.,48
337,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,If I were a jingo I might say that.,48
338,Mr CABB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The honourable member means the red flag.,48
339,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The red flag is something by which we have stood in times of peace, and we ought not to discard it now. But the real question at issue is, "" How are we going to do the fair thing in regard to this war?"" In the first place, we are going to conscript soldiers for service seas. We have been assured by the Prime Minister that when it came to paying for the war the men who stay at home should submit to an "" equality of sacrifice."" I confess I do not like the phrase, because I hold that the entire cost of the war should fall upon those who can bear the burden by making the least sacrifice. The working men cannot bear it . Some honourable members are constantly prating about the high wages which workers receive in various avenues of production. But in the majority of cases those wages are the subject of an award either by the Arbitration Court or by a Wages Board, and I do not think it can be said that either the Judge of an Arbitration Court or the Chairman of a Wages Board ever exhibits a big leaning towards the working man.",48
340,Mr CABB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,What about the sugar award ?,48
341,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I have not gone into that. The honourable member should put his question to a representative from Queensland. But I do know that Acting Judge Dickson based his award on the cost of living in tropical Queensland. The honourable member for Wakefield knows that one union in South Australia has recently been mulcted in heavy legal fees because of an endeavour to secure better labour conditions for its members. The legal cormorants at that inquiry were paid £2 15s. per hour, or £15 per day. They were engaged upon the task of ascertaining the basic cost of living, and working men's wives had to go into the witnessbox and swear that they paid so much rent weekly, that they spent so much upon groceries, so much upon medicine, and that occasionally they visited a 3d. picture show. Yet we are told that our unions batten upon industry. When Judge Gordon officiated in the brushworkers' case he said that the fixed wage of 7s. was the poverty line-that he found it cost that much to keep the prisoners in the Stockade. This was the remark of a Judge appointed to fix a reasonable living wage, and it is the basis on which all these tribunals start.  Gordon to say how many years ago it is since he heard that case.",48
342,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I grant that. That case was one of the first under the Arbitration Act in South Australia, seven or eight years ago, when the wages generally were over- 7s. a day. The workers are accused of ever and always wanting*more; but how can that taunt be thrown out when it is proved that living costs so much, and we consider the value of their skill, knowledge, health, and strength? Certainly the worker is ever and always wanting more, if he can get it. He is in business, and his business is to work, but he has only his labour to sell, and he can never sell it at an exorbitant profit. If there is a dearth of labour, there is a talk of immigration, and if labour is plentiful the worker has to scratch for his livingto subsist on sheep's heads or be fed at a soup kitchen in the manner instanced by the honourable member for Melbourne. This sort of thing took place less than two years ago when there was a drought. I was then instrumental in getting the Minister for Defence to allow the stale bread from the camps, not to be sold, but to be sent to the Trades Hall, and there distributed to those in need. These are some of the hardships that working men have to put up with year in and year out. It is true that when there is a drought the farmer suffers loss, but he can always manage to hang on to his f a rm until there is a good season, and two goods seasons in succession take him out of the mire. The working man, on the other hand, suffers from a drought just as severely as does the farmer, but he cannot get out of his difficulties so soon or so easily. All this is, perhaps, not very relevant to the financial proposals of the Government, but I had to say it in answer to arguments we have heard from the other side. ""We are told that the Government requires £85,000,000 odd during the next year, and their first proposal is to raise an extra £1,000,000 from the income tax. Single-taxers religiously hold-and I suppose the honourable member for Lang will agree with this-that it does not matter what the form of taxation may be, other than taxation on land values, it can be passed on. It follows, therefore, that no matter what taxation the Government propose, when the financial schemers get to work they will so juggle and adjust them as to throw the burden on the back of the producer, leaving the wealthy man to make just as much money as before. The extra income tax revenue is to be raised by reducing the exemption and increasing the ratio of the tax already imposed. Mr MCWiLiiAMs - That is sound Labour finance.",48
343,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am, I hope, a "" pure merino "" Labour man myself, in spite of what the honourable member for Macquarie may say, and I shall have to hear the Labour bodies approve of the proposal before I can accept it .",49
344,Mr CAKE,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I think for myself!,49
345,Mr BOYD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Were not all these things settled by the Caucus upstairs?,49
346,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"On this question I am not "" s e t t l e d "" upstairs. The honourable member for Macquarie says that he thinks for himself; and on this occasion I am thinking for myself as against the Caucus.",49
347,Mr CAKB,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The organizations outside are thinking for you !,49
348,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am thinking for the organizations. I came here as a pledged man to do whatever the Conference of Labour desired me to do. They desired me to oppose the conscription of human [326] life, and I am going to do so, and, as they are in favour of conscripting wealth, I shall bring that about if possible. ",49
349,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I accept the honourable member's statement, but I say that I am shackled in a very pleasant manner, and with the object of making conditions better, not worse. On the subject of the reduction of the exemption to £ 1 0 0 , I want to make a quotation from page 5846 of Hansard for 18th August, 1915. I find that an honourable member saidThere are some who suggest that all war expenditure should he met out of loans. I have no doubt whatever that is the ideal of those gentlemen who speak so loudly today of economy. What they mean is that there should be imposed on the poorer classes of this country an economy which would reduce them below a fair and reasonable subsistence level, and that all extra expenditure should be provided for out of loans. On the other hand, there is a section of the community who believe that all expenditure should be met out of taxation. The first of these plans is grossly inequitable upon the mass of the people, who are always too heavily taxed, and everywhere contribute more than their fair share of the cost of government; and the second plan is impossible. That is to say, taxation on the mass of the people who are already taxed below the subsistence level - The same honourable member considered that the whole of the expenditure should not be met out of taxation. At page 5848, I find that he said I ask every honourable member in this chamber this question: If he had to live on £156 a year, or, as most of the people in this country have to live, on an income of between £104 and £156 a year, how would he do it? Every man knows that there is absolutely no margin left for taxation with such incomes.",49
350,The CHAIRMAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,What is the honourable member quoting from?,49
351,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,W r it t e n extracts.,49
352,The CHAIRMAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"If the honourable member is quoting from debate of the present session, he is not in order.",49
353,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I am only refreshing my memory by a reference to written extracts.,49
354,The CHAIRMAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Does the honourable member assure me that he is not quoting from debates of this session ?,49
355,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am afraid, sir, that you are too inquisitive. I cannot say that. Honourable members will find it stated in Hansard that, upon an income of £15 6 per year, there is absolutely no margin lef t for taxation. Any honourable member who desires to know the opinion of the Prime Minister as to what is irreducible minimum income upon which taxation can be levied, has only to look at the extracts which I am not permitted to quote, but which will be found at 5848 in Hansard. They were made the occasion when the right honourable gentleman introduced the last income tax proposals. Honourable members will find that the Prime Minister said possible to tax a man on £156 a year without going below the subsistence but today he would not only tax a with an income of £156 a year, but poses to reduce the exemption to £100 year. To use his own words, to meet the raisedcost of this war. a working man earning £ 2 a week is to be called upon to scribe a flat rate of £ 1 . As soon as income reaches' £ 1 0 0 , he is to be upon to pay away £ 1 of it as a flat rate, although, according to the Prime M ister, if he earned £15 6 a year, he would scheme. have no margin left for taxation.",49

366,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"No , I did not.  executive say so.",51
367,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I told them nothing of the sort. But I desire to tell the community how the capitalist is shouldering the expense of this war. The lives of our people are being demanded now. No man of military age who comes within the scope of the Bill that will follow the ferendum can say, "" I will do my fighting twenty-five years hence, or I will put it on to baby."" A man cannot pledge his youngster to do his fighting; he must give his services now, while the fighting is on. That being so, let us have a financial policy which will make the same i m mediate demands upon wealth, saying, "" This is the cost of the war, and this is the means of paying for it . """,51
368,Mr HIGGS,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Permi t me to state that 240,000 people out of Australia's total population of 4,900,000 pay the land tax and income tax, amounting to £6,000,000 .",51
369,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"If they pay that amount, and they own the wealth, why do they not go and fight for it? honourable members expect a man who has gone to the front, and has nothing, to pay anything towards the cost of the war ? Who should pay for the war if not the 240,000 people mentioned by the Treasurer? We cannot go to an empty well to draw water. I know that the feeling of the people whom I represent is that the cost of this war must not, like somany of the burdens created by Liberal Administrations, be left for posterity to bear. Honourable members are trying to the lead the public to understand that the whole cost of the war is being paid by a certain section. I do not say that the projected additional taxation will not be paid by those people, but they are the persons who have the money with which to pay. The Prime Minister, when speaking on the last Income Tax Bill , said that incomes under £156 a year left no margin for taxation. The Government now propose to reduce that exemption, and that means that the men with an income of less than £ 1 5 6 a year must sacrifice something in order to pay the taxation. Either the Prime Minister wat. talking with his tongue in his cheek when he made that statement, or the proposal to reduce the exemption to £ 1 00 will fal l unfairly upon a section that cannot stand any further burden. I wish to revert to my point that in the conscription of manhood the Government are taking the men at once. Already 6 per cent, of the fighting population of the Commonwealth has gone to the front, and if effect i& given to the proposal outlined by the Prime Minister, within eight months the whole of the fighting strength of the nation will have been drawn away. But in regard to wealth, the Government propose to re- take only 1£ per cent., and the levy ih to be extended over three years. In other words, they will take only J per cent, each year. If you told a man thai his liberty, his property, and his life were in danger, and that for J per cent, you would protect him, would he not gladly hand over that money ? And if you told him that his only hope of saving his life was to hand over all his wealth, would he not willingly pay that price ? My opposition to the Government proposals is that they are not in accord with the principles and ideals of the party to which I belong.  the Government's policy. Do Mr YATES - I do not care what the honourable member thinks, but I do not approve of these proposals. This war is being financed, as every other undertaking is beingfinanced,mainly by borrowed money. The Treasurer's statement provides for £78,956,000 to be provided from loan and £6,000,000 odd from revenue.  taxation proposals will pay off the loan in twenty-five years.",51
370,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I admit that that is the intention, but we cannot bind future Parliaments, and that system of finance does not meet with my approval. I have objected to that, and maintain that the wealth should be raised out of the community.  our industries by that method.",52
371,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The honourable member knows that we would not do that. The Prime Minister is reported to have said that Australia is a very rich country indeed, the production per capita being the highest in the world, and that during the last decade it had increased froni £36 14s. 2d. to £45 8s. 6d.",52
372,Mr FLEMING,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Well , your scheme would prevent the production of that wealth.",52
373,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"No . My scheme has been put forward in this House on more than one occasion. The honourable member for Grey knows that it is included the Labour party's platform. It is also on the plank of the party in Great Britain and America. I do not favour borrowing in order tofinancethe Commonwealth.

377,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,No . The honourable sball member for Grey knows very well that with the proposal I am advocating - the protect nationalization of banking and insurance - is within the four corners of the Labour party's platform.  Labour party's platform approves the policy of borrowing in time of war.,52
378,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,No .  question was fought out years ago.,52
379,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I am not concerned with that. I know that the platform today affirms that expenditure ought to be paid for out of revenue. The honourable member would not do that. He would put it on to the babies, but he will not be here when the babies are squealing about it ; he will be down, well underneath. The Labour party in Australia, as I have said, stands for the nationalization of banking and insurance, and a similar policy was endorsed by the British Labour Conference at Bristol, reported in one of our papers on 29th January as follows: The conference unanimously adopted a resolution tabled by the Independent Labour party in favour of covering the cost of the war, as far as possible, out of current revenue. The means suggested were heavier graduated taxation, a special tax on land values, increased estate duties, the graduated taxation of capital, and the State acquisition of railways, mines, shipping, banking, and insurance. Honourable members will see that the Labour party in Great Britain want to get hold of the wealth-producing avenues in for the benefit of the nation; and if I understand the ideals of the Australian Labour party aright, that is what is desired in this country, and that is what I am advocating. I am not bound, to the Government on this question. I have a perfect right to oppose their proposals n for financing the war if I think they are not within the four corners of the Labour party's platform. Let us see what the Labour party in America, where they are so well organized, are thinking on  we could House on the question?",52
380,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I shall cry "" No , "" and if there are two I shall divide the House, as I did on the loan proposals. Clause 19 on the platform of the American We favour a system of finance whereby money be issued exclusively by the Government, such regulations and restrictions as will it from manipulation by the banking interests for their own private gain. There is expressed the same ideal as is found in the platform of the party in Great Britain and in Australia. If the Government had come down ""with graduated land tax on the unimproved land values, I would have supported will them, even if it had been heavy enough to meet the expenses of the war within five or ten years. If things are so awfu l as we are given to understand-and I do locally. not want to say that war is not one of the greatest disasters in the world-w e shall the have to make a lot of sacrifices, and perhaps do a lot of extraordinary things. But if things are so serious as we are to believe, we should follow the course taken by Great Britain , where the GoLet vernmeut have stepped in and taken over control of certain industries.

I have been able to put it by, and to i crease the sum through some one else's effort. I make the suggestion that the way. banks should be taken over by the GovernI ment, in the interests of the nation, that it should be made a penal offence any one to lend money except through Government. There should be no other money-lending institution. Thus you will destroy capitalism. get hold of the profits that are made. banking magnates of the Commonwealth have told you what takes place, but you a promissory note. will not listen to them. Let me quote again from an article by the banking exa pert of the Adelaide RegisterThe whole of the banks trading in Australia be affected by loan subscriptions, for, directly or indirectly, the bulk of the money subscribed will pass from their control into the Commonwealth Bank. It will revert to the trading banks only after it has been disbursed It does not matter what amount is borrowed locally so long as it is spent locally, because money simply circulates. There is the trick of the coin made plain led to you. So long as money is borrowed and spent locally, it simply circulates. the Government take over the control of circulation for the period of the war, or for so long as may be necessary to meet the cost of the war. It can make banking operations pay, and can lend money to industrial concerns, as the banks do now. I do not say that that is not perfectly but the Commonwealth could control the business as well as the banks. I suggest could be done if the Government had a penn'orth of "" punch "" in them, and were prepared to do something extraordinary in extraordinary circumThey have not proposed anyGothing more than a Liberal Government Indeed, I think that the Liberals, after all that has been said about equality of sacrifice, would have been ashamed to propose a wealth tax of only J per cent, for three years for repatriation purposes.  per cent, of the entire wealth of Aus",53

It has been the rule of my family to keep out of debt, and 1 thank my guardian angel that I have always been able to pay 20s. in the £ 1 , and to keep out of debt. our national finance were properly regulated, the country would be in the same position as I am; but we are so obsessed by the financial ideas of big, f at , bloated motor-hogs that no change can be effected. The present financial system is a sort of legerdemain. Wealth is turned over and over, and the individual who turns it over makes* money by doing so. The Commonwealth could take up the business of lending money. The establishment of a State Bank in South Australia was opposed by persons who told the farmers that their industry would be killed; but today the State Bank is saving the farmers. It is a good asset to South Australia, and its operations have had a beneficent effect. The National Bank, too, is a wonderful institution. It has given stability to the private banks, and honourable members propose to allow them to make'profits out of that stability. I wish the Government to take over the whole business of banking. If they did that they could finance the war. Let me, in connection with the war profits proposal, read an extract from an article which appeared in the financial columns of the Register on the 25th January lastTbe New South Wales banking averages for 1915 showed the greatest increase in the deposits on record-£9,401,000 , of which no less than £7,598,377 accrued to current accounts, and the deposits, advances, and cash held all broke previous records.  money borrowed by Mr Holman.",53
384,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Did he do all his borrowing in 1915? I am inclined to think that the borrowing of the Commonwealth had something to do with the position. As the Minister for Home Affairs pointed out on one occasion, if he borrowed £4,000 from a bank, that was shown as "" business out,"" and if he paid it back again, that was shown as "" business in , "" the whole transaction appearing as £8,000 worth of business, though not a copper was spent. To continue my quotationThe proportion of cash to deposits is also the greatest of which there is any record, and the hanks are maintaining a strong position. It is probable that the loans to general customers have not expanded during the year, but loans .to and investments with the Governments have certainly done so, and this is a time when the Governments need support, more particularly the Federal Government. Up to last year the cash holdings of the banks were never near the £20,000,000 level, and now they reach £23,130,608 in New South Wales alone. The If gold has dropped £3,172,350, but the Government notes held have increased £8,656,611, and the total cash is greater by £5,484,261. That is remarkable. But the increase in the current accounts is still more striking, and it serves to show that the public in these times are doubtful as to the outlets for their surplus funds. Por the first time on record the current accounts in 1915 exceeded one-half the total deposits. In 1890 the current accounts were only 29 per cent, of the deposits. In 1905 they reached 40 per cent., and now they aro 52i per cent. That means (says the Sydney Daily Telegraph) that a much larger proportion of the banks' resources are drawn from the current business of the country, and the expansion has gone on in the face of a rapid development of the Savings Bank operations. There are, therefore, other means of financing the war if the Government so desire. We are not making wealth pay. The Government are not doing what a good Labour Government, who believe in the platform they helped to make, ought to do. All they have done is to go in for fancy forms of taxation which will be passed on. The only one that will not be put on the back of the worker is the tax on wealth. No matter what tax is imposed, these fellows are too cute, and have too big a pull in the community, to bear it themselves. If the Government had grabbed the avenues of wealth, and manipulated them in the in terests of the nation, they would have been able to finance the war properly, in stead of being £85,000,000 in debt, as we shall be at the end of this year, for war purposes only, and the bill is not likely to stop there. We must go on until the job is finished, and no one can estimate what the actual cost of the war will be to Australia. One thing that can be said with certainty is that, if the Government remain as they are at present, and the same process is adopted, it will be borrowed for and put on to baby, and the man who now says he is prepared to give his last shilling will take the last shilling he can get out of the war, as he is doing at the present, time. He will do anything but come up to "" scratch,"" like every man has to do in his daily life, and meet his expenses as they occur. A great deal more could be said about the proposals to finance the war, because the whole thing reeks. The amusement tax will be paid by the general comniunity. The worker will have to pay a ^d. on his little three-penny picture show. Although, as pointed out by the Prime Minister, with a wage of £156 there is no margin for taxation, the little pleasure the citizen gets by going with his wife and kiddies to a picture show is to be taxed. The time is coming when the mother and kiddies will have to go to the picture show alone, father having gone to the front, ancl mother and kiddies will have to help to pay to keep father at the front. is how the money-hogs finance the war.",54
385,Mr BOYD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Do not call the Labour Government money-hogs.,55
386,Mr YATES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Some of them may be even that. I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister for Defence, through the Prime Minister, the case of Nurse Stacey, of South Australia. She gave every satisfaction while in Egypt, and assures me that all. the time she was in the hospitals there was not a word of complaint against her service or a mark against her character. She was returned from Egypt, and has a clean discharge from the military authorities. Every one of the questions could not be answered more satisfactorily than they were in her case. She made application to go to the front again, but her request was refused. At her request, I brought the matter before the Defence Department, who in formed me by letter that she could not go back on account of unsuitability. Colonel Fetherston, when I saw him on the matter, shook his head, and would not tell me the real reason. He was not inclined to define the unsuitability. There are rumours that some nurses have returned from the fron t who would not like people to know why they cannot go back; but this nurse has nothing of that sort against her. She courts and would welcome an investigation into her abilities as a nurse. I want the Minister to take a note of this case, and see that I am not put off by any allegation of unsuitability. alleged reason for which she was sent back has nothing to do with her skill or attention to duty or personal character. It is a matter of snobbishness on the part of those in charge. The iron heel of militarism extends even into our hospitals, and this is a case in point. This nurse has, apparently, happened to offend some one just a little above her. The position she is now in is that she cannot go back, and people can think what they like of her. There is another matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Committee. On 18th August last year, Senator de Largie asked for a return showing the militi a officers who had not volunteered for the front , but were holding paid positions. Among the names for South Australia was that of Major W . S. Hanson, aged 39 years 8 months. He was described as acting as D.A.Q.M.G. He is now holding the same position at the Keswick camp, and he That keenly feels his inclusion in that list, believing that it classes him as one of the cold-feet brigade. I have known M a j or Hanson in civil life, and I could not select a more energetic or capable man for any post. In the course of a letter he has written to me on another matter, he remarksI tried to get away with the Expeditionary Force, and was twice turned down by the Principal Medical Officer, Lieut - Colonel Shepherd, who happened to be my own medical officer, and who had fairly recently attended me for a somewhat serious stomach ulcer. When offered a troopship, which 1 regarded as a picnic, I refused. I wanted to do service at the front. ; If any man would do his duty to his country it is M a j or Hanson. I am satisfied that he has secured his rank by the outstanding ability that he possesses. There is also a matter to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs.
