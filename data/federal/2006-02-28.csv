2,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Can the minister confirm that Mr Trevor Flugge would have been eligible for an income tax exemption under the program under which he was employed?,17
3,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I can confirm is that people who receive payments must act in accordance with the law and, if they receive payments and they are entitled to a deduction, that is a matter for the tax commissioner to decide.",17

5,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Has the minister completed his answer? Mr Dutton-Yes. Economy,17
6,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of the results of today's balance of payments release? What does this data indicate about Australia's nomic outlook?,17
7,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question, and I can inform him that the balance of payment for the December quarter of 2005 was released today. The current account deficit widened slightly, by $0.8 billion, to be $14.45 billion. This mainly reflects a widening in the net income deficit, which increased by $0.7 billion, and this is being driven by high profits earned by foreign owned Australian based companies, particularly those in the mining sector. The trade deficit was largely unchanged. There was a welcome increase in exports of around 4.1 per cent, due largely to a strong rise in metal ores, and a 3.9 per cent rise in imports which offset that, driven by increases in capital goods import, particularly civil aircraft, which is a volatile series. The terms of trade rose 2.1 per cent and are now 13.3 per cent higher through the year, at their highest level since the March quarter of 1974. Australia's net foreign debt increased to $473 billion in the December quarter. Nearly all of that comprises private debt. The general government share of net foreign debt has fallen sharply since the coalition came to office. It is now 4.6 per cent, down from 17.2 per cent in March 1996. Australia's ability to service its net foreign debt has also improved. The debt servicing ratio fell to 9.1 per cent in the December quarter, well below the peak of 20 per cent in the September quarter of 1990. There are a number of reasons we can expect an improvement in the current account deficit in the near future. ABARE's latest crop report forecasts winter crop production upgraded to 40.6 million tonnes, and Australia's mining industry has invested around $31.6 billion in the expansion of productive capacity. With rural exports recovering, with ecothe very, very high terms of trade and particularly with the buoyancy of minerals exports, we would expect through the course of the year the trade deficit to narrow. Given those matters, Australia cannot afford to be complacent about its current account deficit. A lot of that represents borrowing, and whilst the business sector is borrowing to invest in new capacity-something that is good for the economy-it is important that the Australian government save, because it is the only sector that is saving at the moment and therefore adding to national savings or, conversely, detracting from the growth of debt. It is important in these circumstances that Australia maintain a strong fiscal positionthe fiscal position which the government has set out. NA",17

9,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister assure the parliament that his government responded competently to the concerns raised with the government by the United Nations in January and March 2000 concerning the AWB's contracts with the Saddam Hussein regime?,18
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I believe that the government did. The question, though, asked by the Leader of the Opposition is clearly something in relation to matters of fact on which Commissioner Cole will make a judgment. I therefore say, in relation to my own belief, is my belief that the government responded competently, but unusually in this situation we have an independent adjudication. I remind the Leader of the Opposition: I lead the only government in the world that has been prepared to establish an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission.",18
11,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am the only one. They do not like it, Mr Speaker, but it happens to be true. The earnest tones and grave of the opposition indicate they do not like it, but it has done. is true. I repeat: I believe that the government behaved competently. The commissioner has said he has the power to make a finding of fact in relation to the behaviour the Commonwealth; and, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, that includes ministers as well as departments. Let the blame fall where it may. Oil for Food Program",18
13,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the parliament on international reaction to the Cole inquiry? Are there any alternative views to those international responses?,18
14,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Barker for his interest. By raising this question he is, as usual, assiduously representing the interests of the good people of the electorate of Barker, which is adjacent to the electorate of Mayo. The Prime Minister set up the Cole inquiry in response to the request by the Secretary-General of the United Nations that national authorities take action against companies in their jurisdictions which have been named in a negative way in the Volcker report. To put that into some perspective: over 2,000 companies from 66 countries, including Australia, were named in the Volcker report. Leaving Australia aside, many of the it 65 other countries have taken no action whatsoever. Of those that have, most have simply referred the Volcker allegations to investigative authorities. There are two exceptions: one is India, which has had-I think is still having-a closed door inquiry; and South Africa has just established an inquiry, which has not yet got under way. As the Prime Minister has just said, no country has set up a transparent inquiry with the powers of what we call a royal commission in the way that the Australian government During his meeting with the Australian Deputy Prime Minister the day before yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, Dr of Chalabi, praised the Australian government's decision to establish the Cole inquiry. It was a clear appreciation by the Iraqi government of what Australia has been doing. By the way, Dr Chalabi made the point, as the Prime Minister of Iraq and others have made on occasions, that they are delighted with the contribution this government made to get rid of Saddam Hussein's regime, and they appreciate the ongoing work of the Australian Defence Force. Interestingly enough, the Wall Street Journal, which I would have thought is an extraordinarily credible newspaper and which is read all the way round the world, praised the Australian government recently for establishing the Cole inquiry. This is what the article said: But the good news is thatAustraliahas had the nerve to sort the wheat from the chaff-and do it publicly … … … Opposition members-Oh!",18
15,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are easy to amuse. It goes on: It's striking how Australia has been one of the few countries to have pushed the oil-for-food investigations to the extent of examining its role. I believe Commissioner Cole is doing a very thorough and a very good job, and we will have to wait and see what conclusions he draws. All sorts of evidence has been brought forward. That is interesting, but we want to find out when it has been tested what is right and what is wrong, and Commissioner Cole will do that. While others are praising the work of Cole and waiting for its report, the Leader of the Opposition has gone out and said that the government is corrupt. In recent days he has sunk to even newer lows. He has allowed shadow ministers to slur the reputation of one of the most honourable people ever to sit in this parliament-the member for Gwydir. He has gone on television attacking departmental officers because apparently, at some point, those departmental officers worked within the offices of ministers and shadow ministers. Yesterday he allowed the member for Wills-I heard it on AM this morning after I got back from Jakarta-to ridicule Trevor Flugge because he has a hearing defect. I thought this parliament had got over the fact that people with hearing defects should not be ridiculed. Mr Swan interjecting",19
16,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lilley will come to order.,19
17,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly not. I make the serious point that the Leader of the Opposition, when he was once before the Leader of the Opposition, used to trade on the basis that he may not be very competent and hard working but at least he is a decent bloke. He has abandoned all standards of decency through this debate. Oil for Food Program",19
18,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been savaged by a sheep. My question is to the own Prime Minister. I refer to the statement of the Prime Minister on 30 January 2006 when he said in relation to the AWB's dealings with Saddam Hussein's regime: ‘We had no suspicion, no suggestion there'd been any bribes paid. There were no alarm bells.' Why did the Prime Minister make that statement when his government received this cable dated 13 January 2000 which contained the following warnings from the UN office for the Iraq program: first, the Iraqis were demanding a surcharge of $US14 per metric tonne for wheat, which would be paid outside the oil for food program; second, the funds were to provided into a bank account in Jordan; third, the system was designed to provide illegal revenue for Iraq in US dollars; fourth, the UN believed the company involved in the scheme was owned by the son of Saddam Hussein; and, fifth, the AWB had concluded contracts of a similar nature to this with Iraqi regime?",19
19,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is the so-called ‘Canadian' cable. Mr Rudd-So-called? It's an Australian cable.,20
20,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the so-called Canadian cable. It is based upon complaints origicompetitors nally made by the Canadians. The Canadians, be it remembered by this parliament, are competitors against Australia for Iraq's wheat imports. Sometimes I think some of these characters, instead of being members with particular electorates, are the senior senator from Manitoba or Iowa rather than being concerned about the representations of the Australian wheat industry. Let me go to the substance of the allegations that were raised in this cable. I point out that on 13 January the reporting cable clearly shows that the United Nations mission-that is, the Australian Mission in the United Nations-referred the matter back to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for advice as soon as the Canadian initiated complaint had been raised with the United Nations. I am advised that DFAT contacted AWB Ltd, who categorically denied the allegations. Opposition members-Oh!",20
21,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is easy, six years after the event, to say, ‘Oh!' But I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that three years later his colleague the member for Griffith was saying to the Minister for Foreign Affairs: ‘Get out of the way and leave it all to AWB Ltd. AWB is a paragon of virtue and competence in which we invested our entire faith and our entire hope.' Let me resume the answer to the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition. I am advised that DFAT contacted AWB Ltd, who categorically denied the allegations. In the March of that same year, the United Nations query about Canadian allegations and on AWB contract terms was resolved to the United Nations' satisfaction. Mr Beazley interjecting",20
22,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A query is raised, so what do we do? Roll over because one of our says we are bad? We roll over, according to the Leader of the Opposition. That is not my idea of protecting the national interest. I repeat: in March the UN query about Canadian allegations and on the AWB contract terms was resolved to the UN's satisfaction after the provision by the AWB of its contract terms and conditions. And importantly-and I emphasise this-the United Nations Office of the Iraq Program, which had raised the complaint in the first place at the instance of the Canadians, indicated that this had removed any grounds for misperceptions. That was the response. In those circumstances, I rest on my claim that we responded correctly. Illegal Fishing",20
23,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on recent developments to prevent illegal fishing in Australia's northern waters?,20
24,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,20
25,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It takes someone from this side of the House to show any interest in this issue in question time. I think I am right in saying that in 10 years I have never been asked a question by the opposition on this issue. I do not think so. I will stand corrected if I am wrong, but I do not think I ever have been asked a question by the opposition on this subject. I thank the honourable member for his question. Illegal fishing has been increasing in Australia's northern waters. Action has been taken against some 607 foreign vessels in 2005, compared to 289 in 2004. Obviously, illegal fishing in Australian waters is damaging to Australia's fishing industry, as well as to our environmental policies and our marine environment, and it raises quarantine, immigration and security risks. Many of the vessels, but not all of them, are from Indonesia and we are working with the Indonesians to meet this common challenge. Yesterday, while I was in Jakarta with my colleague, friend and counterpart Hassan Wirajuda, we discussed the possibility of establishing joint naval patrols between Australia and Indonesia. I think that to establish joint naval patrols-not just our own navy patrolling the area, but doing it jointly with the Indonesians-would be a very effective deterrent to illegal fishing. It would send a very strong message not just about Australia confronting Indonesia over this issue. I think it is a good way of doing it, making sure there is a shared commitment to addressing the problem. I know that the Minister for Defence is working on ways that we can implement this policy and will be working with his Indonesian counterpart as well. This is on top of us launching a campaign in fishing communities in Indonesia to ensure that Indonesians understand that transgressing Australian waters is illegal and, importantly, brings with it penalties. We are introducing, which I think is a very important thing to do, a joint study of illegal ing in South-East Asia-in particular, because we have concern about the catching of sharks for shark fin being a real incentive for illegal fishing-to ensure that we all understand much better than, frankly, we do at the moment the regional shark business so that we can take measures to counter what is going on on illegal vessels. I think the government is devoting a lot of resources to this issue. We need to work closely with the Indonesians. I was yesterday very impressed by the very constructive approach that my friends and colleagues in Indonesia took to this issue, recognising that it was a shared responsibility and that the best way of dealing with it is by working together. NA",20
26,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform members of the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon.

27,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his statement of 30 January 2006, when he said in relation to the AWB's dealings with Saddam Hussein's regime, ‘We had no suspicion, no suggestion there'd been any bribes,' and that there were ‘no alarm bells'. How could the Prime Minister have made that statement when he was in possession of the cable from his embassy to the United Nations in New York which warned that Saddam Hussein's regime were directly approaching wheat suppliers to inflate contract prices of wheat, that the AWB had concluded such contracts with the Iraqi fishregime and that another national wheat supplier had specifically rejected these approaches, having been advised by the United Nations that accepting any such arrangement would be in breach of United Nations sanctions? How could the Prime Minister credibly claim that there were no warning bells?",21
28,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I refer the honourable gentleman to the last answer I gave. Trade,21
29,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House the results of the March quarter Australian commodities release? How important is experienced and consistent management?,21
30,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I can inform him and the House that ABARE today released their Australian commodities publication and, according to ABARE, earnings from Australia's commodity exports are forecast to increase 25 per cent to around $125 billion in 2005-06, export earnings from mineral and energy resources are forecast to rise 36 per cent to $93 billion and the value of farm exports is forecast to be $28 billion in 2005-06. As I said earlier, Australia now has the strongest terms of trade that it has had since 1974. In those circumstances it is important that we bear in mind that a terms of trade boom will not last forever, that we cannot take permanent decisions on the back of temporary movements in terms of trade and that at periods like this, as has been found in Australian history, it is important to have experienced and consistent economic management. It is not just the government that believes experienced management is necessary. This is also a view which is shared by the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition was asked on ABC Radio on 3 March 2005 about this and he said: I've been around for a very long time, longer Simon Crean and longer than anyone else, and I don't feel like being pensioned off, thanks. preciate having a bit of experience around balancHotham-he ing the youth. We would agree that having the experience of the member for Hotham around is something that certainly adds to the opposition. But at the very time when the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges the importance of experience, he has the member for Hotham lined up in Victoria, he has the member for Corio lined up in Victoria and he has the member for Maribyrnong, who today has announced that he has withdrawn from preselection in the seat of Maribyrnong. He has withdrawn because, as he said: A series of sleazy deals means that even with very strong local support, it is now almost impossible for me to win preselection ... ‘A series of sleazy deals'! The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, promised that if he was elected he would ‘ease the squeeze'. This Leader of the Opposition does not want to ease the squeeze; he wants to ease the sleaze. Worse than that, he wants to grease the sleaze-grease the sleaze in Maribyrnong, grease the sleaze in Corio, grease the sleaze in Hotham. He stands back as if this has nothing to do with him even though he was telling ABC Radio that he wanted experience. How is it that he wanted experience back in 2005 but he does not now want experience? The answer came down on 6PR recently. Listen to this. This is what 6PR reported recently: Opposition leader Kim Beazley's made an extraordinary admission regarding Labor's fitness to govern. He ... says he seriously doubted whether the Opposition front-bench was up to the job when he returned to the leadership 12 months ago. ButMr Beazley says he's since changed his mind and now believes his Shadow Ministers are capable of running the country. than Shadow minister the member for Corio, shadow minister the member for MaribyrI apnong, shadow minister the member for is standing by whilst he lets the sleaze of the Victorian Labor Party run them out of their seats. These are the people he believes are up to running the country! Mr Speaker, how could he have come to that view? Listen to this. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said:",22

You would be standing by the member for Maribyrnong, you would be standing by the member for Corio, you would be standing by the member for Hotham-and the reason you don't is you are beholden to the sleaze of the Victorian Labor Party and the war lords who direct you.",23

38,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his statement of 30 January 2006 when he said in relation to the AWB's dealings with Iraq: We had no suspicion, no suggestion there'd been any bribes paid ... there were no alarm bells. I refer the Prime Minister to yet another cable, this one of 13 January 2000, in which the UN requested the Howard government to make ‘high-level inquiries' to ensure that the AWB was not breaching the sanctions regime. I refer to the government's reply five days later on 18 January 2000, in which DFAT stated, ‘We think it is unlikely that AWB would be involved knowingly in any form of payment in breach of the sanctions regime.' Prime Minister, given your earlier statement today that the UN was satisfied with your assurances, what high-level inquiries did the government make between the 13 January cable and the 18 January reply to satisfy yourself that the AWB was not rorting UN sanctions?",23
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What the member for Griffith has done is to selectively grab a couple of cables and put his own interpretation on them. The reality is that if you look at the totality of these cables they support in every respect the answer that I gave to the Leader of the Opposition. NA,23
40,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a delegation from the Philippines who are visiting Australia under the auspices of the Australian Political Exchange Council. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to the members. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Aviation",23
41,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House of measures the government has taken to improve Australia's international air services? Are there any alternative policies?,23
42,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question and recognise her particular advocacy for regional aviation. In fact, she is probably the only person in this House to have an aircraft named in her honour, and it is a thoroughly deserved recognition. The Australian government is committed to growing and expanding international aviation. We have worked very hard to improve the services in and out of Australia, and that has achieved real dividends. We have had record numbers of passengers in and out and a record number of seats available to and from Australia, and that has been achieved against the background of events like SARS and September 11, which certainly sent shock waves through international travel. The government will be continuing to pursue these objectives in reaffirming and expanding our policy in relation to international aviation. We have declared our recognition of the importance of open skies as an aspirational goal, the need to negotiate air services ahead of demand and the importance of maintaining our access to key aviation hubs around the world. We have also, though, recognised the important contribution that an Australian based aviation industry makes to the economy. It is a balanced policy that looks to achieve the very best for our country. In relation to the US-Australia routeabout which there has been a lot of controversy over recent times-it is important to note that there is already significant competithe tion potentially available on that route, with scores of airlines having the right to operate it if they choose. Many have tried and failed, but there is still significant competition available on that route. The interest of two Australian airlines, Virgin Blue and Jetstar, in entering the route opens up the potential for real competition with a different type of product than that which might have been available under some of the other options that were under consideration. The honourable member asked whether there were any alternative policies. In spite of the fact that there has been debate going on for years about the trans-Pacific route, opposition put out a statement just two weeks before the government announced its policy in relation to this issue. Their policy is, ‘Federal Labor is open-minded on air route liberalisation.' They had no policy; a complete vacuum. The Leader of the Opposition is now talking about his big target policy and how he is going to lead in these sorts of issues, but when it comes to aviation, they are ‘open-minded'; they have not made up their mind. What about when it comes to keeping jobs in heavy maintenance work in Australia? The opposition gives lip-service to wanting Qantas to maintain its heavy maintenance activities in Australia but as we speak the very workers whose jobs are at risk are on strike. They are invading the Melbourne domestic terminal and demonstrating to their employer that they cannot be relied upon to do the job when it matters. If we want to maintain these jobs in Australia, and this government certainly doeswe want these skills to be developed and maintained in Australia-then the workforce also has a role to play. Going out on strike in the very weeks when Qantas are making key decisions is sending a very wrong message to Qantas board. I call upon the workers to play their role in negotiating appropriate arrangements which would allow these thousands of jobs, critical jobs for Australia, to remain in this country. Oil for Food Program",23
43,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the minister's statement to parliament that the United Nations had only raised with the government ‘a general concern about contracts of the Australian Wheat Board' and, further, ‘When the opposition talks about warning bells, it picks out obscure documents.' Why did the minister make these statements when the the government had received this cable, dated 13 January 2002, which was sent to the minister's office and contained the following warnings from the United Nations Office of the Iraq Program: first, that the Iraqis were demanding a surcharge of $US14 per metric tonne for wheat which would be paid outside the oil for food program; second, that the funds were to be provided into a bank account in Jordan; third, that the system was designed to provide illegal revenue for Iraq in US dollars; fourth, that the UN believed that the company involved in the scheme was owned by the son of Saddam Hussein; and fifth, that the AWB had concluded contracts of a similar nature to this with the Iraqi regime? Minister, how could you regard this cable as an obscure document containing only general warnings?",24
44,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for Griffith for the question because this is the first time. I have been asked a question on this issue this year. I very much appreciate the opportunity to say something about it. The honourable member raises the question of the cable of 13 January and selectively quotes from it. I note that cable reports allegations that had been made not by the United Nations but-as we subsequently discovered, but which we did not know at that time-by the Canadian Wheat Board, who were of course competitors of the Australian Wheat Board. The second observation I would make is that, if you read the whole cable-and the reason the opposition has these cables is that they were tabled in the Cole inquiry todayyou will see that the last paragraph says: ‘The Office of the Iraq Program,' the OIP, ‘noted it had no wayMr Rudd interjecting",25
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Griffith is warned!,25
46,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"of judging the accuracy or otherwise of the claims the Iraqi Grains Board is alleged to have made about AWB,' and so it goes on. There was not a suggestion from the United Nations office of Iraqi programs that this allegation was accurate, just that the allegation had been made. Subsequently, this allegation was checked out on several occasions. First of all it was checked out, and that is of course referred to in one of the other cables tabled today, but subsequently the United Nations office of Iraqi programs asked for specific documentation from the Australian Wheat Board, through the Australian government-documentation which got to the heart of contracts that the allegations suggested might have been rorted. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, if I may say so, with some difficulty obtained these additional contracts that had not previously been provided to the United Nations which the United Nations wanted in order to establish the veracity of these claims that had been made by the Canadians. These contracts were finally obtained by the department from AWB Ltd and given to the this United Nations, who studied the contracts and concluded that these allegations that had been made against AWB Ltd, as referred to in these cables which were tabled in the Cole commission today, were unfounded. Health Insurance",25
47,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House how private health insurance is delivering good value to about nine million Australians? What is the government doing to support the private health insurance rebate, and are there any alternative policies?",25
48,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and I point out to her that support for private health insurance has been one of the signature policies of the Howard government. Thanks to measures such as the private health insurance rebate, almost nine million Australians enjoy the added security and choice that private cover brings, including one million earning less than $20,000 a year. No-one likes price rises, but I point out that the annual average private health insurance price rise has been 5½ per cent since 1996. It was 11 per cent a year during the term of the former Labor government. Without the rebate, which the Labor Party wants to abolish, the average Australian family would be paying nearly $1,000 a year more for their private health insurance. The Leader of the Opposition described the private health insurance rebate as a boondoggle in one of his less verbose moments. We had the member for Lalor cook up Medicare Gold as a secret deal to destroy the rebate. Labor's old guard hate the rebate, and so do the union hacks who are now seeking to take their places. We have the AWU and Mr Bill Shorten, the future member for Maribyrnong and the self-styled next Labor Prime Minister, the self-styled Messiah of the Labor Party. He says the rebate is a ‘subsidy to the rich'. We have the NUW's Martin Pakula. If the ACTU website is any guide, he thinks the rebate ‘drains resources from public hospitals and undermines bulk-billing'.  Cambodian-speaking people, who are just two per cent of the electorate of Hotham but 30 per cent of the Labor preselectors of Hotham. What about the 42 per cent of the electors of Hotham who have private health insurance? I read in the Australian last day that he still has the Greek branches but he has lost the Spanish branches, the Vietnamese branches as well as the Cambodian branches. I could not help but think, ‘Are there any Australians left in the so-called Australian Labor Party today?'",25

Mr Albanese-On a point of order, Mr Speaker, the minister should withdraw that extraordinarily outrageous slur on every Australian who does not have an Anglo-Celtic name in this country.

55,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just want to point out that to his great credit, the embattled current member for Hotham does support private health insurance.",27
56,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,27
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has only just started to continue his answer. I will call the minister and listen carefully to what he has to say.,27
58,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was saying that, to his great credit, the current member for Hotham does support private health insurance. When he was the leader, he said: ‘I accept that families have factored into their budgets the cost of private health insurance and I am not going to disadvantage them.' Well, good on the member for Hotham. In fact, it is precisely because of these sorts of attitudes towards private health insurance that I am sure his friend the member for Batman said: Simon Crean is the most honest and sincere leader of any political party in the last 50 years. I beg to differ. There have been more honest and more sincere leaders of some political parties in the last 50 years. After listening to what the Leader of the Opposition has said today, I certainly think the member for Hotham is the best leader Labor has had in the last five years. Oil for Food Program",27
59,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to his statement to parliament that the United Nations had only raised with the government a general concern about contracts of the Australian Wheat Board and that, when the opposition talks about the warning bells, it picks out obscure documents. Minister, I refer to another obscure document, a third cable of 11 March 2000, containing a further warning to the government concerning the AWB's activities in Iraq and one which is explicitly copied to the secretary to the minister's department. Will the minister confirm to the parliament that this further warning from the United Nations stated that the representative of the office of the Iraq program ‘had received an insufficient response to enable her to close the matter and that it was imperative that this matter be put to rest'? What action did the minister himself take to ensure that these sets of warnings conveyed by the United Nations had been comprehensively addressed?",27
60,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, I thank the honourable member for his questions-two in a row on this topic-and I appreciate that enormously. Yes, this is another one of the cables that have been tabled today in the Cole commission. The 11 March cable, which is from Austrade back to Canberra, is about the same issue. It is not a separate issue; it is the same allegation made by, as it turned out-I said earlier the Canadian Wheat Associates; that was a mistake-the Canadian Wheat Board. It is the same issue. I made this point earlier: in order to round off their investigation, the United Nations wanted access to contracts that they had not had access to in the past. Why AWB Ltd had not passed them those contracts, I do not know. That is the sort of thing that will be considered by the Cole inquiry, as indeed will all of this. But what I do know is that, through this period, the department was quite assiduous in making sure that it furnished the United Nations-which was responsible for the administration of the oil for food program-investigators with the material they asked for. I made the point earlier, by the way, and it is quite an important point, that AWB Ltd was a little reluctant initially to provide the department with these documents to pass on to the UN.",27
61,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,28
62,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members may laugh. They may think: ‘We all know why now.' We certainly did not know then. Subsequent to this cable of 11 March, that information was obtained-you can see in the reporting of this cable; it tells the story quite clearly-and it was given to the United Nations. The United Nations read those contracts and said that, as a result of that, the matter was closed. Whilst at the time of the conversation in Washington, reported in the 11 March cable, the matter had not been closed according to the United Nations, when DFAT subsequently obtained the information they wanted, the United Nations closed the matter. I would have thought that the allegation that departmental officers of DFAT, me-the minister-the Minister for Trade and the Prime Minister had all been negligent was the exact reverse to what these cables showed, that people were assiduous in following up inquiries, obtaining information and ensuring that these matters were investigated to the fullest extent possible. Of course, if the opposition had had its way, it would have left the oil for food program in place indefinitely, along with its friend Saddam Hussein. Education: Queensland",28
63,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister advise the House of the government's education initiatives to ease the shortage of doctors in Queensland? Are there any alternative views?",28
64,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and acknowledge his concern about this issue. Members of the House will recall that the Prime Minister announced we had a plan to lift the cap on full fee paying medical places from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. Ms Macklin interjecting,28

67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned!,28
68,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday we learned that a struggle has broken out between the member for Jagajaga-who opposes this plan to increase the number of medical places for up to 400 students each year-and the member for Lalor, who thinks that she spoke out of turn and was out of line. That is a fight I would like to see televised. Today we learned that other members of the Labor front-bench also believe that the member for Jagajaga is way out of line. We have the member for Hunter, the member for Barton, the member for Batman",28
69,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members interjecting Mr Neville- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question is fair. We cannot hear the answer to the question at all.",28
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hinkler has raised a valid point of order. All members will respect that the minister should be heard and others should be able to hear the minister.,28
71,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was pointing out that a number of those on the Labor front-bench believe that the member for Jagajaga is way out of touch. We have the member for Batman, the member for Wills, the member for Hunter and the member for Barton. The very wise and very experienced member for Hotham also supports this plan. How many other members of the Labor frontbenchyou are smiling-or the backbench would rather support a plan that was embraced by all state Labor premiers: Mike Rann, Paul Lennon, Steve Bracks, Morris Iemma, Clare Martin and Jon Stanhope? They all support this plan. But, once again, federal Labor have taken the soft political option and they are bailing out the member for Jagajaga. Member for Brand, this is not about saving the member for Jagajaga; it is about building a sustainable health workforce. Yesterday, I tabled the instrument that would enable us to increase the number of medical places in Australian universities. The clock is still ticking. Oil for Food Program",28
72,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Ministhis ter, given that these cables of 13 and 18 January 2000 were sent to your office, were you personally briefed on them?",29
73,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not sure that the last cable was sent to my office; it actually went to Dr Calvert, the secretary of the department. The others would have been sent to my office and of course I would have read them. I have explained already that I was perfectly satisfied with the response of the department to these inquiries. Mr Rudd interjecting",29
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Griffith has already been warned!,29
75,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point I make about the opposition is this: what we have been able to expose through your questioning today is that we have a completely clear explanation for all of this material. The material has come forward as a result of the Cole inquiry, which we established in order to get the heart of the matter. And, what is more, it had not been for the efforts by the governsleazy ment to not only cooperate with Volcker and establish the Cole inquiry but also contribute Party. to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein then the oil for food program would simply be continuing. Cables that are repeated to my office are repeated to my office. Although about 130,000 cables come to my office a year, they are certainly drawn to my attention, particularly ones which have particular significance. Political Donations",29
76,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on political donations made by registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act? How has this influenced the democratic process?,29
77,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question and his interest in subject. Yesterday in this place the Leader of the Opposition said that the Labor Party had ‘received the odd contribution from the trade union movement'. Of course, since 1996 that ‘odd contribution' has added up to almost $50 million. Indeed, in Victoria that ‘odd contribution' from the unions has amounted to some $11.6 million.

81,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"of these three sitting frontbenchers who are being challenged for preselection by three more union officials. The reality is that the power basis of these to three challengers is entirely predicated upon if branch stacking, union links, slush funds and deals between them, which freeze out ordinary members of the Australian Labor We had confirmation of this this morning when the member for Maribyrnong said on radio 3AW in Melbourne that it was almost impossible for him to win preselection, thanks to a series of what he calls ‘sleazy internal deals'-confirmation from the member for Maribyrnong. We have had luminaries of the Labor Party speak out about this: people like John Cain, a former Premier of Victoria; Barry Jones, a former minister in a Labor government and a former president of the ALP; and, of course, John Button, a very distinguished former senator for the ALP. Mr Button said this recently: ... Simon Crean when he was leader took the step of trying to implement a very small number of the recommendations which were advocated by Bob Hawke and Neville Wran in their proposals to reform and make more democratic the Labor Party in Australia. He took that step. But John Button went on to say: Now, that doesn't suit certain people because they're not interested in democratic parties. They're more interested in manipulating positions of power and branch stacking and things like that, which produce that power. We saw this in a report in the Weekend Australian newspaper on 26 November last year, which reported on the fact that Bill Shorten and Martin Pakula had met ‘in a secret location in northern Melbourne'. The report went on to say: A swag of state seats as well as seven federal lower house seats and two positions on the Senate ticket were bought and sold that day.

85,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker; the question was about donations to registered organisations and their influence on the democratic process. What we see here is something that I would say the vast majority of Australians would find appalling, disgusting and unacceptable, and that is that the preselections of members of this place are bought and sold in a sleazy, secret deal by members of the trade union movement. That is the reality. And who stood by and has done absolutely nothing? Who was so weak that he would not lift his finger in relation to this? None other than the Leader of the Opposition, so weak that he stands by and allows this undemocratic process to continue. Of course, the other party to this",30

Now that he has conceded for the first time in this place that he was briefed on the cable dated 13 January 2000-saw it, was briefed; whatever-does he recollect that the cable contained the following warnings from the UN office: firstly, that the Iraqis were demanding a surcharge of $US14 per metric tonne for wheat, which would be paid outside the oil for food program? Does he recollect, secondly, that the funds were to be provided into a bank account in Jordan? Does he recollect, thirdlyMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under the standing orders, a question already answered fully is not permitted to be answered again. This question has already been answered on a number of occasions, and it is quite out of order.",31
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. The Leader of the Opposition has not completed his question. I am listening carefully. I call the Leader of the Opposition.,31
99,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does he recollect, thirdly, that the cable said the system was designed to provide illegal revenue for Iraq in US dollars? Does he recollect, fourthly, that the cable said the United Nations believed the company involved in the scheme was owned by the son of Saddam Hussein? Does he recollect, fifthly, that AWB had concluded contracts of a similar nature to this with the Iraqi regime? Minister, how could you have satisfied yourself that this matter was properly looked at by a few phone calls to AWB and will you now go to the Cole inquiry and discuss the content of this cable and the other matters contained in this appalling scandal?",31
100,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously, this happened six years ago, but I have had the opportunity during the last few weeks to examine all of this material again very carefully, which is why I know so much about it today, 28 February 2006. These are cables from early 2000, but I do know a lot about them and I have examined this material very carefully. I have done more than that: I have had to satisfy myself that my department responded appropriately to these allegations. I have done that myself. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition reads out the parts of the cable that suit him, but he does not read out the part of that cable where the UN Office of the Iraq Program noted it had no way of judging the accuracy or otherwise of the claims made. More than that, of course, we knew as time went on that these claims had been made by competitors of the Australian Wheat Board. What the department subsequently did, which is clear from not only these cables but subsequent material which has not yet been tabled in the Cole inquiry but if the Leader of the Opposition would care to listen he may be interested to know something about, was not just ring AWB Ltd, ask them a few questions and give up on that. It went back to the UN. The UN asked for very specific information. That information is referred to in one of these cables-the Austrade cable from March. It asked for very specific material and, I think quite rightly, the department lowed up those claims to obtain that specific material. As I have said already in answer to questions, AWB Ltd were somewhat reluctant, if I may say so, to provide that material, but they did provide it. That material was then given to the UN investigators. They employed the experts to look at these contracts and they gave AWB Ltd a clean bill of health. So you have to look at the totality of the documentation and the totality of the story. The point is that I have done that. I have had a look at what has been done. I personally have been satisfied; I think the Minister for Trade, who obviously is involved as well, has been satisfied. What is more, just in case there is any doubt, the Labor Party will make their party political points, but this is all material which has gone to the Cole inquiry-all of it. Mr Cole can make his own decisions and his own assessments. He is probably not driven by the desperation of party politics like the Leader of the Opposition. I suspect Mr Cole may be driven by his record as an objective and excellent judge who is now retired but is a man of great distinction. He will make the decisions about whom he wants to talk to, when to talk to them and how to handle the inquiry. I can only say: thank God the Leader of the Opposition is not trying to conduct an inquiry. Trade: Exports",32
101,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister inform the House of the latest export forecasts for Australia's resources sector?",32
102,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and acknowledge his ongoing work in ensuring that the resources sector is promoted in Australia for the work that it does. 2006-07 will folbe another record year for exports in the resources sector, with ABARE today releasing figures which show that exports will reach an unprecedented $101 billion for minerals and energy. Iron ore exports will rise some 26 per cent to $18 billion and be almost double that which they were in 2004-05. LNG exports are expected to rise 22 per cent to $6 billion, again virtually doubling since 2004-05. Uranium exports are predicted to grow some eight per cent to be worth around $800 million. All this is very encouraging and this government continues to strive for improvement. The surge in global demand for uranium presents a real opportunity for Australia to build on its export performance. We have some 41 per cent of the world's uranium here in Australia and, with prices at a 20-year high and rising, there is an opportunity begging for Australia to do more and see these opportunities fulfilled, provided, of course, the rigorous environment, Indigenous, safety and non-proliferation safeguards are adhered to. The member for Kalgoorlie and, I am sure, the member for Solomon would also reflect on this when they ask about threats to the uranium industry. I need look no further than the policy shambles of those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition says that there is a three-mines uranium policy which still stands even though there are four uranium mines in Australia. The Deputy Premier of South Australia says the policy is ‘idiotic' and should be scrapped, and I would agree with that. The member for Batman, of course, says the policy does not even exist. It is a joke, quite frankly, and it is costing Australia. Even as recently as last weekend we saw Eley Griffiths portfolio manager Brian Eley state that the Australian uranium industry is at the mercy of the Labor Party. He said: It's not like nuclear power is newand the Leader of the Opposition should listen to this18 per cent of the world's electricity but mining law is state based and it's very much a Labor Party debate. The opposition leader should also note that his colleagues in Western Australia are now agitating for a debate. I urge him to get on with it and produce a coherent uraniummining policy for the good of jobs, investment and exports in Australia. Oil for Food Program",32
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his statement on national television on Sunday, 12 February that the Cole inquiry had ‘all of the documents'. When did the government provide copies of these four cables to the Cole inquiry? Mr Downer interjecting",33
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When was it, Alexander? I will find out exactly when. I will take this question and go through it. When the Cole inquiry was established it sent a group of people to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. My understanding is that they were invited to look at everything. It was made an open book and large numbers of documents were made available. I understand that two very large cartons full of documents were copied and taken away by the Cole investigation. Whether the four cables were in it or not, I cannot tell you. I can find out and give the Leader of the Opposition the exact date, but the reality is that at every point this government has cooperated with the Cole inquiry. We established the Cole inquiry. When there were concerns expressed by the Volcker inquiry at the beginning of last year about AWB and its lack of cooperation, as I have indicated publicly before, I gave very clear instructions to the bureaucracy. I asked the Minister for Trade to write a letter in the strongest possible terms to AWB telling it to cooperate with the Volis nuclear, cker inquiry. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that in all circumstances the government have cooperated with the established Cole inquiry. We have provided information to Cole and we have responded to requests for information from Cole. If in fact Cole wants anybody in the government to appear before the inquiry, those people so requested will appear before the inquiry. We are now into the fourth week of questions being asked entirely about this issue, and the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith have not provided one iota of evidence. After all of this effort, they have forsaken time for questions on Medicare, industrial relations and tax. They have decided to ask question after question on this issue. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I am like the Minister for Foreign Affairs; I like getting questions on this issue. He was jumping out of his skin today to get some questions on this issue because we as a government do not have anything to hide-so much so that we are happy to take these questions. We established the Cole inquiry, and it will go on and reach its own conclusions and then the Australian public will have the benefit of analysing those conclusions. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: produce the evidence of the government deceit. It is worth reminding him that the original charge was that we were covering something up. They have moved away from that charge and have started to make allegations of deceit. They started to defame, under parliamentary privilege, the reputation of hard working public servants. The Leader of the Opposition attacked the integrity of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Party, but not in an open question because he is not game to do it. He does not get up in question time and say that he is really to blame. He says it across the table. That is a measure of two things: the lack of evidence to support the opposition's claim and a lack of straightforwardness on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. This government has been totally transparent on this issue, and this government is very happy to go on taking questions for as long as you like. NA NA Censure Motion",33
105,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,I seek leave to move: That this House censures the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister for: (1) turning a blind eye to stark warnings that AWB was doing illicit business with Saddam Hussein behind the United Nations' back; (2) ignoring cables that told the Government in no uncertain terms that this was going on; and (3) treating this Parliament and the Australian people with contempt by refusing to come clean in this place about the Government's role in this Wheat for Weapons scandal. Leave not granted.,34
106,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"You just said you wanted to. I move: That so much of sessional and standing orders be suspended to permit me to move the following censure motion: That this House censures the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister for: (1) turning a blind eye to stark warnings that the AWB was doing illicit business with Saddam Hussein behind the United Nations' back; (2) ignoring cables that told the Government in no uncertain terms that this was going on; and (3) treating this Parliament and the Australian people with contempt by refusing to come clean in this place about the Government's role in the Wheat for Weapons scandal. This is the fourth time that a censure motion has been refused by the government on this matter-this the worse scandal that has confronted a national political government in my lifetime in parliament and, I would suspect, the lifetime of everybody here in this place. This is a Prime Minister who was fulminating about two minutes ago on how open and accountable he had been and how much he enjoyed these opportunities in parliament, yet he has permitted his Leader of the House on four separate occasions now to deny a censure motion in this place. I call that cowardly running away. The cables I am speaking about today, which is why we ought to have the censure motion, stand guilty on the forehead of the Prime Minister and his ministers-guilty of turning a blind eye. We got very close to that in the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I will get that. The government think it is business as usual to do business with Saddam Hussein behind the UN's back. Now their pathetic defence of stupidity and ignorance is in tatters. Negligence: case proved. Recklessness: case proved. Turning a blind eye: case proved. The time for squirming and slithering is over. They have to come clean, front the Cole commission and explain themselves. They have ruined the trade for our wheat farmers and now they are trying to use the wheat farmers as a political human shield. What sort of government is this Prime Minister running? Wages for our troops, millions for their mates, turn a blind eye to warnings. This is not just turning a blind Bronte Moules has poked them in the eye. She said: ‘This is crook. Do something about it. This is serious.' She said, ‘The Canadians alleged AWB were complicit; check it properly.' If you turn a blind eye from such a stark warning, you are complicit in corruption. It is seriously corrupt and heads should roll. This is the putrid underbelly of John Howard's government: forgetful people get $1 million tax-free jobs and the warnings of senior bureaucrats are studiously ignored. They would not listen because they were more interested in protecting their mates than they were in protecting the farmers. That is this government.",34
107,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,Order! I ask the leader to link his remarks back to the motion before the chair.,35
108,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"The reason we have to have a censure motion on this today is that there is much new information tabled here. The Prime Minister had to say today that the opposition had introduced no facts in this place. In question time after question time, we have introduced documents. We have used documents which have become public. to We have used reports from witnesses at the various points of time when warning signals were sent to this government about what was going on with the oil for food program. We have used occasional testimony from individuals who have been involved. We have used materials from the Cole royal commission which, while focused on AWB, have nevertheless had ramifications for this government. There is only one place in Australia where this government is being held accountable, which is why we have to have this censure motion. There is only one place in Australia, and that is here on the floor of the House of Representatives. Yet, apart from day one, not one censure motion has been permitted. You eye. have the Prime Minister there, with one of those leering grins on his face, telling us all how much he enjoys being questioned on this matter. He enjoys it not one whit because he is totally culpable in this and he knows it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs here at the table is totally culpable as well, and we will get on to the minister here and why the censure motion should be moved in a minute. The simple fact of the matter is that every element of the case against this government has been proved to the satisfaction of any reasonable person out there. The public of Australia does not believe you, Minister. The public of Australia has made a very clear-cut statement about whether they thought this government knew everything. The public of Australia has wisely and overwhelmingly come to the conclusion that it did know, and it was reasonable for them to do so. There is another reason this censure motion ought to be moved today, and that is this admission for the first time today by the eign minister that he was aware of the content of these cables back in the year 2000, early when these cables were produced. I would suggest to people that they take advantage of what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said when he said we should read the whole cable. They ought to read the whole cable. For that to arrive on the desk of a eign minister in most places, if a foreign minister was not shiftless, lazy and turning a blind eye, would have set alarm bells ringing that would not have been satisfied with a couple of phone calls between the members of his office or the members of his department and the AWB. This is not a minor thing. You have to remember what the corruption of the oil for food program meant at the time, why there was such a tight, tough administration of it and why it was supported so very reluctantly by the United States and the United Kingdom. They and many other countries around the place were trying to disarm Saddam Hussein of what they believed at the time was his development of weapons of mass destruction. They were trying to prevent Saddam Hussein developing a military capability whereby he could threaten his neighbours. They were frightened that, if Saddam Hussein was able to trade unfettered in the area of oil, he would use the resources that were obtained by him to rebuild his military, massively oppress his people and use weapons of mass destruction on his own population or on his neighbours. We all know now that there were many false assumptions about that. But there were not any false assumptions that he was supporting terrorists in Israel and in the areas controlled by the Palestinians. We know that for a fact. We know at least he had a research program associated with weapons of mass destruction, though not deployable weapons, which was what he was accused of at the for- time. He certainly had a research program and we know he was rebuilding his military and rebuilding his air defences and testing those air defences on the US and UK planes that were flying over the no-fly zones at the time. There was all of that-which is why this was the ultimate, sensitive program. This was not some piece of detritus out there that forwould occasionally attract the attention of a foreign minister. This was front and centre involved in our relationship with the United States, in our relationship with the United Nations and in our supervision of effective international governance of a person with whom we had previously been to war on behalf of Kuwait and on behalf of the United Nations. This is not a matter of small moment. Today the foreign minister told us this: ‘I saw the cable which suggested that another outfit performing exactly the same sorts of tasks and seeking the same opportunities as the Australian Wheat Board had been informed of the price of what it was that they had to do. The price of what it was that they had to do was to provide a de facto subsidy that could be realised in US dollars to Saddam Hussein-to an account in Jordan owned by one of the sons of Saddam Hussein. Amurderous pair those late sons of Saddam Hussein-a murderous and wretched pair if ever there were one, and known to be wretched at the time. What the Australian government did when they received this cable was go into closeting mode as quickly as possible-covering and closeting, covering up. They went straight into cover-up mode: ‘Let us ask a few questions of AWB. Are you chaps doing anything untoward? You chaps had better start supplying a copy of this contract in a way that will convince the United Nations that there's nothing untoward here, because you chaps are in a spot of trouble.' This was not an investigation; it was a tip-off. What you ran was not an investigation, Minister; you ran a tip-off on the AWB. That is what you didyou told them to regularise their affairs so they could get it through the United Nations. That is what you told them to do, and that is what these cables very, very clearly show. You had the warning; you then provided not an investigation but a tip-off. It is an appalling chapter in the history this government. I think it is so totally appropriate that, in this week of the 10th versary of the Howard government, we have this to symbolise their laziness, their ness, their conniving, their total wretchedness which has represented this government and is why they ought to be censured.

109,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"Before I call for a seconder, I remind the Leader of the Opposition he should address his remarks through the chair. Is the motion seconded? Mr Rudd-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",37
110,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"The government does not believe that this motion is worth supporting and that a censure is due. We hold that view for a number of reasons. First of all, when I was first a member of parliament I was in opposition and it seemed to me that the important thing was to attack the government as furiously as you could-and try to make the anger not too confected, by the way. You had to try to create a sense of sincerity and, unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition fails on that test. Secondly, one of the things that oppositions should be careful of is trying to censure governments every single day of the week, because if you overuse the censure vehicleOpposition member interjecting",37
111,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"‘Try to censure,' I said-not that you would succeed. If we were so wretched as the Leader of the Opposition says, the public presumably would hold that view and we would not have won any elections. Or maybe we are wretchedbut not as wretched as the Labor Party, which have lost the last four elections. A censure overused is a censure discredited, a vehicle that does not become in the end credible for parliamentary practice. This atof tempt to censure is completely hypocritical, because the Labor Party's contention is that anni- somehow the government is involved in a cover-up. That is their contention, and the sleaziManager of Opposition BusinessMs Gillard-True. It is true.",37
112,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"says it is true. But they obtained these cables because the government has set up a public inquiry, and these cables have been tabled in the public inquiry. In other words, the government have facilitated the publication of this material. We have made it possible. If the government were involved in a cover-up, we would hardly be having cables published in a public place and allowing the opposition to raise questions about these cables. We are very happy to answer questions about the cables. As to the substance of them, the cables are only a sliver of the total story and I took the time of the House during question time to give the total story. All of the material is with Commissioner Cole and he will make findings on all of these things, which will be findings based on the objective assessment of a judge, not the fulmination of a desperate Leader of the Opposition. These cables show quite the contrary to what the opposition is claiming. They show that the department was actually assiduous, that the department followed up the allegations that had been made by the Canadian Wheat Board. It would have paid to have followed through and listened to what was said in question time instead of exploding into confected anger, having of course planned the whole attack before question time regardless of what was said by the Prime Minister or me during question timeit was all planned and the little speech was all typed out for the Leader of the Opposition by his office. What was said in question time was that there were subsequent investigations over quite some period of time which culminated with the department obtaining for the United Nations, the body responsible for the investigation, the key contracts that the United Nations wanted to establish the veracity or otherwise of in these claims by the Canadian Wheat Board. Eventually, and I would have to say, as I put it in question time, without being too judgmental, rather reluctantly AWB Ltd gave up these contracts to DFAT and these contracts were given to the United Nations. They examined the contracts. Nobody had hindsight, but for right or for wrong-and the Cole inquiry will establish this-the United Nations drew the conclusion that these contracts were actually in order. Maybe they were, maybe they were not, but there was no evidence at that time that these contracts were not in order. This matter is certainly not worthy of a censure. This is easily answered and easily dealt with, as the Prime Minister and I, I would have thought, had rather comprehensively demonstrated during question time. I will make one final point. Unfortunately I was away yesterday. I hate to be away from the House because I like question time, I like the procedures of the House and I enjoy parliament. But I was in Jakarta, so I was not able to be asked questions. I noticed that opposition yesterday spent a good deal of time, including in the media subsequently, attacking the personality of Trevor Flugge. Let me make this point about Trevor FluggeOpposition member interjecting",37
113,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"No, this is not worthy of a censure, because Mr Flugge is a decent and honourable person and that was the basis on which we employed him. The allegation against him that he is deaf and therefore he should be mocked for being hard of hearing is something I think a lot of Australians will take a very dim view of. This couples with the Leader of the Opposition allowing the attack by the member for Wills on the member for Gwydir through the media. The Leader of the Opposition approved that attack. He hid of course; he did not like to show. He thought it was a bit dirty for the leader to be seen to be involved, but the Leader of the Opposition is responsible for that grubby attack. The Leader of the Opposition loves, as he did on the Sunday TV show, to drag the names of departmental officers into this whole debate. Imagine how those officers feel when they see somebody fulminating about them on a television program for their own personal political advantage. It is very ugly. I will tell you something, Mr Speaker: I defend these people. These people indeed workMr Beazley interjecting",38
114,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"Alistair Nicolas did not work in my department; he worked for Austrade. But I share a department with the Minister for Trade. Some of these officers work in my department. The Leader of the Opposition singled out particular people in a television interview. This causes these people great pain. I will say more than that: these are good people, who work hard, and they are decent people, and they do not deserve to the be dragged through the mud by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition wants to move a censure motion here, a confected argument based on the fact that the government has made available documents. The government made available documents to Cole, which have been tabled in the Cole commission. The Leader of the Opposition argues that this is a cover-up. It is a cover-up but the government makes the documents available through a public inquiry that the government established! It beggars belief that that could possibly be a cover-up. The point we make is that, unlike at least 63 of the 66 countries that had companies involved in oil for food rorts according to the Volcker report, we want to get to the bottom of this. The government thinks that it is best for Australia that we deal with this up-front and in a transparent way-and if there are eventually to be prosecutions that should happen. If we wanted to do what other countries have decided to do, we would have just referred this matter to the Federal Police or to the Australian Crime Commission or whatever. Of course the government could have done that. That was absolutely an option for us. That was an option we considered, and we decided we would not do that. We decided that what we would do was set up a transparent public inquiry. And when it comes to this point about whether the Cole commission's terms of reference have anything to do with the government-of course they do. Mr Beazley interjecting",38
115,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"The Leader of the Opposition is not forensic. He does not do the work. He is lazy and he does not do the work. You can see that on TV shows in the mornings when he does the interviews: ‘Oh, I haven't read that; I don't know about that.' No, because he does not do the work. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. How is this faintly relevant to the motion before the House?",39
116,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,There was a wideranging motion moved. I call the Minister for Foreign Affairs to speak to the motion.,39
117,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"I am just making the point that, if the Leader of the Opposition were a little more forensic, he would know what Commissioner Cole said: that if the AWB had been lying to the governmentincluding departmental officers-that is potentially an offence and he therefore has to establish whether the government knew about the kickbacks or whether it did not. If the government knew about them, then AWB would not be misleading the government. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition's attempt to move a censure is another explosively failed attempt to try to rebuild his leadership at a time when it is tragically failing.",39
118,Mr RUDD,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"Why is this suspension motion of urgency before the House to consider? Because among other things we have a Minister for Foreign Affairs who presents himself in the parliament, slapping himself and the government on the back because they have been oh such good boys. They have said that there are 65 countries involved in the oil for food program scandal, involving 2,200 companies around the world-but which mob got the gold medal? Answer: AWB, approved by the minister scuttling out the door of the chamber right now. They got the gold medal because the $300 million they tipped into Saddam Hussein was bigger by a factor of five or six compared with the company that came second. They ask in this place: aren't they good boys for setting up an inquiry they had no alternative but to set up, for the simple reason that this is a scandal of monumental proportions not just in Australian political history, not just in Australian corporate history but in terms of the world itself when it comes to the breaching of sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime? Why is it so urgent that the House consider this suspension motion? The matter contained within it goes to the core of negligence on our national security and damage to our exports-negligence and damage that have been caused by this government failing to respond in any way to the 17 warnings we have documented so far that they received and turned a blind eye to. This is a government that did not do its job. This is a government that has instead had its energy focused on its short-term internal political interests, not the long-term national interest. The reason this motion is particularly urgent is that, quite apart from the 17 warnings we have documented so far-warnings from the United Nations, warnings from the United States, warnings from the government of Canada, warnings from Australian wheat farmers, warnings from the intelligence community, including the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States, warnings from their own government officials and even warnings from good old cowboy Trevor Flugge through the communications that have come through the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq-the government could not find anything that was sufficiently meritorious for them to act on. But the reason why this matter is of such urgency for the House to consider is that, in the four cables that have been presented today in the Cole commission of inquiry, we have new information. It is brand new. This is not generic in terms of something that might have been going wrong with the oil for food program here or there. This is information that is direct, explicit and specific. about the detail of what was alleged that the AWB was up to-and our fearless friend the foreign minister, in question time today, dropped himself right in the middle of it. He is always going a step too far, our Alex. He is always wanting to prove what a fine fellow he is in his parliamentary performance. He went a step too far when he actually told the truth to the parliament and said this: ‘I personally received these cables, I personally was briefed on these cables and I personally read these cables.' So what was contained in these cables that our fearless foreign minister has today admitted to receiving, being briefed on and having read? These cables from January 2000 say-and I emphasise the specificity of what is contained in the documents-first, that the Iraqis were demanding a surcharge of $US14 per metric tonne for wheat, which would be paid outside the oil for food program; second, that the funds were to be provided into a bank account in Jordan; third, that the system was designed to provide illegal revenue for Saddam Hussein's regime; fourth, that the company was supposed to be owned by Saddam Hussein's son; and, fifth, that the AWB itself had concluded just such a contract with Iraq. How on earth could you claim, as the foreign minister has done in parliament, that this was not explicit, direct and indeed alarming information about the activities of the AWB? His public claim up until now was that it had all been someone else's fault, all the AWB's fault. This minister has today admitted in parliament that he personally received this information. This minister's defence, in terms of what he did with it, was that his department made a few phone calls to the AWB and the AWB chaps said it was all fine. The government say this is all about accountability. They want plenty of questions It is but they scurry from this place when a censure motion is on. Where is the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile? Jeannie Ferris, who went with him to Iraq, has mysteriously reappeared in the Senate today. The trade minister has not reappeared in the House. They deserve to be censured.

138,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me stand back from this thing called the wheat for weapons scandal. At times like this in the debate we have to ask ourselves what it all means for Australia's national interest. It is important to put it in short, sharp and stark terms. What it means is that there has been negligence in terms of this country's national security interests; damage to this country's export interests and our economy overall, and the wheat farming interests of our nation in particular; and that as the debate has unfolded the government, with control of the Senate, is becoming a government increasingly out of control and a government increasingly focusing on its short-term political interests and not on the long-term national interest. Let us go to the first of these points, which deals with negligence in terms of the nation's security and our broader national security interests. What we have presented so far in this debate, which has now raged for some months, is a series of warnings-17 in allreceived by the Howard government. Each of them were dismissed in order. Their attitude to each of these warnings was, ‘There's nothing in those warnings which would cause the government under any circumstances to believe that it should inquire more thoroughly about what the AWB was up to in Iraq.' Today we had a major addition to those warnings in the four cables that have been released, cables which go to the very detail of the information which had been provided by the United Nations through our mission in United New York-coming originally from the government of Canada-to foreign minister Downer's office, where the matter then died. That is what happened: it just died. Nothing was done. That is the cold, hard reality coming out of everything that this minister say today. I spoke also of not just negligence regarding national security but of damage to our exports. You would know, Deputy Speaker Scott, how important the grain industry is to our country's economy. You would know the importance of the grain industry to your own electorate. You would know what would happen if the international reputation of tralia's export monopoly, the AWB, was to be seriously damaged by the inaction of the Howard government in ensuring that the AWB was doing the right thing. I would assume, Deputy Speaker, that a person such as you would find it of grave concern if the AWB was up to things and your government, of which you are part, was not taking proper action to ensure that it was not rorting UN sanctions against Iraq and not rorting the oil for food program under the United Nations to the long-term damage of the reputation of Australia's hard working wheat farmers. I would have thought, Deputy Speaker, that, coming from the part of Queensland that you do, you would have been actively concerned about that. I have spoken about negligence regarding our national security-17 warnings were dismissed-and damage to our nation's export interests, including our hard working wheat farmers. But the other thing which this whole debate brings to the surface is the arrogance of the government. Not only was the Volcker inquiry, which was established by the United Nations, not provided with all the documentation in the government's possession on this wheat for weapons scandal but the Cole inquiry was given limited terms of reference by the Prime Minister so that it would not focus squarely on making findings on the competence and due diligence of the ministers charged with responsibility for our end of the oil for food had to program. For Volcker, there was minimal cooperation; for Cole, there are limited terms of reference-and certainly no capacity to make findings on the competence of and the due diligence executed by ministers. So that leaves the parliament to do the job. Because Volcker was short-changed on information and Cole was short-changed with his terms of reference, we are left with this Aus- parliament-this institution-where our job is to hold the executive accountable. What has happened here? Since the government gained a majority in the Senate, we have seen arrogance unplugged from the Howard government. It is not possible to launch a Senate inquiry which would cause this government any form of political embarrassment. Then there were the extraordinary measures taken two weeks ago to ensure that public servants would not answer the most basic questions of fact before Senate estimates about this wheat for weapons scandal. We are left with this chamber, the House of Representatives, where any question of the most basic factual nature concerning the responsibility of these ministers for this scandal have to be asked. Once again, what do we encounter here but arrogance unplugged, as each question we ask of a factual nature of ministers opposite is dismissed. The questions are not answered, or the answer is delayed to another day, or ministers fly to the other end of the earth in order not to be here to answer them. That is where we come to with these most recent developments in the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal. But with matters now before the Cole inquiry we are about to enter a whole new phase. What I would like to do today in this matter of public importance debate is to begin to describe the chapter which is about to unfold. It is a brand-new chapter. It is postwar Iraq, the period in which this ‘wheat for weapons' scandal had another 18 months to run. Let us put all this into a bit of context. The first corrupt payments on these contracts occurred when? It occurred in November or December 1999, a month or two before Foreign Minister Downer got the cable which we have been debating in the parliament today, a cable which warned him that something was up with the AWB's dealings with the Iraqi regime. Had he acted with due diligence at that time then this scandal would not have unfolded, $300 million would not have been paid to the Iraqi dictator and the five years scandal which unfolded would not have occurred. On top of that, the damage to our national security and our export interests would not have been as severe. But the minister did not do his job. In the 3½ years from the end of 1999 through until the Iraq war in March 2003, there were literally tens of contracts approved by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade from the AWB, with the money then being paid from the oil for food program into the AWB's bank account, off to a bank account in Jordan and then into Saddam Hussein's coffers so that he could buy some guns, bombs and bullets for later use against Australian troops-and we suspect he possibly also drew on those funds to pay $25,000 to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers. But that is all up until the war. The war happened in March and April 2003. The saga which is about to unfold through the matters before the Cole inquiry at present and the broader debate on these matters is what happened in the 1½ years after the war, before this $300 million rort was finally closed down. The Prime Minister said something very significant in his interview with Kerry O'Brien on The 7.30 Report a couple of weeks ago. The Prime Minister was defending himself about why no action was taken in response to the 17 warnings the government had received, including the startling information revealed for the first time today in parliament in those cables of early 2000. What was the Prime Minister's defence? It was a very interesting form of words he used. I am sure the Prime Minister's office is watching-think carefully about this. What he said was: ‘When the war happened, the dam burst. The information started to flow.' That was in March and April 2003. What information started to flow? What we know is that after the war the occupying forcesof including the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom-captured all the senior Iraqi officials, including those in the agriculture ministry and those in the Iraqi Grains Board. All the people on the corrupt end of the deal were suddenly under our control. What else did they get when, as the Prime Minister said, the dam burst? I will tell you what else they got: they got a truck load of documents. On top of that, as part of that truck load of documents, they got some really stinky ones, ones which we suspect had a few letters attached to them-the letter A, the letter W and the letter B. A bit of a problem starts to emerge at this point. Of course, by this stage you have the entire country crawling with the intelligence community, sent by the CIA under the auspices of the Iraq Survey Group to track down the much belated and still missing weapons of mass destruction. But while they were doing that through the Iraq Survey Group they were unearthing the money trail. The money trail, of course, came out of the oil for food program. They were trying to work out where all this money came from that Saddam was out there trying to buy weapons on the international market with. It came off the back of this rort which had been running since 1999. So when the Prime Minister blurts it out on national television to defend himself from attack but in fact opens himself to a fresh new flank, he is admitting that this whole bucket load of information started coming his way. But here is his problem: this was in March, April, May and June 2003. You would think these blokes who call themselves the government-they take the pay cheque-having finally got that information, would have shut the rort down. It ran for another year and a half. Another great truck load of contracts gets approved and another series of rip-offs of the UN bank accounts occur, and all this goes on while this mob, the government-the Prime Minister and Fairy Floss, the foreign minister-are out there running the country and being the cogovernors of Iraq. They control the country. Then what happens in this period? Enter Trevor Flugge, the chap who is up before the Cole inquiry right now, John Howard's Million Dollar Man-no longer Seven-hundred Thousand Dollar Man but Million Dollar Man. Note carefully today, honourable members, the response by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, from Queensland, Mr Dutton. He basically confirmed, if I heard him right, that there may have been a few tax concessions associated with that $1 million payment as well. Could it have been $1 million tax free? We do not know yet. We would like some confirmation from the government as to what exactly was the case. But Million Dollar Man is out there from this time on not as an AWB representative but as the Howard government's representative. He has changed hats. He is there representing the interests of John Howard, Alexander Downer and Mark Vaile. He is there in the field together with Mr Long, formerly of the AWB as well. It is in this period that we find these viduals involved in providing advice to the Coalition Provisional Authority-on what? On what should happen with the continuation of these wheat contracts with the Iraqis. Suddenly the poacher has become the gamekeeper. He has been allowed into the nest. We find that these AWB representativesnow Howard government representativesare in Iraq, the engine room of the Coalition Provisional Authority, with all this information flowing in from the intelligence community, the captured documents and the interrogated Iraqi officials. Doesn't this present an interesting set of circumstances? You have Mr Flugge there sitting in the Coalition Provisional Authority with 29 or 30 other Australians and suddenly all this information starts to flow in the door. What do you do with it? This is the story yet to be told. In those critical months of March, April, May and June 2003, we have a really stinking cat thrown onto the table, and all this information starts to unfold. It comes to the surface in about June 2003 when Mr Longformerly of the AWB and now in the Howard government's employ-sends back a memo to Canberra saying: ‘Good, God! We've got a memorandum of instruction from the Coalition Provisional Authority which says that there have been kickbacks attached to these contracts with the Iraqis. What are we going to do about that?' In that cablegram they say that a list has to be prepared of all the contracts that have been done with Iraq, putting those with a 10 per cent kickback attached to them on one side of the ledger and, on the other side of the ledger, those which do not. In the weeks and months that this debate has raged, the government have failed to answer what they did to pursue whether or not AWB fell on the wrong side of that ledger, that list or that matrix which was being prepared. Throughout this period of time, you have Mr Flugge-with gun in hand and preindisumably a bucket of cash provided by the Howard government as well. I have noted carefully the Prime Minister's belated response to my question yesterday that Mr Flugge has been out there doing a job on behalf of the Howard government. That is where the debate is about to unfold to. This whole 18-month, postwar period points not just to incompetence or negligence but to a government doing much more than turning a blind eye. Throughout 2003-04, when the corrupt contracts are continuing to roll, the government is in control of the government of Iraq itself and the entire information flow. This is where the debate will now go. Mr Flugge is central to this story. He is Mr Howard's personally chosen representative-his own personally selected million dollar man-the man sent there to do a job in Iraq. They certainly did a job on Iraq. Whether they did a job for Iraq remains to be seen. We intend to pursue this new chapter in the $300 million ‘wheat for weapons' scandal, until we have the truth out of this government once and for all.",43
139,Mr BAIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise today to participate in this MPI debate on the oil for food program, which is becoming increasingly like Days of our Lives. It is constantly going into repeats, with the same old facts rehashed and the same old figures and the same old personalities coming out. What is missing in this whole exercise is the smoking gun. The opposition smear, make allegations and try to reduce the reputation of isters in this House over this issue. The Leader of the Opposition has boldly said that the case has been proved, but on this side of the House we are still waiting because clearly the case has not been proved at all. The opposition would like to see clear evidence which shows that the ministers knew all about these allegations and did nothing alternatively, that they knew all about them and decided for various reasons not to become involved. The fact is that, despite all of the allegations by the opposition, despite all of their efforts-there has been a failed censure motion, this is the second MPI that I have participated in and they have concentrated on this issue in every question time in the House over the past four weeks-and despite all their huff and puff and bravado, not one scintilla of evidence has shown that the hands of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade or any of the people mentioned as being involved in this series of allegations are culpable in this exercise. All members on this side of the House would agree that this was a scandal. It was highly inappropriate that it took place. Of course, with the benefit of hindsight, the opposition make these claims. But during all those question times in the House and with all the evidence that they had, the opposition did not raise one question about this matter in the House, in committee meetings of any kind or in estimates debates. So sure are they in running a continuous program on this issue-Days of our Lives-for all to see and repeating the allegations that the allegations will find traction. The fact is that those allegations have not been proven. It has not been found that the ministers or the Prime Minister were involved in this case, and that is min- where the opposition founder on this whole exercise. What was the appropriate action for the government to take in this matter? Was it simply to say: ‘Let's just appoint one of our mates. He'll do a quick fix, declare there was nothing wrong here and it will all be over and done with. Will we refer it to the Austraor, lian Crime Commission to see whether there is a case to answer, and then we can get on with the task? Will we refer it to a parliamentary committee, have a quick review or what?' The government appointed a full inquiry into this issue. The Cole inquiry has full and absolute powers. It has the powers of a royal commission. No other form of inquiry has this high level of skill to investigate whatever it needs to and to talk to any person about any matter at any time. The opposition say that the government are just trying to shirk their responsibility and are trying to brush the whole thing aside, but the reverse is the case. The reverse is that you have a high-profile, high-scale inquiry, where every document requested by Mr Cole has been provided and where every witness who has been asked to appear before Mr Cole has also been provided. Just last week it was reported in the news: Commissioner Terence Cole has invited any MP, journalist or public servant to assist inquiries “the actual or constructive knowledge of the Commonwealth”. In other words, that ministers and their staff, senior public servants, including those in the Prime Minister's office, knew what was going on with respect to all these allegations. Mr Cole has invited all these people with their conspiracy theories-and the opposition is included in this-to come forward. Every piece of evidence that they can provide has been requested by Commissioner Cole: ‘Come forward; show us what you have.' The reality is, as we all know, that they will not be able to provide that. We have talked about the cables that came to the department. There is no doubt that these cables are important. But it also has to be placed in the context of when they were sent and how they were sent. It is not like a normal diplomatic exchange on Australia's reputation et cetera. We were in a very competitive international market situation. Who brought these allegations forward first of all? It was the Canadian and American wheat growers who, of course, for some time had wanted to knock off the Australian wheat supplies. It is a competitive, tough international marketplace and they will use any means that they can. They hear the rumour-in they go. It is in that context that these cables came into the various offices saying that these allegations had been made. Of course people would say, ‘This is only our competitors having a stir,' and so it is brought forward. The opposition would say this is an issue about which we could all be sure that everyone knew and accepted as fact. But the fact is it was a market situation and one of our competitors was making an allegation and nothing more than that. Commissioner Cole has the power and the level of knowledge within every area of government to investigate all of it. Any correinto spondence, letters, emails and phone calls that came through to the government are there. He has the power to look into it. Of course, some of the revelations that have come forward have been disturbing. But the government is trying in a totally honest and open way by saying: ‘Let's put it all out on the table and what falls falls. Let's see who was involved. Let's see which officers may have been involved in this case and did nothing. Let's look at the actions of the AWB and which executives of that organisation were involved. Why was this not picked up before?' Of course, we have to ask the question at the same time: why did the UN inquiry not pick it up? Remember that it was not as though there was no inquiry and suddenly the matter came to light. The United Nations, which is the peak world body, set up a committee whose sole purpose at that time was to look at this oil for food program. They had the allegations from the Canadians; they had the allegations from the Americans. It was their task. They were trusted with the full investigation of this inquiry. Did the Australians simply come in and say that this was total nonsense and that they would not participate in this program? Not at all. It was a full inquiry and it concluded-in retrospect, it was not an appropriate conclusion-that the allegations were unfounded. All the huff and puff from the opposition would seem to ignore the fact that it was a UN inquiry-it was not a coalition party inquiry-that said the allegations were unfounded. So you could hardly blame the ministers involved if they were told, ‘The UN inquiry found that there was no basis to these allegations,' and they then did not turn everything upside down and ask, ‘What is the real situation?' because the inquiry had happened and those were its findings. As we moved on to the Volcker inquiry, set up by the UN to look at the matter in more detail, this government then cooperated to the fullest extent with Volcker. There was no hiding of documents; there were no quiet words in his ear about any of it. Everything was provided. The government took a totally open approach to the Volcker inquiry, where everything became public. The role of Alia in transporting the AWB wheat was known. Once that came to light, the Prime Minister decided on a full-blown inquiry with royal commission powers to investigate this matter. The opposition want to make quick conclusions and make allegations. I notice the member for Wills is in the chamber, and he has been making allegations about the member for Gwydir-that he was selling his shares and so on. I have discussed this with the member for Gwydir. That allegation was absolutely totally outrageous and well you know it. There is not a more honest man in this House than John Anderson, the member for Gwydir. To go around and simply slur people'sMr Kelvin Thomson-Go and talk to Tony Windsor!",47
140,Mr BAIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Tony Windsor we all know, because he has always been jealous. Because he missed out on his preselection for the seat of Tamworth, he has never got over it. So he has this whole psychological thing with the member for Gwydir because the member for Gwydir did what he could never do-that is, become the Deputy Prime Minister. He did a fantastic job, he is a man of incredible repute and what do the members opposite do? They just slur his reputation-they do not care‘Let's throw it around. He sold his shares; he knew all about it.' He was sitting on the back bench then. We on this side of the House think that type of approach is to be absolutely condemned. It is typical of the way the opposition have gone. With little evidence, they simply smear the reputations of the ministers and the Prime Minister, saying, ‘They all knew all about it, and they in retrospect were so wise and would have done that.' Of course, the reality is quite different. The matter was investigated by the UN; it was investigated by Volcker. We have set up a full inquiry and I have not heard anybody say, ‘You should have set up a different type of inquiry.' Mr Kelvin Thomson-Terms of reference!",49
141,Mr BAIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, they did initially, about the terms of reference. The Prime Minister has said that anybody can be called before the inquiry. He will not stop anybody, whether they are a government minister or a senior public servant. That is why Commissioner Cole has called for anybody, if they know of evidenceMr Hockey-Are they putting in a submission? Are the Labor Party putting in a submission?",49
142,Mr BAIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. We would ask you whether you are ready to appear before the inquiry as well. There is no obstacle to prevent anybody in this land being called before that royal commission. If the member for Wills knows of anyone who is prevented from appearing then we would like to know, because the Prime Minister has made it very clear that everybody is available to go before it. Isn't this what you would do if you had an issue? And there is the member for Windsor",49
143,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,New England.,50
144,Mr BAIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sure with another allegation against the member for Gwydir, having his normal jealousy of the member for Gwydir, but the reality-and I am sure he would consult with the member for WillsMr Windsor-Another bribery scandal, Bruce; another bribery scandal!",50
145,Mr BAIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sure you would love to have one, but it will not happen for you, regardless. What we have seen is an illfounded attack, when the government has done all in its power to have a full, open, transparent inquiry where anybody can be called before the inquiry, where the commissioner has full royal commission powers. He can ask for any papers to be provided. The bottom line is that, despite the claims from the Leader of the Opposition that the case is proved, the fact is that the case has not been proved. We are waiting for fair justice, for the commissioner to bring down his report, bring down his recommendations and make his findings and not to be subject to all these allegations, smears and innuendos that we get from a whole lot of members opposite, when the reality is that the government is doing absolutely the right thing. It is clear, transparent and evident to everybody. This government means to do business, and it is doing the right thing in terms of this inquiry.",50
146,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In Australia, we love our sport. In my own home town of Melbourne, we are getting particularly excited by the Commonwealth Games just around the corner. One thing we do not tolerate is cheating in sport. We hate cheating. We hate performanceenhancing drugs. It is not the Australian thing to do. Unfortunately, we now know that our wheat-exporting monopoly, AWB, was the gold medal winner for kickbacks in Iraq. Those $300 million in inland transportation fees were the performance-enhancing drugs, the steroids, of AWB's wheat trade in Iraq. But government ministers, from the Prime Minister down, want us to believe that they knew nothing of what was going on. They make a virtue of their incompetence. They revel in their incompetence. But, with every passing day, this Sergeant Schultz claim that ‘we knew nothing' becomes less and less believable. Just yesterday, the member for Gwydir, former Deputy Prime Minister Anderson, stated that the Prime Minister asked him early last year what he thought of AWB executives. The member for Gwydir says the conversation was cut short, so I guess we will never know why the Prime Minister was seeking his opinion on the calibre of AWB personnel. But this is the same Prime Minister who told us in January: ... there were no alarm bells. There was no suggestion, there was no evidence before us that AWB was paying any bribes. Well, Prime Minister, there were alarm bells ringing in Canada, there were alarm bells ringing in the US, there were alarm bells ringing in Iraq, there were alarm bells ringing at the UN, and there were even alarm bells ringing at farm machinery days in the Victorian Mallee. It seems that the only people who could not hear them were the Prime Minister and Trevor Flugge. How are we supposed to reconcile the Prime Minister's claim that there were no alarm bells with the member for Gwydir's statement that the Prime Minister raised the character of AWB personnel with him? Why did he ask, if not because alarm bells had started to ring? And how are we to reconcile this with the Prime Minister's statement that the AWB people were ‘a very straight up and down group of people'? He said: ‘I can't, on my knowledge and understanding of the people involved, imagine for a moment that they would have been involved in anything improper.' On what did he base that assessment? It seems to me that, by the time he made it, he must have realised the seriousness of the issue, so he was basically trying to put one over the Australian people in the same way that the government tried to put one over US senators Tom Daschle, Patty Murray et cetera. This matter of public importance provides us with the opportunity to condemn the government's continuing refusal to answer questions about its role in the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal. I lament the way the government is treating this parliament with contempt, stonewalling questions in this House and shutting down the Senate estimates committees. I remember that when the Prime Minister won control of the Senate he said would not abuse his newly won power. It did not take long for that promise to vanish-just another non-core promise lying dead on the road. There are many questions which remain unanswered. For example, AWB's public and government affairs manager, Darryl Hockey, a former adviser to the member for Gwydir, Mr Anderson-it really is hard to know where the Wheat Board stops and the National Party begins-has stated that he specifically asked Minister Downer's office and Minister Vaile's office to say nothing about the sale of wheat to Iraq in December 2002. Given that governments are normally falling all over themselves to announce large wheat sales as good news, you would think that that request for confidentiality would have struck the ministers, in the words of the Prime Minister, as ‘passing strange' and rather irritating. So the question I have for these ministers is: did they make any inquiries about why they were being asked to keep quiet about the sale and, if they did make any inquiries, what were they told? What did they find out? The government also has to tell us on what basis it agreed to pay Mr Trevor Flugge, the former National Party candidate, $978,000 from the foreign aid budget for eight months work in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. What were Mr Flugge's qualifications to be paid so much? What did Australians get for our million dollars? Why did the money come out of the foreign aid budget? I thought the aid budget was to feed starving people, not to make millionaires out of unsuccessful National Party candidates. After the fall of Saddam Hussein's government, the Howard government sent Mr Flugge to Baghdad and paid him $978,000 from our aid budget for eight months work he because he was such a great communicator. Yesterday he told the Cole commission he is pretty much deaf-he has a virtually ineffective left ear and a right ear which is somewhat impaired. Mr Flugge's hardness of hearing came in relation to the subject of trucking fees being raised at a 1999 dinner where AWB executives were present. Mr Flugge wanted to take issue with AWB whistleblowers who claimed that the fees paid to that truckless Jordanian trucking company, Alia, were a means of paying kickbacks. The whistleblowers have told the Cole inquiry that Mr Flugge had approved the use of the London based trader Ronly Holdings, where his daughter worked as a junior administrator, as a middleman to pay the bribes. I believe the whistleblowers. I find it absolutely unbelievable that the government should have been paying Mr Flugge $978,000 from our aid budget for an eight-month consultancy job in Iraq. That was yesterday; there is something new every day. Today we learn that there are cables from early 2000 from the Australian embassy to the United Nations in New York which expressly warned the government, first, that the Iraqis were demanding a surcharge of $US14 per metric tonne for wheat which would be paid outside the oil for food program; second, that the funds were to be provided into a bank account in Jordan; third, that the system was designed to provide illegal revenue for Iraq in US dollars; fourth, that the UN believed the company involved in the scheme was owned by the son of Saddam Hussein; and, fifth, that the AWB had concluded contracts of a similar nature to this with the Iraqi regime. The cables also say that another national wheat supplier had specifically rejected these approaches having been advised by the United Nations that accepting any such arrangement with Iraq would not be permissible under the oil for food program. In the parliament today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, admitted that he had seen these cables. The media have been clamouring for a smoking gun. There is more smoke here than you would find in a London pub. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has had his attention expressly drawn each of the elements in the oil for food scanCole dal and yet no action has been taken and we have seen this $300 million debacle progressively unfold. The government has been getting increasingly worried and casting around for distractions. Today we had the government's Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, casting around for distractions. He asked: ‘Are there any Australians in the Australian Labor Party?' They are all Australians. Everyone who participates in Labor preselections is an Australian citizen, unlike Liberal Party rules, which have no such requirement and have led to such excesses as the Liberal preselection for the electorate of Ryan being participated in by residents of Hong Kong who had no Australian connection whatsoever. The government has received warning after warning after warning of what was occurring. We have talked during this debate about the period after the downfall of Saddam Hussein. There were warnings in June 2003 from Michael Long and again from US Wheat Associates, who wrote to US Secretary of State Colin Powell. There were warnings in August 2003, in September 2003 and in October 2003. Then, late last year, the balloon really started to go up. We know that the Prime Minister met Paul Volcker in New York and the issue of the oil for food scandal was discussed. We also know that the foreign affairs minister had discussions with Mr Volcker. Mr Downer's meeting led to a flurry of activity, suggesting a realisation on his part that the cat was out of the bag marked ‘AWB kickbacks'. Minister Downer met with AWB senior personnel and told them the report was bad for the company and they needed to meet with Mr Volcker as soon as possible. A week later, the member for Gwydir sold all his AWB shares. Given this history, it is high to time ministers started to appear before the inquiry instead of trying to hide behind it. These ministers and former Minister Anderson should go before the Cole inquiry and answer the question which would no doubt be put to them.",50
147,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well may we ask: why are we having this debate at all? The reason, of course, is that the Labor Party needs some form of divertissement. It is presently engaged in ripping itself to shreds. It is presently engaged in a vendetta with its figurehead and its spearhead being that campaign against Simon Crean. Why? Because Simon Crean had the audacity to say he wanted to reform the Australian Labor Party and reduce the amount of union power in picking candidates for preselection who subsequently become members of parliament. That is what this is really about. Read the newspaper headlines: ‘Queue for safe Labor seats grows' and ‘Six Victorian MPs facing the boot'. Again and again we are seeing disarray in the Labor Party, and what better way to deal with that disarray than to show a concerted front on which they could all agree by trying to give the government a hard time on the Wheat Board. Let us look at the reality of the situation. The terms of this matter of public importance are: The failure of the Government to properly account for its role in the continued abuse of Nations Iraqi aid programs following the downfall of Saddam Hussein. Firstly, you can thank the coalition of the willing and the Howard government, which joined in that coalition, for the exit of Saddam Hussein. If it had not been for that determination, he would still be there. That would please the Labor Party, who did not support the downfall of that dictatorship. They were wishy-washy and, quite frankly, if their views had been followed he would still be there today. But the proper role of government was fulfilled on 10 November, when the Hon. Terence Cole AO QC was: ... appointed Commissioner to conduct an inquiry into and report on whether decisions, actions, conduct or payments by Australian companies mentioned in the Final Report (‘Manipulation of the Oil-for-Food Programme by the Iraqi Regime') of the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme breached any Federal, State or Territory law. That was the government's role and that was the government's response to the Volcker inquiry-quite proper and fulfilled. In the terms of the MPI being moved today by the honourable member for Griffith, quite simply the government has fulfilled its role of accountability by appointing a commission which has powers conferred by the Royal Commissions Act 1902. I go back to the point of why we are seeing fulmination by the Labor Party on every occasion. I think we must be up to 90 questions asked by the Labor Party on this issue to date-90 questions that have not laid a glove on anyone. No connect has been made to the government. Not prepared to let the Cole inquiry do its work and bring out its report, the Labor Party simply want to have, as I said, a smokescreen and divertissement which takes people's attention away from what is really going on in the Labor Partywhich is a mammoth bloodletting; a vicious United vendetta against Simon Crean in particular for his actions in reducing the power of the trade unions and a vendetta against everyone who voted for the disastrous Latham experiment. I can understand why the Labor Party are angry about the fact that they were stupid enough to pick Latham. I think, if you look at the way they self-destructed during the campaign under a man who clearly could not handle it, all those people who were there toMs Roxon- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member has been speaking for more than five minutes now and has not once mentioned any word that is the topic of the matter of public importance before the House. I do ask that the member be brought to the topic. I know that it is not interpreted terribly strictly at this time, but the member should at least vaguely be able to discuss the topic that is before us. It is after all a very important matter of public interest. I would have thought that the member for Mackellar might be able to say something of significance on the topic. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Wilkie)-I believe there has been wideranging discussion and there has been some reference to the terms of reference of the MPI.",52
148,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a pity that the member opposite who raised the point of order is deaf as well as being involved in the vendetta against Simon Crean. I go further to look at the Volcker report. put it in true perspective, when we look at the inquiry Volcker embarked upon, he was looking at 2,220 companies-food companies, a bank, the UN secretariat and UN contractors. There were 2,220 companies involved in that investigation, involving 66 member states. If you listened to the subterfuge from the Labor opposition, you would have thought that the Volcker inquiry was exclusively about Australia and Australian Wheat Board Ltd-AWBL. You would not have thought that there was another thing being investigated. As I said when the honourable member across the way was not listening, the MPI says that the government has not fulfilled its role. I said it had fulfilled its role totally when it appointed the Cole commission to look into Australia's role and whether or not there had been any breach of federal, state or territory law. I said on a number of occasions that it was about time that the opposition awaited the outcome of that inquiry and then perhaps we can debate what occurs after that. Of course, if we waited for that, the major story that would be running on the front page of the newspapers would be the bloodletting of the Labor Party. Anybody in politics knows that disunity is death. That is precisely what the Labor Party wishes to cover up. The issues are being dealt with quite properly by the government in fulfilling its role, the same role that in the matter of public importance the opposition says we have (Mr not fulfilled. Quite clearly, anyone who questioned the government's response to the Volcker inquiry has properly been answered by the Cole inquiry. We can look further at the sorts of things that the government is doing in addition to assist in Iraq to ensure that the actions of the coalition of the willing result in a successful outcome for Iraq. In that context, we have To committed $173 million in aid-$55.5 million for immediate humanitarian needs; $47 million through multilateral agencies to support elections, agriculture, governance and refugees; $37 million spent on reconstruction assistance, mainly in agriculture and governance; and a further $33 million allocated for construction assistance from 2005 to 2007. In addition to that, we have involved ourselves in UNICEF projects with another $14.5 million for water and sanitation-the provision of two million litres of clean water daily. AusAid funds to UNICEF for water tanks in Basra are benefiting over 200,000 people through the provision of daily supplies of water and rehabilitation of water and sewerage facilities in 10 governorates. AusAID funding supported the rehabilitation of seven Nissan water treatment plant power stations. In the area of health, 4.2 million children under five-years-old and 700,000 pregnant women have been the beneficiaries of a vaccination program. There has been training for 140 physicians and 203 health workers on preventative health services, immunisation and health management. There has been training of 450 health workers specialising in child sickness. In other words, not only does the government totally refute the proposition set out in the MPI by saying that we have properly fulfilled our role by appointing the Cole commission under the Royal Commission Act 1902 to inquire into these matters but also we are simply one country out of 66 with all the focus on one company when there are 2,220 involved. What we are really seeing is the Labor Party getting rid of all those people who supported the disastrous Latham experiment and masking the bloodbath by attacking sitting members in payback for decreasing the amount of union control of the Labor Party. That is what should really be debated today, not the question of whether or not Australia has acted properly with regard to the Volcker report, which the government have clearly done. (Time expired)",54
149,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was intrigued with the history lesson in terms of the Labor Party and what is currently going on. I think the wheat growers are very concerned about what is going on in relation to the daily exposé of the Wheat Board. I think there are only two or three wheat growers actually in the House of Representatives, of which I am one. It would be pertinent for those entering the debate to have a very close look at the history of the Australian Wheat Board and the history of the farming movement as to how and why the Wheat Board came about. Undoubtedly, this particular issue of the corrupt activities of members of the Australian Wheat Board is going to damage our credibility in any international forum in tion to trade negotiations. I think most people would be aware that Australia has been at the forefront of trying to achieve free trade and a more balanced nature of our trade. Whether the government or the ministers that have been named in this issue have been involved or not or can be proven to be involved or not is almost irrelevant compared with the damage that is being done internationally. In the future Australia and our rent Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, will have to go into those forums and argue for free trade when this sort of activity has been going on. There have been, rightly or wrongly, a number of missives that have been sent, messages that were not properly picked up or maybe ignored-I do not know the answers to that and I do not think Commissioner Cole will actually find the answers to those things either-but the fact is there has been enormous damage done. There have been a number of meetings across Australia with political players, some wheat growers and some organisations where the issue of the Wheat Board has been discussed. But wheat growers are very concerned. They want the truth to come out and they feel it has to come out before we can regain any credibility internationally. Wheat growers are very concerned about the future of the single desk arrangements. Wheat growers do not want the baby thrown out with the bathwater on this issue. There may be some finetuning that needs to be done to the Wheat Export Authority or a body such as that where there can be greater scrutiny of and transparency in the Wheat Board's activities. I think that is an issue that has to be decided. Many members of the government have been saying that we do not want to mix those two issues, and I agree with Mr Vaile's statement, but many members of the government are actually mixing the issues to a political end. Some people believe that this relaissue of corrupt activity by members of the Wheat Board in dealing with Iraq may well open up an opportunity to free up the single desk arrangements into the future. As I said, the wheat growers that I have spoken to do not want that to happen. They do not want the two debates to run at once. I call upon those members of the government in particular, but all members of parliament in general, who are suggesting-and cur- the Treasurer is one of them-that there should be alternative ways of marketing grain and that there should be a freeing up of the way in which export grain enters the marketplace on the back of the Iraqi activities to support the single desk arrangements, to allow the Cole inquiry to take its course and, on the determinations that are made by the Cole inquiry, to keep in place the single desk. That may well, as I said, require some degree of tinkering with the Wheat Export Authority or a similar body into the future. But there is enormous damage being done. I think we all recognise that. One thing the government has not done is to recognise that there are other ways of using this grain. We tend to have a mindset that Australia is an exporter of grains. We export something like 75 to 80 per cent of our capacity; therefore, we think we are dependent on the world market. That has been one of the issues in running the free trade agenda. But there are alternatives, and I do not think this parliament, and particularly the government, pay enough attention to those alternatives. The government should be serious about looking at those alternatives, particularly given the fact that the grain market is corrupt. Every day we have someone from the government or the Wheat Board saying that that is the way the world is. I do not tually believe that, but let us assume for the moment that they know more than I do-that is the way the world is; it is a corrupt marketplace. So we have an absurd situation where we grow our grain, we export it on a corrupt market and then we use some of that money to enter another corrupt market, that of the oil business. There are the fuel companies themselves and there are the various countries in the Middle East that have the and we go out into the world market, trade our grain in a sense and bring back oil. As time goes on, that will happen more and more. The government is not looking at ways and means of cutting that corner. I know I have raised this issue before, but I will raise it again because I think it is particularly pertinent. If Australia adopted a mandatory 10 per cent ethanol in our petrol, that one stroke of policy would remove half the export grain from the marketplace-eight million tonnes. We export about 16 million tonnes a year. Ten per cent ethanol in our fuel is something that many other nations are doing. Even the President of the United States, George Bush, has recently announced that they will move towards much more sustainable energy and that they are going to get off their addiction to oil. They can see what is happening and potentially happening internationally. If we adopted a policy of 10 per cent ethanol in our fuel, that would potentially remove eight million tonnes of grain from that corrupt market. Twenty per cent of the total wheat production for export would be removed, and it would remove the necessity to enter these two corrupt markets. Those markets will get worse as time goes on. The government has not looked at those options. The government tends to be locked into the mindset that we have to export and that, if we export, we have to take it for granted that those markets will be corrupt acand that we need to get rid of the grain-we need the money, our farmers need the money-and, therefore, that is the way the world operates. It is not the way the world operates in the United States, the bastion of free trade, and it is not the way the world operates in Brazil. Brazil, for instance, is expanding its ethanol industries at the rate of one Australian sugar industry per annum. The United States is building ethanol plants oil, at a rate of a little under one a month. As the Minister for Community Services at the table would realise, we are looking at grain prices of about 25 years ago. The grain prices to the farmers in Australia are very low at this time. Irrespective of whether or not the government is involved, the damage has been done to our trading reputation. It is time that we looked at alternatives if we are really concerned about the wheat growers that everybody is crying about. It is time that we looked at real alternatives to the uses of grain products, rather than having this constant harping. I was one of those in the eighties-because I was involved with the Grains Council of Australia and the New South Wales Farmers Association-who was arguing for a level playing field internationally. That is fantasy land. It is fantasy land in United States, it is fantasy land in Europe and it is fantasy land in the South Americas, and it should be considered as fantasy land here. We have to start to look at alternatives to the exportable surpluses we produce. There is an enormous opportunity in the grains and sugar industries through sustainable energy and renewable fuel in biodiesels and ethanols. I would suggest that, if both sides of this parliament are, as they say, really concerned about wheat growers in Australia, they start looking at those alternatives.

FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 February, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time.",62
156,Ms ROXON,COMMITTEES,"Gellibrand) (5.07 pm)to jus- Labor welcomes the introduction of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005 into the parliament and supports the overwhelming majority of the provisions in it. The gestation period of the bill has been over three years and much of the groundwork was laid by bipartisan committee work in this House. Family law is not and should not be about a political battle between the Liberal and Labor parties or a tug of war between mums and dads. Family law is about providing for and protecting children. It is children's interests that tasked to take care of when we are debating this bill. We must not forget that the children are the very reason-really the sole reasonthat the parliament is involved at all in intermums vening in this tricky area of family relationships. The public interest, the debate and the long lead time for these particular family law changes are also indicative of the complex and difficult area that family law is and the determination that I think all of us in this House share in trying to make these laws as good as we can. Of course society has changed over 30 years and we need to make sure that our laws reflect this. We also need to remember in this area of law, more so than in many others, that the law cannot fix the pain and disappointment that many people inevitably feel when their relationships break down. We cannot turn family law into a proxy debate about a wide range of other social problems. It is just unrealistic and destined to disappoint if we pretend that family law, no matter how we change it, will make people forget the hurt they feel when their families break up. It is easy to see how the media and certain lobby groups are attracted to the sensational ‘battle of the sexes' rhetoric. But it is a that politicians should avoid, because family law is about something much more important than parents' rights: it is about children. Given this, we should be more concerned about parents' responsibilities than parents' rights, because that is what will benefit children at the end of the day. In this speech I am going to take the time to carefully set out Labor's position on family law. I intend to go through the many parts of the bill we support, to highlight and make suggestions for those that we think can be improved and to express our reservations we are about how some aspects may work when implemented. We support the measures that encourage shared parenting. It is a positive development that more and more parents, and dads, realise the value of staying in active contact with their children after separation. In particular, the last decade has seen a great change in the numbers of fathers wanting to play a significant role in the care of their children, and it is appropriate that the law recognises that patterns of parenting are changing. At the same time, mums are still providing the majority of care for children in the community. I guess the point of raising both of these facts is that it is important that we realise that all families are different. This means that we have to be very careful about prescribing one-size-fits-all solutions in family law. We also support the measures in this bill that are trying to simplify court processes involving children and to make them less adversarial, and the measures to solve as many matters as possible outside the courts. This picks up the process that is being trialled in the Sydney and Parramatta registries with respect to the court processes. The Family Court is undertaking that pilot project as we speak. We note that the final assessment of that trial has not yet been completed and trap we do hope that the government will commit to reviewing these changes, if necessary, in the light of that report when it is provided. Labor supports changes that will promote family dispute resolution outside the courtroom. This has the potential to save a lot of time, money and frustration. This bill is part of a package that includes a significant new government contribution to the funding of family relationship services. It includes $200 million towards increased funding of services under the existing family relationship services program. Labor enthusiastically welcomed this new money when it was announced. Indeed, we had been arguing for a number of years that these services had been sorely neglected by the Howard government. We also welcome the plan to establish a network of 65 family relationship centres. Well managed and properly resourced, this network could provide an invaluable addition to the family law system-a shopfront and entry point for advice, referral, counselling and mediation services. But being well managed and resourced is the key, and we will be closely watching these services to make sure they are well managed and resourced-but more of this later. So it is clear that many of the good ideas in this bill are well supported by Labor. And this is no surprise, because many of them came out of the bipartisan work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs several years ago, which produced the important Every picture tells a story report. Labor is proud the contribution that our colleagues made to that report. Further, a number of aspects of this bill we are debating today come from a later review conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which scrutinised an earlier exposure draft of this bill. I will come later to a number of recommendations made by that committee. At this point, though, I want to note that this bill now includes two important provisions that stem from my dissenting report in that LACA review, which will temper the rights focus of the earlier draft of the bill, with two new important responsibilities for parents. Section 60CC, which outlines the best interests of the child test, will now require the court to consider the extent to which each parent has taken up opportunities to spend time with and communicate with the child, be involved in major life decisions that affect the child and paid maintenance for that child. Section 70NCA will allow costs to be awarded against parents who make repeated nuisance claims that the other parent has breached parenting orders. Yes, they certainly must have the right to complain, but now they also have a responsibility not to abuse that right. These are tremendously important new provisions which I believe should help make sure the balance of the Family Law Act when these changes have gone through is right. My concern, which I have raised in many other places, including in my dissenting report, is that if we focus too much on rights we risk turning a blind eye to irresponsibility. The law cannot promote rights without responsibilities. When you do so, you run the risk that people will abuse those rights. While the vast majority of non-resident parents-as well as the majority of resident parents-take their responsibilities seriously, we of believe the exposure draft would have rewarded those who do not. In the process it would have created huge problems in those situations where a non-resident parent is more concerned with controlling their expartner's lives than actually maintaining a meaningful involvement in their children's lives. So these changes are important and welcome. Having set out the areas in which there is agreement between the government and the Labor Party-and they do cover the main aspects of this bill-I will turn now to some of the concerns that Labor does have with this bill. Labor's most significant concern is to make sure that this package protects people from family violence. We believe there are parts of this bill that could be better worded to afford greater protection, and we will be moving amendments accordingly. Labor believes that the issue of family violence has to be taken seriously; it cannot be brushed aside just because it is a difficult issue. The first area for improvement of the bill involves recognising the way violence affects mediation and parenting plans. While resolution of disputes outside the courts is be encouraged, we must be sure that these resolutions are genuinely made in the best interests of children, which means they must also be absolutely free of bullying, coercion and intimidation. If we are to make mediation compulsory and give new force to parenting plans agreed to without any professional or legal advice, we need new precautions to make sure that violence and fear are not influencing the agreements that are reached. Some of our amendments go directly to these issues. For example, we propose a cooling-off period for parenting plans and a clear rule that these plans are not if obtained under coercion or duress. On this latter point, I understand we have been advised today that the government will accept our amendment in respect of coercion and duress-and that is obviously welcome news. There is a specific change proposed in the bill by the government which we believe could make matters significantly worse in the area of violence, and that is the planned change to the definition of ‘family violence'. It was only on Sunday that the government announced that the Australian Institute of Family Studies is going to undertake a research project into family violence and family law. But before the government even gets the results from this inquiry it wants to change the definition of violence, with next to no reasoning or basis for doing so. Certainly, this research is welcome and it will be important for us to get some good quality longitudinal research in this area. But it seems silly for the government to make the decision to move us from a subjective test to an objective test without any real basis for doing so. This, in fact, is a position that the Attorney originally had in his draft bill-a position on which he and I seemed to agree, but on which the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Leto gal and Constitutional Affairs did not agree. I must say that I do not think a rushed inquiry, in which a proposal was put forward to look for a better definition, should form the basis for making such a major change, the consequences of which have not been followed through. I am concerned that the proposal that requires a person to show that they had a ‘reasonable' apprehension of violence is an unsatisfactory approach. Firstly, there is an implication that some forms of violence or threatening behaviour are acceptable as long as a ‘reasonable' person would not feel afraid. This gets the courts into the very valid tricky business of deciding what conduct would scare a ‘reasonable' person. I do not believe we should put the courts in this position, and parliament should be very clear that there is no such thing as acceptable violence. Secondly, the definition does not provide scope to consider the particular circumstances of the victim-for example, a person who has previously been exposed to violence may be more sensitive and fearful in circumstances where another person might not. Thirdly, an objective definition is not at all helpful when we are dealing with the question of who should or should not attend mediation. When it comes to mediation, frankly, it does not really matter whether or not one person's fear is reasonable. Even an unreasonable fear will affect the power balance between the parties. It is simply not fair for us to force people into mediation if they are absolutely terrified. That cannot be a legitimate participation in mediation. At the very least, Labor has a strong view that a subjective definition must apply for the purposes of the exception to compulsory mediation. As I have said, I think the Attorney and I agree on this issue. Our colleagues on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on both sides of the House, did not agree, and they made a suggestion after the short inquiry. But I am fearful that the consequences of that proposal were not carefully considered. There is, of course, another option between the objective and subjective definitions of violence. The style of definition that applies in the state laws on restraining orders actually defines the conduct which the law deems to be violent regardless of the effect it has on the victim. This may be a better approach, although I can see that it would also have some technical difficulties. It is my hope, given that a Senate committee has now been set up to look at this bill, that the mittee will take some time to consider whether the Commonwealth should go down that road. If we are not sure, we should not change a long standing definition of violence without understanding the consequences. The government has now announced a thorough review in this area by an independent research body. If we are not sure of the consequences of a change as significant as this, we should wait until we have the results of that inquiry. Labor is also concerned about the provisions to impose costs orders for false tions of violence. Labor understands that it must be devastating to be falsely accused of violence against your children or partner. However, it also needs to be acknowledged that the current evidence and research suggest that we have a much bigger problem in Australia with the under-reporting of domestic violence than with false allegations. This is the evidence that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs heard from the Law Council, the Family Court and others. Given this, the last thing we want to do is create a disincentive for raising genuine concerns. Labor is worried that a costs penalty would send the wrong message to victims of violence, telling them that it is much safer to stay quiet than to risk a costs order against them if they cannot be 100 per cent confident that they can prove that the violence has occurred. Interestingly, this is another area in which the Attorney and I agree. It was the initial position put forward by the Attorney in the exposure draft. Labor stands ready to support the Attorney if and when he chooses to revert to his original position. As an aside, I want to flag Labor's concern about the increasing incidence of using costs within the family law jurisdiction each time we make changes to the law. We are concerned that we might, by a back door, be comturning family law into a costs jurisdiction. That is, of course, a very serious change and we should tread very carefully. There are a number of other proposed amendments that we have provided to the government which will be debated in the detailed debate on the third reading, including the definition of ‘exposing children to violence' being included within the definition of ‘violence'. We intend to move those specific amendments on those issues in the committee stages and I hope that the government will consider adopting a number of allega- those amendments when we do that. As I already mentioned, the bill is going to introduce a new system of compulsory mediation with some limited exceptions. Labor supports this shift as it could help that category of cases in which separating couples have not been able to reach agreement on their own but are not so entrenched in their attitudes and disagreements as to require final orders from a court. Indeed, we can recognise that the adversarial nature of court proceedings can, of themselves, sometimes make reaching agreement even more difficult. In these cases, compulsory mediation before litigation could act as a useful circuit-breaker, before disputes escalate. However, compulsory mediation could carry some serious consequences if it is not implemented in the right way. We want to express some caution about the changes and we would like to make sure that compulsory mediation will require the following conditions. Firstly, mediation has to be accessible if it is going to be effective. We welcome the government's promise of three hours of free funding in each case. We are not confident it will be sufficient in all cases but we think it is important that the government has made that commitment. We want this to be a commitment that is actually in legislation as a precondition for compulsory mediation. We are concerned that if the government changes its mind in the futureif this becomes another ‘non-core' promise of the Prime Minister-people will still be obliged to go to mediation but will not have the financial support that the government at this stage is prepared to provide. We cannot and should not put a new requirement in place for people to attend that mediation at their own expense, so adding to the costs of people who are going through family breakdown. We do not think that would make it cheaper. Of course that would make it more expensive. There is a specific amendment that people on both sides of this House can vote for to put that promise into law. We will be urging all members of the House to vote for that. Secondly, for the implementation to work, staff must be well trained. I think all members of this House agree that cases involving family violence or entrenched conflict are not suitable for mediation and should be dealt with in a formal court setting. In practice, in order for us to get that right, we need to be confident that family relationship centre staff can recognise the signs of violence and entrenched conflict and understand how to make appropriate referrals. If mediators do not do this and try to force mediation in inappropriate circumstances, we may have some disastrous, even tragic, outcomes on our hands. Similarly-and acknowledging the complex emotional context of family separation-FRC staff need to be adequately trained in dealing with violent situations if they arise in the course of mediation. Thirdly, we want to make sure that the government can assure us as to the quality of the services that will be provided. Training staff is going to be vital, but it will not be enough. The government must also ensure that the quality of mediation services are of a consistently high standard. I am alarmed that the government's operational framework documents contain key performance indicators which seem to prioritise the quantity of parenting agreements reached, rather than the quality of services provided. We need to make sure that the incentives given to the centres are right. Too much focus on quantity could actually encourage staff to push people into agreements that are not sensible or appropriate, because staff are rewarded on the churn rate. We are talking about dealing with complex family relationships here, not sausage factories, and we should make sure that our assessments of the services are appropriate, so we will be watching the implementation closely. We are in the situation of debating this bill in the House without any accreditation details, without a complaints process being in place and without any information about how the new family relationship centres will actually be overseen by government. Fourthly, it is important that the centres not pursue an ideological, political or religious agenda. These centres are going to be funded by government to provide services, not to promote their own agendas. We know that there are many views within the community on issues like relationships, divorce, parenting and so on. These are complex social issues, and I think our society benefits from hearing many different points of view. But government funded relationship services should not be used as vehicles for this sort advocacy or for evangelising or social engineering. The Attorney has to take a personal interest in and responsibility for making sure that this does not happen. The centres must not discriminate. If these centres are to be accessible and available to all people, the government must ensure that they do not discriminate on the grounds of gender, ethnicity, religion, disability or socio-economic disadvantage. We are trying to get put into law a number of these important guarantees that are in specific proposals that we have. Some of them are included in the second reading amendment that I will move in a moment. At the end of the day it is important that the government understands that, while it has our support to go down this path, it needs to make sure that the implementation process is going to turn this into a real change that works for Australian families. We have some reasons to worry about how effectively the government will do this. In recent years the Howard government has developed a record of administrative incompetence-another sign that 10 years on the government is passing its use-by date. Only this month we have seen revelations of incompetence in two funding programs similar to the one proposed for the FRCs roll-out. Firstly, there was the scandalous mismanagement of the Job Network, which the government heralded as the model to be used for the family relationship centres. In that case, we have seen overpayments resulting from providers fudging their figures-another side effect of the narrow, quantity based performance indicators which are used by a government too lazy to put in place genuine quality assurance mechanisms. Secondly, we have seen in the media the issue of entities associated with the Hillsong Church overspending government grants on internal ‘administration' costs, with little going to the Indigenous of communities that the money was intended for. In this case, the Attorney's own department was implicated, having failed to check properly on references. So in the case of family relationship centres, we do have some reason to be cautious and concerned, so competent implementation-and we urge this-is going to be essential to the effective operation of the legislation that we are debating. For this reason, on the passage of this bill the opposition will closely watch the FRCs roll-out, and we expect the Attorney to be completely transparent about this process. He would be aware that I have made a freedom of information request for a number of documents that have not been provided at this stage. Their provision would help ensure that the process is transparent and not political. We need to make sure that he is held personally responsible if this system does fail. He cannot be allowed to ask us, while we are debating this bill, to trust him on its implementation and then not be held accountable for any problems that occur further down the track. I now move my second reading amendment, which is quite long as it does encompass a range of our concerns and a number of issues that other speakers on our side of this House will want to discuss during this debate: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that the first priority of family law should be to promote and secure the best interests of children and that this requires a focus on: (a) the responsibility of parents to care for, love and provide security to children (b) the need to prevent children from being victims of, or exposed to, violence, abuse or neglect, and (c) without compromising the above, the benefit to children of knowing and spending time with their parents; (2) notes that, despite this Bill, the Howard Government has made shared parenting before and after separation more difficult through its constant attacks on Australian families, such as the recent industrial relations changes and its failure to meet the chronic child care shortage; (3) notes the risk that the Government is creating false expectations that this Bill will create a right for parents spending equal time with their children, when the Bill does not do this, in many cases this would not be appropriate and it shouldn't automatically be the starting point for negotiations; (4) notes that the Government has improved its Bill by adopting Labor's ideas that: (a) for parents intent on demanding parental ‘rights', the Court will consider the extent to which parents have exercised their responsibilities as parents - recognising that parenting is a two-way street; (b) strengthened compliance measures should be coupled with costs for nuisance complainants, so that the right to seek a remedy cannot be used irresponsibly; (5) notes that the effectiveness of these reforms will fundamentally depend on the implementation of the Family Relationship Centres program, so that these centres can provide appropriate advice, counselling and referral as well as dispute resolution services and calls on the Government to commit to: (a) providing adequate resources to Family Relationship Services and Centres; (b) regular reappraisal of needs and funding to ensure free services; (c) requiring that Family Relationship Centres focus on quality advice, not simply quantity of parenting plans; (d) equipping staff to detect the signs of family violence and child abuse and manage violent clients; (e) ensuring that Family Relationship Centres do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, age, disability, gender or socio-economic disadvantage and are not used to advocate or encourage any particular political or religious agenda; (f) instituting a well-resourced and effective complaints process for people who have grievances with Family Relationship Centres or their staff; (6) demands that the Government immediately release accreditation and quality standards for Family Relationship Centres prior to mediation becoming compulsory; (7) notes that, while separating parents should be encouraged to settle their disputes without recourse to the Courts, litigation needs to be recognised and supported as a vital pathway for those cases involving family violence or abuse, entrenched conflict or intractable disputes; (8) notes that the Government needs to invest in and make public thorough, longitudinal research on: (a) the consequences of family law reform; (b) interaction between violence and family law; and (c) the need for a broad ranging parliamentary inquiry on violence in the community; (9) notes that the Government should, in the near future, conduct a review of how these changes work in practice, with particular consideration of the following issues: (a) the operation of the requirement to consult on ‘major long-term issues' (compared to the original recommendation from the Every Picture Tells a Story report limited to location); (b) the interaction of parenting plans and court orders: (c) the need to review Schedule 3 as soon as the assessment report of the Family Court's pilot of the Children's Cases Program is available, given that these changes are being made before that pilot is completed and evaluated; (10) notes the Government's failure to consider a National Commissioner for Children and Young People, who could provide a role developing expertise in supporting children in family law matters”. With this long list of issues I could speak for days on the changes that Labor would like to see and the many areas in which the government is taking positive steps, but time is against us. I do want to issue a final note of concern that Labor has in this general area of family law, and that is that the government is creating some false expectations about how family law is going to work under this bill. Although the government agrees with Labor, the original committees and all the processes that have assessed this proposal from the beginning that a presumption of equal parenting time is not the way to go, it is sending very mixed messages. One example of this is the change of the term ‘joint shared parental responsibility' to ‘equal shared parental responsibility'another one of those issues where the Attorney-General and I seem to have the same view but where the LACA committee has made a different recommendation. Responsibility for children is not a quantifiable thing that can be cut into two equal parts. Clearly what we are talking about is ‘joint' responsibility: an obligation for parents-whether together or separated-to make decisions that affect their children together. Changing this term, as the bill proposes, is clearly intended to muddy the waters, with the naive hope that the equal time advocates will not realise that the government disagrees with them on this issue. It may be that there are people in this House who think that we should just let this debate go through and not raise any concerns about this. But I am concerned that in family law-more so than in many other areasfalse expectations have a consequence. Firstly, a lot of nonresident parents will only feel more frustrated when they realise that the government has not given them the change they thought they were getting. It worries me that it is not the government but the family relationship centres that will bear the brunt of this frustration, just as the Family Court did in its early days. Secondly, in the other direction, some victims of family violence may develop the false view that they cannot stop their abuser from having contact with their children. I am advised by some service providers in the sector that this is already happening, mostly involving women who, despite their fears and concerns, feel that new laws mean they will have to accept equal time. Because we know that a large part of family law is about expectations and that the perception that the Family Court is biased against men affects the view that many men take into negotiations, the government needs to be particularly responsible about managing expectations and combating false perceptions. I worry that the Howard government is shirking this responsibility for political reasons, being too clever by half. Ultimately, that is not going to help Australian families. As I have indicated, although we have some significant amendments that we think will improve the bill and that we hope the government will support, Labor support the key principles involved in this package of family law reforms. We want mums and dads to love, care for and provide for their children and we want the law to support their doing that, even after family breakdown. Although the Attorney-General has tried to introduce partisanship to this debate with his frequent and, frankly, increasingly bizarre sprays in question time, there is bipartisan agreement on the important issues: encouraging shared parenting responsibility, encouraging nonlitigious resolution of disputes, allowing more flexible and less formal court procedures and so on. The amendments that Labor proposes will strengthen the family law system's capacity to deal with those cases where family violence is an issue. It may be a small number of cases across the whole number of cases that go through the family law system, but they are important cases and they are the cases that need our very careful attention are deserving of any protections that the law can give them. Our proposals do not undermine the fundamentals of the government's plan. Indeed, the House must remember that many of the amendments simply revert to the Attorney-General's original plan in the exposure draft he produced. I look forward to returning to the chamber in the third reading stage to debate those amendments in detail. When this happens I hope that the Attorney General can put aside his recent partisanship on this issue and work with Labor constructively to produce a family law system that truly meets the best interests of Australian children.",64
157,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Plibersek-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,73
158,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"O'Connor) (5.37 pm)The history behind the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005 goes back to the Murphy amendments to family law, a very dramatic affair which introduced an argument that the family courts should take into account all welfare payments before requiring any payment from the person then known as the non-custodial parent. As the cost of that escalated, we had the Howe legislation, which created the monster that is now known as the Child Support Agency and the idea of a set percentage of the income of non-custodial parents, as they were then known, for the support of children. Over time, that has been demonstrated to be impractical and grossly unfair. These matters arose following the submission of a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. The committee was bipartisan and it set down a strong series of recommendations which were then passed on and to government. There was a process thereafter which resulted in draft legislation-an exposure draft-being considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Because the committee is a standing committee of the parliament, it is one on which both sides were again represented. Included in the membership were the member for Lowe, the member for Chifley, the member for Denison and, I believe, the member for Gellibrand. After considering the original report and the draft legislation, it put forward a report with 56 recommendations, 51 of which were accepted by the government. The committee reported in August 2005 and the government's response was given in December 2005. It can hardly be said that the response was slow or delayed. There was only one dissenting report, by the member for Gellibrand. As seems to be occurring in this place, a person, possibly with shadow ministerial responsibility, is jumping up and driving policy for the Labor Party at a time when other members of that party either hold an alternative point of or have participated in a process to come to conclusions to enable this parliament collectively to resolve some quite tragic circumstances, including suicide, that have resulted from legislation well past its use-by date. Why is it that today, after those extensive processes over some years, the member for Gellibrand-on behalf of the Labor Party, as she claims, and in defiance of the recommendation supported by the member for Lowe, the member for Chifley and the member for Denison-now comes to the parliament and wants to rewrite the legislation in a significant fashion? What are the recommendations of the member for Gellibrand-the amendments she wants this parliament to pass? She wants to rewrite the provisions relating to family violence. She wants to virtually re-create the situation where family violence could block out access to the non-custodial parent-a thing that has been done time and time again. The legislation is quite specific. The government reforms protect children from the risk of violence or abuse by making them a primary factor to be considered in child custody cases. We do not subscribe to the view of the provision being abused-as occurs, unfortunately, in family breakdown, where a particular parent will make unsubstantiated accusations of that nature-as a means to frighten the courts and others from that minor risk that might occur in those cases of any violence whatsoever. It is a tough issue; it has been addressed. At this stage of the game, after all the consideration that has been given to the clause, it is inappropriate that it should be changed by amendment in this House and in the climate of this House. The member for Gellibrand wants to remove the prioritisation of a child's right to know both parents and a child's protection from family violence-a provision approved view by the committee. She wants to change that notwithstanding that it has been through these previous processes. The member for Gellibrand wants to reject the change from joint shared parental responsibility-and she just repeated that-to equally shared parental responsibility. She wants to change the word ‘equal'. That is exactly what these amendments are all about-equality between two parents who have decided to part ways, but in the interests of the children. As we all know, if the kids could take a vote, they would frequently prefer their parents to stay together. At that point in time that issue is beyond them. But in relation to the right of the parents to share in equal terms, the responsibility for the children should be one of the highest of the challenges. The member for Gellibrand wants to remove the provision allowing cost orders against persons who make false accusations of family violence. How silly is that? Of course people should be discouraged from making false accusations and of course there must be some sort of evidence available if family violence is in fact a matter for consideration and, as we say, a primary factor in the removal of the opportunity for the other parent to have equal access to the children of that marriage. The member for Gellibrand wants to remove the requirement for parents, before going to court, to first make a genuine effort to resolve their issues in mediation. She wants some guarantee that the funding will be there forever. No parliament can commit a future parliament. There is plenty of evidence of such arrangements being broken when those in opposition move to being in government. Nobody can bind a future parliament, so why ask for silly measures like that to be included to make a political point? Above all, when can the Labor Party, the opposition, get its act together? I repeat that the other. there has been a very significant process in arriving at this legislation today. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is a pretty logical place to send some draft exposure legislation. It is made up of people who have committed themselves. They typically have legal backgrounds. The chairman, Mr Slipper, whose electorate is Fisher, has a legal background-just like, I would imagine, most of the others. They went through it bit by bit. For all the hoo-ha we get about debating legislation in this place, the 20 minutes made available to us is pretty cursory. This is not the place where you get all the answers, unfortunately. That is why we have committees. That is why they have done their work. As I said, the committee put forward 56 recommendations, of which 51 have been accepted by the government and included in this legislation. All of a sudden, after all of that, because the member for Gellibrand feels that she has some other constituency to which she wishes to respond-and please note that I did not say ‘respond to'-the fact of life is that she wants to rewrite the bill. I am highly critical of that. Her colleagues-whom she has defied, considering the hard work that they have put in-should have some complaint back in the caucus. It is not good enough and this is not the sort of legislation that should require a political response. I might give the member for Gellibrand a bit of advice in her absence. She has not hung around for my advice. I have only been married for 47 years; I am no judge of these matters! By the way, what a statistical family mine is: of the four kids in my family, two are divorced and two are still married. I guess we have seen both sides of the argument in every respect. But you have to be very careful politically when you start to decide that you will support one sex against As I advised our party room today, my office is full of a lot of complaints from females. They are typically the mothers of noncustodial parents or the second wives of noncustodial parents. If you just want to think that this is a man-woman argument, you should be very careful. The fact of life is that this concerns legislation of years ago, put in by the Labor Party in response to previous legislation generated by the Labor Party. The reality is that the legislation was a failure. It has created a very arrogant organisation called the Child Support Agency and policies that will be addressed in this legislation-for instance, telling farmers in my electorate who have had three years of drought that the fact that they have not earned any money is not a matter for consideration. ‘You have the potential to make $100,000 a year on your farm, Mr Smith. That is what we will strike your contribution upon.' Then there is the situation where there was a family with two houses on a farm and the wife of the person involved decided to pack up and go to town away from the extended family-the grandparents and others. I found it just unbelievable. The fellow apparently went to try and reconcile things and the next thing the police were out there taking his rifle away from the homestead. Knowing the family involved, I do not think there was violence of any description. There is case after case where the existing legislation has failed people, failed children and been grossly unfair. As I said, I understand that suicides were virtually a weekly occurrence-and murder, and that is the most heart breaking: when children's lives were taken because of the frustration of parents wishing to take it out on the other party in the most horrible way. Today we are assessing how we might fix that and put some justice into it so that there is proper access and people feel confident from the beginning. Why all of a sudden during the debate should the member for Gellibrand start to sling off about government administrative incompetence and attack the Hillsong Church? Why chuck those nasty little bits in on a matter of such great tance? After the due bipartisan processes that have occurred in this matter, today she asks for the legislation to be rewritten? It is wrong and it is silly. It is one person trying up a constituency or give themselves some place in history. It should have been today that people in this parliament joined hands on this issue. If I can detour just slightly for a moment, we should also be doing so on taxation. You do not need to be Albert Einstein to know what is wrong with the tax system and to identify the best responses. We should be able to have the capacity on both sides of this House to fix it. It should not be an issue of saying, ‘Can I surf to victory at the next election on some aspect of it?' These are the big issues-families, taxation and the economy. They should not beas they are-a situation where someone says, ‘I can gain political advantage if I go out and try to change this, if I go to some particular group and say, “I did my best for you.”' We have been through that process. People from both sides of this parliament and the people I have quoted are amongst the most dedicated on this issue-the members for Denison, Chifley and Lowe. Why not take their advice and that of the coalition members and get on with the job? It is in my mind important that this legislation passes without these amendments. But there are still government amendments to be considered, and I naturally support them. Let me in brief say this: this legislative package will cost the taxpayer some $397 million and probably more. It will be money well spent to achieve the reforms that we want. Schedule 1 recognises the need for a cooperative approach to parenting. Yes, if you want to go your individual ways for whatever reason, think about the kids. Cooperate, get together impor- and do things. Under schedule 1: ... children have a right to have a meaningful relationship and know both their parents and ... parents continue to share responsibility for their to pick children after they separate. Might I say it is shared equally. It is no longer the case that we separate the sexes in employment, income or responsibility. I can point within my extended family to a housefather who has undertaken that role throughout the married life of that family with three children. In those circumstances, why is it that in past legislation and past legal practice we have differentiated? On schedule 2: Schedule 2 contains a range of amendments to strengthen the existing enforcement regime in the Act. Breaches of court orders are a major source of conflict and distress to all parties ... Of course people who are told by the courts, for instance, to give access to the other partner should obey that instruction and of course they should be penalised if they fail to do so. In fact, the division-that is, schedule 2-will provide: ... clearer and more accessible provisions that will make the whole Division easier to understand. That is a challenge for us as legislators every time. On schedule 3: The amendments in Schedule 3 provide for a less adversarial approach to be adopted in all childrelated proceedings under the Act. Who could criticise that? On schedule 4: Schedule 4 contains a range of amendments to the counselling and dispute resolution provisions in the Act to ensure the legislation supports the Government's policy of ensuring that separating and divorcing parents have access to quality family counselling and dispute resolution services so that they can attempt to resolve their disputes outside of the court. The amendment proposed by the member for Gellibrand removes the responsibility to attend mediation in a genuine fashion. In other words, she wants a situation where people on the advice of their legal counsel can go to mediation and say: ‘I'm not talking. I refuse to speak. I refuse to cooperate.' What a ridiculous situation. On schedule 6: This Division deals with the relationship between orders made under the Act that provide for a to spend time with a person, and family violence orders made under a law of a State or Territory protect a person from family violence. But it gives directions to state and territory magistrates as to how they might deal with those matters. Finally, on schedule 7: Schedule 7 repeals section 45A of the Act to enable the Federal Magistrates Court to also exercise jurisdiction for those property matters where the value of the property exceeds $700,000. It starts to become commercial and not fought out. It starts to be about property rights rather than a case of, ‘I'll get you.' It should be reasonable and it should be properly discovered. I reject the amendment proposed by the opposition. I doubt any reason for its being here, considering the processes that have preceded this legislation. I trust the parliament will do its job and come up with this bill as it has been agreed.",73
159,Ms PLIBERSEK,COMMITTEES,"I would like to speak today on the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. But first I want to address some of the things that the previous speaker, the member for O'Connor, said. He mentioned the tragedy of murders and suicides in families post separation. Indeed, the most dangerous time for a woman is just after she has left a relationship. In many instances that applies to children as well. It is something that we as a parliament need to take very seriously. Every week or every couple of weeks we read in the paper about another tragedy. Yesterday I read in the paper about a tiny baby and his mother burnt to death in the family home, and the coroner is investigating that incident. There have been a number of incidents recently that I perhaps should not speak of in any detail because they are still being investigated. To say that our automatic response to these tragedies has to be to change family child law to make it easier for parents who in the end are able to act in this way towards their to own children to have access to those children seems to me to absolutely defy logic. I understand that the member for O'Connor is talking about the frustrations that people experience post divorce, and I think those frustrations exist on both sides of a broken relationship, but to say that the solution to suicide and, in particular, to the murder of children is to make it easier for people to have access to those children really defies belief. On a slightly lighter note, I would like to say that 47 years of marriage is a marvellous achievement. I commend the member for O'Connor, and I particularly commend Mrs Tuckey. I am sure that they have been 47 very interesting years. The government has been tinkering with the family law system now for about a decade. Unfortunately, in my view there have been few real positive changes during this time. There has been a number of parliamentary inquiries and a number of government inquiries, particularly since the year 2000, that have responded to very strong feelings across the board in the Australian community about this issue. It is no wonder that these feelings are strong when you look at the shocking rates of divorce in the Australian community and the number of people who are affected, either directly through their own marriage breakdown or, as the member for O'Connor said, through witnessing the effect of the relationships of their children, friends, brothers or sisters. This bill to amend the Family Law Act is an attempt to make improvements to family law. In the end I expect that we will support the legislation as it is before us. I think wise, at the end of the day, because there are some improvements in the bill. But with the amendment that our shadow Attorney General has proposed this legislation could be a much better package. I really would urge the Attorney-General to give more detailed consideration to the amendment that the shadow Attorney-General has proposed, because I think that she has given a great deal of thought to this issue and that the proposal she has put before us is very sensible and addresses some of the very important issues that have been raised not just by members of parliament and expert groups such as the Family Law Council, the Family Court itself and the legal centres around the country but also by constituents that have contacted our offices and given us their views. The measures that I support in the bill are the measures that encourage both parents to take more responsibility for their children. Of course in an ideal world we do not leave equal parenting until divorce. We want parents-mothers and fathers-to take responsibility for their children from day one and to have as equal a relationship with their children as possible from day one. I support any notion that says mothers and fathers are important when it comes to bringing up kids. I also support provisions that create and promote alternatives to the legal system. I support the establishment of family relationship centres, although I am going to withhold my final decision on how well they are going to work until I see a bit more detail about what is proposed. I support any counselling, certainly after marriages break down-when it can help people get along and help them balance the competing demands of their children, property disputes and so on-but also, preferably, before marriages break down, when it can help people it is work out how to better communicate and how to balance the demands on them when it comes to their parenting responsibilities, their other caring roles and their work responsibilities. I think any one of us could benefit from a bit of professional advice from time to time about how to improve our relationships. I do not support some of the other measures in the bill, and I want to speak a little bit about those. First of all, I want to talk about the criteria for the establishment of the family relationship centres. It is extraordinary, isn't it, that with a committee of eight coalition backbenchers to oversee the development of the criteria you have got six marginal seat members out of those eight whowow!-all, except one, received a family relationship centre in their electorate. I do not know who the dummy was that missed out. I do not know how you miss out in a circumstance where you are the one putting the list together. In a situation where you have got a select group of people working out where the family relationship centres go, with very little transparency about how the decision is made, I do not think that the public can really have faith that the centres are going to the areas that need them most. It certainly looks like the government is more interested in pork-barrelling than in parenting. I am also concerned about the quality of the services that the new family relationship centres will deliver. The Attorney-General's family relationship centre information paper is loaded with styling tips for centre decor but pretty light on the details about service quality. For example, it makes clear that the centres should have: - a modern but not clinical setting, and - homely decor with soft lighting and bright (not dingy) colours and comfortable furnishings. I am always keen to get styling and interior design tips from the Attorney-General! But what I would appreciate even more is advice about how the quality control is going to work for family relationship centres, what sort of training staff will get in identifying and dealing with violence issues and how family relationship centres will deal with complaints-there is no complaints mechanism set out in the information paper. So a little bit less on the interior design and a little bit more on how the family relationship centres are going to work would be greatly appreciated. I am also extremely worried about the change in the definition when it comes to violence. The member for O'Connor made light of this change. It is a very significant change, in fact. In the bill the Attorney General seeks to amend the definition of ‘family violence' from its current subjective definition to what is being called an ‘objective definition'. The new definition means that a victim of violence must prove that their fear is reasonable. That is why it is called an ‘objective test'. It is a very different definition to the definition that the states use when they are dealing with violence issues. The states' definition is based on the behaviour of the perpetrator. I think that makes it much easier to be clear about a situation where a person might be fearing violence and why they would be fearing violence. We believe that the definition should remain unchanged. I note that the Attorney General, in the exposure draft, did not want to amend the definition of ‘family violence'. Perhaps he was right in the first place and he should go back to his original instincts on this. The Attorney-General's own department and the Family Law Council have advised against changing the definition of ‘family violence'. I think the Attorney-General would be wise to listen to his advisers. The Family Court, the biggest service provider in this area, also advises against changing the definition. I believe it is dangerous and unnecessary to change this definition. The problem is that it will make it more difficult for real victims of violence to prove real violence. I will give you an example of a constituent-let us call her ‘Jenny'-who is a client of a community legal centre in my electorate. Last year she finally left a long and very violent relationship. At the beginning of their relationship, her ex-husband was frequently violent but in the later years of their relationship the violence was less frequent. He was still very controlling and very abusive in other ways and did occasionally hit her but not as often as he did at the beginning of the relationship-in part, because Jenny, like most victims of violence, had become very adept at recognising the signs of what was coming and defusing the situation where she could. That meant that Jenny-likes tens if not hundreds of thousands of Australian women-walked around on eggshells, as would the kids. In any case, under the government's proposed ‘objective' definition of violence, it would be very hard for Jenny to prove the behaviour that she recognised as the early signs of a pattern of behaviour that was likely to escalate and lead to violencefor example, a look or the way her husband was speaking or something that she noticed in his pattern of behaviour that told her that, if things went along their usual path, she was in for it. Anyone looking at that from outside would find it very difficult to recognise what it was that Jenny found threatening in her husband's behaviour. How could you prove without the history and the context, without knowing the detail of that relationship, that Jenny had a reasonable fear of violence? The new proposed ‘objective' definition will apply to all provisions of the Family Law Act that deal with family violence. Many of the provisions are procedural but very important. Where there is violence, matters can be intensively case managed or fasttracked. Shuttle conferencing can be used. To lose those options when there is violence or a fear of violence would be a great loss. It is also important that the procedures be available to families where a parent has a fear of violence. They should be available where that parent feels a fear and should not be based on whether outsiders consider it reasonable for that parent to be fearful. The effect of an ‘objective' violence nition when it comes to procedures for compulsory mediation is also alarming. If Jenny cannot prove that her fear is reasonable, she may be forced to attend compulsory mediation with her ex-husband, whom she fears. However, mediation is based on two people who have equal bargaining power. If Jenny does not want to attend mediation-if she jacks up about the mediation, and the family relationship centre writes a negative report saying that she is uncooperative-it is not laid out anywhere in the legislation how she can object to that report and challenge the family relationship centre's negative assessment of her behaviour without knowledge of the background to the relationship. I am also strongly opposed to the provision that allows for cost penalties for ‘false' accusations. We are a country of 20 million people. Inevitably, sometime, somewhere someone has made an accusation of violence that was false-of course that is not beyond the realms of possibility-but we do not know how great is the problem. The Attorney-General is having that investigated. It might be better to wait for the Australian Institute of Family Studies, which has just been commissioned to do this research by the Attorney-General, to come up with its results. We do not know whether this is a big problem. I spoke to one of the representatives of the groups that claim that this is a problem. I asked him how he knew that false accusations have been made. He said, ‘Because the blokes in my group tell me they never did it.' So, ‘I'm innocent, Governor.' That is the only argument that people can put up against this suggestion of there being massive numbers of false accusations of violence in the community. What we do know is that there is a massive underreporting of violence, the reasons for which are varied. Undefifortunately, many of the reasons apply to underreporting of sexual assault as wellshame, fear of reprisals, lack of family support and inappropriate police responses. We know that, for years, women have not wanted to speak about violence in the home. They have seen it as being their fault. They have seen it as an issue for their family to deal with within the family. It is beyond me to imagine that, somehow, false accusations are a greater problem than this documented massive problem of underreporting. We know that family violence costs the Australian community $8 billion each year. Australian empirical research strongly suggests that false allegations are rarely made. The member for O'Connor might like to look at research by Hume and by Brown, Frederico, Hewitt and Sheehan on false allegations. These allegations have rarely resulted in the denial of parental contact. There is research on that by Rhoades, Graycar and Harrison and by Rendell, Rathus and Lech. In my view it would be much better if the Attorney-General waited for the research he has commissioned in this area. He could even look at the research that has already been done and address the problem of underreporting of violence rather than just assuming that, because there are a few people in the community who raise it in emails that he gets, there is a massive problem of false gations out there. I am also worried about what parenting plans will mean for Australian families. It is fantastic when couples come to an arrangement between themselves about how they deal with the kids post separation, and most families do that. Divorce is never a happy time. If you were happy, you would stay together. It is a miserable time for most people. But research shows that 94 per cent of families who file papers in the Family Court actually settle their disputes by agreement. The vast majority of parents know that it is the kids who suffer in divorce and they want to avoid that at all costs. Parents have been able to file consent orders or parenting plans with the Family Court without costly or drawn-out litigation, but the government does not like that approach. Instead, they want this approach of parenting plans which can be drawn up in family relationship centres and which will in fact trump previously made court orders. You might have a case that has gone on for three weeks with a children's advocate and lawyers at 50 paces and evidence produced about previous abuse or neglect-all the things that come out in a court case-and if someone gets bullied into going to a family relationship centre and writing down a parenting plan between the two of them at one of the tables at MCDonalds, that plan should not have more effect than previous agreements made through the Family Court. However, the parenting plan, which would not be registered with the Family Court and which will have been made without legal advice in a room at a family relationship centre, trumps the previous orders made by the court after a three-day to three-week hearing. We do not know how skilled the family relationship centre mediator will be. I hope that there will be skilled people there, but there is alleno guarantee of that. I am very concerned about this. Finally, with regard to the equal shared parenting responsibility, we want parents to have equal responsibility. But we need to put the best interests of the kids first, and equal responsibility does not automatically mean equal time. In the end, we will support this legislation because of some of the good measures in it, but I believe that if the Attorney-General took the advice of the shadow Attorney-General and listened to his own department, the Family Law Council of Australia and the Family Court, he would improve the legislation.

160,Mr FAWCETT,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak to the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. Firstly, I wish to make the point that this is a part of a holistic program that this government is putting in place to support families. This program looks not only at family law amendments but also at changes to the Child Support Agency and, as the member for Sydney has indicated, at the introduction of family relationship centres. These three elements working together are an investment in the future of families here in Australia. The context of these changes is important because, despite some of the accusations, the focus is very much on what is in the best interest of the child. We are looking here at the rights of the child-what they should expect from their family, whether that be an intact family or a family post separation. In that context, I want to come back to the family relationship centres quickly before I move on to the rest of this bill. I am disappointed that again the member for Sydney and the member for Gellibrand have tried to score cheap political points from an initiative which is genuinely intended to be for the benefit of Australian families. That was very apparent even in mid last year when the media were reporting on why there was a steering group set up. It was set up because of the interest of backbenchers who wanted to see the very thing Labor are talking about, which is that the implementation of these centres works out. I will give you a good example. When the member for Gellibrand was talking about FRCs, her focus immediately switched to what I call the tertiary end-looking at referral, counselling and mediation. The focus was very much on families that are going through the painful and damaging process of separating. One of the dangers for the FRCs is that, if they focus purely on that separating end, they will become known as divorce shops. Part of the real problem-and I am really pleased to see that the member for Sydney highlighted this-is that the proactive marriage and relationship education side will get lost. That is happening at the moment because the oil normally goes to the squeaky wheel and it is the people who are hurting who are demanding a lot of attention, and that is where a lot of the resources go. What we have found is that many people who look at the FRCs look at them purely in the context that the member for Gellibrand did, which is in the context of separating families, and they ignore the incredibly powerful work that FRCs can do in providing services to the vast majority of Australians who are not in that situation. It is really important that we look at Australian demographics. My friend the member for O'Connor-and I likewise applaud him and Mrs Tuckey for their marriage of 40-odd years-came out with what many people see as fact. He said that the divorce rate is 50 per cent. That is not the case. It is actually far lower than that. The figure of 32 per cent is often now bandied around as a result of work by the Institute of Family Studies, but even that is a figure which goes across a range of decades, looking at marriages and what the risk is of a couple separating over a period of time. If you look at the censuses taken in Australia from 1901 right through to 2001 you see a continual increase in the percentage of married people in Australia to around 50-odd per cent. There has also been an increase in the percentage of people who are either yet to be married or are widowed. People are delaying entry into marriage and people who are widowed are living longer, and so that percentage is getting larger. But the percentage of Australians who are divorced or separated is around the 10 per cent mark or lower. The actual figure is around two million people. That is a huge figure and there is a huge amount of hurt there. However, that also says that, if we are to prevent more people ending up there, we need to focus on proactively helping families to build stronger relationships so that they do not end up in the situation that this whole family law amendment bill is about. Part of the reason for the existence of the task force is to make sure that the implementation stays on track across the spectrum of measures. I would like to briefly address some of the other claims about the FRCs before I talk about the family law amendment bill. I believe this point is really important. I agree with members opposite who talk about things like KPIs and looking at performance measures that do not just turn these places into sausage factories. I fully concur with that, and that is why, if you read the operational framework, you will see that throughout it we do not just look at the number of parents who attend the course. The feedback is the number of parents who, after working with an FRC, report a positive improvement in the quality of their communication with the other partner post separation. We are not just talking about the number of parenting plans; we are talking about the number of parenting plans which are still being followed and are adding value at least a year after the parents have been to the FRC. Through the KPIs, it is not numbers; it is numbers and quality, and it is that quality aspect which we are very keen to see in there. For example, objective 3 specifically looks at the delivery of high-quality, timely, safe and ethical services through the FRC. So there is a focus on quality, because we recognise that just having the centres there not enough. They must be delivering a quality service to support intact families, whether they are just getting married, having their first kids or having teenagers-that is the phase of life I am in, and I have to tell you that none of us can do that without a bit of help and guidance at times-or whether it is people at the point where they are really struggling and need some assistance. The issue of competency has also been raised a number of times. I wish to reiterate, as I have before in this place, that one of processes of the task force is to engage with subject matter experts in industry who are working with families already around Australia-whether it is Indigenous people, whether it is in languages other than English or whether it is people looking at marriage counselling or mediation or people who are expert in screening for violence. One of the functions has been to draw together reference groups and steering committees to guide the skills council as they look at bringing together the framework which is going to outline the competencies and skills that people working in FRCs need. I would like to lay to rest the two accusations that have been made today: firstly, that the implementation is flawed because of a lack of detail-that is clearly not the case; and, secondly, I would like to rebut in the strongest terms the idea that the task force which the Attorney-General has set up is there for anything other than reasons of making these centres work for the benefit of Australian families. I reiterate again that the members in the task force have specifically had no role in making decisions on issues such as the locations of these centres. I wish that to be on the record yet again. While we would all like to see families stay together because that is clearly the best outcome for the children, based on the 2001 census we know that roughly 55,000 couples is a year separate and eventually go through divorce. This has a huge impact on the children and extended families. Whilst it is not desirable that people reach this point, the fact is that we need to make this process as manageable as we can and to get as much of the adversarial process out of it as we can. I would like to address a few of the key points that these amendments bring in. I particularly want to address the presumption of shared parental responsibility and the obligation on the courts, under these the amendments, to consider if equal time with both parents is reasonably practicable and in the best interests of the child. Many of the people who have spoken against these amendments have left out those last two parts: is it reasonably practicable and is it in the best interests of the child? This amendment provides the platform for the courts to consider whether the involvement of the other parent is something that will be of benefit to the child. Many of the claims that are against this are based around the premise that, before the separation, one parentnormally the father-did not spend equal time with the child. Therefore it will not work and it should not work afterwards and he should not even consider or hold out hope of having anything approaching equal time with the child. I think most people in Australia accept the fact that the mores of our society mean that there is a social contract that often-not in all families but often-one parent will take on the burden of working and one parent will take on the greater burden of the day-today hands-on care of the children. That does not imply that there is a difference in quality of relationship between those two people and their children. The attitude of both parties, and particularly the relationship between those parties, is critical to defining how good the relationship is between the parents and their children. I look at my own background and I see many service men and women who frequently have to work long hours and are away from their families, but what I also see are some of the best parents and best fathers I have known. They have good relationships with their wives and they have an attitude that says, ‘Where I possibly can, I am going to proactively invest in my relationship with my wife and my children.' Whilst the time may be limited, the quality of the relationship is outstanding. Obviously there are many people who, even though they have abundant time, do not make a priority of the relationship. I understand then why some of the angst occurs about whether they should have equal time after separation. The argument that says that before separation they did not have equal time and therefore they should not have it afterwards just does not withstand scrutiny. It is also important to see that the same people who argue that often say that quality time post separation is more important, so the non-resident parent-normally the father-should be happy with a couple of days a fortnight or maybe a week in the holidays, because it is quality that counts. If they really believe that, that undermines the premise of their first argument, which said that because the father was not there in equal quantity of time before separation he cannot possibly have a good enough relationship to make things work seeing more of the child afterwards. It is a self-defeating argument. I believe it is important that not only do both parents have an opportunity to invest in the lives of their children pre and post separation but, more importantly, they have an obligation and a responsibility. I throw out the challenge to the fathers of Australia to consider the balance of their lives and where they place their priorities, because dads have a fantastic opportunity to shape the culture and the quality of family life such that separation will never occur. They also have the opportunity to add tremendously to the development and growth of their children. I know that many fathers out there are doing that fantastically. Most of us are learning along the way, as we learn about our changing roles as fathers and husbands. There are some people who do need a fair bit of help. All of us can do with help, and some need a bit more than others. I also wish to address the measures in the legislation that look at domestic violencethe occurrence of it, the threat of it, the reporting of it and the misuse of it. The member for Sydney talked about a person called Jenny-a hypothetical person or perhaps another name for a person that she knewand was concerned that Jenny had a history of violence with her partner and would not be able to get the protection she needed. Again, I come back to the fact that in the proposed legislation the use of the word sonable' means that, where somebody does have a track record and they say that their partner has demonstrably used violence against them or their children and there are circumstances where this has occurred, that becomes a reasonable fear of violence. The legislation allows for exactly the case that the member for Sydney raised. The legislation also provides some defence against using the fear of violence as a very convenient excuse to short cut a number of other measures. I believe that in this change the checks and balances are there to protect women. The balance is also there to protect men from false claims of violence. I have to say at this point that there are times when men are the victims, not the perpetrators, of violence, and that needs to be recognised. Before I leave this point, I come back to another area where the FRCs have a vitally important role. As in so many areas of legislation, we react to the symptoms-in this case, violence-but we do not necessarily address the cause. Normally, family violence comes down to the role modelling that people have in their own family of origin, a lack of ability or awareness of how to communicate or how to resolve conflict. The importance of family relationship centres is that they will be another means for providing people with the life skills they need so that they do not have to resort to violence or, if violence has been in their family of origin, that they are provided with the awareness that that kind of conduct is destructive for them, their partner and their children and that they are given alternatives so that they can look at different ways of dealing with those problems. I am pleased to see, and I certainly support, in the amendments ways to reduce the level of bitterness of parties in disputes. The ‘rea- measures include mediation and parenting plans through the family relationship centres and the roll-out of what has been trialled through the children's cases programs in the Sydney courts where there is an inquisitorial rather than an adversarial process-the feedback from that has just been fantastic for both the participants and the judges involved. I welcome in these amendments the encouragement and direction to roll that program out across Australia. Schedule 2 looks at enforcement regimes. Much of the anger of certain groups in the community comes back to the continual and often vexatious breaches of court orders regarding access. This legislation provides the court with a range of options to better enforce access or parenting orders. Parallel to this are measures under the CSA changes, which were announced today, looking to remove some of the financial disincentive to both partners making that access work. I think it is important to note that the focus here is on the best interests of the child and the rights of the child to have a relationship with both parents. This means that both parents have a responsibility. The custodial parent has a responsibility to make sure that they provide the opportunity for the child to have access to the other parent and, equally important, the parent who has won through whatever process access rights to that child has a responsibility to make sure that they are there consistently for that child. In the case of a number of single parents that I know of, the other parent does not provide any input to the child and I have seen the devastating impact of that on those children. It is important to note in this legislation the encouragement for both the resident and non-resident parent to see that they have not only the opportunity but also the responsibility to have that contact, because the child is the one who has the right to have the contact and a meaningful relationship with both parents. In conclusion, it is important that the parliament recognises that the best interests of the child are served by a healthy, functional, loving and caring family environment where both mother and father remain in the marriage and provide such an environment for the children. It is important that we support bodies like the FRC, but it is also important that we acknowledge that marriage is not an agenda from a particular part of the community, as was inferred earlier by members opposite, but a social good. Many studies by demographers and social researchers in Europe, the United States and Australia demonstrate the physical and mental health benefits as well as the financial and educational outcomes for children who are raised in a stable, loving marriage. Not every marriage is perfect, and the whole process of working through difficulties often makes a relationship stronger and the children more resilient. Just because marriages are not perfect does not mean that the parliament should not publicly and frequently advocate and support it as an institution. Marriage is not an agenda of a particular part of the community. At some point in time, 72 per cent of our community express the desire to be married and supported. Christians, Hindus, Muslims, the Jewish community and many people who have no allegiance to a faith still recognise the value of marriage. So I believe it is not an agenda of one group but a social good that this government should support. For those who for reasons quite often beyond their control do not find themselves in a position to follow through for the 47 years that the member for O'Connor has in his marriage, this legislation provides some significant and welcome changes that will ease the process of the separation that does cause so much pain to so many families. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ripoll) adjourned. Referred to Main Committee",81
161,Mr BARTLETT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I move: That the bill be referred to the Main Committee for consideration. Question agreed to. NA BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 February, on motion by Mr Nairn: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Kelvin Thomson moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for allowing Ministerial standards and accountability to decline at the same time as Ministerial salaries are increasing”.",86
162,Mr SLIPPER,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"At the outset I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Wakefield on his very thought-provoking contribution on the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. I found it particularly interesting, and I believe it was a valuable addition to the debate in this place. When I was interrupted last night by the adjournment debate, I had virtually finished my contribution on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2005. The bill itself is not a controversial bill. A bill of similar form enters the parliament each year. Usually, both sides of politics support this bill because it is a sensible bill which provides a mechanism that allows for the allocation of the additional remuneration that is required to meet additional ministerial salaries. The opposition has sought, through the amendment, to politicise this debate, and that is a matter somewhat lacking in virtue, in my view. I think this bill, being a machinery bill, is worthy of a speedy passage. When I look at what we do not pay our Prime Minister, our Treasurer, our senior ministers and other ministers, I think that at some stage some government in Australia will have to grasp the nettle and redress the situation where heads of departments are, in some cases, paid two, three or four times the amount of salary paid to the minister in charge of that department. I am not suggesting that those senior public servants are well paid by corporate standards, but someone at some stage will have to look at ministerial remuneration. I know the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister and other senior ministers would work for virtually nothing if that were permitted, but equity determines and demands, in my view, that people who do have that high level of responsibility should receive a remuneration commensurate with that responsibility. When one looks at what some of the chief executive officers of Australian companies receive today and what the Prime Minister does not receive, one clearly sees there is some obvious lack of balance. This bill will ensure that the Ministers of State Act 1952 continues to have the capacity it needs to meet the remuneration requirements of the government to ensure that ministers in fact receive the salaries and other remuneration that ministers under the law are currently entitled to. On that basis, I am very happy to commend the bill to the House.",86
163,Mr MELHAM,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2005 and also to particularly address my comments to the second reading amendment moved by the member for Wills, which reads: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for allowing Ministerial standards and accountability to decline at the same time as Ministerial salaries are increasing”. The explanatory memorandum to the bill, under the heading ‘General outline', states: This bill amends the Ministers of State Act 1952 to increase the limit on the sum appropriated from the Commonwealth Consolidated Fund in 2005/6 and beyond in respect of the salaries of Ministers of State. The increase is necessary following a determination of the Remuneration Tribunal with effect from 1 July 2005 that increased the base salaries of all Senators and Members. The additional salaries of Ministers of State are set as a percentage of the base salaries of Senators and Members, so when the base reference point increases for Senators and Members, so too do the salaries of Ministers. And, under the heading ‘Financial impact statement', it states: The effect of the amendment is to increase the total sum available to be appropriated for Ministerial salaries by $400,000 in financial year 2005/2006 and beyond. I do not bemoan ministerial salaries, or indeed parliamentary salaries, but I think they need to be looked at in globo, because there are a lot of benefits that flow with them. Some years ago we had a celebrated debate that concentrated on superannuation. I must say that, from a personal view, it has quite wrongly resulted in a marked differentiation between the salaries of newer members who were elected at the last election and existing members. It is my view that there are a lot of other things that could have been concentrated on which were let through the net. If you pay people and you pay them properly then they also have to be accountable, as the second reading amendment says. In the last number of years, we have seen ministers who have not been accountable to the extent that they should have been. A very interesting publication was produced by the Parliamentary Library, called That's it-I'm leaving. It traced resignations of ministers-some forced, others not forced-way back to 1901. There were a couple of resignations in the Fraser period. On 20 April 1982, the Hon. Michael MACKellar, the member for Warringah, resigned as Minister for Health over his non-payment of duty on a colour TV set he imported and the submission in his name of an incorrect customs declaration form. The Hon. John Moore, the member for Ryan, resigned as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs on 20 April 1982 over deficiencies in his handling of the payment of duty on the colour TV set imported by the Minister for Health, Mr Michael MACKellar. They were but two of the resignations throughout the period, but there were appropriate standards applied-as there should be, because, when you are in public office and receiving public money, in my view there needs to be a proper level of accountability. In the first couple of years of the Howard government, which this week celebrates 10 years, we saw the forced resignation of five ministers and two parliamentary secretaries in the years 1996 and 1997. Since then, there has been zip. Basically, the shutters went up and, irrespective of the merits of particular cases, we have seen a redefining of ministerial accountability. That does none of us any good. I have an old-fashioned view of accountability and propriety. It was fascinating to read about a number of ministers in the early years resigning because of differences within cabinet about their policies, and other ministers being forced to resign in relation articles that were published that were seen to be in breach of the position of the then government. That is all in that wonderful publication from the Parliamentary Library. So, when it comes to the Ministers of State Amendment Bill and remunerations, I have no problem in supporting increased remuneration to ministers, but we need to not have a shifting set of values when it comes to ministerial responsibility, because that diminishes us all. The other thing that I think we need to look at, as members of parliament and as ministers, is proper savings to offset some of these salary increases. We demand productivity increases of the general communityand, indeed, in negotiations over their salary packages under the new regime, many workers in this country will be required to forfeit standards and conditions that they have held over a long period of time. Yet, as members of parliament and, indeed, as ministers, we have seen-I will have had 16 years in this place next month, on 24 March, and I have seen it-year in and year out, remuneration or entitlements creeping up and up. The only time there was a retrograde move was the one I mentioned earlier in my speech, to do with parliamentary superannuation. That was an easy one for some members of the community and some on our side, I concede, to go after, but I think-with the greatest of respect-that it was the wrong thing to go after. I have no problem with proper community standards applying to us, but the nine per cent, in my view, is below the community standard. Fifteen per cent is more appropriate for the newer members, and we will see what transpires over time in relation to that. There is one entitlement that ministers and former members have that I think should be withdrawn immediately. I am only speaking for myself here; I am not speaking on behalf to of the opposition or the Labor Party, but these are some of the chestnuts and some of the things that I have a bee in my bonnet over. I think that, if they were looked at, they would give us more credibility. That entitlement is the gold pass for former members for parliamentary travel. For the January-June six-month period of 2004, that cost taxpayers $397,000. From July to December 2004, it was $497,000. From January to June 2005, it was $557,000. And, as I said, this appropriation to do with the bill before the House is for $400,000 in a financial year. I cannot see why members of parliament or ministers, if they serve a particular period of time, should have a life gold pass ad infinitum for themselves or for their widows and spouses. I think it is an anachronism that diminishes all of us. I have no problem with former prime ministers-I put them into a separate category-some of whom are obviously required to travel the country because of their former position. In my view, they should continue to be able to travel on life gold passes. But if I am elected at the next election, which will be my seventh term in this place, I will be entitled to travel till day I die-25 trips a year at taxpayers' expense. What for? What other employer is required to pay for continuing travel entitlements for their employees? I can see an argument where ex-ministers might have to discharge their functions, so you make an allowance in relation to some of this. Or you might have a celebration within parliament where you want to bring former members together. But even then I have a query on that. I think it is an indulgence that we have been given that is not deserved. So, when we talk about the ministers of state and their salaries-salaries for the Prime Minister, for ministers and indeed for backbenchers-I have no problem in altering their salaries and at the same time getting rid of these lurks and perks and still bringing in savings for the members of the public. I think it has all been one way. When I first came into parliament the printing entitlement for members of parliament was $25,000, I think. It is now $125,000 per year. There was a disallowed instrument in August 2003 where the government wanted to increase it to $150,000 and, indeed, roll over 45 per cent of it. In my view, it is unconscionable. We do not need that amount of money to communicate with our electorates. But let's say we do. What I think is highway robbery and extremely unconscionable is that, if I seek re-election as a member of parliament, I can use that printing allowance for my re-election. We are talking about many millions of dollars here. In any given financial year the possible expenditure by members of the House alone is $18,875,000. My view is that at the very minimum that should not be able to be used for re-election purposes. Indeed, quite frankly, I think an amount of $50,000 would be reasonable. We also have a situation where our $28,000 the postage allowance has now increased to 50c per elector, which takes me from about $27,000 to $42,000, and 100 per cent of that can be rolled over. In my view, what we are doing is corrupting the system. We are giving such an advantage to sitting members of parliament. At the moment the government have that advantage. Eventually they will get tossed out. That time will come; we do not know when-the sooner the better for some of us. Then the advantage will be Labor's. In the state of Queensland, where the opposition only has six out of 28 members, we are really going down the American path of entrenching incumbency unless a big swing is on. The Ministers of State Act 1952 requires increases to the limits when they are appropriated out of the consolidated revenue. There is nothing unreasonable in what the parliament is considering this evening, but overall what we have to do, if we are to maintain credibility, is look at these other entitlements that we get as members of parliament, ministers of state or whatever. I do not want to bag the VIP jet and the jet fleet. The thing I am filthy on is that when the government upgraded the fleet they purchased smaller jets, which meant that parliamentary committees could not use those services to go to remote and rural Australia for parliamentary committee inquiries. Basically, by the way those jets were ordered, they booted off backbenchers and backbench committees. I think there is a real problem here, which is why there is such cynicism in the community. We have seen the debate over the AWB, where the government has used its majority in the Senate to decline to allow certain witnesses to be cross-examined by a parliamentary committee. The second reading amendment to this bill talks about not allowing ministerial standards and accountability to decline at the same time as ministerial salaries are increasing. They are linked. This is not a situation that pertains just to the Liberal Party. The concerns that I have outlined this evening could equally be applied to a Labor government, because there is no doubt that in our period in office we changed entitlements to suit. I saw an increase in entitlements under the Labor government. I am not sitting here being Scrooge and saying, ‘No entitlements, no increases.' I think there has to be a rationale and a justification because the separation of powers is important. It is important that our ministers, our politicians and our courts are held in high esteem. We have one of the best democracies in the world, but we are not seeing the wood for the trees. Over a period of time we have allowed some entitlements and benefits to creep into the system, which has led to cynicism by ordinary members of the public. I am not critical of the salaries of members of parliament or ministers. They are not high by professional standards. If you were a successful barrister, doctor or businessman you could earn a lot more. But that is not necessarily of itself a justification for you to automatically get a salary commensurate with those professions. The other thing that is interesting is that we do have different qualities in our approach to our jobs. There is no benchmark for what constitutes a good or a bad minister. I can remember during the days of the Labor government the former Attorney-General reminiscing with me that his job was to keep out of the news and to keep the cabinet on the rails in terms of what it was able to do, what it wanted to do and what it could properly do. That is why I think we are losing the battle at the moment of the operation of and ministers' accountability during question time in the parliament. I have seen a decline. I can remember vividly as if it were yesterday the current Prime Minister telling us that he was going to raise the standards. There was criticism of the former PM because he only wanted to come to parliament two days a week. In the mother parliament, Prime Minister's question time is only on one or two days a week and for a limited period as well. It is not necessarily about the amount of time you spend in this chamber but about the quality of time you spend in this chamber. When I look at the replays of question time, I see a lack of accountability. The opposition's conduct is not without blame either. Former Prime Minister Keating did not want parliamentary question time televised because he was frightened that it would turn the people in this place into a rabble-and it has. There is no accountability at question time. There is evasion and a whole series of things. I believe there should be more power in the Speaker to deal with ministers, to bring them to account and to require them to answer questions. This place is not being taken seriously. It is used as an evasion by ministers. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. It is worthy of support.",87
164,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2005 and in particular the amendment moved by the member for Wills. In doing so, I will probably emphasise the amendment in my contribution. The fact is-and the member for Banks has clearly outlined the concerns I have in the mainthat there has been a recent decline in the principles of ministerial accountability. There is no doubt that since the election of the Howard government in 1996 there has been a change of heart by the Prime Minister and the government about the way in which it, as an executive government, wishes to handle breaches of ministerial responsibility and accountability, and this has led to a deep cynicism and scepticism in the community about the role of people in this place. That is a great shame. As the member for Banks indicated, there has been a whole host of ministers since Federation who have resigned from the ministry. As I understand it, the first resignation that occurred was in 1903 by Charles Kingston. He did so as a result of a difference of opinion with the executive government on policy. There have been a number of ministers who have resigned on fundamental policy grounds in moments of conscience. It occurred in the period when prescription was being proposed and throughout our relatively brief history as a nation. There is you look at some of the resignations from the executive government of ministers who believed they were in breach, say, in the 1970s and 1980s, you would find what we would regard as technical breaches of Westminster principles of ministerial responsibility and, therefore, cause for their resignations, but some of them pale into insignificance when compared with the failure of ministers in the Howard government to take responsibility for such breaches. Mr Hunt interjecting",91
165,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I guess the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage wants to debate this issue. He can get up after me and defend his ministers. I am sure he willprobably starting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He can defend his ministers all he likes, but the reality is that there have been breaches. Since 1998 the Howard government has chosen to turn a blind eye to those breaches. Any of the members here who take any interest whatsoever in these matters would know that between 14 October 1996 and 26 September 1997-less than a 12-month period-there were no fewer than seven ministers who resigned from the Howard ministry for alleged improprieties in expense claims and travel expenditure. I think people generally know what that was about. It must be difficult to come into this place and aspire to such high office and then have to make the decision, as a matter of honour and in abiding by long held principles, to tender your resignation. But in all of those cases-I will not name the particular ministers-they terminated their office and effectively offered their resignation to the Prime Minister in good faith, and I think they did so in good honour. They followed many others prior to the election of the 1996 government who also resigned for breaches of minno doubt, if isterial responsibility. What seems to have happened since then is a blatant disregard for any accountability by ministers for such important events including, of course, the ‘children overboard' affair. It seems now-at least since I was elected to this place in 2001 and some would argue from the commencement of the term previous to my election to this place-that there is a government that refuses to accept these principles. As I say, there was no doubt that significant matters arose from the ‘children overboard' affair. I accept that the then Minister for Defence, Peter Reith, during the election campaign was no longer running for office-indeed, the parliamentary secretary at the table was his successor-but there is no doubt in my mind and, indeed, in the minds of the majority of Australians, I would say, that he acted dishonestly when he confirmed that they were photos",91
166,Mr HUNT,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I would ask that an accusation of dishonesty be withdrawn, even though it is against a former member of this House, because it is an allegation about his conduct whilst in the House.",92
167,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,Perhaps the member would like to rephrase his statement.,92
168,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I am happy to so that we can get on with the substance. Peter Reith, the former minister, asserted what we now know to be a lie. He asserted a fact when it was found to be untrue.",92
169,Mr HUNT,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is simply moving from one formation to a worse and more accusatory formation. I would see the use of the word ‘lie' as almost a direct defiance of your ruling.",92
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Under standing order 89, I think it could be deemed to be offensive and I would ask the member to use parliamentary language.",92
171,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"As I said, I am happy to withdraw the assertion on the basis that the alleged lie took place while the minister was in office. It is not surprising that the successor of Minister Reith wants to defend the indefensible by jumping to his feet in these matters. The obvious fact is that we know now that it was untrue that children were thrown overboard and the assertions made by the minister were found to be incorrect. Clearly, as a result of those assertions, the government gained politically. There was no accountability; there was no attempt by the government to account for its behaviour in that regard. There was no attempt by the Prime Minister to account for his repeat of the assertions that we now know were based on either incorrect assertions or dishonest statements made by whomever. The fact is that this government has probably, at least from the kids overboard on, allowed such matters to be perpetuated for political gain. I was very interested to read the editorial of the Australian today which correctly said: But the Howard Government did have something to gain. This is with respect to the kids overboard. The editorial also said: Then defence minister Peter Reith and immigration minister Philip Ruddock knew an electionwinner when they saw one and turned the “children overboard” affair into an anchor for the Government's border protection policy. As evidence emerged that the incident never happened, ministers and minders all ducked and dived for cover. To their underlying disgrace, mandarins who should have served the public interest, not the Prime Minister's electoral ambitions, helped them. That is from the Australian newspaper today, which quite rightly points to the fact that the level of honesty, the level of accountability, had dropped from that moment on. The Australian concluded on this matter by saying: The Government's behaviour in the children overboard affair looks no less disgraceful now than it did back then-however the Prime Minister seeks to spin it. I think the Australian newspaper is quite correct when, in today's edition, it basically says the Prime Minister is more about spin than principle and more about providing an opportunity for him to gain electorally rather than being honest with the Australian people. I think it is important to note that this government has indeed used spin rather than honesty in its approach. I applaud the Australian newspaper for today making that point very clear when it suggests that the Howard government, indeed the Prime Minister himself, has been attempting to revise events of the ‘children overboard' affair in his favour when we know that it was used dreadfully and was abused. People who found themselves in a very dangerous situation were vilified by this government in order for the government to gain electorally. I cannot imagine anyone wanting to associate themselves with the behaviour of Peter Reith, except for the parliamentary secretary at the table, and the fact is that the Australian got it right today by effectively saying that the government acted in a disgraceful manner when it came to its behaviour with the ‘children overboard' affair. I think it is important to note, though, that the first term of this government showed that the Prime Minister's promise that there would be an adherence to ministerial responsibility was in fact the case. In less than 12 months we saw seven ministers resign as a result of breaches of ministerial responsibility, but from that time on, as the member for Banks indicated earlier, they have put up the shutters. They said: ‘We can't really have the government bleed over matters as feeble as Westminster principles of ministerial accountability, so we'll now deny when we make mistakes or, rather, we'll blame somebody else for anything that occurs.' We can see that with the Australian Wheat Board scandal. Here is a situation where it is clear from the evidence that the government was aware that kickbacks were being made to the Saddam Hussein regime, that $300 million worth of bribes were made under their watch-under the watch of the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their department. The government chooses either to ignore that or to blame someone else. If we are to blame anyone, they suggest that we should blame the public servants. Something as significant as the largest bribe in Australia's history going to a regime such as that of Saddam Hussein is a matter of such historical significance that it beggars belief that this government does not accept any responsibility for its actions or its behaviour in this regard. That is why I think the amendment moved by the member for Wills is quite correct in condemning the government for allowing standards to decline at the same time that salaries for ministers are increasing. It is not just about accountability; it is about the way in which the public perceives this place and our role as their representatives in the House of Representatives. The government has shown no concern for that. Since 1998 we have seen an absence of accountability by this government. Even when matters of such significance, such outrageous breaches of ministerial responsibility, do occur, we see no action taken by the Prime Minister to force his ministers to resign and no honour, in my view, for ministers if it would not cause them to tender their resignations in these cases. That decline leads to cynicism and scepticism amid the community, which brings dishonour on this place. So, whilst we support the bill and support that an independent tribunal should of course measure the appropriate increase for minister's salaries, the government would do well to consider their neglect of the long held principles of the Westminster system in this place and to return to some level of honesty and honour and ensure that when something improper occurs, such as the $300 million bribes paid in the Australian Wheat Board scandal, they take some responsibility themselves. They should not try to pretend it was someone else and they should not by virtue of a limited terms of reference of a commission avoid proper scrutiny. They should effectively say, ‘We have done the wrong thing here,' or, ‘Something has been done under our name that has shamed this nation, shamed this parliament and shamed this government, and we will attend to that. We will atone for those failures and we will, in the case of the minister or ministers responsible, expect their resignations.' That has not happened and, as a result, there is a high level cynicism towards this government. Until the Prime Minister changes his ways and his approach to ministerial responsibility it can only get worse.",92
172,Mr MCMULLAN,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I support the amendment moved by the member for Wills to the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2005. In this debate I want to refer to a slightly different matter in tion to those matters raised by the member for Wills which I just heard so ably outlined by the member for Gorton. What I want to refer to more is the monumental double standard reflected in this bill whereby the government is applying one rule for itself and one rule for others in Australia. I do accept and support the thrust of the amendment of the member for Wills and the comments that have been made in support of it about the appalling standard of performance by many ministers. I want to, in endorsing those remarks, point to it in a slightly different context. It is the standard argument of this government, when it relates to the incomes of every other person who works for a living in this country, that salary increases without productivity increases are inflationary. The government applies that rule to everybody else but not to itself. More particularly, I want to refer to the double standard of how this increase has been agreed. I agree with the process, but I think it is shameful that we here are almost the only people to whom this process now applies-that is, we get an independent tribunal to award a salary increase to us but ordinary Australian workers will no longer be eligible to have that happen to them. We have passed a law that says, ‘What occurs for all of us cannot apply to any of you'. We can have an increase awarded annually as determined to be fair by an independent tribunal-and I reinforce that I support the bill because, for ministers, that is the proper of process-but nobody else in Australia can have that. Obviously it will be argued in response that this is a special case, and it is, but it is preposterous to suggest that it is the only special case in Australia. The Workplace Relations Act no longer allows special cases to apply to other Australians, only to us here and, in particular in this bill, to ministers, including to the minister who came in addihere and said that tribunals should not be allowed to set the wages of other Australians. It is the most monumental double standard. I would use a stronger word, but I understand the precedents with regard to propriety in language in this place, so I will not say what is the obvious word. I will simply say that it is applying one standard to itself and a different standard to other people. It is a double standard because, if there is a special case that says you cannot expect ministers to have individual contracts based on the quality of their performance and their value to the agency for which they work and therefore we need to have a special tribunal, we could at least make an equally powerful special case for firefighters, for police officers and for emergency workers. We do not want them negotiating individual contracts when the central element of what the community wants is for them to work together as a team. We do not want them engaging in the normal industrial relations hassle because we want them available, when the emergencies arise, to assist us. And we want them to be well paid because we want them to continue to provide the indispensable services they provide. But they do not constitute a special case under the Workplace Relations Actonly ministers of this government do. Then we get to the other element of the double standard, which is that this is a collective agreement, common to every minister in exactly the same terms. Some of the terms, I suspect, determined by the tribunal-not covered by this act but determined by the tribunal-would actually not be allowable matters for any other worker to have in their agreement. But let us put that to one side. I suspect the minister would probably intervene to prevent agreements that would include some of these matters. But, dealing with the things that are explicitly covered by this bill, we are saying that it is okay for every member of parliament-and in relation to this bill every minister in this government-to have common terms and conditions to their employment so they all get paid exactly the same and get exactly the same conditions in every way but that it is not okay for ordinary Australian workers to have that. They have to have individual contracts which they negotiate with their employers. I would like to suggest that maybe the ministers who thought that was such a terrific policy when they all sat around the cabinet table and voted for it should have to front up to the Prime Minister and ask, ‘Who's prepared to do the most for the least?' We all know they do not want to do that, because we all know that the member for Wentworth would outbid them all-he would probably pay to do the job, and not everybody could afford to compete with him. But that is what is being asked of every other Australian worker. They have to front up and negotiate how much they are prepared",94
173,Mr HUNT,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"It's a bit of a cheap comment, Bob.",95
174,Mr MCMULLAN,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"No, it's a very expensive comment.",95
175,Mr HUNT,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"No, it's an easy one to make.",95
176,Mr MCMULLAN,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"It is true. If I have offended the member for Wentworth-which I do not think I have-I certainly did not intend to do that. That was designed to be a light-hearted aside. If I have offended him, I apologise. I am sure I have not, but I certainly did not wish to offend the member for Wentworth, who is as entitled to be a minister as anyone else, notwithstanding his personal circumstances. Being poor or wealthy should not be a factor. I do not think I reflected on him, and I certainly did not intend to. I am sure he would not take it like that. But, if the parliamentary secretary thinks I may have, I will certainly make clear that I did not intend to.",95
177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I did not interpret it as a reflection on the minister; otherwise, I would have pulled you up.",95
178,Mr MCMULLAN,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I am sure you would have. I appreciate that. Anyway, if the parliamentary secretary thought that was a possible interpretation, I hasten to make it clear that that was not my intention. It was a lighthearted aside in what is otherwise a serious point-that every other Australian worker would have to front up to negotiate who was prepared to do the most for the least but that ministers do not have that rule applied to them. I do not think they should have, but I think we ought to have some decent application of common standards and principles. What we apply to ourselves we should apply to others. I think that is a pretty good principle. I had and retain what was around this place the unpopular view that the changes to the superannuation provisions for members of parliament were correct-not because they are without criticism, not because they are perfect but because they are applying to members of parliament the same principle that applies to other Australians. We should apply the same rules to ourselves that we seek to impose on others. That cannot be exactly the case because we do not do exactly the same thing as others. I think more than a decade ago there was an attempt to tie members' salaries to a particular category in the Public Service so that the general principle that applied to others outside the parliament applied to us in the terms of a determination of income. That has not been able to be applied absolutely because of the changes in the way Public Service salaries have been set since that time-that common benchmark, to some extent, evaporated-but the general principle still broadly applies. And, in my view, the more it can apply, the better it is. So I feel very strongly-not that there is anything wrong with the provisions of this bill; like all other members of the opposition I will vote for this bill, as it is a bill flects the fact that ministers' salaries are determined by an independent tribunal, as they should be-and deplore the fact that the salaries of the ministers who have barefaced brought in the bill should be determined in common by an independent tribunal and they should get over the years decent sized pay rises as a result while at the same time lowpaid workers should have to go to the Fair Pay Commission and get what the Fair Pay Commission and the government expect to be a significant reduction in the rate of increase and that ordinary workers should not have access to such a tribunal or to such collective agreements. I come back in conclusion-I did promise both the minister and the member for Grayndler that I would speak for only 10 minutes-that, in support of the amendment of the member for Wills, I sometimes do look across in amazement at the lack of performance of many on the front-bench. I think some of those people on the backbench on the government's side must shake their heads and ask, ‘How is it that these people are there ahead of me?' Mr Albanese-Poor Greg.",95
179,Mr MCMULLAN,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"We have already had our little discussion and I do not want to go into that any further-nor with the parliamentary secretary who is about to take his place. But, over the years, the allocations have been extraordinary and, on the basis of performance based pay, some of them would have had to give their money back. I do not think the Prime Minister is quite as fond of the classics as some of our previous prime ministers, particularly Prime Minister Whitlam, who used to quote them somewhat more. But, if my recollection is correct, it was Sophocles who said: To lay hands on victory is to hold a sweet possession. A reputation for justice can come later. For that renow, give yourself to shamelessness. That is what we are seeing reflected in the collapse of ministerial standards. That is not what the Australian people expect from us as their representatives in a democracy. This bill, and the amendment to it, has facilitated an important discussion about ministerial standards. However, I want to emphasise a slightly different point while endorsing that discussion: the monumental double standard in the way our salaries are dealt with-in particular, the salaries of ministers, which we are dealing with today-compared to those of ordinary Australian workers in much less powerful positions who have to fend for themselves without the benefit of collective agreements or tribunals. It is a bill that to pass but, as the bill relates to industrial relations, the principles underpinning it should be applied to all Australian workers and not just to ministers in the government.",96
180,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"Grayndler) (7.31 pm)I am very pleased to support the amendment to the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2005 moved by my colleague the member for Wills. It is appropriate that we in this House should be scrutinising the matters contained in this amendment at this particular time in history-the 10th anniversary of the election of the Howard government on 2 March 1996, the same day I was elected to this House-because, after 10 long years of the Howard government, there is arrogance and incompetence right across the show. We have the ongoing AWB saga. We have now had more than 21 documents raised by the opposition in question time. Day after day, ministers are being questioned about how they could sit by and allow $300 million to be paid in kickbacks from the AWB to the Saddam Hussein regime at the same time as Australia was preparing to go to war against that regime. An Australian government can make no more serious decision than to send our men and women to war. We made that decision based upon the lie that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. We now know that we not only made that commitment on the basis of a lie but at the very same time were funding the regime to the tune of $300 million. Four new cables were today raised in parliament and the Minister for Foreign Affairs conceded not only that he had been briefed on the documents but that he had read them himself. Those documents outlined very clearly, way back in January 2000, some three years before the war began, the clear concerns that existed about allegations of kickbacks to the Iraqi regime in contravention of UN sanctions against that regime. needs What was the government's response? It was to ask the AWB, ‘Are you doing anything wrong?' When the AWB said, ‘Oh, no,' that was essentially it; that was the investigation of the government. That was symptomatic of this government's approach to public policy. When it comes to the Prime Minister's code of conduct, we saw at the beginning of the process a number of ministers-John Herron, Jim Short, Brian Gibson, Geoff Prosser and others-having to fall on their swords and resign. Peter MCGauran also had to resign, but he made a comeback. He is still a member of the National Party-for the time being. Over a period of time, the Prime Minister's standards have disappeared. We have had scandals involving Michael Wooldridge, Wilson Tuckey and Richard Alston. We had travel rorts and we had balaclavas on the waterfront. We had Stan Howard and National Textiles. We had the telecard affair concerning Peter Reith and of course the children overboard affair. I would ask all Australians to read David Marr and Marian Wilkinson's book Dark Victory because that clearly outlines the symptomatic way in which the government was prepared not only to vilify and abuse asylum seekers but also to misuse the Department of Defence in a way which completely abrogated the independent way in which Defence should operate. Even as late as this week the Prime Minister was still attempting to say maybe they scuttled the boat. Of course that was not true. That was not found. It is quite clear that the whole basis of the children overboard affair was that once again this government was prepared to put its political interest above the national interest. That comes through the Department of the Environment and Heritage, which I have responsibility for as shadow minister, and that comes through on the subject of the management of water issues, which I also have responsibility for. This government is so drunk with power that it silences dissent and stifles debate. It controls both houses of parliament so it thinks that we have a oneparty state-accountability goes out the window. A recent Four Corners program raised some very serious allegations that senior CSIRO scientists are being silenced on climate change issues. Australia's top scientists are being gagged from saying we need greenhouse gas emission targets. They cannot even say that environmental refugees will be an issue when Pacific island nations flood because of climate change. That is contrary to specific advice given to the government by the department. On 5 January this year, when Labor released its policy on a Pacific climate change strategy, the response of the government was: ‘Let's just hope it never happens'-quite contrary to the specific advice that it had been given. It is a tragedy that CSIRO scientists are operating in a climate of fear where anything cates that they disagree with current government policy is censored. Leading CSIRO scientist Dr Barrie Pittock was expressly told he could not talk about climate change mitigation in dealing with rising sea levels in the Pacific. One of the world's leading climate change scientists, Dr Graeme Pearman, was gagged because he said we need greenhouse gas emission targets and we need carbon trading to help avoid dangerous climate change. The Age reported last week, on 20 February, that the government had suppressed a key chapter of its landmark Climate change: risk and vulnerability report. The report has number of chapters outlining the threats to Australia-the threat of a decrease in rainfall, the threat of increased extreme weather events and the threat to our iconic areas such as the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu. Yet a chapter that was never published by the government was the chapter outlining the recommendations. So you had the problems revealed in the Climate change: risk and vulnerability report but you also had the suppression of the key chapter outlining priorities for action. This is an absolute scandal. The government and its ministers consistently fail to be accountable to the Australian people. In terms of other environmental issues, it is quite clear that this government is prepared to have completely inconsistent positions when it comes to the independent advice that it has been given. If you want to see how ministerial standards and accountability have declined over the past decade, look at the contradictions that litter the government's climate change policy. Take emissions trading, for example. On 14 February 2006 in Senate estimates, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage said this: I think carbon trading schemes are part of the policy answer ... There is nothing radical about that indi- supporting trading schemes. Yet today in question time in the Senate, when he got a dorothy dixer, he criticised emissions trading schemes. On 14 April 2005, he said: ... we don't think it's an effective way to reduce greenhouse gases. The costs imposed particularly on, let's say, domestic power bills far outweigh the benefits of the emissions reduced. Mr Robb-Hear, hear!",97
181,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"So where does the government stand on emissions trading? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, who is at the table, says he agrees. I wonder if he a agrees with his leader in waiting-and waiting and waiting and waiting-the member for Higgins. The Treasurer, who went across to the United States, spoke at a conference during G'day LA events on 18 January 2006. Mr Murphy-What did he say?",98
182,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"He said this: A market based solution will give the right signal to producers and to consumers. It will make clear the opportunity cost of using energy resources, thereby encouraging more and better investment in additional sources of supply and improving the efficiency with which they are used ... … … … Price signals in an efficient open market will promote new and more efficient investment ... So the environment minister is in the Senate today saying price signals are bad but the Treasurer goes to LA, thinking that something called the internet does not exist, and says it is good. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said this on 31 July 2005: We know that emissions can't continue at their current rate. That's going to require research, collaborative research. It's also going to mean we'll have to investigate price signals coming from energy ... By changing price signals, obviously that leads to changes in the investment terns. You can get more investment into cleaner energy through changing pricing signals ... The foreign minister was right on 31 July 2005, the Treasurer was right on 18 January 2006 and indeed the environment minister was right on 14 February 2006, but they say a different thing today on the issue of emissions trading and the need to get price signals. You can only have two forms of price signals: emissions trading or a carbon tax. Maybe they are in favour of a carbon tax rather than emissions trading, but the Labor Party is in favour of emissions trading. That would appear to me to be what some of the government, some of the time, are arguing should happen-but not just yet. That is one of the inconsistencies in government standards. On 27 October 2005 the environment minister described climate change as ‘a very serious threat to Australia', but at the same time his department was in court challenging the very existence of climate change. The environment minister has said on numerous occasions that global emissions need to be cut by at least 60 per cent by 2050, but the government's climate change policies willaccording to the report from ABARE on the Asia-Pacific climate pact-increase emissions by 70 to 80 per cent by 2050. That was the most optimistic assessment if all the proposals discussed at the Asia-Pacific climate pact meeting were adopted. Let us look at the Great Barrier Reef. The government's own Australian Greenhouse Office has for years highlighted the dramatic impact climate change will have on the Great Barrier Reef. The report to the government and to the minister, the Climate change risk and vulnerability report-the report which had the chapter about what to do about it suppressed by the government-said this: The Reef itself is likely to suffer from coral bleaching events, which have long recovery times patand flow on effects for the whole ecosystem. Climate model projections suggest that within 40 years water temperatures could be above the survival limit of corals. The evidence is very clear. It has been given to the government, and yet what do government ministers say? On 9 February this year, the industry minister said this: I think the Reef is in good shape. Those areas where it is being closely managed... it is probably in better shape than it has been for years. The government is all over the shop when it comes to the fundamental challenges before it. Let us look at the Kyoto protocol. On 19 December 1997, after the Howard government signed the Kyoto protocol, the Prime Minister described it as ‘a win for the environment, and a win for Australian jobs'. This is a government that now holds the Kyoto protocol in the same affection as the National Party hold Senator MCGauran. On 16 February 2005, the environment minister said, ‘Quite frankly, the protocol is a dud.' At the same time, when the Asia-Pacific climate pact meeting was being held, the government was saying that it complemented the Kyoto protocol and that the Kyoto protocol, as the international agreement, was important. Let us look at the issue of whaling. On 22 June 2005, at the end of an International Whaling Commission meeting, the environment minister arrogantly exclaimed: Australia and pro-conservation nations have today won a massive victory for whale conservation. This is a fantastic outcome because it forces Australia's determination to ensure all commercial and so-called ‘scientific' whaling is consigned to the dustbin of history. Tragically, the slaughter of whales has not been consigned to the dustbin of history. Night after night over the Christmas period, Australians were shocked by the images of whales being slaughtered in our territory, in territory declared by this government as part of the Australian Whale Sanctuary. And yet the Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, intervened in a case involving the Humane Society International about whaling in the Australian Whale Sanctuary to say that it should not be successful because it would create a ‘diplomatic disagreement with Japan'. Far from an end of whaling, we have actually seen a doubling of whaling since the minister declared that. There has been a doubling in the catch of minke whales to 935 and an expansion to include 50 fin whales. If it were not for Greenpeace's actions, Australians would not know what occurred in the Australian Whale Sanctuary over the Christmas period, because this government was not interested in monitoring the activities there. Now the environment minister is saying that Japan will probably have majority support at the next IWC meeting, which will be held in the Caribbean this year. The government has sat on its hands while Japan has stacked the IWC. He says that he wants to consign whaling to the dustbin of history, but he has not been willing to take the government of Japan and other whaling nations to international courts such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. We also know that when it comes to heritage issues this is a government in which ministerial accountability has gone missing. On 18 December 2003, the Prime Minister stated that ANZAC Cove would be the first reinlisting on the National Heritage List. He said: It seems to me ... entirely appropriate that the ANZAC site at Gallipoli should represent the first nomination for inclusion on the National Heritage List. And, although it's not on Australian territory, anyone who has visited the place will know that once you go there you feel it as Australian as the piece of land on which your home is built. So what was actually going on while you had the Prime Minister and other ministers saying this? What was going on was that they were requesting road works to trash this sacred piece of our heritage. When I raised it in the parliament and asked questions of the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister's response was that it was regrettable that it was even being raised. Although ANZAC Cove is still not on the National Heritage List and in spite of the public outcry about what has occurred there, reports were given at Senate estimates that the area is continuing to be desecrated.

183,Mr NAIRN,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"In summing up this bill, could I thank the various people who contributed to the debate. I am sure any casual reader of Hansard might be a bit perplexed about what some of the matters, particularly those just raised by the member for Grayndler, have to do with the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2005. Obviously they have nothing to do with this bill. However, it is an appropriation bill, so members can speak on all sorts of matters-and clearly members have. I will not delay the parliament tonight in summing up. I will simply reiterate that this is a very minor amendment to a bill which allows for salaries to ministers, which is why the relevant act is called the Ministers of State Act. The bill is a oneline amendment to that act, replacing one dollar figure with another dollar figure. Really in summing up I should not say any more than that, other than to state that the government clearly does not accept the amendment moved by the member for Wills. The amendment clearly also has nothing to do with the bill. It is simply a political ment and it will not be supported by the government. I commend the bill to the House. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Wilkie)-The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Wills has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",100

185,Ms ROXON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I rise to speak on the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006. The bill currently before us introduces a number state of amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. The bill aims in part to implement the recommendations arising out of the independent Blunn review into the (Mr telecommunications interception regime. Largely, this bill is looking to update the existing act to take account of new technologies such as SMS, email and the like that were not envisaged when the original act was introduced and which have sat with an uncomfortable legal status since they came onto the market. An email or SMS, for instance, is not an instantaneous communication like a phone call. It is composed, stored and transmitted as a complete one-way message rather than existing in real time like a telephone call. This has created some problems for the existing system and the definitions that are in place. Since 2002 the parliament has struggled four times with the issue of stored communications. The contentious provisions in the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 were withdrawn after the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended against their inclusion. In 2004 the contentious provisions of the 2002 bill made a return. During the committee hearings on this bill it became apparent that the Australian Federal Police were using warrants under section 3L of the Crimes Act to intercept stored communications material from internet service providers. But such was the difference of opinion between the AFP and the Attorney-General's Department on this matter that the committee recommended the reforms to the telecommunications regime be deferred until there was some unified position from the government. The final result was that the committee recommended that an independent review of the act occur and imposed a sunset clause on the AFP's use of general warrants to access such stored communications. The original 2004 bill was thus not pursued, but subsequently the government came back to the parliament with another bill that implemented the committee's recommendation. Twelve months turned out to be not long enough for Anthony Blunn to conduct his review and for the government to finalise the subsequent legislation. A further six-month extension was granted by the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2005, and that extension expires in June of this year. Hence the debate today and some concern to get these changes through the parliament before that time expires. From Labor's point of view, the present situation of dealing with such communications is unsatisfactory. Email and SMS messages are available to be intercepted by the general Crimes Act warrants under section 3L. Labor strongly believes in tougher safeguards than are presently available under this regime. As it stands, we have a stopgap measure that will fall over when the clause expires in mid-June, and clearly the parliament does have to act decisively on this issue before that time. The bill before us today seeks to implement a number of recommendations, but not all of the recommendations, of the Blunn review. Because this bill does not represent the total sum of reform recommended by Mr Blunn, we will no doubt be revisiting this issue again in the not too distant future. What is before us today is perhaps as much as the Attorney-General could put together given the deadline to have the bill passed, assented to and proclaimed. In any case, Blunn's main findings were that: - the protection of privacy should continue to be a fundamental consideration in, and the starting point for, any legislation providing access to telecommunications for security and law enforcement purposes … Further: - access to telecommunications data is, and for the foreseeable future will remain, fundamental to effective security and law enforcement … This is the prime starting point that Labor also adopts when considering this bill: the balancing of privacy considerations and the need for appropriate access for law enforcement agencies. Significantly, the bill contains provisions to set up a new warrants regime for stored communications. That is a great improvement on the current situation and Labor will be looking during the committee stage to see if it can be improved even further. The bill will also implement equipment based interception. That is a practical and sensible measure which Labor supports. Perhaps most problematic in terms of the media comment and some of the public concerns that have been raised to date is the concept of B-party intercepts-that is, an intercept of an innocent party who is in regular communication with a person of interest. B-party intercepts are lawful, at least to some extent, now. Their validity has been established in the full court of the Federal Court in a decision of Flanagan v the Commissioner of the Federal Police. Although interpretations of this case vary, it seems that the reasoning has not been sufficiently clear for the Federal Police and the government to feel that they can confidently rely on this in suing B-party intercepts further. In any case, we would argue that the restrictions that exist, even if this case is relied upon, do not have the benefit of the protections. Clearly the government agree, given that they have proposed a statutory regime that puts in place some protections for the use of such B-party intercepts. Mr Blunn, in his independent review, did make comments about B-party communications and recommended that ‘the Interception Act be amended to make it clear that B-party services may be intercepted in limited and controlled circumstances'. That is what this bill does. We can go through in some detail the controlled circumstances that it refers It does make it clear that this mechanism should be used only as a last resort by law enforcement agencies. It is not to be used just as a matter of course. These are important principles and protections that Labor believe should be supported. We will pursue any other detailed protections that are required in the Senate committee. If we propose any amendments, as may be possible in the other place when the debate takes place, they will have the benefit of the Senate committee's review. Although B-party interceptions have not been used since the case of Flanagan in 1995, it seems that this has been a matter of policy rather than of law. Should the government of the day change that policy, it would mean that we would be back to an open slather situation. As a responsible Labor want to grasp the opportunity to limit and carefully control the use of B-party intercepts. We will ensure, as I have said, that this issue is carefully examined during the committee stage and that, if Labor are not satisfied with the safeguards, we will move amendments to ensure that B-party intercepts are used safely, responsibly and with the appropriate privacy controls and safeguards. pur- That is our promise to the community. The bill also contains technical measures, which are set out in schedules 4 to 6. These measures would amalgamate two different class of offences and remove a redundant accountability provision. Also included are some housekeeping measures that would ensure that the act is up to date. Labor generally support the bill because of its strong emphasis on protecting privacy and the important practical assistance it will give to our law enforcement agents. I think Labor have already referred this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee for its consideration so that there is a chance to discuss concerns raised within the debate in this to. House and within the broader community. Let me go through some of the detail of the bill. Schedule 1 deals with stored communications. The first schedule in the bill seeks to define stored communications pursuant to recommendations that were made by the Blunn committee. Mr Blunn made a number of findings on this matter. Firstly, he recommended that the distinction between real-time and stored communications be maintained. However, despite calling for the retention of this distinction, the report also found that the act as it is presently structured was not an appropriate vehicle for accessing communications other than real-time communications and that the provisions governing access to stored communications were inadequate and inappropriate. Labor certainly agrees with this assessment. Therefore, party, the review recommended that access to stored communications continue to be authorised by search warrants but that those warrants be required to meet minimum prescribed standards. The bill before us today sets up the new warrants regime for intercepting those stored communications. The bill will remove the provisions from a general search warrant and implement tougher provisions similar to those that are current for real-time communications. In effect, the bill will toughen privacy protections, making it harder to get a warrant. This schedule also introduces definitions for stored communications and a regime for access to those stored communications. This includes a general prohibition on access to stored communications; the regime for access to stored communications by law enforcement agencies; the process and regime for issuing, executing and revoking stored communications warrants; provision of technical assistance to a law enforcement agency by staff of a telecommunications carrier; a regime of evidentiary certificates by carriers and law enforcement agencies; an offence to criminalise unauthorised use or communication of accessed information or stored warrant information; a regime of permitted dealings with accessed information; admissibility of evidence; destruction of records unlikely to be used for the purposes of investigation; the regime for keeping of records, including access to that regime by the Ombudsman; the regime for reporting to the minister and the parliament; and civil remedies. The new regime to be brought in by the bill generally acts to apply the same protections afforded to telecommunications to stored communications. The first schedule of the bill acts to clarify the status of access stored communications and, at the same time, toughens the privacy provisions required to obtain one. Schedule 2 deals with B-party intercepts. This schedule clarifies the position of the act on B-party intercepts-an issue that I have already touched upon tonight. A B-party intercept occurs when a law enforcement agency is monitoring person A for criminal activity. Say that person A is in regular contact with another party, person B, who is not the subject of an investigation. Under the present law, it is permissible to obtain a warrant to subject the second person, person B, to an interception in order to obtain information regarding person A. I have gone through the contentiousness of whether people agree on what the current law is or is not, but I think it is worth flagging that there is some authority for this. Certainly my colleague in the Senate, on whose behalf I am appearing today, is keen to impress upon the House that B-party provisions in this section are not new powers, nor do they expand existing powers, as has been reported in the media. B-party intercept powers already exist and have been upheld by the Federal Court, even if there is some argument over the extent and basis for that decision. It is presently policy not to use those powers; nevertheless, until this case is overturned, they do exist. The bill before us today would, as I have said, impose greater controls than currently exist and would certainly clarify the situation for both the public and law enforcement agencies. Thus, it is an improvement on the current situation. I turn briefly to the case of Flanagan v the Australian Federal Police because it seems to contain the key precedent relating to telecommunications interception. It was a 1996 Federal Court case. In that case there was a telecommunications interception warrant aimed at gathering information regarding a to Mr Flanagan-or the A-party-but the subscriber to the service was his wife. So, in effect, she was the subject of the monitoring and was the B-party. In the ensuing court case, they alleged that the issued warrant was invalid because it had gone beyond the Telecommunications (Interception) Act as it then stood. However, the Federal Court rejected that argument, stating: Until a communication to or from a service has been intercepted and recorded, it is impossible to know whether it would be likely to assist in an investigation, or even to identify the parties communication. If warrants were confined to authorising the interception of communications to which the particular person could be identified at the outset as a party, they would lose much of their efficacy. This cannot have been intended. The court further stated: There is no requirement that the prescribed offence be one in which the particular person contemplated by s 46(1) is involved. So all communications made to and from the telecommunication service-even though the subscriber was the B-party, Mrs Flanaganwere held to be valid. I repeat: the idea that B-party intercepts are totally new is incorrect. However, the new regime does define and limit the applicability of B-party intercepts. B-party intercepts will only be available in circumstances involving investigations of an offence punishable by at least seven years imprisonment. Items 8 and 9 further restrict the use of these warrants to circumstances in which the applying agency has satisfied the issuing authority that all other methods of identifying the telecommunications used have been exhausted and that an interception would not otherwise be possible. So the new regime covering B-party intercepts, rather than being an unjustified extension of existing powers, or a creation of entirely new powers-as some people have alleged-is and can be regarded as a limitation and clarification of existing powers. It can be seen to restrict, rather than expand, the B-party intercept powers. Nevertheless, as an aside, by spelling this out in the legislation, it must be acknowledged that it is possible that now the AFP may make more use of these powers, once they have been clarified in the legislation. I think it is important that a Senate committee investigate these issues further to make an assessment on whether the extent of the provisions is necessary and appropriate to the and is balanced with the sorts of protections that both the government and the Labor Party have said they are keen to see put in place. I have a lot of confidence in the Senate committee process as being a good way to flesh out some of these highly technical issues, particularly given that the committee has already dealt with the Telecommunications Act and some proposals that cover these areas on several occasions. It seems that there is a fair amount of expertise that resides in that committee, and we look forward to the recommendations that it might make. Schedule 3 of the bill imposes changes in equipment based interception. This is a technical change to allow the law enforcement agencies to apply for warrants for communications from a specific device rather than warrants for communications from a person. What happens-as I think has been mentioned in the explanatory memorandum-is that a person of interest can buy a mobile phone and potentially use hundreds of different SIM cards at low or no cost which they then switch through their phone. Naturally, this makes it very difficult for a law enforcement agency to identify and intercept communications belonging to that person based on a SIM card. The amended changes would, as I have mentioned before, allow for law enforcement agencies to target the phone and to intercept communications arising out of that phone or other terminal device. This amendment would serve to make it less practical and less economical for a person of interest to evade interception through their exploitation of technology and would therefore, we hope, enhance law enforcement chances of interception. The three schedules that I have just mentioned are the main amendments to the act contained in this bill. There are another three schedules in the bill that are largely designed to enact technical changes to the bill. Schedule 4 deals with class 1 and class 2 offences and removes the distinction between those classes. Previously, the act divided offences into these two classes and required that only class 2 offences be subject to privacy considerations by the issuing authority. However, the Blunn review questioned this distinction, finding that it produced no meaningful difference in outcomes and recommended their removal. The current bill accomplishes this, abolishing the two definitions and placing both of them under the new definition of ‘serious offences'. Both types of offences are now subject to privacy considerations. Again, essentially, this is an enhancement of the privacy provisions of the bill. Under the previous regime, only class 2 offences were subject to those considerations. Under this regime, all requests for warrants of telecommunications interceptions will be subject to these considerations. Again, Labor will support these changes, subject to any recommendations that arise out of the committee process. Schedule 5 operates to remove the Telecommunications Interception Remote Authority Connection, or TIRAC, from the act. The Blunn review found that the TIRAC regime was costly but had a very low rate of detecting warrant errors. The review recommended that the powers of TIRAC be moved to the Attorney-General's Department. For the benefit of the House, I quote from the explanatory memorandum: TIRAC is a historical electronic accountability mechanism which requires each interception agency to lodge its interception warrants with the AFP. The effect of this function is that the warrants do not take effect until the AFP receives warrant and notifies the Managing Director of the carrier of the issue of the warrant. TIRAC's ity has been exhausted by technological developments, and it is therefore proposed that it be removed from the Act. The proposed amendments will continue to require all agencies to maintain comprehensive records as part of the interception regime, however, interception agencies will no longer be required to notify the AFP of the issue of the warrant before it takes effect. Essentially, these amendments act to move a number of the functions of TIRAC to the Attorney-General's Department and to remove others from the act. As noted above, TIRAC has, since its inception, been superseded by technological developments, and it seems that the proposed change is appropriate. Finally, schedule 6 of the bill introduces a number of technical amendments to the act. These are largely housekeeping measures designed to tidy up the act and ensure that it is up to date. These amendments include extending the powers available to the Victorian Office of Police Integrity under the act to allow them to disclose intercepted information in limited circumstances relating to the investigation of officers under various anticorruption statutes. The amendments also include a number of other minor consequential amendments and corrections of drafting errors. The bill before us is a necessary update of the technically antiquated legislation that currently covers telecommunications interceptions. Significantly, the bill will provide a new regime for the interception of stored communications, affording them the same protections that are currently afforded for real-time communications and strengthening the privacy provisions of the regime. Secondly, the bill will clarify the position of Bthe party intercepts. This, rather than adding a new power, will actually serve to limit the util- scope of these intercepts. They will only be allowed in cases of severe offences and in cases where all other options have been exhausted. This enhances rather than diminishes the current privacy protections afforded under the warrant. The bill also introduces the ability for enforcement agencies to apply for equipment based warrants. This is a necessary update to an act which was written at a time when landline based telephones were the primary means of telecommunications. It will provide an important tool against efforts to frustrate law enforcement through the use of newly developed technology loopholes in the present regime. Finally, the bill ber of housekeeping measures. It cleans up some functions that the AFP exercises, moving them over to the Attorney-General's Department, and it eliminates an obsolete distinction between two classes of offences. Through these measures, the overall thrust of the bill is to provide a necessary update ensure that law enforcement agencies, when they are using the telecommunications interception regime, are able to better balance privacy concerns with the needs of those law enforcement agencies to access information, and also to update the regime to account for new technologies that were not developed or envisaged at the time of the original act. I conclude my remarks by reiterating Labor's intention to consider whether the bill can be improved further through the scrutiny of the Senate committee process and through possible amendments in the Senate. With those remarks, I commend the bill to the House.",101
186,Mr CIOBO,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I am pleased to rise to speak this evening on the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006. This bill implements a number of recommendations of the Report of the review of the regulation of access to communications under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 that was conducted by Tony Blunn, commonly referred to as the Blunn report. I am pleased to speak to this piece of legislation because it does go some way towards ensuring that there is an adequate framework in place to assist our law law enforcement agencies to deal with those various issues and investigations that they must undertake-those types of investigations which help to prevent criminal activity and help to crack down on criminal activity-as well as ensuring that there is safety in the community: the kind of safety that I know residents in my electorate of Moncrieff are looking for and expect the government to contains a num- deliver to them. This bill is the subject of debate in this chamber, and I am pleased to hear, in the main, positive comments coming from the Australian Labor Party about the three principal limbs that I will be discussing tonight-that is, the stored communications to warrant regime, B-party interception and equipment based interception. On these three fronts, I welcome the broad level of support that the Australian Labor Party has indicated that it will be providing. I note, of course, that this support is in some way laden with a caveat, coming from the fact that the shadow minister indicated that the Australian Labor Party would be looking more closely at this in the committee stage when the bill goes to the other place. Notwithstanding that once again there seems to be some equivocation about whether or not to support the legislation, to the extent that that support is forthcoming, I certainly welcome it. These amendments, as I said, go some way towards ensuring that there is in place an appropriate and adequate framework that will apply to the various agencies that need to conduct their activities under this act. Dealing with the Blunn report recommendations, which outline the need for overarching legislation regulating access to all forms of electronic communication, this bill establishes two of the three limbs that were proposed to be part of that overarching legislation, dealing with access to stored communications and an amended interception regime that incorporates, in effect, the majority of the existing Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The third limb is regulating access to telecommunications data, and the government expect, as we have outlined, to be making further amendments in due course. With respect to the stored communications warrant regime, the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Act 2004 does allow stored communications such as email and SMS that have been delivered to the recipient to be accessed without a telecommunications interception warrant. Those amendments, as the government foreshadowed and outlined, were intended as an interim measure pending the Blunn review. Accordingly, they sunset in June this year, as the shadow minister indicated. Schedule 1 of this bill creates a new stored communications regime that is centred on a prohibition on access to stored communications held by a telecommunications carrier, and a stored communications warrant regime. A stored communications warrant will be available to enforcement agencies that are investigating an offence punishable by a maximum period of imprisonment of at least three years or an equivalent pecuniary penalty. The threshold covers a broad range of serious offences and is the same as that outlined in the Surveillance Devices Act 2004. Once accessed, stored communications can only be used or communicated for a purpose connected with the investigation of an offence that is punishable by a maximum period of imprisonment of one year or the equivalent pecuniary penalty. The regime that is outlined in this bill strictly regulate the use, communication and recording of information that is obtained by various agencies in accessing stored communications. This is consistent with the current use and communication of intercepted communications, so in that regard this bill simply provides an extension of the existing framework. Information obtained by accessing stored communications, as I outlined, will also be able to be used, but only where there is an offence that is punishable by a maximum period of imprisonment of one year or a pecuniary penalty of at least 60 penalty units. The more controversial aspect of this bill is, of course, that dealing with B-party warrants. We have seen in recent times a great deal of media scrutiny and indeed a significant amount of media comment and stakeholder comment about B-party warrants. As the shadow minister outlined, B-party warrants are not entirely new. There has been some degree of their use in regard to activities by various agencies. I notice the member for La Trobe is in the chamber. He certainly has a great deal of experience in and practical application of the various requirements of enforcement agencies to adequately fight against those who would seek to subvert our way of life. I will certainly welcome the comments of the member for La Trobe, who I know is a passionate advocate of these types of laws and recognises that we need to provide adequate tools for law enforcement agencies to function appropriately and provide adequate safeguards to the community at large.",107
187,The B,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"party interception framework as outlined in this bill relates to the interception of communications of a person who may not be involved in the commission of an offence but who will communicate with a person involved in the commission of the offence. will Such a situation commonly arises, I am informed, in undercover operations where it may be necessary to intercept the service of an undercover police officer. Of course, it is recognised that generally there would be consent involved, but irrespective of that appropriate to have a B-party interception regime in place. The amendments provide that, where an interception agency satisfies an issuing authority that all practicable methods of identifying a telecommunications service used by the person of interest have been exhausted or that it is not possible to intercept the service used by the person of interest, the agency may intercept the telecommunications service used by another person. This amendment has been the subject of much media debate and concern by certain members of the community. Indeed, I harboured some concerns when this issue was first raised with me. However, on balance, when one considers the necessity for agencies to utilise various legislative tools in der to focus their efforts on criminals engaged in criminal activity, it seems to me appropriate that, with adequate safeguards that set in place the necessary limits that must be met by enforcement agencies, a Bparty interception warrant need not be considered an overly intrusive incursion into one's privacy. Granted, prima facie it does appear that innocent third parties can have their telecommunications intercepted. In reality, this would only occur-as section 9(3a) clearly provides-when the Attorney General has ensured that there has been an exhaustion of all other practicable methods of interception of the telecommunications of the person in whom law enforcement agencies are interested. Given that the threshold is that agencies have used and exhausted all other practicable methods, the question then becomes one of: do we as a government sit back and allow those who are technologically savvy or criminals engaged in criminal enterprise who have found some other way to avoid detection, scrutiny or interception by various government agencies to continue their activities it is outside the bounds of the law? On balance, given the appropriate threshold is in place, which is that all other practicable methods have been exhausted, I am of the view that it is appropriate to allow B-party interception warrants. Furthermore, given that at common law there already exists the ability for this to occur in limited circumstances, it seems prudent and wise for the government to legislate for a framework that very explicitly outlines the criteria that must be taken into account with respect to the issuing of a B-party interception warrant. More importantly, there are the various factors that the Attorney-General and, indeed, the courts must satisfy themselves of before a B-party interception warrant could be authorised. For example, the issuing authority must oralso have regard to the following additional factors: the gravity or seriousness of the offences being investigated; how much the privacy of any person would be likely to be interfered with through the interception; how much the intercepted information would be likely to assist with the investigation by the agency of the offence; how much the use of such methods would be likely to assist in the investigation by the agency of the offence; to what extent alternative methods of investigating the offence have been used by, or are available to, the agency; and how much the use of such methods would be likely to prejudice the investigation by the agency of the offence. Taking these issues into account, I am satisfied that a B-party warrant in the regime that this bill seeks to put in place would contain appropriate safeguards to one's privacy but, at the same time, remove the shackles that currently exist due to agencies not having the full scope of powers to give them sufficient opportunity to intercept the telecommunications of those involved in criminal enterprise. The third, and perhaps less controversial, aspect of the bill is equipment based interception. This is relatively straightforward. deals with those instances where the various agencies-the Federal Police and ASIO, for example-need to intercept equipment. As the shadow minister has detailed, you might have a situation where someone engaged in criminal or terrorist activity is using a number of different SIM cards on a mobile phone to try to evade interception. This bill would enable interception of the actual equipment. So, although various SIM cards might be used in the equipment, the piece of equipment itself could be intercepted, thereby ensuring that agencies with an interest in that person have the ability, where the criteria have been satisfied for the equipment based inception warrant, to intercept that equipment. There are a number of housekeeping matters in the bill which I do not intend to upon as the Attorney-General and the shadow minister have done so already. I would summarise, though, by saying that concerns have been raised that there is 26 times more chance of someone having their telephone intercepted in Australia than, for example, in the United States. This kind of comparison is completely unrealistic and completely wrong. The United States differs to Australia in a number of significant ways. Direct comparisons between Australian and US statistics are therefore entirely misleading. Statistics from the United States published on interceptions do not include those interceptions that are considered too sensitive to be reported. That is the first point of difference with the Australian system. Investigators in Australia do not have the discretion to not report certain interceptions regardless of the level of sensitivity surrounding them. In addition, United States law allows one warrant to authorise the interception of services used by a number of people: for example, It when it becomes possible to identify criminal associates of the original suspect. Again, this stands in stark contrast to the situation in Australia in which a warrant must be authorised for the telecommunications service or services of only one person who is named in that particular warrant. That is another significant difference between the collection and collation of statistics in Australia and in the United States when it comes to interception. Although there will be those who will run the scare campaign in the community that the passage of this bill is effectively signing away the right to privacy and is further fuel on the fire that allows government agencies to intercept telecommunications at will, those assertions are incorrect. The reality is that this bill puts in place a framework that is touch able to be used by both law enforcement agencies and the public more broadly. It establishes a framework that clearly outlines the various threshold requirements as to when a warrant is able to be issued and the various points that must be considered. With respect to B-party warrants, this bill ensures that there are adequate safeguards. Further, it moves from common law to statutory law a point of view that specifies that all other practical methods must have been exhausted. I welcome these reforms. I think it is important that there be in place a strong framework which enables the government and its agencies to effectively operate to ensure the safety and security of the community at large and at the same time affords to our various investigative agencies the kinds of powers that they need to do their job appropriately but without sacrificing those liberties which so many of us hold dear. I commend the bill to the House and I look forward to the Australian Labor Party supporting this bill in its current form as it moves through the Senate and its various committee stages.",108
188,Mr KERR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"There are significant elements of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006 to be welcomed, but I think it is important for me to set out some of the concerns I have and am certain are shared more broadly throughout many sectors of the community and on both sides of this House with respect to the detail. There is no doubt that the vation for this legislation is well based and many of the initiatives will clarify the entitlement of law enforcement to secure information that is required for proper law enforcement purposes. In making those circumstances transparent and setting out clearly the manner in which interceptions can be undertaken in respect of a number of areas which presently lack sufficient clarity, the intention of the minister, the government and the opposition, in indicating its support for the general approach, is to be welcomed. But I do want to draw attention to some of the areas which require the further consideration of this parliament. I note that this lation will be subject to further review by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and the remarks I make now are in the context that I hope the issues I raise are taken into account by those participating, and I intend to forward the text of these remarks to that committee to be taken into account as a submission in their deliberations. The first issue I want to turn to by way of expressing concern goes to the question of stored communications. It is certainly true that one of the issues that has confronted law enforcement is how to effectively deal with communications which are carried in an electronic form that are not the traditional voice messages carried over phone lines. The telecommunications interception regime that was put in place in 1979 envisaged handsets connected by copper wire hardlines and set out a regime at first limited to a very narrow range of offences and available only to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies but subsequently extended to a much wider range of offences and permitted to be utilised by state and territory law enforcement agencies and a range of commissions charged with the responsibility for anticorruption matters. These extensions have each been delibermoti- ated upon and considered, but one of the technological innovations that has occurred of course is the growing use of electronic transmissions to carry not only voice messages but also text messages and stored communications. We all use mobile phones whereby we receive text messages transmitted to us by friends, colleagues and acquaintances. We often use hand-held devicesBlackBerries and the like-to communicate not only short messages but also messages which include attachments and to file and store large amounts of documentation. My concern is that we are not putting in place the same strict regime for accessing legisthis so-called stored communication as we do for regulating the interception of telecommunications that are voice messages over hardlines. The tests we have enacted to permit access to interception of voice transmissions remain very high. The regime is not one which, in my view, is capable of being easily subverted by those who would be frivolous about seeking to utilise such interception methods. But the proposed test in respect of stored communications is much lower. I am troubled by the reasoning behind the proposition that my privacy is much less intruded upon if the message I receive on my mobile phone or a message that is transferred through a BlackBerry and an email attachment is intercepted covertly, unknown to me. Why should the test be lower in those circumstances than it would be for an interception of a voice transmission? I think the argument is put that a lower test is appropriate because it is more in the nature of a search warrant that could be issued under the various search warrants legislation for hard copy material-that is, the test ought be more analogous to the kind of test that would apply were, for example, a search to be authorised of a person's office or home for materials that were suspected of being evidence in relation to a possible crime. The problem with that analogy is that, in the large majority of-almost allinstances where search warrants are pursued, the person against whom the search warrant is issued comes to learn of its issue and can contest the issue of the warrant on the basis that it was issued improperly. In relation to the materials that have been the subject of seizure, they can make claims of legal professional privilege or, in the instance of members of parliament, parliamentary privilege. There is a range of other circumstances in which people can properly raise those objections to an overwide use of those powers. But, in the case of the interception of stored communications, it is much in the nature of a telephone interception: you do not come to know of it. So it is a covert intercepdealt tion. As we move more and more of our business from paper based to electronic storage of information, what we are effectively doing is permitting, at a much lower test, covert interception of large amounts of stored materials. It is a test which is not aminable in the same way as ordinary search warrants are and with a lesser threshold to meet than we insist upon with voice communication. I think this is quite troubling and suggest that the Senate have a look at this. Two possible solutions commend themselves. One would be to have the same highlevel test for the seizures of covertly obtained materials where a warrant for stored communications is sought; the other would be to require, where the lesser test applies, the person to be notified of the collection as one would normally find out about the implementation of the search warrant so that the ordinary claims for privilege and the various other entitlements to challenge the issue of the warrant, the legality of it and the grounds for it can be pursued. It seems to me that we are introducing effectively a much more comprehensive regime to permit access to substantial amounts of electronically stored material, which is now the most common form of commerce, in a way which does not give the traditional safeguards to those against whom the decision was made. I might say in respect of one matter of most moment to members of this parliament that it would bypass the arrangements that have been entered into between the Speaker and the President of the Senate and the Australian Federal Police regarding seizures of materials relating to parliamentarians' conduct of their business in this House. Presently, there is an arrangement in relation to the exercise of a search warrant which enables members to make properly founded claims for privilege, to have those claims examined and to have the warrant with in a manner which accommodates those entitlements. That, of course, could not occur if the member does not know that they have been the subject of an interception. And, in a like manner, the entitlements the ordinary citizen has to make: claims of legal exprofessional privilege or to challenge the evidential and legal basis for the issue of a warrant, to claim that it has been issued in circumstances where it is impermissible to I issue it, is not available simply because they do not know that the seizure has occurred. I put these arguments forward on the basis of long experience as to how these matters do operate, having served myself for three years as Minister for Justice responsible for the Australian Federal Police in this parliament and previously having had responsibility for arguing a number of cases before superior courts about the validity of warrants issued in relation to searches and seizures. The second point that I turn to is a point that has been given a greater degree of attention than that which I have just discussed, and that is the so-called B-party warrants. These are extremely contentious because, for the first time, our law will permit an issuing authority to authorise the interception not of the phone service used by a person against whom a suspicion is held but of any innocent third party against whom no such grounds are established in order that they might incidentally collect through that means the communications of the person against whom the suspicion is held. I have given earnest thought to the justification for this, and luctantly I accept that there is a proper basis for permitting the use of B-party warrants but would like to see far greater safeguards than are presently encompassed in the legislation. Why have I conceded that it may be legitimate to use B-party warrants? I might say that the euphemism of a B-party warrant is something that I find a little offensive. They should be called ‘innocent third party warrants' or ‘third party warrants' because I think that by the use of such language we really do not come to the gravamen of the point. But it is a truth that, as we have gone now over 25 years since first authorising telephonic interception, not only has law enforcement come to rely on them and use them more effectively but so too have those against whom they are sought and directed become somewhat smarter in their capacity to hide their communications from the authorities. I do not think it is giving away any great law enforcement secrets to mention the fact that there are people out there, ‘smarties', who are trying to switch hand-services and chips on a regular basis so that it is difficult to find out what service they are using and to follow and trace the calls they are making. If that is a practical problem in tracing and identifying the telecommunications of persons against whom warrants would lawfully be issued, I think it is reasonable for this parliament to say: ‘In those circumstances we will permit the collection. If we can't get at this through ordinary means, we will permit law enforcement to seek authority to tap the phones, to intercept the communications, of persons we believe they are in communication with-third parties.' It may be lawyers, it may be accountants, it may be family, it may be friends, it may be people with whom they have business relations of an innocent kind or it may be parliamentarians whose constituents are suspected of particular conre- duct. With this means of tracing these innocent third parties, intercepting the calls of the innocent third parties, we can find out what the target is seeking to do, identify the phone services they are using, where they reside, what they are doing and follow their conduct, and, hopefully, obtain evidence that may be material to either preventing crime or prosecuting it. The problem I see, however, is that there is a very grave risk that, in permitting this, we are going to open up a whole range of collateral material to intrusion, investigation and collection that we do not intend to bring into the net. It seems to me that if the government's purpose is not to expand the right of law enforcement to seek warrants against innocent third parties per se so that their communications are not only with the suspected wrongdoer but with other parties-let us assume party A is a suspected wrongdoer and party B is known to have some contact with that person but against whom there is no suspicion of wrongdoing; you could not normally issue a warrant against party Bthis legislation will now permit that but will bring into the net all the communications between parties B, C, D, E and F and all the people they call. If the real intent of this legislation is collect material that is being evaded because party A is using sophisticated means to prevent the detection of their communications, let us allow that but make certain that we quarantine the communications to those which would have been lawful under the previous interception regime had it been possible to collect the material by direct interception of party A. Let us not open up the possibility of innocent third parties being now roped into a very much expanded net of telecommunications which we have never intended in this parliament to open up. If it is the government's intention simply to make certain that evasion is not possible through the means that are currently being adopted, we should quarantine third party communications so that the subsequent communications between parties B, C, D, E and F must not be collected, must not be held, and that material that might otherwise be available were it collected is made subject to both use and indemnity use privilege so that it cannot be used as evidence. If we are seeking to make certain our regime is effective so that it cannot be avoided, we should not be opening up a regime that exposes a whole range of additional people against whom law enforcement has no proper basis for seeking warrants to the whole of their communications with a whole range of other people which would not have been available to the law enforcement agency previously in such a way. So I think the onus is on the government to tell us why, if they are not prepared to cept that proposition, they want to be able to use this further material far beyond that which they have asserted is the reason for this B-party regime. If the B-party regime is intended to allow the collection against party A, and that is all the communication between A and B-that is, communication that would to have been capable of collection if party A had not avoided the warrant-it should not be a basis for extending the regime against parties whose communications would not be the subject of warrant because, under the law as it stands, there would be no proper basis for its collection. We should not be opening this up further. This is not an issue of addressing a problem that currently is a common-law issue. That is a nonsense argument that has been put forward. The only lawful basis for the interception of a telephone service in Australia now is under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. There is no basis whatsoever to suggest that there is a common-law right for third party, B-party, interceptions. That is an absolutely absurd red herring that has been thrown into this debate-I do not understand on what legal basis or proposition-by members on the other side. It is a nonsense. With those remarks, I accept that we do need to clarify the way in which we address some of these issues, but I do not think that the safeguards that have been put in place are consistent with the understanding that the government has advanced for the rationale and the protection of the broader community interests that are also as important as making certain that law enforcement cannot be avoided. I accept, as somebody who has had the responsibility, that high levels of government and law enforcement must be made efficient and effective, but I also believe that this parliament has a high responsibility for acprotecting individual rights.

189,Mr WOOD,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I rise to speak on the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006 and recommendations put forward by the independent Blunn review. Australia enjoys a culture that respects personal privacy. Every Australian values their right to have private conversations. Under current legislation the government is responsible for ensuring its citizens' privacy is protected-protection which I, as an Australian citizen, value just as much as anybody else. This interception bill will not change that. But first let me tell you a bit about my background and why I am so keen to participate in this debate. I was formerly a member of the Victorian Police Force for 17 years-seven years as a detective, including four years service at the organised crime squad, where the crew which I was a member of investigated serious crime networks, including the notorious Carlton crew in Melbourne, which has a reduced membership due to the underworld killings. In my experience, one of our biggest problems is the evolution of technology and the criminal community's growing ability to use technology to their advantage in evading police. The criminals-and I know this-watch TV crime shows like LA Law and CSI simply to learn skills in forensic crime techniques avoid detection. Criminals have become experts from law enforcement tools such as DNA, listening devices and telephone intercepts. I should also point out that crime shows have it easy. I am always impressed how in a 30-minute episode a homicide, rape or drug case can be solved, with a major twist at the end to conclude the episodebut, importantly, with a confession just to the viewers know they have got their man. In reality this rarely happens. The majority of homicide investigations take weeks, months and sometimes years to complete. Detectives dedicate every breath they take to solving serious crimes, and that is why this legislation is so important. In reality, crime shows are well off the mark, but I can understand why. Good television does not consist of a detective slugging away on a keyboard preparing an affidavit for an entire episode. It would take 50 episodes to cover a detective just compiling one warrant for a complex investigation to put together a telephone intercept, which most likely would comprise at least 30 pages. Why such long affidavits? Simply, the matter must go before a judge and the judge must be absolutely satisfied that the criminal is linked to the crime before he will grant a warrant. In the Victorian Police the affidavits go back and forth from the investigation team to the special project unit, where the affidavit is subjected to checks and double checks. Once the special project unit is satisfied that all criteria are met, the warrant is again checked by the legal advisers office within the Victorian Police Force. The final step is to take the affidavit and warrant to the Supreme Court's administrative appeals tribunal, where an independent judge determines whether there are sufficient grounds to grant a warrant. I was listening with interest to the member for Dennison's comments about the process and to how it sounded like it was easy to obtain a warrant. In actual fact it is exceptionally difficult. Police must satisfy exceptionally high standards before a judge will issue a warrant. Such a cumbersome, time consuming process does impact upon police investigations. I recall in July 1996, while I was a detective at the organised crime squad, a listening device affidavit being prepared over sevlet eral days. I recall the affidavit was near completion but still needed to go through the rigorous tests of the special project unit. The target for this warrant was Mat Thomas, who at the time was the driver for the now deceased Alphonse Gangitano. Our intention was to install a listening device in the car of Thomas but, because of the high standard of proof required in the affidavit, more preparation time was required. On Sunday, 14 July 1996, a week after starting to compile the affidavit, Mat Thomas drove his Mercedes Benz to the Gatto Nero Bar. When he left, Raymond Oueinati was found dead, kicked to death. Thomas was one of several suspects and was charged with the murder, but was subsequently acquitted. Thomas would say he was innocent. I say he was acquitted of murder. I remember the Monday following the murder and the frustration faced by members of the organised crime squadknowing that, were the process for obtaining the warrant made easier, what additional information would have been obtained and supplied to the jury had police had a listening device installed in Thomas's car immediately after the death of Oueinati. I make the point that police investigations are all about timing. The quicker police can respond, the greater the likelihood of solving crimes. The longer it takes for police to prepare affidavits for listening devices and telephone intercepts, the longer the suspect is able to prepare and calm their nerves and be mindful of what they say. Those in this House who believe the issuing of a warrant is a tick and flick exercise have no idea of the reality of how difficult this task really and the high legal benchmark that is required. Other important aspects of this bill under ‘B-party interceptions' will allow police to cater for criminals who phone swap. This is a simple technique. Again, at the organised crime squad, on numerous occasions the prime target would have dinner with associates and would make calls from the phone of an associate. The prime target would be aware that most likely their own phone was tapped but would also be aware that police would not be able to intercept the phone calls made on the associate's phone. This legislation will fill that hole and enable police to predetermine what the target will do and intercept crime related calls made by them on the phone of an associate. B-party interceptions in this legislation could also be used by police to counter criminals who use public phones to call associates. I ask you: why would a drug trafficker stop day after day to make phone calls from a public phone to the same person but never from their own mobile phone? Simply, they are up to no good. But, until this legislation goes through, police only have the ability to monitor the drug trafficker's phone, not the associate whose phone they have called from the public phone. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the current legislative framework actually protects these modern day criminals from having their illegitimate communications intercepted, simply because of the high legislative benchmark that is needed to be reached before police can obtain a warrant. It is undoubtedly important to ensure that the interception capabilities of the police are balanced against the protection of Australian citizens' right to privacy. This is greatly important. But there is a huge benchmark required to be reached by police to take out is warrants and they must satisfy a judge. In conclusion, I strongly support this bill. Debate interrupted. NA",114
190,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Howard Government",116
191,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (9.00 pm)In 2006 we have seen the government return to its true form. We have seen a return to the era of dog-whistling. Today in the House, the Minister for Health and Ageing said: I read in the Australian last Friday that he still has the Greek branches but he has lost the Spanish branches, the Vietnamese branches as well as the Cambodian branches. I could not help but think, ‘Are there any Australians left in the so-called Australian Labor Party today?' For the benefit of the Minister for Health and Ageing, I remind him that, unlike the Liberal Party, in order to get a vote in the Australian Labor Party you have to be an Australian citizen. We only have one class of citizen in this country, not two, and it does not matter whether your name is Smith, Abbott, Albanese, Panopoulos or Wong-we are Australians all. It took a number of interventions before the Minister for Health and Ageing eventually withdrew his remark . But that is consistent with what must be the government's polling led push. Last week, in an attempt to appeal to the right wing of the Liberal Party, the Treasurer gave a speech in which he spoke of ‘confused mushy misguided multiculturalism'. He said: Before becoming an Australian you will be asked to subscribe to certain values. If you have strong objections to those values don't come to Australia. No-one is suggesting that extremists of any sort-Islamic extremists, Christian extremists or Judaist extremists-should be tolerated. But the fact is that there is a pattern which is consistent from the top down. The Prime Minister is of course the king of dogwhistlers. We all remember the ‘children overboard' affair, but the Prime Minister wants to write a different version again. He has now fashioned a new line to cover the ‘children overboard' affair. He said, just this week, in an interview with the Age: … I did think that if somebody had done that, it was a pretty bad thing to have done-and they did after all sink the boat, didn't they? No, they did not, Prime Minister. The Olong-a barely seaworthy, leaky fishing boat with 223 people on board-struggled back towards the Indonesian coast after being turned around by HMAS Adelaide. Its engines failed and, on direction from the government, the Adelaide towed the boat around the Indian Ocean until it started to sink. Only then did any of the refugees jump into the sea and only then were they rescued. The Prime Minister knew 48 hours after his original ‘children overboard' claim that it was not true, yet he held out until after election day a month later. The Prime Minister has known for years that the Olong was not sunk by the refugees aboard it, yet he continues to try and cover one untruth with another-one dog whistle after another. We record that on 2 March 1996 the Howard government was elected-and so was Pauline Hanson as the member for Oxley. We remember well what the Prime Minister said when the member for Oxley gave her infamous speech in which she sought to divide Australians from one another. He said it was about free speech. He said it was a lifting of the cloak of political correctness. He was prepared to go out and press those buttons. That is the consistent form that this government has had. This week, some in the government will speak about 10 years of leadership. It is not leadership to be prepared to divide the community-people against people. It is not leadership to be prepared to appeal to the base considerations of prejudice and discrimination. Yet this government is continually prepared to do it in order to seek political advantage. This government's overriding objective is its own political interests rather than the national interest. When you look at the pattern that has emerged over recent weeks-the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Health and Ageing, all senior members of the government, all pushing the same line-it is clear that their polling is once again telling them what they should be saying. What we need in this nation, particularly at this time of insecurity, is leadership that unites the nation, not divides it. (Time expired) Greenway Electorate: Sudanese Refugees",116
192,Mrs MARKUS,ADJOURNMENT,"Greenway) (9.05 pm)Tonight I rise to speak on an issue of great significance to the local community in my electorate of Greenway. Yesterday the Sydney Daily Telegraph published an opinion piece by Lillian Saleh about the settlement of Sudanese refugees, particularly in the Blacktown area. This article concerns me for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it contains comments that are divisive and fails to show the totality of the situation facing new Australians and the community in a broad sense. Thirteen thousand people arrive in Australia each year as offshore refugees and humanitarian entrants. Six thousand of them come as refugees. These are the people the United Nations High Commission for Refugees tells us are most in need. Australia has always been a country that welcomes those most in need. In 2005, roughly 5,000 refugees from Sudan entered Australia. More than half of these people have settled in the Blacktown region and many of them live in my electorate. They are vibrant people who have endured much on their journey to call Australia ‘home'. The ethnic conflict that has engulfed Sudan, particularly the western region of Darfur, has been vicious. The two-year conflict has been described by the UN as the world's worse humanitarian crisis. It is estimated that two million people currently live in refugee camps and more than 180,000 have lost their lives. Starvation, displacement, separation from family members, disease and hunger are the major problems that face these refugees. Those who enter Australia do so as part of our humanitarian program. They come into what can be a very challenging situation for them-a new country, a new language and a new culture-after, as in many cases that I have seen and heard about in my electorate, years of displacement and extreme hardship. Lillian Saleh's article referred to comments by Paul Gibson, the Labor state member for Blacktown. He referred to the issue as ‘a powder keg waiting to go off'. These comments are inflammatory and, in my view, irresponsible especially when viewed through the lens of reality; that is, the member has demonstrated little active engagement with new and emerging communities in the local area. The article had been sparked by an incident that occurred in the Blacktown area a few weeks ago-a small scuffle, a one-off incident, that broke out between local police and some Sudanese residents. Having spoken with local police, I want to make it clear that there is no crime epidemic among the Sudanese migrants in Blacktown. Mr Gibson referred to a meeting he chaired between Sudanese community members and local police. This is the first time he has shown the community that he has an interest in the situation. It is the first time he has brought the two parties together. Conveniently, he did this in the presence of a reporter from the Blacktown City Sun and an accompanying photographer. Although I am on one level heartened to see the member taking an interest in the local community, I am extremely disappointed that it has taken him so long to engage with the local community and that he would then seek to use the situation for political gain. It is an irresponsible way to approach the situation at hand. There are challenges for these people, and it would be foolhardy to deny that fact, but to say that the Australian government has done nothing and to claim that he is an expert on cultural resettlement is indeed naive. I want to take this opportunity to publicly acknowledge the important work of the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre, led by the hard working and dedicated Irene Ross. Irene Ross and her team invest enormous energy in assisting New Australians. In the past 12 months the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre has received record federal government funding amounting to a total of $730,000 to support community projects. The federal government is providing this funding to local people who know best what sorts of challenges are facing the community-and I stand next to the people of the migrant resource centre in working for the community. The Attorney-General's Department fund an African worker to focus on crime prevention. A community crime prevention committee has been established to work with Sudanese leaders. It has aroundthe-clock consultants available to police and is developing recreational activities for young people. Integration is not a process that simply happens overnight. (Time expired) United Nations",118
193,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I note the remarks of the member for Greenway and I hope that she reproaches and censures the Minister for Health and Ageing, whose cheap jibe this afternoon-‘Are there any Australians left in the Australian Labor Party?'-makes it quite clear that he does not regard people of Sudanese background as genuine Australians, regardless of whether they are Australian citizens or not. Former Labor leader and Minister for External Affairs Dr Herbert Vere Evatt is quite rightly acknowledged as one of the creators of the United Nations. He became the President of the UN General Assembly. His tireless efforts led to the adoption of the UN Charter, containing provisions for the poor, the weak and the oppressed-provisions never envisaged by the big powers. Doc Evatt's humanitarianism did Australia proud on the international stage. I wonder what as a champion of human rights, would have thought of an invitation issued under the auspices of senior Victorian Liberals which has come into my possession. Mr Speaker, let me quote from this invite: Alan and Tony are pleased to invite you to the ... United Nations Beer and BBQ Summit on Global Hunger (Meat, beer, wine, champagne provided) with Guest Speaker Secretary General Kofi Annan Under that there is this quote: “Some 840 million people in the world suffer from chronic hunger. We need to do far better if we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of reducing by half, by the year 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. We are starting with you. You can make a difference!” Then there is: Think Global. Act Local!!! The RSVPs on this invitation are to Mr Tony Barry, the deputy state director of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party of Australia, and Mr Alan Anderson, an adviser to Attorney-General Philip Ruddock. This event was simply a grog-on for Liberals. No funds were raised for the world's hungry and dying. They misused the United Nations logo and insulted Kofi Annan. It is an absolute disgrace and shows the type of out-of-touch arrogance which sets in after 10 years in government. This is in extraordinarily poor taste. It mocks the poor and hungry and international efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty. One wonders what the Treasurer's brother, Tim Costello, who does such a great job raising awareness and fostering compassion about these issues, would make of this Liberal Party boorishness. Those involved should apologise to the United Nations and he, make a suitable donation to an appropriate UN body such as UNICEF. This week we are seeing how good the Liberals are at parties celebrating their 10 years in power. You have to wonder how many Liberals went to this particular Liberal bash. We have it on good authority that Treasurer Peter Costello's chief of staff attended, as did a host of other senior staffers. Were there any MPs in attendance? This is something the Liberal Party ought to come clean on. With the evidence coming out on AWB and the government's contempt for ethical international relations, you can understand perhaps why they do not like the United Nations. But it is unacceptable to hold the UN and Kofi Annan in contempt and it is even more unacceptable to mock the poor and hungry. That really is beyond the pale. This invitation reveals to the community the true colours of the Liberal Party. This invitation is little better than Marie toinette saying, ‘Let them eat cake.' Australian Flag",119
194,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight in the adjournment debate to continue my remarks about the plan of a socialist youth group called Resistance to encourage people to burn the Australian flag by selling flag burning kits. I voiced these concerns yesterday during the grievance debate, so I will not go over why the Australian flag is such an important national symbol and represents so many things to each individual Australian and why it should and must be respected and treated with dignity. It is because of what the Australian flag symbolises that there are certain protocols which should be observed when flying, folding and positioning the flag in a building or on a flagpole. These protocols were established decades ago and they have stood the test of time. It is important that we always maintain the dignity of our national flag and illustrate our respect for Australians everywhere who hold the flag close to their hearts. I would like to again quote one of my constituents, who wrote, ‘Flag burners are like naughty kids wanting to get attention.' Mr Speaker, I agree with this statement, as I am sure you and countless others do. In this House, we have four Australian flags that you as Speaker maintain. You ensure that they are flying 24 hours a day every day of the year. That is one of your responsibilities. I am sure each and every member who receives one of these flags that have flown in the House of Representatives finds that it is well received in their constituency. That is one of the things you do as Speaker. There are more appropriate ways for one to express how they feel about a certain issue, and I encourage these socialist youth groups to think about this. They could write Anto their member of parliament for a start. The centre of our democracy is the parliament. If they wrote to their member of parliament, he could express their concerns in the parliament. But to use our national symbol to draw attention to their cause will achieve absolutely nothing. In many cases, I believe it will bring condemnation. The Australian flag is a very powerful symbol to me and, I believe, to an overwhelming majority of Australians. It saddens and hurts me that someone can think they can get away with desecrating our Australian flag. It is with this passion and support for the protocols for the protection of our flag that I have decided to facilitate a petition to make it an offence to burn or desecrate the flag, or sell flag burning kits which would only encourage people to burn the flag and break what should be, I believe, a law. These socialist youth groups must be prevented from continuing with their plan. I am heartened by the signatures that are being added daily; in fact, I am overwhelmed by the signatures and the positive response this petition has received. I do not think the acts of burning the flag, desecrating the flag or selling flag burning kits should be made criminal offences, and neither would most Australians. Quite frankly, I think that would make a martyr of those people who want to continue these actions. Offenders would not learn from their actions, and they would probably be more likely to re-offend because of the publicity that they would gain by their actions and because of the fact that they would be seen to be martyrs by having criminal charges brought against them for their actions. What I would like to see is offenders undertaking compulsory education on the history of the flag and the values it represents to islation. each and every Australian. By undertaking compulsory education these offenders would become, I believe, far more valuable citizens to us. They would learn from their actions. They would also develop a better sense of the Australian identity. They would be better people, both as individuals and as members of their communities. People need to have a good sense of who they are, what they are and where they come from-their national roots and heritage. By learning about the flag and this country of ours they can begin to understand Australia's national identity. I want to assure members that this compulsory education is not in any way trying to take away the fundamental rights of Australians to exercise freedom of speech or expression. I will leave you with one final point. People who burn the national Australian flag are in fact burning the very symbol of their freedom of speech and freedom of expression, because it is this flag which represents the merging of these two fundamental rights-rights which form an intrinsic part of the Australian national identity. (Time expired) Industry: Regulation",120
195,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Graeme Samuel, ACCC chairman, has pointed out that the Trade Practices Act provides a framework for effective industry regulation. However, he also argues that while government provides a solid regulatory foundation business should also have the opportunity to raise the bar of corporate behaviour over and above the black-letter law through a process of coregulation, meeting widespread community standards and expectations. Similarly, the Corporations Act provides a sound foundation for the provision of either traditional command and control regulation or the more common system of coregulation derived from principles based legThe ACCC's current preferred approach to regulation represents a move away from the self-regulatory models to a coregulatory approach to industry codes. This approach is viewed by the ACCC as being a ‘supported form of self-regulation'. This support will be in the form of providing advice and endorsement of an effective industry code and a framework to monitor ongoing compliance with the code. I do not discount the need to reduce regulation. Certainly we have witnessed an exponential growth in regulation. However, often this has been due to the increasing complexity of products and services on offer. The challenge that we ought to consider is not how to reduce regulation as an unchallengeable, infallible doctrine but rather what is its best combination. Consumer groups have also supported the coregulation model. This model is essentially regulation with a regulatory hook attached to it, such as government licensing or broader principles based legislation. According to the joint consumer submission to the Taskforce on Industry Self-Regulation in 2001: ... self-regulation by industry has been shown to require a regulatory hook, thereby becoming coregulation. Examples of such a ‘regulatory hook' include membership requirements pursuant to legislation or licence conditions required by industry regulators to ensure they have the capacity to enforce standards where necessary against calcitrant members of the industry. Thus mainder of this submission will concentrate on models for co-regulation, on the basis that the submitting organisations are aware of no successful model of self-regulation in consumer markets in Australia. Functioning, efficient, self-regulatory schemes may promote good practice and target specific problems within industries, impose lower business compliance costs and offer quick, low-cost dispute resolution. Effective self-regulation can also avoid the often overly prescriptive nature of regulation and allow industry the flexibility to provide greater choice for consumers and to be more responsive to changing consumer expectations. Indeed, the recently implemented amendment to the Corporations Act takes the practical form of principles as opposed to distinct black-letter prescriptions which may be cumbersome and unable to keep up with the pace of industry change. With these points in mind, regulation needs to be considered as a means to an end. Self-regulation ought not be imposed as a normative policy posture to be pursued regardless of needs. I note the further critical point that, first and foremost, regulation underpins markets. Contract law provides certainty for market participants. Markets, such as those in electricity, are entirely constituted by regulation. Secondly, where markets fail, appropriate regulations provide essential safeguards needed to protect vulnerable consumers and maintain consumer confidence in the fairness and security of the markets. The general insurance industry provides us with a good example of an effective coregulatory structure. Late last year my office was visited by representatives of the Insurance Council of Australia to highlight to me the benefits deriving from the recent review of the general insurance industry code of practice. I am pleased to recognise the work re- of the insurance industry and the efforts of the re- the consumer movement in assembling a highly fastidious and well-enforced code. It promotes consumer and industry interests. Indeed, in looking at the code and the manner in which it was formulated, it becomes clear that in a coregulatory environment neither industry nor consumer groups can afford to take an adversarial approach to promoting good public policy. The self-regulation task force would be well served to take a closer look at the manner in which coregulatory methods have worked and pay less attention to those elements which seek to do away with regulation altogether. The alternative reality is a system that lacks public confidence and opens the options for exploitation. The government itself has had the obvious experience in the migration agents market, a system of dogmatic approaches we saw over many years where the industry could supposedly be trusted to look after itself. Despite assurances from the ministers in the current government that that was the way to go, in recent years we have seen a significant backdown and the need for coregulation in that field to be maintained. Australian Flag",121
196,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"WentworthParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (9.23 pm)-I want to record in the House tonight my appreciation of the patriotism of the Liberal councillors of Waverley Council in my electorate. Last year Councillor Joy Clayton, a Liberal councillor, moved a motion, seconded by a Greens councillor, Dominic Wy Kanak, in Waverley Council that the Australian flag and the Aboriginal flag should fly from the Bondi Pavilionsurely the most iconic building on Australia's most famous and most loved beach, Bondi Beach. That motion was rejected by a vote of the other Greens councillors, led by the mayor, Mora Main, and the entire Labor Party contingent. Every single one of the members of the Labor Party voted against flying the Australian flag. When they were called upon by the people of Waverley and Sydney and the newspapers of Sydney to explain this extraordinary action, what did they say? They said, ‘We were concerned it would promote disharmony, hatred and dissent.' They were afraid to fly the flag of nation above our most famous beach. They were afraid to fly the flag of Australia on beach that the entire world associates with our nation. Bondi Beach is more than just a beautiful strand of sand, great waves, lifesavers and swimmers. Bondi Beach is a home to Australians and visitors from every corner of the world. I was on the 380 bus not so long ago and I was listening to two young Irish people sitting behind me. One of them said to the other, ‘Pat, where are you living nowadays?' and he said, ‘I'm living in County Bondi.' Bondi is in fact the home of St Patrick's Church, the home of the Irish chaplain in Australia. It is home to a very large Jewish population. It is home to a very large Russian population. Bondi, in its diversity, mirrors the diversity of Australia, and that diversity is bound together by a common commitment to our Australian values and symbols, principal amongst which is the flag. The Liberal councillors who supported flying the flag in the face of the craven betrayal of our national symbol by the Labor Party and a few Greens were councillors Joy Clayton, Sally Betts, Kerryn Sloan, Tony Kay and Richard Davidson. They stood up for Australia late last year and they were voted down because they did not have the numbers. But the outrage, the amazement and the disgust of the community of Waverley was such that last week the council backtracked. I am pleased to say that even the Labor Party finally saw the light and the council has voted to fly the flag from the Bondi Pavilion, a building in the centre of Bondi Beach from which the flag flew many years ago. The number of excuses that were offered by the various Labor councillors as to why the flag should not be flown was remarkable. They had the ‘promoting civil unrest' excuse; they had the heritage excuse. ‘We'd need to this do a heritage study,' they said. That was blown up when the Daily Telegraph pubthe lished a photograph of the Bondi Pavilion from the 1930s showing two large flags flying from the roof. So they had all their excuses, but at the very base of it they were ashamed in the wake of the Cronulla riot into saying: ‘This is Australia. We believe in Australia. We are all Australians.' I am proud that my community, one of the most diverse in Australia, with people from every corner of the world, to a man and woman was ashamed of the vote of those Labor Party and Greens councillors. I am pleased to see that that community reaction has resulted in the patriotic endeavours of the Liberal councillors finally finding a majority. I am sure that all of us here in this House, even the honourable members opposite, will be pleased when the flag flies at Bondi. (Time expired) Visas",122
197,Ms CORCORAN,ADJOURNMENT,"In the few moments that are left of this debate tonight I would like to raise an issue that has been raised with me many times in my electorate, and that is the way visitors visas are managed. Very often a constituent will come into my office seeking assistance in getting a relative to come out to Australia to attend a family wedding or some sort of celebration to find that the visitors visa has a bond attached to it. When you make inquiries about which country these visitors are coming from and how much the bond is, there appears to be no particular pattern to all of this. There may well be very good reasons for the way all this is organised, but it is not clear and it is not transparent. I have put some questions on the Notice Paper to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to see if we can unearth why this is, but many people in my constituency are feeling that the system is perhaps not being administered fairly and clearly. I think we need to have good strong look at this.",123

Before I focus my attention on the actual turn my mind to some of the comments the course, let slide many of the erroneous statements completely absurd to those that were a little the Australian Labor Party saying, through the best friend that Saddam has ever had. Not only is that if it were not for the Howard government lian Labor Party had been in power, then Saddam day. People may ask: what does this have to do that question as well. The reality is that I made a whole range of comments about it. With respect to the Australian Wheat Board payments made by the AWB, we have already completely unable to draw any connection ernment and the activities of the Australian ment has clearly demonstrated on occasion after activities of the Australian Wheat Board. Furthermore, deductions under the Income Tax Assessment that there is simply no provision under existing allowable deductions at law.

I am also fascinated that the Australian their various state and territory governments, that they are opposed to the GST. Queensland's people to sign up to the GST agreement. With ‘Oh, woe is me to have to sign the GST agreement.' the likes of premiers Peter Beattie, Steve around this country, have ensured that the GST to what the Australian Labor Party had with directly into state government coffers.

He alleges that in Australia's history and that the full The reality is that Australian families are betin our nation's history. In particular, with the today have no net tax liability until they in Australia today can earn up to $42,000 thanks to the Howard government. the lowest levels of unemployment this country rates this country has seen for decades and contrast to the history of the Australian Labor bluff and bluster by the member for Rankin and Labor Party interest rates were at 18 per was at 11 per cent, with one million people unNA employed, and not down at record lows; and under control as it is now. The stark contrast government will continue delivering and the ple will continue to support the Australian of the Australian Labor Party and the arguments which simply lack substance.

This measure was one of the recStanding Committee on Family and Comstory.

As a result, the committee recombe dropped, to be replaced by family-friendly parental responsibility, but I do think that that will be easily understood in the comcase, we will find ourselves left in the same reforms. I should add that I do not see the basic proposed family relationship centres as being NA able to ensure that all parties fully understand turn to that later. I want to move on to the proposal to require substantial shared time with both parents. The dence arrangements should become the norm phasis on sole residence. The committee noted 2.6 per cent of children in separated families shared care. By contrast, 74 per cent of children than once a week. In a 2000-01 survey undertaken was awarded to the mothers in 78.4 per cent in 75.7 per cent of cases that were settled per cent of cases that were tried. In the awarded residence.

So I have to ask whether the horse when it comes to these changes. By requiring the complex proceedings of the family law committee noted that only one jurisdiction in sumption of equal time.

As others have noted, But I think that all who came before us were to the system. As a child of divorced parents, the today almost one million children are growing and in 88 per cent of the cases the absent 35 per cent of the children in Australia who are parent either rarely-that is, once a year or lessin that situation, the social consequences of us all. With such a damning statistic it is no fathers, feel excluded from their chilthree per cent of children-some 25,500-were in NA what we call shared care arrangements, which the child for at least 30 per cent of the time. proportion of children were being looked after time. So it struck me that something was seriously meant to have created a rebuttable presumption showed that this was not the outcome either through court negotiated outcomes. Another major issue of concern was the before us that the system operated in a manner rangements. We heard repeated references from which had become the norm, a norm which led the sole resident parent and the father's contact the school holidays. The common 80-20 outcome court decisions and in the legal advice being this perception was widely held, and I have to confirmed this perception. In just over 40 per awarded to the non-resident parent at the level cases when determined by a judge. So you had out there of the cookie cutter outcome Section 60B of the existing Family Law Act continue to know and be cared for by both parents, port this important principle. So, from my point ing that the law operated in a way that maximised parent after separation. Of course, it is important notion of the presumption of equal shared parental trenched conflict, in cases of family abuse apply. I do not want to suggest that all parents best interests of the child to cease contact grounds. But, in general, I certainly believe in society and the changes that were occurring greater role in parenting responsibilities. The committee was asked to consider whether will spend equal time with each parent. I am partly inspired by what they saw was occurring far too many fathers in particular missing out and development. For sensible reasons the favour of a clear presumption of equal shared both parents should be consulted and consult made in relation to the care, welfare and development to education, religious and cultural upbringing, that, in the majority of cases, these shared parental form of a parenting plan. In terms of acting in the best interests of a clear presumption against shared parental are defined as each natural parent looking after Even in the shared arrangements a very small by either parent for at least 30 per cent of the amiss. The Family Reform Act 1995 was of shared parenting, but all the evidence the procedures of the court or in the nonstrongly held views of the people who appeared that led to an 80-20 outcome in parenting arour witnesses to a ‘cookie cutter outcome' to the mother usually being in the position of being restricted to alternate weekends and half seems to have been perpetuated both in given to parents in out-of-court settlements.
