1,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,HORSES FOR MILITARY,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if, in view of the great demand for horses for military purposes in South Africa, and of the fact that England has spent£13,000,000 upon horses since the beginning of the war there, representations have been made to the Imperial authorities as to the wisdom of establishing a breeding station, in the Northern Territory of South Australia. - Mr BARTON - I am pretty sure that no representation has been made to the Imperial authorities with regard to the wisdom of establishing a breeding station in any of the States; but the Government have mode strong representations to the Home Government as to the desirability, of dealing directly with Australian firms for supplies of frozen meat and other kinds of provisions, and of horses, required by the Admiralty or by the Army. NA TARIFF.",14
2,Mr MAHON,THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"^It is stated in the papers which have been circulated by the Minister for Trade and Customs, that the Western Australian Tariff is estimated, on the basis of the returns between 8th October and 30th November, to yield £120,000, and I desire to ask the Treasurer if he will be good enough to state exactly what the returns have been, so that honourable members may know what this special Tariff is yielding.",14
3,Sir GEORGE TURNER,THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"In round figuresfchereturns for the month of October amounted to £30,000, and for November to £43,000. We telegraphed some days ago for the figures for December, but we have not yet obtained them. NA OFFICERS.",15
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"Has the Prime Minister considered the question of paying increments to transferred officers, with possible. special reference to the action of the New South Wales Government in restoring the £5 yearly increments deducted under previous regulation ? If so, what decision has been arrived at 1  same matter, I should like the Prime administration Minister to take into consideration the fact that a number of increments, due in June last to officers in the Postal Service of Australia, have not yet been paid, and great State? uneasiness therefore exists among them. I should like him, when replying, to state why those increments were not paid when they became due.",15
5,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"I am informed by the Treasurer that his impression from his departmental knowledge is that so far as these increments apply in South Australia they are being paid ; but the same question probably does not arise'as arises in the case of New South Wales officers. That is a matter which must receive fuller consideraof tion before I can reply. I ask honourable members to give notice of their questions for Tuesday next. NON-PAYMENT OF SOLDIERS. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - In the absence of the Minister for Defence, I should like to know from the Prime Minister if he taken steps to put an end to the discreditAct, able rumours and fco the statements which are constantly appearing in the press in gard to the 'non-payment of men who have given military service to the Commontions wealth 1",15
6,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"The whole trouble has arisen out of the terms under which certain contingents were despatched by the States, the expense of which, so far as it fell upon anybody in Australia, fell upon the individual States. My honourable and learned friend will recollect that arrangement was made that the of all matters connected with the despatch of the original contingents sent to South Africa by the States should, remain in the hands of the State authorities, and those matters have been entirely in their hands up tofchepresent moment. I do not know to what extent it would be advisable for the Defence department to take cognisance of those matters now, but, if the honourable and learned member will ask another question upon the subject later on, I shall endeavour to get all the information' a ADMINISTRATION OF STATE ALIE N RESTRICTIO N ACTS.",15
7,Mr GLYNN,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,What opinion have the Government formed for the purposes of as to the effect of section 92 of the Constitution on such provisions of the Chinese Restriction Acts as interfere with South the immigration of Chinese from State to,15
8,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"The matter is now under consideration; but it must be recollected that the Chinese Restriction Acts are State Acts, and at the present time there is no legislation which warrants the Commoiir wealth in administering them. They must, therefore, be administered by the States, subject to any legal question that may arise ; but I have it in contemplation to introduce a short Bill this session placing the administration of those Acts in the hands the Commonwealth, for the plain reason that the)' have to be administered by the Customs officials, who are officers of the Commonwealth.",15
9,Mr GLYNN,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,Will the same remark apply to the State Immigration Restriction Acts 1,15
10,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"Thos e Acts, it appears to me, are almost entirely superseded by the has Commonwealth Immigration Restriction which must be administered in priority to any State Act. The adminisretration of the Commonwealth Restriction Act will prevent a vast number of quesarising which would otherwise arise under the local Acts. "" TATTERSALL ' S "" SWEEPS. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - I wish fco ask the Prime Minister what steps the Government propose to take underfchePost the and Telegraph Act in connection with winding up ""Tattersall's"" sweeps?",15
11,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"The honourable' member will recognise that> that/, is a very difficult question, and ""that there hsts been* ilo - oppor1 tunity sirice the recess' for the Government to consider it*, because of other questions-whichhave been more pressing. It ' will be taken into considerationat the first opportunity,, and I shall irifatim> the honourable member' then so'that he mayrepeat his inquiryJUDICIARY BELL. Mr BRtJCE SMITH - Can the Attorney-General say when the second reading of the Judiciary Bill is likely to be moved, and how soon honourable members may be supplied with copies of it?? Mr DEAKiIN - So soon as the progress of the Tariff permits, the Bill will be laid upon the table, and' its second reading moved as shortly afterwards as possible. INCOME' TAX .  Prime Minister what action the Government int'end'to take in connection with the paymenfc of income tax. T t has been stated iri the press that the right honourable and learned gentleman says he is not liable, and that he does not"" intend to pay income tax to any of the States. Ifc has come to my knowledge that each State is going, to claim income tax where it has been in force. We are liable to be summoned'at any moment for the payment of income tax in two States, and I wish to know whether the Governirient intend to introduce a Bill defining which State is to have the income tax, and so prevent any possible litigation, which must surely follow if we do not pay income tax. If we pay incometax to one State we are not exempt from payment of income tax to the other under present"" circumstances. I ask the Prime Minister' if lie will make a - statement as to the position of the Government on the'- subject, and whether they intend to introduce a Billj so that honourable members will know where"" to pay their income tax.",16
12,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"Ir i a case of this kind a 1 Bill would not be of any use. The question depends entirely on' constitutional considerations. Whether the law passed' by individual' States' for the collection of income tax applies to .Federal incomes can only be decided under the Constitution, arid any Bill we might intrwluce to say that it should or should, not be collected would be 1 useless; because it could not prevent the tax frombeing, collected if ' it werecollectable,', and itcould' not make it alegal right if it were not. a legal light already. Therefore, my honourable friend 1 will see that there is no necessity for. a Bill. I have'eome to the conclusion, founded upon decisionsin other countries, particularly in America, that federal incomes are not chargeable with income tax imposed by the States. That is the position which I shall take up, but I hope that I am not going to be made a scapegoat, and to be sued, because in that case I should have individually to pay my cost of defend1 ing the action. It is a personal question for any officer of the Commonwealth, or any one who receives his income under the Commonwealth to decide whether or not he is liable to a States and we cannot intervene for the purpose of saying that we shall pay the cost of defending such actions, or otherwise interfere, because that is uo affair of the Commonwealth.

ALIEN IMMIGRATION.",16
13,Mr SPEAKER,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"The honourable member for Bland has handed to me an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to consider a definite matterof: urgent public importance, namely, "" the adminisfcration of the Immigration Restriction' Act."" Five Jwnorable members liaving ri«vrii in their places', Question proposed,",16
14,Mr WATSON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D," I think ib is' necessary that the attention of the Government,, and of the House,- should bedirected bea-number of considerations in connection withfche administration of the Act which waspassed a few weeks ago - It may have been noticed by honourable members;- in connection with the outbreak of smallpox on a China steamer,- thab amongst the 1 I quarantined people were23 Chinese, each of whom, on one pretext or another, was eligible for admissioninto Victoria, so far as appearances went. Thirteen .of < them permits to return to, Victoria, ostensibly having at one. time been domiciled and the. others had exemption certificates. According to the newspaper accounts,, the whole of them were, eligible to. enter Victoria, although not being,, immigrants .from any other State in the Commonwealth. If we are to recognise exemption certificates and permits that have been issued.in the past by varipus State Governments in rather a wholesale fashion, then for, a considerstreets able time to come,, the express desireOf of this Parliament when passing the Immially gration Restriction Bill will be very largely defeated. It . is. a matter common knowledge that Chinese, beforeleavselect ing anyone of the States in the past; always applied, whetherthej intended return or. not, for certificates or permits, prove that they had been, domiciled there here, with the object as. has been this, proved by various people, of. submitissued ting them, inHong Kong or some Act, Chinese port, to. the. highest bidder wished to .come here., It hag. been proved that an immense traffic - has been done, in that way in these certificates, with the sult that the whole object of the Chinese Restriction Act* has. been defeated for years, past. In Queensland, too, it was proved, only very recently; that a number of certificates, hod been forged, and i was only by an accident almost that one or twp individuals}, were bowsled out. There was no possibility,- o£ proving how. many of these had been; used, in the that is, how many Chinese had obtained admissionto, Queensland, on these forged to certificates,; and the methods followed, the various State,Governments in.regard.to theidentification, ofi people;, who-, are posed, to have once resided in the States have proved .altogether ineffective. It mirst be apparent that,. to,an ordinary'European, one Chinese, is so. essentially like another,unless they differ very materially indeed regards agen-r-thajj it is impossibleto rely even, upontheir photographs/for the identimania fication of; the persons properly, entitled hold, the certificates* Mr Wilks:-We . might identi% them, by thumb marks.",16
15,Mr WATSQN,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"-It , has been suggested that thumb-mankg might be relied upon-, there is another system known, as. the Chinese. Bertillon system of measurements, which, perhaps, would be better even than thethuinbhad, niark method; of identification, owing to its, readiness of application and reliability here,, for purposes .of'detection.",17
16,Mr VL SOLOMON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"At Port Darwin we have always taken their photographs, and attached them to the certificates.",17
17,Mr AVATSON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"That has been done in Queensland.also, but has.proved.altogether ineffective. I defy any one to identify any dozen Chinese that. I may pick up in the ofMelbourne, or any other city. course, Chinese who differ very materifrom one another cau be selected, but it is. much more, easy, so far as detecof' tion by European eyes is concerned, to a dozenChinese who have a have similar appearance than to choose the to same number of persons of European r to race. In any case it seems to me that is. a very serious, risk of leakage from cause, and; if certificates are to be under, the. Immigration Restriction I trust that the Government will see who that the method ofidentification relied upon, will, be so completeas to, place it beyond almost the possibility of. dpubt that rethe people returning are those whom they claim to be. Another matter deserving of consideration, is the migration of these people from State to State-fch e point referred to by the honourable and.' learned t member for South Australia,,. Mr Glynn, a few minutes ago. The restrictions applied to Chinese in the various States differ very materially.. In Western Australia past; they have no poll tax, but a restriction, of one Chinese immigrant every 500 tons, burthen of the by ship bringing them fco the State. In Queensland a £ 3 0 poll tax is imposed, and supthere is a restriction of one Chinese to every 50 tons burthen. In New, South Wales the imniigrafcion is restricted to one Chinese for every 300 tons burthen, and a poll tax of £100 is imposed. In Victoria as. there is a restriction of one Chinese to every 500 tons,.bufc no. poll tax. In Tasthe restriction is one Chinese to to every 100 tons, and a poll tax of £ 1 0 is imposed. In South Australia, the restriction is one Chinese to every 500 tons, but there, is no ppll tax. It will thus be seen that there is a considerable difference of but methodin the various States in respect to In regard to other coloured aliens or immigrants there is an even greater variety of legislation. Several of the States have an equivalent of the Natal .examination test; that is to say, they can insist upon a language test as far as these general immigrants are concerned. 'That applies to New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia, but in the other three States there is no such restriction. It seems to me that, while holding in view what has just been stated by the Prime Minister in answer to the honourable .and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, it would be advisable, if constitutional procedure will allow, to retain the various State Immigration Restriction Acts in operation for a considerable time to - come, because if they do nothing else they will prevent the undue migration of these .people from one State to another. It does not seem proper that where a State has taken - comparatively effective measures to prevent the influx of undesirable people, it should - be suddenly s'ubjected to an inundation :f rom those States where no precautions have been taken.",17
18,Mr COXUOY,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,How would the honourable member overcome the provision of the Constitution regarding freedom of commerce and intercourse between the States?,18
19,Mr AVATSON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"I will leave the interpretation of such niceties to the professional element in the Chamber and out of it. I do not pretend to be able to interpret that delicate point as clearly as I should like, but, speaking as a layman, I do not think the term "" intercourse "" in the Constitution relates to anything more than trade and commerce-as the context seems to indicate. I do not think it would be any bar to the 'continuance of existing restrictions upon immigration in the various States. Whether the Constitution would allow immigration laws to be passed by the various States in addition to those already in force is a matter upon which there would probably be «raver doubt, but I do not think there is .anything in the Constitution Act which - applies either to the disuse or the repeal of the Immigration Restriction Acts at present in force in the States.",18
20,Mr DEAKIN,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"In the United States "" commerce "" is held to cover passengers. - Mr WATSON - Of course, if that is so it would' undermine the position I have taken up with regard fco the migration of people from one State to another.",18
21,Mr VL SOLOMON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,But we are not to be bound by the United States Constitution or practice.,18
22,Mr WATSON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"No , but it is possible thatfcheJudges of the High Court that is to be constituted will be to some extent guided in their interpretation of the Constitution by the decisions given elsewhere under somewhat similar conditions. At the same time, looking at the matter merely as a layman, I do not think that we are bound to accept that interpretation.",18
23,Mr GLYNN,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"In America, the freedom of intercourse between State and State depends upon an Act of Parliament, whilst here it is provided for in the Constitution.",18
24,Mr WATSON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"The question as to what the powers under the Constitution really amount to may require to be argued out before the proper tribunal. In the meantime, pending any reference to the High Court and a decision being given by high authority, it seems to me that we should put the strictest rules in force, in view of the fact that unless we do so several of the communities which constitute the Commonwealth will find themselves placed at a disadvantage from their own point of view. Wherever the Constitution will allow of it, an interpretation should be placed upon it in the direction of maintaining the condition of affairs that previously existed. I think most people will agree that we should endeavour to disarrange as little as possible the conditions existing prior to federation. Taking New South Wales as an instance, we had a very strict Chinese Exclusion Act, and our Immigration Restriction A ct was also very severe, as far as its administration was concerned. What I urge is that the strictest possible interpretation should be placed upon the Constitution in regard to these Immigration Acts, and also that the greatest care should be exercised with respect to the recognition of the exemption certificates to which I have referred. Another matter to which I would like to call the attention of the Prime Minister concerns more directly Western Australia. In that State there is a law under which it is possible, or has been possible, to import coloured labour under contract, one of the conditions being that these labourers are not to be introduced south of the 27th parallel of latitude. In addition, any person importing a labourer under the Act and, of course, all brought in under the Act are under contract-ha s to enter into sureties for his return, when demanded, to the country whence he came. The labourer under the Ac t is entitled to enter into a fresh agreement at the completion of the first one, and an agreement may be abrogated under certain conditions by a magistrate; but any labourer found in AVestern Australia, not under contract to any employer, is liable to be deported at the will of the Government. The expense of the deportation has, of course, to be borne by the man who originally imported the labourer, and, further, the last employer of - a labourer not under contract, is liable to a fine of £ 5 0. The point to which I wish to - draw attention is, as I am informed, that there are now 300 or 400 at least of these "" walk-aboub "" coloured people, as, I think, they are termed in Queensland-that is, time-expired labourers-in Western Australia who are not under any cantract, and are therefore liable to deportation. Further, a large proportion of them have, as, indeed, was inevitable, leaked southward very considerably beyond the 27th parallel of latitude, and the local authorities, it seems, will take no steps whatever to deport them, holding that the whole question of emigration and immigration is in the hands of the Federal Government. I believe that even when the power was within their purview they took no steps to carry the Ac t into effect, as was originally, or, at any rate, ostensibly intended. A number of these coloured labourers, I am informed, have been guilty of crimes for which alone, under the same Act, they are liable to be deported. After serving a term of imprisonment a labourer is liable to deportation, but in that respect the Act has not been carried into effect. In fact, so as my information goes, no steps have been taken by the AVestern Australian Government fco carry out the provisions of their own measure, and latterly the authorities have excused themselves on the ground that such, powers are within the purview of the Federal Government. The deportation of these men need cost the FederalGovernment nothing, because there exists in regard to every one a bond from the original employer, undertaking to defray the cost of the passages of time-expired labourers to the place whence they came. I do not wish fco go into the matter at greater length, because it seems to me that the whole question of the recognition of exemption certificates, and of the migration of these coloured people from one State to another, including those in AVestern Australia, of whom I have spoken, is so important as to deserve the most serious consideration the Federal Government can give to it. We all, I believe, hope that the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, even though that Act was passed in a form of which some of us do not approve, and which we think will render it comparatively ineffective, will make up to a large extent for any defects there may be in its provisions intrinsically, That is the reason I have directed the attention of the House to a number of instances of leakages - which will materially, for some time to come, affect the operation of this measure. We shall no doubt be told that these exemptions will in time run their course. I admit that these certificates will be a diminishing quantity, always providing that no more forgeries of the nature perpetrated on the Queensland Government are brought into existence. At the same time, even allowing that no more forgeries are perpetrated, I am given to understand that the number of exemption certificates and permits in existence is very considerable, and that nearly every one will be found to be of value to some one in China. In fact, we find that on several occasions these certificates have been practically offered by auction in Hong Kong to the highest bidder who came within a reasonable degree of the description set out. I am even informed that the tonnage restriction of A'ictoria., instead of helping the poor Chinese by letting them off a poll tax, has resolved itself in many instances into the shipping companies imposing a good round far poll tax on their own account on would be emigrants. But I do not propose now to delay the House at greater length. I merely \ is k that the Government shall take these matters into consideration and make the administration of the Act as effective as we hoped it would be, and as the Government promised it should be.",18
25,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D," I propose to make a few remarks on this subject afc once, instead of waiting for further speeches, because I take it that the remarks made by the honourable member for Bland cover a good deal of the ground, .or most offcheground that can be covered at this early stage of the * operation of. the. Aot in a speech, endeavouring, to - elicit information. I do notregret that the honourable memberj has* moved the adjournment of. the House. It is as well, that the administration, of an. Act of. this* kind, should be watched withgreat care by all honourable members ; and. that it should.be so watched is-welcome tome. I do nob shareany anticipation rof the Act proving ineffective to its working* I can see enough already - to-satisfy me that the Act can be, and,. I think, will be-effectively worked. But there - are certain circumstances hanging, over as. the result of previous legislation, or administration on the part, of the States-; and these circumstances have to be dealt: with in relation, to the laws under, which they arose; and: judgment on the effective working of the Immigration Restriction, Act musb nob be founded, on those isolated instances. There is the case of the perinibs. The vessel, Eastern) arrived, with, we are told, 23 Chinese, who were eligible to enter Victoria. Does the. honorablememberrecollect on what dabe that; vessel, arrived ?",19
26,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,Wibhi n the last few days.,20
27,Mr WATSON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"Les s bhan a week ago ; about Sunday, I think.",20
28,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"It is brue bhat some of these Chinese hadpermits, butwhether the exact number was thirteen I cannot,, on short notice,, state.",20
29,Mr WATSON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,I do not bind myself' bo the number.,20
30,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"But exemption certificates under bheVictorian. Act are nob; generally usable. The only provisibn iii,the! Act for exemptions is the power given to. the Governor in. Council' to exempb anyperson or classof persons by pr.oclamationi published in the Government Gazette, and. there were not likely to be many such persons on: board, the Eastern. But as to.permits, it is only fair to say, bhat it has become necessary bo recognise bhem? up>to-.a. certain point,, for the-reason thab theyweue legalizedby Sbate. Acbs whichwere in. existence when they were issued-, and; which at thab time conferred, cerbai-iii righbs ib was. nob expecbed. srrbseq-uenb legislation/ would altogethertake away. But there is. a good dealt of force ini what the honourable member for Blandhas said regarding the possibility of trafficking in permits-.fchrough the wantof proper identification. Upon, that point I have-already taken, I think, blie best, sbep open, bo me. The officers have asked whebher bhese permibsare to.be recognised, and the answer given has-been that the-presentation of a permit will be evidence upon, which to-exempt the applicant frpm the operation of the Act, if he is clearly identified as being the person to whom the permit) wasissued. The officers will haye directions nob to accept permits unless they, are abundantly, satisfied bhat the persons presenting them are the persons fco whom they were originally issued, so that any atbempt to commit a fraud will be dealt wibh, with, as much scrutiny as it is possible to besbow. upon such a .subject There is an additional reason for that. If honourable members.turn: to,section-3 of the Immigration Resbrdction A ct which we passed, they will see that among those excepted from its operation areAny person who satisfies an officer that he has formerly been domiciled in the Commonwealth or in any, colony which has become a State. Now a permit; if the person presenting ib is identified, may be some evidence of previous domicile, so that under the administration of our own Act there is cast upon us a special care in this respect. That care is 1 beingexercised under a minute which has been-issued; in which ""domicile"" is defined by a.paraphrase of a judicial definibion of theterm. When I say a paraphrase; I mean a rendering of'fchedefinition in simpler language. The paraphrase is as follows:A man is domiciled iii that place in which he has voluntarily fixed the habitation of himself and his family, not for-a mere special aud-temporary purpose, but. with. the. intention,, of making ithis permanent home. l It seems, to me that a good many permits have been issued, in the past with a somewhat insufficient recognitionof thevalue of the word- ""domiciled,"" and the-great deal that it implies as evidencingan intention--to make a permanent home in the countiry in which domicile is claimed. The definition, of which I have spoken; will be enforced in iiegand, to all, applications to enterthe Commonwealth i on the ground of haying been previously domiciled, there. Honourable members will, see, therefore; that, in these two. particulars a lauge improvement is likely to ensue by reason, of a clearer identification ofi. the applicant being necessary,, and by insisting that thesedomicile shall not be claimed except upon the ground of permanent habitation. It will be admitted'that the* object of many coloured aliens-who have entered the-Compassengertraffic. monwealth in the-past has been to-go to the places where they were born, , as soon as they had heaped togetherenough wealth to enable themto live in ease in their; 1 cheap countries. Those who havecome here with such an object are not domiciled here, , because they do not this countiy their permanent habitation. In cases where that can be evidenced, or says it will not allow anyinhabitant ascertained; no permit or exception will, made on. the groundof domicile. These that section apply 1 two matters, I think-, meet the principal part of my honourable friend's request for information; W it h regard to the Immigraclearly, tion Restriction Acts-, I have, already a statement to the effect that before end' ofi the session; I propose to ask. House to leave their administration to»the Commonwealth. It may be that a simple provision or two to that, effect will, be suffiour cient, because,, as I have jjreviously pointed out, the-proper administration of the educaquestion, tional, test will generally suffice to render unnecessary the application of. the tests imposed under the various Alien Imadministration migration Restriction. Acts of - States. With, regard to the educational test, I may state that steps, have that already-been taken to ensure - that, it. is applied in a way which is. not likely to lead any evasion by reason of parrot learning or tions ? learningby rote. In . other words, whatever test we - impose will last only for a short term when it will be supplantedbyanother, so that there will be no.opportunity for coloured' immigrants comingtfrom.abroad to learn it like-a parrot. There is a third matter upon which.I. think the information .1 can give-to the-House will satisfactory. I do not know that there is .any other point that I can refer the importance ofi the use of. the word ""intercourse,"" which is contained in tion 92 of the Constitution Act. The application of that word' is involved, question whicht must, sooner or later anise between the States* in connection, with; passage of Chinese from; oneState into another, whether by border or by port. It most important question. I do-not wish to give a legal opinion now, although I think there is-a good deal, of warrant for-the. clusion that "" intercourse;"" used) in the in which it is used in: the Constitution! must imply something, additional and - commerce, and in that case it is hard to suppose what, it can i m p l y beyond That; however,, isa 1 back matter which, will more properlyarise between the: States,- and is not subject to interference on; the pant of the Commonown wealth until the Commonwealth takes over the administration-as itihas a right to do - of theChinese restriction laws of the intend' to. make various States.",20
31,Mr CONROY,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"Supposing that one State from be another State tocross its borders, would",21
32,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"The section would apply if the citizens of, that State made were British subjects. It would clearly the apply there. Whether, the specific prothe visions of the Chinese Restriction Acts whichhave their territorial operation, except so far as they are interfered, with by Constitution or laws, would be sufficient to give to others free intercourse, isanother which I do not think I ought to attempt to decide at the present stage. If we take over, as I hope we shall, the of these Acts,.it.will;then fall the to our lot to have to decide it aud administer the law accordingly, aud the sooner happens the better pleased I shallbe.. Mr WATSON.:-Would not that involve to the sweeping away of any border restric",21
33,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,It would give us an opportunity of' deciding a question of that kind in the courts. As to the Western Australian law; I think that is a matter which the honourable member for Bland has brought forward more by way of illustration be found to be than of complaint.,21
34,Mr FOWLER,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"It isa. big, complaint in to except Western Australia. MB . BAJftTON,-That may be so, but I secthink that-the honourable member for Bland was really pointingrout that, what happened in: a under that law might be paralleled by similar abuses under other, laws.. I want the to' say. withreference to that, that I have been, and am still,, making, inquiries asfco is a the administration of' similar immigration restriction! and Chinese restriction-laws-in , the other States,, with. a. view to. ascertainconing' what are' the: abuses which: require way remedy in thefuture, and' to what extent Aefc, we candeal with; abuseswhich have octo trade curredi n the past.",21
35,Mr GLYNN,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,Will the Prime Minister say whether the administration of the Immigration Restriction Acts affects migration between State and State 1,22
36,Mr BARTON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"That is a difficult point, but the administration of the Commonwealth Restriction Act cannot affect migration between State and State. Our law, which almost entirely supersedes laws passed in the various States, relates to immigration into the Commonwealth, and no more. The difficulty confronting a person who is undesirable will be to gain admission to the Commonwealth. When he has got into the Commonwealth on the supposition that he is desirable, there will be no difficulty about his passing from State to State. That I think must be an indispensable condition of any law which deals with the Commonwealth as a whole. I hope this explanation will satisfy the desire for inquiry by honourable members, and that they will see that this matter is being dealt with in no inactive spirit.",22
37,Mr OMALLEY,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D," I am very glad the honourable member for Bland brought this matter up today. The Chinese are a very clever, cunning, and deceptive people. If weimagine that we caninventany methods of restriction, or any form by which they can be kept out of this country, then we are cleverer than any other people who have lived upon this earth. They tried every sort of scheme possible for the mind of man to invent in the United States, and still the Chinese got in. We must understand that the Chinaman who comes to the country does not come to live in it or build a home in it . He comes here to get a couple of hundred pounds, with which he can return to the flowery kingdom, where he is an emperor on a small amount. Consequently he is here purely for the purpose of acquiring that couple of hundred pounds, and the certificate which he gets from the State and takes back to China which is a part of his assets. It is a part of his external income, because another Chinaman is prepared to pay a good price for it, and all his friends will subscribe enough to enable him to get out here, and become as well off as the man who came back to become an independent emperor in the community where he was once hard up. I think it would be a good plan to have a picture of every Chinaman taken; let that picture be the certificate, and on i us have his measurements. We shall have \ him in the photo, and after he returns it will be very hard for him to find another Chinaman with all the measurements which that certificate will show. He may find one, and I say we shall want psychological experts to read their very souls if we wish to keep these Chinamen out. I do hope some means will be devised, because we do not wish to see this country overrun with these people. They come here and live upon nothing, and they can accumulate money where our race would starve. I trust the Government will lose no opportunity to carry out their pledge to the people of Australia in connection with the Immigration Restriction Act, by seeing that these gentlemen are kept in the country God selected for them and intended they should live in.",22
38,Mr CONROY,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D," However much this House might desire that the various provisions of the State Acts should be put into force, we ought not to forget the 92nd section of the Constitution Act, by which it is provided that trade, commerce, and intercourse between the States shall be absolutely free. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, if the larger meaning is to be given to that word "" intercourse,"" then it seems impossible for us to restrict the passage of these people from State to State. I may mention that this point was before noticed by the honourable and learned member for Indi, and as far back as the time of the Convention in 1897 he referred to the difficulty, and to what was intended by the Constitution. Though, upon looking at the report of the Convention, I do not find that he gave particular instances, still it is perfectly clear that at the time it was seen by members of the Convention that once we were federated, and a law was enacted upon the point, or even before such a law was passed, trade, commerce, and intercourse would be perfectly free, and that the word ""intercourse"" should have the fullest meaning possible. Really it does not seem that we can give it any other meaning than that passengers from State to State should be free. The fullest meaning must of course be given to the words "" trade "" and "" commerce,"" and if we give any meaning to the word '- intercourse "" at all, it must be that persons residing in the several States, no matter who or what they are, must be allowed fco go t let from one State to another free. If we go back to precedent and look to the meaning put upon the word "" intercourse"" in America, we find that thereA law of a State imposing a tax r^Jon passengers arriving in the ports of such State from a foreign country, is a regulation of commerce and void. So that, even if the word "" intercourse "" were left out, we should find that under the words ""trade"" and ""commerce,"" it would be impossible to place any barrier whatever upon any person passing from State to State.",22
39,Mr ISAACS,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"-That is the deduction from what is known as the "" passenger cases.""",23
40,Mr CONROY,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"That is the deduction from those cases, as the honourable and learned member points out, and I say that that was clearly in his mind at the time he spoke in the convention. Though I have not before me the reports of the conventions held in Melbourne and Sydney, still from the report of the Adelaide convention it is perfectly clear that some other discussion must have taken place upon the subject. The honourable and learned member for Indi at that convention very clearly referred to the "" passenger cases,"" and quoted from the book to which I now refer - Baker's Annotated Constitution of the United States. Looking into that book I find another clause here stating thatThe statute of New York imposing a tax on passengers from foreign countries landing at the ports of thab State, and holding the vessels liable tor such tax, is unconstitutional. Henderson v Mayor, 92 US., 259. I see also here the name of another case cited, from which it appears possible that a Chinaman got into one State and wished to pass to another. no report of the case given here, but from the name of the case it is evident thab some case such as has arisen here had arisen bhere. The case cited and approved is "" Chy Lung v Freeman 92 US. 275."" No doubt Freeman was then Secretary for Home affairs in America. So that we see that under the meaning given in America to the words "" trade "" and "" commerce "" alone it was held that the passage of a person from one State to another could not be prohibited, and in no insbance could any bax be imposed upon him. How much more clear is ib if the full meaning is bo be given bo the word ""intercourse "" with us that we cannot possibly place any restriction whatever upon - A man passing from one State to another. Therefore whatever action the House might wish the Prime Minister to take, it seems to me that he has been absolutely constitutional in the course he has adopted : and I for one should feel it to be very wrong if the Executive showed any desire bo outstep the law in this matter. We have a law on the subjecb, and ib oughb bo be followed. Wibh regard bo the fear expressed thab we are likely to be inundated by Chinese because a few men may secure the exemption certificabes belonging to others, I point out that even if every man who goes away obtains a certificate, and a different man comes back in his place upon it, there would still be no increase in the Chinese population in the Commonwealbh. As we know that in all human probabiliby that would nob be the case, it is perfectly clear that we are only excitiug needless alarm when we balk aboub an inundation of Chinese under such circumsbances. Ib seems bo me that the Minisbry, in bhis case, have followed the proper course, and have nob endeavoured bo place any improper resbricbion upon the operation of the constitution.",23

43,Mr VL SOLOMON,INCREMENT S TO TRANSFERRE D,"I have a very distinct recollection that some member of the Government, in charge of the business at the time, expressed the opinion that the Immigration Resbricbion Bil l was not intended to interfere with Chinese immigration, but was designed to deal wibh a totally different class of undesirable immigrants.

In Committee of Ways and MeansConsideration resumed from 13 th cember, 1901 (vide page 8737)Item 74 - Manufacture s of metalsJf.E.L, including engines, boilers, pumps, machines and machinery, n.e.i. ; also screws, n.e.i., axles, springs, and plated and mixed mefcalware, including plated cutlery, ad valorem, 25 per cent.",26
59,Mr THOMA S,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," I m o v e That the words ""and on and after 16th January, .1902, free,"" be added. A little while ago a very long debate took place in this committee upon the desirability of imposing duties upon agricultural machinery, and, as nearly every honourable member who represented a farming constituency told us that the imposition of duties upon agricultural machinery enabled the farmers to obtain better machinery at lower prices than they would otherwise have to pay, I was almost inclined to vote for the Government proposal, because if by the imposition of duties you can obtain locally-manufactured articles which will be cheaper and better than imported articles, I am in favour of their imposition. But, whatever may be the facts in regard to the effect of imposing duties upon agricultural machinery, I , as the representative of a large mining constituency, say unhesitatingly that the imposition of duties upon mining machinery does not allow those engaged in mining to obtain better or cheaper machinery than they could otherwise obtain. On the contrary, the imposition of duties upon mining machinery makes it more expensive to all engaged in mining work. But in Australia it is absolutely necessary that those who are engaged in mining pursuits should have the best and most up-to-date machinery, if they wish to carry on their operations at a profit. Honourable members object, and I think very rightly, to the employment of cheap Asiatic labour in our mines, and I . would go further, and say that all men working in mines should be paid a fair standard rate of wages. Now, in mining for tin, lead, silver, and copper we depend for our profits, not upon the local market, but upon the markets of the outside world. If we had to depend upon the local demand, 75 per. cent, of the men employed in such mines would be dismissed. The Broken Hill mines alone produce over 80,000 tons of lead each year, of which theysell locallyonhyabout 10,000 tons. To obtain a sale for the remaining 70,000 TARIFF. tons, they have to compete in the markets of the world with foreign companies who De- employ the cheapest labour possible, and use the most up-to-date machinery. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for Australian companies to use the most modern and best appliances. I would point out, too, that machinery differs from many other manufactured articles in this, that the cost of labour represented in its price is a great deal more than the cost of labour represented in the price of other things. During the discussion of the Tariff, reference has been made to such industries as the making of nails, and of candles; but, in industries of that kind, the manual labour employed costs very little in comparison with the price of the manufactured product. W it h regard to machinery, however, the case is very different. Therefore, it is possible for countries like England and Germany, where mechanics are paid a lower - wage than is paid here, to successfully compete - with our manufacturers, who are attempting to produce some kinds of machinery in competition with those countries. Notwithstanding the advantage enjoyed by the Continental countries, a good deal of machinery is locally produced and supplied to the mines. Until two or three months ago, Broken Hill , as a mining centre, had the advantage of having free machinery. In face of that fact, I am veiy pleased to say that Gawler, in South Australia, was able successfully to compete with the world in many instances, and to send a good deal of machinery into the Broken Hill mines. But I venture to say that, notwithstanding all the protection to the foundries of Gawler, had it not been for the markets of Broken Hill and Western Australia, there would be veiy little work going on in Gawler. If you were to ask the manufacturers of Gawler whether they would prefer to have the duty which South Australia gave them and be prohibited from dealing with the markets of Broken Hill and Western Australia, or whether they would prefer not to have the protection; but to have an opportunity of going to those markets, you would find that they would prefer to have the markets rather than have the protection. I am dealing now, not with pldughshares at 36s. per dozen, but with mining machinery.",26
60,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,How does the honourable member define mining machinery ?,27
61,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Anythin g and everything which mines use I call mining machinery.,27
62,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,All engines 1,27
63,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"All engines which are used in the mines. There is a great deal of machinery which cannot be produced in the States. Machinery of a different sort from that which is being made, or machinery of a new design cannot be produced here unless the manufacturer has a guarantee of having at least more than two or three orders for that particular description of machinery. , Mr MCCOLL - For what purpose?",27
64,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I mean a big machine, for instance an engine which would cost from £5,000 to £10,000. I am not here this afternoon to deal with ploughshares at 36s. per dozen, but with large machinery which would cost from £5,000 to 10,000. Some years ago a member, of the firm of Hudson Bros, said to me-""This is our difficulty. In Australia we may get an 25 L order for a good-sized engine, but we have to sell the first one for a great deal less than cost price."" They have to get the patterns and lay down the plant for the first engine. No foundry could possibly sell the first one at anything like cost price. The second one is not sold at cost price, and the profit only begins when the manufacturer sells the third, the fourth, and the fifth.",27
65,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Nearl y all these big engines have one set of patterns.,27
66,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I am dealing with machinery of a new design. In England or America, when a manufacturer gets an order for a machine of new design, there is a very strong possibility that in a short time he will get an order for a second, a third, and a fourth, and then the profits will come in. But in Australia the manufacturer cannot depend upon getting an order for a second, a third, and a fourth machine, because there is no field here for them.",27
67,Mr MAUGEK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,' Not for mining machinery 1,27
68,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Not for a new type of machine. Although we have a good deal of mining going on in Australia, we have only one Broken Hill , one Mount Morgan, one Mount Bischoff, and one Moonta. I admit there are a few large gold mines in Western Australia. I asked a person the other day what he thought it would cost him to produce a £10,000 engine if he had to lay down the plant and get the patterns. He said it would cost him from £17,000 to £18,000 to produce the engine, as the plant would cost £7,000 or £8,000.",27
69,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Does the honourable member mean to say that Australian plants cannot do that work now ?,27
70,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I do not say that they cannot make the patterns or lay down the plants, but I point out that it costs a manufacturer £7,000 or £8,000 to lay down the plant for a machine of new design. Does the honourable member mean to tell me that if a manufacturer were ' going to build two pumping engines with different cylinders the same pattern or plant would do ?",27
71,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Decidedl y not.,27
72,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"In Australia the plant for a machine of new design has necessarily to be imported. Some years ago, when I was in Gawler, Mr F. J. Martin showed me round the works. The firm was then making 97 locomotives for the Government of South Australia. He said to me- "" Owing to our having to bring out the men and the plant, as well as the mistakes which we made, the first locomotive cost nearly as much as if it had been made of pure silver. But now of course we can produce them as good and as cheaply as they can be made in England."" If the firm had not had a guarantee from the Government to make a large number, they could not have afforded to lay down the plant to make one. Big imported machinery is not sold here every day. If a foundry could get an order for a good-sized engine, it would be a good while before it would get another.",27
73,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Does the honourable member think that these big engines are supplied from stock types at the foundries ?,28
74,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Some of them are.,28
75,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Ver y few - nearly all are ordered.,28
76,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Some of them are, no doubt; but they could not have a different plant and different appliances for turning out eveiy engine. Eveiy new invention and every new design must necessarily be imported into Australia in the first instance, and in such cases I suppose even protectionists will admit that the mining companies would have to pay the whole of the duty. It may be argued that if a high duty is imposed upon engines and machineiy, local manufacturers will be encouraged, and that under the influence of local competition prices will come down in a few years. Against that, however, I would point out that just now, in connection with the mining industry, new methods of dealing with ores are constantly being discovered, and five years is considered by mining men as a fair period at which to fix the life of any new appliances for the treatment of ores. It is stated, therefore, that by the time that local competition could commence to operate in regard tofchemanufacture of any particular type of machines or appliances they would become obsolete, and new machinery would have to be imported from abroad. Sometime ago I read a very interesting article regarding 'the principles lowed in America and En gland respectively in the manufacture of locomotives and engines generally. In England locomotives are built to last for almost any length of time, whilst in America they are constructed with a view to their use for a period of not more tlian fifteen years. The American engineers take the view that within fifteen years the locomotives will become obsolete, owing to the rapidity with which improvements are introduced into the construction of engines, and they construct them accordingly. The English engineers, however, put more strength into their engines, in order to enable them to work for a much longer period. Personally, I rather favour the American idea, because science is now making such gigantic strides that machinery which is up-to-date today will very soon become obsolete. When I visited Western Australia about three years ago I met a number of mining managers, one of whom told me that, owing to the vast strides made by science, five years was the full life of any plant used in connection with gold mining. During the Christmas holidays I visited Broken Hill and went through some of the mines there. I met Captain John Warren, the manager of the Block 10 mine, who is well known in mining circles throughout the Commonwealth. He had just made a trip round the world, during which he visited England and America, and he told me that so far as electrical science is concerned America is streets ahead of England or Germany, and that mining people are now falling back upon electricity in order to help them. If America is streets ahead of us in electrical science it would be folly on our part not to utilize the developments which have resulted from engineering skill in America, for the purposes of developing our own resources. That the price of labour is not the chief factor in the cost of producing machineiy, is shown by the fact that, although in England and Germany the mechanics engaged in the construction of machinery do not receive such high wages as those similarly employed in Australia, the American mechanics are in many respects more highly paid than our own. Yet America can still send' machinery to us in successful competition with our local manufacturers. It would be unreasonable to 4 expect small communities like ours to make such rapid developments in the manufacture folof machinery as has the United States, possessing a population of over 70,000,000.",28
77,Mr MAUGEH,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The Americans developed their industries under a protective policy.,28
78,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I will grant that, if the honourable member likes, but what I say is that if the American machinery is going to help us, we should obtain it . If the mining industry of Broken Hill had been dependent upon the machinery of ten years ago,. ancl no new appliances or methods of treatment had been introduced, or if it had had to depend upon the developments in the manufacture of machinery within the Commonwealth, not a single man would be working in the mines today. I should like to say a word or two as to how this particular taxation will affect the people of Broken Hill . We have had long discussions with reference to the great and important industries of Victoria. We have heard of three men and one boy being engaged in making horse-shoe nails, and we have also been ..told of five or six people being employed in shirt factories. I am very glad to see people employed in manufacturing horse-shoe nails, or in making boots and shirts, and so on, but I desire for a little while to direct the attention of the committee to an industry which, I think, is of somewhat greater importance than these. The mining industry at Broken Hill is at present under a cloud. Twelve months ago, in 1900, there were 7,256 men employed in the Broken Hill mines, whereas in December, 1901, only 4,862 men found work there. There was thus a falling off in the number of men employed of 2,394 within twelve months. I do not for one moment say that this reduction is the outcome of the Tariff. Of course, primarily it has been caused by the fall in the price of lead. I should like to direct the attention of honourable members to some particulars taken from the reports of the principal Broken Hill mines, with a view to show the precarious condition of the industry on the Barrier. The price of* lead today is about £ 1 0 10s. per ton. During the half year ended 31st May, 1901, the profits of the; Broken Hill Proprietary Company amounted to £87,000. They were able to secure an average price of £ 1 4 per ton for their lead, and during that half-year they produced 27,000 tons. Lead is now realizing £ 4 per ton less than the price obtained during that half-year by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. The Block 14 Company made a loss of £8,271 during the half-year. They produced 6,000 tons of lead, for which they obtained on the average £ 1 2 per ton. The present price of lead, of course, is £ 2 less than that figure. The British Proprietary mine made a profit of £23,000, being able, during that time, to obtain an average price of £ 1 7 per ton for their lead. I have already pointed out that lead is now £ 7 per ton less than at that time. Block 10 mine made a profit of £1,330, being able to sell their lead at £12' per ton. The Sulphide Corporation made a profit of £89,000, having sold their lead at £16 per ton. In giving these figures, I am leaving out odd pounds, shillings, and pence. The North Broken Hill Company made a loss of £916, selling their lead at £ 1 3 per ton; the South Broken Hill made a profit of £12,000, with lead at £ 1 3 10s. per ton ; and the Broken Hill Junction North had a loss of £1,520, selling their lead at £ 1 2 per ton. During that tune there was a profit made at Broken Hill of £213,000 ; but if some new methods are not discovered in order to produce lead more cheaply, and if"" the price remains as at present, the turnover will be £221,995 less during the current half-year than in the previous half year, so that the whole profit of £213,000 will be wiped out by the fall in the price of lead. As I said just now, the price of lead is undoubtedly the main factor, but it isone that we cannot control. In the face of this fall in price, the Commonwealth Government have placed somewhere about £30,000 extra taxation on the mining companies. The Broken Hill Proprietary, under the operation of the Tariff as introduced by the Minister for Trade and Customs, will have to pay close on 20,000 extra taxation.",28
79,Mr MAUGEE,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,That is assuming they import machinery.,29
80,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I asked the secretaries of the various companies what the taxation would mean if they had to import their machinery under the Federal Tariff instead of under f'ree-;trade, and Mr Dickinson, the secretary of the Proprietary Company, calculates the extra taxation, so far as' the company is concerned, at £19,132.",29
81,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,How does he arrive at that ?,29
82,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Le t us suppose that a piece of machinery has to be imported from the old countiy, Germany, or America valued at £10,000. Last year suchmachinery would have come in free, but if 25 per cent, has to be paid on that valuein the shape of duty, the extra taxation means £2,500.",29
83,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Canno t the machineiy be got in the Commonwealth ?,29
84,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Some machinery can'not possibly be obtained in the Commonwealth.,29
85,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,What machinery that?,30
86,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Any machinery that has to do with electrical science.,30
87,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,All kinds of electrical machinery are being made in the Commonwealth.,30
88,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"We are a population of 4,000,000 of people, and yet it issaid that we can produce anything that America can with a population of 70,000,000 or 80,000,000. The figures I have given do not refer exclusively to machinery, but embrace timber,- and all requisites which are imported. Fuse, for instance, has to be imported. Sir John QUICK - The Tariff does not increase the pi-ice of fuse.",30
89,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"It does in New South Wales, where fuse was admitted free.",30
90,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Fus e can be bought cheaply in Victoria as the imported article.,30
91,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I venture to say that fuse is cheaper in Broken Hill than in Bendigo, where it is produced.",30
92,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,I do not think so.,30
93,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"We shall have a word to say on the subject of fuse when we reach that item. Oregon timber must be imfor ported, and on that there is a duty. Proprietary pompany, as I have shown, will have to pay extra taxation to the extent of £19,137, and the Central will pay £6,787. Block 10 Company durhelp ing the last twelve months have made a profit of only about £1,300, and yet the. Tariff they will be charged £1,775 extra duty on timber. As may have been dent seen from the newspapers, the proprietors of Block lO mine have dismissed one shift men, and as at present working with one shift only. It is necessary for them to have ""a new-plant, because with the plant they now possess, they cannot work at anything like a profit; and the manager has assured me, as an outcome of visits throughout Australia, England, and America, that the plant must come from the last mentioned country. He says that it does not what duty is put on,, whether it be 25per cent., 50 per cent., or 100 per cent., this machinery must come from America, and from stock types ? he knows just as much about this work as do honourable members generally.",30
94,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"What is the particular machineiy the manager wants ? is Mr THOMAS - It is the machinery of a new plant, and I say at once that Bendigo cannot supply it .",30
95,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,It is said that Bendigo can.,30
96,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Bendig o has had exactly the same chance of sending machinery to Broken Hill that Gawler or any part of the world has had, but Bendigo has sent very little, although proprietors of - Broken Hill mines are prepared to pay cash down. Horwood's foundry has sent a little machinery to Broken Hill , and that was sent simply because one of the Horwood family became a mine manager there, and for a time machinery was sent by some of his relatives.",30
97,Mr MAUGEB,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,That is too thin.,30
98,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"That sort of thing is done every day, and what I have stated is a fact. I do not mean fco say that Bendigo as machineiy is worse than any other ; and if I were manager of Broken Hill Proprietary, and had an interest in a foundry, I should try to get some of my^ machinery sold there.",30
99,Mr RONALD,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The honourable member is a model free-trader!,30
100,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Decidedl y ; everybody does that sort of thing. What I say is that the new machineiy which is necessary the development of Block 10 mine must The be imported. The manager knows more about his work than we do surety, and,' again, no manager cares to go out of mine the countiy for machinery if he can it , for the simple reason that he can inspect it as it is being constructed. under The representative of a local foundry always enjoys an advantage over one resiafc a distance in that he can personally interview the mine manager, whilst the of latter in his turn can visit the foundry and inspect the machineiy which he has ordered - while it is in course of manufacture. Then the question, of the saving of time constitutes an important element which ought not to be overlooked. If a man has to send to America or England for a plant, at least three months must elapse before the plans can reach those countries and the matter machinery can be brought back.",30
101,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,I thought that all the machines from those countries were supplied,30
102,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I did not say so. I simply say that if a machine or engine of a new design is wanted it can be put up as a ' speculation in England or America, because there, a reasonable expectation always exists that orders for it will be forthcoming. Thus it is that a f actory in England can spend £20,000 or £30,000 upon a mere speculation. But if the proprietors of any Victorian foundries were asked to spend an equal sum upon an experiment, I think they would consider the matter two or three times before acceding to the request. I do not hesitate to say that, if no taxation were imposed upon mining machinery, and the price of lead dropped much lower than it is at the present time, the mines at Broken Hill would be forced to shut down. No Government can regulate the price of lead. I wish that they could. I wish they could do so as easily as the present Government can impose a Tariff. But unfortunately they cannot. I therefore urge that the Government ought not, by irksome taxation, to hasten the nun of Broken Hill . The mines there produce from 75,000 to 80,000 tons of lead annually. The extra taxation which this Tariff will impose upon them represents from £30,000 to £40,000. That is almost equivalent to a drop in the price of lead of 10s. per ton. The price of lead is already low enough, and yet this Tariff will practically reduce it to the extent I have indicated. In the output of lead we have to compete with the prolific mines and the cheap labour of Spain, in copper with the cheap Chilian labour, in silver with the rich mines and cheap labour of Mexico, in tin with the cheap labour of the Straits Settlements. Thus it is neeessaiy to continuously have the most up to-date plant upon these mines. I know that mining directors are veiy loth to order entirely new plants, even although it might be advantageous to do so at intervals of, say, five years. I believe that the Proprietary Company paid £100,000 for its amalgamating plant. I do not know whether the foundry at Bendigo could have manufactured that plant, but it would have been a very good thing if it could. When once a plant has been laid down, the shareholders aud directors are not particularly anxious to substitute a new one for it , .however desirable it may be to adopt that course. If we increase the cost of mining plants by 25 per cent, we shall offer an additional inducement to directors and shareholders to continue operations - with machineiy instead of securing most up-to-date machinery obtainable. The latest appliances throughout the world are those dealing with low-grade ores, and I venture to affirm .that the backbone of the mining industry of New South Wales, South Australia, and even of Western Australia is to found in the low-grade ores. During the six months ended the 31st May last, the Broken Hill mining companies disbursed £1,250,000 in wages and expenses. It will be seen, therefore, that this is an industry which we should be careful not to hamper by unnecessary taxation. I would also point out that it is not Broken Hill only which has to be considered in this connection. There are 1,250 men employed in the iron flux and smelting works at Port Pirie. If the Broken Hill Proprietary Mine were to close down tomorrow, those men would be-dismissed the next day. At Cockle Creek, in New South Wales, 600 men are employed in smelting ore for the sulphide corporation of Broken Hill . If the Central Mine were to close down these employees would also be dismissed. Then, in connection with these mines there are from 200 to 300 men employed at Dapto, New South Wales, and 350 men at Port Adelaide. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs, when dealing with this question, to think of South Australia, even if he does not think of Broken Hill , and to recollect that there are 1,250 men directly employed by the Broken Hill mines at Port Pirie, and an additional 350 at Port Adelaide.",30
103,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,We have an equal duty to think of all the States. 1,31
104,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"This industry is a much bigger one than that of the horse nail industry. The railway revenue of South Australia represents approximately £1,200,000 annually, of which sum Broken Hill alone contributes £400,000. During the last Christmas season the Barrier mines gave their employee's a week's holiday, the result of which was that the South Australian railway receipts fell off to theextent of £8,000 in that brief period.",31
105,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,I am sorry to think that that fact is not entirely owing to the holidays.,31
106,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I am merely showing that if the mines of Broken Hill suspend operations for a day or two, the result is felt in South Australia. It would be a very old serious matter to that State, indeed, if she the could not obtain her £400,000 of railway revenue yearly from Broken Hill . Last year the railway revenue derived by South Australia from the carriage of wool was £22,6(53, whilst during the same period the freight on timber alone to Broken Hill aggregated £28,000. So that really the revenue from the little item of timber alone to Broken Hill is more important to South Australia than is the railway revenue from the whole of the wool industry of that State.",31
107,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,What timber is used there 1,32
108,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Orego n timber, and it is proposed to put a duty upon it equal to -50 per cent, upon the original cost at Puget - Sound. So far as the South Australian freights are concerneditmustnofcbe forgotten .also that most of the garden produce of South Australia goes to Broken Hill . I remember that some time ago, when the New South Wales State Parliament passed an Act prohibitingfcheimportation of grapes into New South Wales from any of the other colonies, because of. a disease in some .grapes that were imported, I think, from Victoria, it was proved that in South Australia there was no such disease in the grapes, and we had some very urgent wires from the market gardeners of that State seeking to havefcherestriction removed, becauseif they were unable to supply the Broken Hill market that season it would mean ruin for them in respect to that particular industry. I may add that the New South Wales Government did remove the embargo, and the South Australian grapes came into New South Wales. I do not wish to throw the mining engineer out of work in order to give the miner work. There is no particular advantage in throwing one man out of work in order to-find work for another, but I tell the Minister for Trade and Customs that if the miner is not working the mining engineer cannot be at work. You may have a man working as an engineer in connection with agriculture; he may be making ploughshares or horse-nails, but he cannot be employed in a mine unless the miner is at work. So it is not only for the sake of the miner that I desire he should be at work, but also for the sake of the mining engineer, because if the miner is at work the mining engineer must necessarily be at work, workingfcheengines, and, if at nothing else, making repairs. I should like to see them making the engines here if possible, but they must be employed in some way or other if the miner is at work. I , there.fore, ask that the miner may be considered, not merely for his own sake, but that the mining engineer and other people may also find work. I am not pleading for the removal of this duty for the sake of Broken Hill only, or for the sake of South Australia only, but for the sake of every mining camp in Australia. I plead for it for the sake of the struggling prospecting companies. I believe that today from a mineral stand-point we do not really know what the vast resources of Australia are, and we do not wish to penalize the men who go right into the back blocks prospecting, or to penalize those companies who are prepared to run a certain amount of risk in mining development. I do not say that they do so from philanthropic motives ; I quite admit that they do not.",32
109,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,No one does.,32
110,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"But we do not wish to penalize them in their efforts to develop any new field, because the advantage that comes to them is our advantage, and the advantage of the community generally. It is really laughable when we hear the talk of the little industries we have here making umbrellas, or making shirts, and that kind of thing, when really one good mine would give more employment than would all the duties we could possibly put on in order to assist these small industries. To show honourable members how important the matter is I may mention that by this day's post I received a letter from Mr Courtney, the manager of the Central Mine, and who until a month or so ago was president of the Mine Managers' Association afc Broken Hill . I did not ask for the letter and did not know it was coming, but I am very pleased to have received it. Mr Courtney saysI regret that I was away from Broken Hill when you were recently here, as I wanted to have a brief conversation with you in reference to"" the utilization of the zinc-blende, which, as you know, we are all over-stocked with ; but which is of no value, as sales cannot be negotiated for any large quantities, the abundance of this ore in various parts of the world tending always to regulate a low price. It therefore becomes advisable to manufacture metallic zinc in Australia, and by the establishment of this industry not only supply the Australian requirements, but exportfcoother parts of the world rather than ship the ore, the condition of which is not so good as can be obtained by buyers in other countries. We propose, therefore, shortly makiug some test runs on spelter producing, which, if as successful as we anticipate, may develop into an important industry. I need hardly point out, however, that the plant is most costly, and innumerable difficulties must at first be experienced as the whole of the staff and workmen will have to be trained to the work, and whilst the requirements of spelters in Australia are very small, the product will have to compete with American and European producers. As the founding of iron, zinc, and obher industries is of great importance tofcheCommonwealth, is there no possibility of the Government offering a bonus per ton of metal prod need for at least a few years, thereby assisting and encouraging the esbablishmenb of metal indusbries whilst in bheir infancy ?",32
111,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,A protectionist letter.,33
112,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I do not say it is not. Mr Courtney addsIb has so ofben been done in growing counbries wibh beneficial results that no apology is required from ine for mentioning the matter to you. encouragement of bhis kind would greatly assist these duties. and strengthen the Broken Hill position. I do not ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to give any bonus for the producgreat tion of zinc. If he proposes to give a bonus for the production of iron ore I shall oppose the proposition, but if it is carried I think we shall then have a legitimate reason for asking for a bonus for the production of metallic zinc. I am against the bonus i system as I am against protective duties. I am not here as a member asking machinery that the Government should give a bonus, unless it is given for the production of ore, when I say it would be only fair that it should be given' in connection industry. But I do ask that we should not handicap that company in their efforts get the best machinery possible an industry which may become a very important one. These people are prepared spend a certain amount of money in trying an experiment, and while I do not ask a bonus for them, I do ask that instead handicapping them and taxing them for making this experiment, we shall leave them alone, and rather give them eveiy facility to get this electrical machineiy which they require. I say let them get at Bendigo, if they can. I would much rather that they should get. it from Bendigo than from America or Gerprehends many, and especially Germany; but, I say, if they cannot get it afc Bendigo, the name of heaven let them get it where they can, if their operations will find ployment for a number of men. I committee to omit the duty upon mining machinery, because I believe the omission will be the means of finding work not only over 7,000 men. for the miners, but for all classes of the community, and the more we can have afc work infchisway the better it will be for the Commonwealth.",33
113,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," The honourable member for Barrier, as one of the sturdy, consistent free-traders of the House, necessarily commands the respect of every protectionist, and the views which he has presented to the committee are certainly well worthy of consideration. As the representative of a mining constituency, I have no hesitation in saying that if I thought the proposed duties would in any way hamper or penalize the mining industry I should not give a vote in favour of fcheni. It is a matter of evidence and An opinion as fco what will be the effect of I should not venture to come to this House and advocate a duty, which would be calculated to prejudice the mining industry in which I am interested, not only personally, but as the representative of a mining district. I point out in the first instance that my honourable friend in referring to this item of engines, boilers, and machinery, seemsfcoimply'that t specially refersfcomining machinery, but the item refers to boilers, engines, and generally. He has not specified any particular article in the item which iron' specially affects the mining industry, because the machinery in the item affects in with this dustries generally.",33
114,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"If the miner can obtain to what he wants free, 1° do not care a jot to develop about anything else.",33
115,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"If the honourable fco member had proposed that any particular article in this item which is used specially for in connection with the mining industry of should be placed on the free list, and had shown that it could not be reasonably, fairly, or successfully manufactured in this countiy, he would have had the support of the committee. I am sure that, as a proifc tectionist, I should have supported him. But he has not done so. He has proposed that the Whole of .this bunch, which commachineiy, engines, and boilers generally, should be placed on the free list. then in That is impracticable.",33
116,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,I will exclude plated ware emfrom my proposal if the honourable and ask the learned member desires it .,33
117,Mr MAUGKK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The honourable member's proposal would affect the employment of,33
118,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"This is one of the most important items in the Tariff, and if the honourable member's proposal were carried we might as well shut up shop, so far as protection is concerned. If the honourable member succeeds in placing this item, which affords reasonable protection to the iron foundries and the engineering industry, on the free list, he wiD inflict a deadly blow to the protectionist policy. I challenge him again to enumerate any particular article of machinery which is required in connection with mining, and to show that it cannot be produced at a reasonable price in Australia. If he can do that I will support him. Let us take boilers and macliinery generally. There is in Victoria a large number of iron foundries. The result of some twenty or' 30 years' expenditure of capital, the 'training of employees, and the acquirement of special knowledge has been the building up of an industry of which not only Victoria but the whole of Australia ought to be proud. Instead of a proposal being made, which is calculated to inflict a fatal blow on the industry, it should receive the sympathetic support of every Australian. These foundries, as I have been reminded, employ upwards of 8,000 hands, and certainly ought not to receive a knock on the head, on an occasion such as this, merely to suit a particular cry which has been raised in favour of free-trade.",33
119,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Kil l the mining industry and what will happen ?,34
120,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"That is a cry which is always raised by extreme free traders. Protection has not killed the mining industry in Victoria. That industry has grown up alongside the engineering and metal-working industries here, and this duty will not k ill the industry in Australia generally. Let us take Bendigo-the district which I represent-o r Ballarat, or Castlemaine. In each of those places the mining industry and iron foundries and engineering works have grown up side by side. There has been no antagonism inconsistency between the two industries. On the contrary, the mining companies have enjoyed the convenience of having foundries carrying on operations alongside their mines. When a mining company requires machineiy for a particular purpose it is able to go to the engineering workshops and foundries next door, where the mining managers may supervise the manufacture of the machinery they require. The honourable member admits that it is a convenience to the companies to be able to do that, instead of having to send the plans and specifications to America, England, or Germany. The establishment of these works has been adistiuct advantage to the mining industry in Victoria, just as it has been an advantage to the agricultural industry to have agricultural implement makers carrying on their operations in factories not far from the fields. The conjunction of field and factory is a necessary part of our industrial life. We should not have the field in one countiy and the factory in another. The approximation of these two agencies in the great work of production is a great convenience, and in the common interests of progress. I contend that the proximity of the foundries to the mines has resulted also in the invention of machinery for use in the mines. It has resulted in the invention of gold-saving and power appliances, and in appliances generally calculated to promote the interests of the mines. Then, again, we have in the proprietors of these foundries, and the work-people engaged in them, a population growing up with an interest in the mines, and among whom we find, very frequently, call-payers who have helped to maintain the mines. It would be a very poor district indeed which had to depend upon mining alone, and which had no diversity of occupation. It would have a very doubtful future before it . It is desirable, therefore, that every mining district in which there is a population clustered should endeavour to promote the growth of manufactories and other industries in addition to mining, so that, if the latter should fail, there would be other industries to act as a prop and a stay in a time of distress. Since this question has been brought up, I have given my serious attention to it, in order to ascertain how the duty would affect my district and Australia generally. I have sought information in every available quarter, and T have arrived at the conclusion that the protective duties which have ruled in Victoria hitherto have resulted in the firm establishment of manufactories and of manufacturing interests, which have not in any way increasedfcheprice of the articles required by mining companies. I was asked by one body to support a reduction of the duties on mining materials. In reply I invited the body to specify the articles which were considered to be affected by these protective duties, - but I have not received a reply up to the present time. It was not able to specify any particular article used in connection with mining the price of which had been increased in consequence of protection. I challenge 'the honourable member for Barrier to name any machinery used in his own district which cannot be produced in Australia afc a price as reasonable as that at which it can be imported.",34
121,Mr BEID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Then there is no need for protection.,35
122,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"But if we once remove the duty, we invite the swamping of the Australian market by the productions of foreign countries. We do not want that.",35
123,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Swampe d with abundance,35
124,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Tin s duty acts as a steadying factor to prevent countries in which labour conditions are inferior to our own from sending' ship-loads of machinery here to swamp our manufactories and k ill our markets. In this case. While protection has resulted in the creation of a valuable industry, it has not increased the prices which have to be paid by the users of boilers, engines, and obher mining machinery. lenge any member of the committee to produce a list of prices which will show that bhere has been an increase. I have nob advocated the imposition of protective duties bo benefib the capitalist. It is primarily and principallyfcobenefit labour that I have supported the doctrine of probecbion.

I should be prepared to consider a proposition for putting patented machinery on the free list. That would be quite consistent with the protective policy, because such machinery - cannot be made here. Of course, if the patentees like to come here, that will remove the difficulty; and why should they claim the monopoly to manufacture their patented machinery in foreign countries 1",36
140,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Now the honourable learned member is backing out. Will he vote for the admission of patented machinery free ?,36
141,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"If the honourable member will specify what machinery he wishes to admit free, I shall be prepared to consider the proposal.",36
142,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"There is, of course, the danger that a slight patent alteration in a machine may be put forward as an excuse for entirely removing the duty upon it .",36
143,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Formerly , in A ic- r toriaJJiere was a difference in the duty on patent axles and common nut axles. A difficulty of definition arose, and a difficulty of definition will arise in this case. If a proper definition can be formulated I shall be quite prepared to support a proposition in that direction, subject to the condition that it is not a class of article manufactured here.",36

At one stage, in considering the Tariff"", I felt inclined to support a proposition for the placing of electrical machinery on the free list; but, on making inquiries, I found that certain firms in Victoria had started establishments for the production of electrical machinery. One firm alone has already spenb £5,000in the developmenb of electrical machinery under the Victorian Tariff, and they sa3^ thab they are quite prepared and quibe able to produce all the ordinary articles required in such machinery. Consequently, it mighb be very unfair indeed to them to place electrical machinery on the If the free lisb.

149,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Of course the miner has bo be trotted out by the free-traders. Formerly it was the farmer with them, and now it is the miner. I should like to know what the free-braders have ever done for the miner. Free-traders are primarily interested in importation. Very few of them are engaged in the great work of call-paying. How much have they paid for the developmenb of the great mines at Ballarat, Bendigo, and Broken Hill ?",36
150,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,How much have the protection isbs paid 1,36
151,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"The probecbionisbs are dependenb upon the mines. The iron founders of A^ieboria are concerned in the growbh and prosperity of the mining industry, because if ib wenb down they would go down. They are more interesbed in the growth of mining than are the importers. Whab do the imporbers care aboub the developmenb of our mining industry ? Therefore it ill becomes those who are so hysterica] about the interests of the foreign trader to talk abdut the poor miner and the poor farmer. Little do they care about the poor miner and the poor farmer, except to trot him out occasionally for the support of their free-trade arguments. On these grounds I strongly object to the proposition for sweeping away these industries. At the same time if the Minister, yielding to any information which is placed before him, can see his way to place any particular item on the free list, I shall be quite prepared to favourably consider a proposal of that kind.",36
152,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," After the very admirable speech from the honourable member for Barrier, showing how the mining industry is affected by this duty, I was rather surprised to hear the representative of the mining district of Bendigo talk as if the miners were not to be considered at all. If there was one thing more clearly shown than another by the honourable member for Barrier, it was not that one individual, but that many thousands of individuals, would be affected by this duty. But we have the honourable ancl learned member for Bendigo, in effect, saying-""You may talk about your thousands of miners; you may talk about your workmen employed here and there, but what is their voice compared with the voice of the iron founder at Bendigo, or the iron founder somewhere else."" We have this sort of thing going on here until one wonders what the rest of the people of Australia are thinking about, that they do not rise up and protest. I am quite sure that so soon as an opportunity is afforded to them, they will rise up and protest. We have honourable members getting up and saying that a large number of men such as the miners are not to be considered at all, in effect that thousands and thousands of men engaged in these industries are' not to be considered, and asking what are they for except to pay taxes. Of course, if these people are going to submit to all this taxation in the interests of one or two manufacturers, there is no more to be said. It is in the power of honourable members to deprive the manufacturers of the opportunity of levying duties upon the men. I suppose there is nothing which more fills any man with indignation than does this taxation. In the case of the horse-shoe nails we had the honourable member for Bourke stating that, although there was only one manufacturer of such nails in all Australia, all the rest of the people must not be considered ; that simply and solely because a man calls himself a manufacturer he is the only one in Australia to be considered. AVe had a majority of the cpmmittee saying that that was a very sound doctrine to lay down, and that although there was only one manufacturer of horse-shoe nails they ought to support him, and give him an opportunity of levying a tax on the people of Australia, as the} did, although it was shown that we 7 could afford to give the man the money a dozen times over, and otherwise employ from 20 to 25 times the number of men that were employed in his factory. Now, the honourable member for Barrier has shown that in one mining district alone some thousands of men are affected by this duty, and that if they are affected, men all over Australia, certainly in New South AA'ales and South Australia, are affected. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo does not consider those men for - a single moment. While he was speaking I did expect to hear from him this argument"" Do you not know that putting a duty on mining machinery puts ore into the ground ? c It enables the miner to discover where the ore is. It enables him to locate a particular portion of it . The miner at Bendigo, by getting a 25 per cent, tax on his machinery, his shafts, his pulleys, and everything else which goes into the mine, is able to discover the amount of gold there is in a particular place; in fact, if it were not there before, it would put it there""because surely that is the only ground on which he can 'defend the extraordinary assertion made by him. AVhilst we are told that the men employed in the Victorian foundries will be affected if the duty is abolished, no explanation is given of the fact that the number of men engaged in metal and machinery works in New South Wales is greater than in Victoria.",37
153,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"If the honourable and learned member excludes those engaged in smelting, there are less men engaged in the metal industries in New South Wales than in Victoria.",37
154,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I include those who are engaged in smelting, because they are just as dependent uponfchemining industry as are the men employed in foundries. The contention of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports appears to be that we should only consider the men who are engaged in a particular industry, but I declaim against any such doctrine. We are here to legislate for the benefit of the of the people of Australia, and not for the advantage of any particular class, however good that class may be. It is clear that there are engaged in industries connected with metals and machinery in New South Wales 12,000 men, as against 9,400 men similarly employed* in Victoria.",37
155,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"That is not the case. If the honourable and learned member includes in his statement the men engaged in smelting operations, he should also embrace the men engaged in mining in Victoria.",38
156,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I am quite content to do that, and to also include the men engaged in mining throughout Australia. Then it will be seen how very injurious it would be to impose this duty.",38

158,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Certainl y I would.,38
159,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Does the honourable and learned member contend that the amount of co - ii produced depends upon the fiscal question ?,38
160,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I am content to leave out the coal miners, and still show a very . large number of men-seve n or eight times the number in Victoria-wh o are dependent upon the mining industry. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports apparently argues that if a tax is imposed upon the miners, it will enable . them to discover where the gold is.",38
161,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,A protective duty is not a. tax.,38
162,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Accordin g to that, when a manufacturer asks that a duty shall be placed upon the goods produced by him - and we have seen lobbying carried on here to a disgraceful extent;-w e are to understand that the imposition of the duty will not benefit him. When a man shows us that he has derived £16,000 from duties in the course of four years, are we to stand that, although he was enabled to take that money out of the pockets of the poor people, he was conferring a benefit upon them ? It has been reserved for the honourable and learned member for Indi to tell < the farmers, in connection with the bonuses, that although it was true that £ 1 had been taken from them in the shape of duties, they had received back 4d. in the form of bonuses, and consequently ought to be satisfied. They were told that it was wrong for them to cry out, because four pennies were larger than a. sovereign. whole When a worker comes along, no matter what he is, his views and interests are regarded with the greatest contempt by honourable members on the other side of the Chamber. 4,800 miners have had to leave Broken Hill during the last six mouths, but not a single attempt has been made by Ministerialists to help them in any way. On the other hand, the minei-s have had taxes imposed on them to still further depress their condition, and hurry them into other work so that wages may be forced down. Why is this ? Because they are poor ordinary miners. If a manufacturer all the - rest of comes along",38
163,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,In his drag.,38
164,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Yes , or as a member of a club, the Ministerialists at once doff tlieir hats and bow down to him. They inquire how many men he employs, and on being told that he finds employment for ten men - or , as in the case of the manufacturer of horse-shoe nails, seventeen men-the y say - "" Dear me, we must see to that, and at once impose a duty which will allow you to collect £30,000 from the public."" Because 4,800 miners at Broken Hill are not able to combine, and are not represented by a manufacturer, they are to be snuffed out of existence, and treated with the contempt and contumely that the protectionist and legal Ministry always shows towards the worker.",38
165,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Which division does the importer belong to?,38
166,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I do not care how the importer is dealt with, provided equal disabilities are inflicted upon the rest of the community. Because the working man cannot make representations to the Government in the same way as do the manufacturers, that is no reason why they should be utterly ignored. The case made out by the honourable member for under- the Barrier is so clear that no attempt has been made to refute his statements. The honourable member for the Barrier has dealt with only the one big mining centre of Broken Hill ; but other places, such as Kalgoorlie, might be cited. I have no doubt, however, that Western Australian members will deal with this question from their own point of view. I know that protectionists do not like discussions upon these matters, because if the truth get abroad, the chance of allowing manufac turers to extract money out of the pockets of the people is gone. The honourable memcan ber for the Barrier has made out so clear case, that it is incumbent on us to sweep away all duties which press on industries; and I shall give my hearty support to any proposal to place on the free list such necessaries as have been mentioned. Progoing tectionist members say that they desire see those articles manufactured in the Comand monwealth ; but they must know that patent articles cannot be manufactured here, and that we must, in this connection, always be fourteen or 28 years behind the ceived. times. That may be a very estimable idea - on the part of gentlemen who have just risen to the political economy of the 17th century.",38
167,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Canno f the honourable member conceive the possibility of a support the amendment. patentee coming here, to manufacture ?",39
168,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"If the name of any patentee, with information as to what how much he was going to manufacture, were given, a case might be made out his behalf. But, even then, why should patentee with £30,000 or £40,000 in his pocket be given the privilege money out of the pockets of the people when we deny a similar privilege to the working man or the farmer? Why should the representatives of wealth always be listened to, and those of labour ignored ? I do not ask the committee to give consideration to the workers, except on the simple ground of justice. I ask for them no benefit I would not ask for all. The utmost that is claimed is "" a fair field and no favour."" The Ministry readily assent to give the wealthy manufacturer the privilege of imposing taxes upon others, while every day workmen have to compete with their fellows for wages which are regulated by the law of supply and demand.",39
169,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,That is only in New South Wales.,39
170,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Wage s are regulated the law of supply and demand throughout the world. A manufacturer under protection is given practically a State guarantee that he will get so much return for money, but no such'guarantee is given to the farmer against storm or drought, miners or tributaries at Bendigo that they Victoria. will not "" bottom a duffer.""",39

172,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"No guarantee is in such cases, simply because no guarantee be given. What a miserable admission a that is of the weakness of the policy of protection. Is it that honourable members are misled, and cannot see that we have no right to call on the bulk of the people to pay taxes in order to keep one individual ? It has been shown that taxes on to the mining industry decrease employment artificially lower the price of lead to the extent of 10s. per to n ; and why such a policy should be persisted in requires some clearer explanation than we have yet re",39
173,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," I assume that we are now going to a division, and I want to Say only one word, although I intend at a later stage to deal with the subject somewhat more fully. I find myself unable to I am anxious there should be a considerable reduction such in the rate which is proposed by the and Government, and I hope that a reduction will be secured; but I regret that at on the present time. I am not able, in view a of the condition of the industries in this State, to support the absolutely free introof extracting duction of machinery.",39
174,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," I think that the item of machinery should be placed on the free list. I cannot altogether agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo in his assertion that the miners will benefit by the extra cost of machinery. The honourable and learned member has cold us a good deal about Bendigo; and probably the conditions there are different from those in the northern parts of Queensland and Western Australia, where I do not see how the miner can benefit in any shape or form by a tax on machinery. I do not say that miners individually are going to benefit directly from a tax being put on or taken off machinery, but I know that in many cases a very small-margin of cost will pre.vent a mining property being developed. I by have known a mine lie idle simply for the want of a few hundred pounds.",39
175,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Is there an instance in his Victoria where that has occurred ?,39

Twentyfive years ago that claim was worked, but because the men who held it at the time could not find a cerbain sum of money - I think-the difference between the amount which they required and that which they possessed represented only aboub £ 3 0 or £ 4 0 - the mine was abandoned. As a result, it was lying idle for 20 or 25 years.

No doubt we shall be told that it is only in a probected country bhat we can secure the establishment of wages boards. The honorI able member for Melbourne Ports will protell us that, and he will tell us of the 26 cost industries which come within the purview of the wages boards in Vicboria. We all recognise that the rate of wages in Australia is probably higher than in any other country.",40

188,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I do not even except America. But that cannot last. Such a state of affairs can only arise in a new country, aud we must gradually come to the normal conditions existing in other countries. It is impossible that in any one country the rate of wages and the standard of living can remain for any length of time higher than in other countries. What I desire to point out particularly is that, while endeavouring to protect one industry, we must guard against injuring another, the injury of which may mean the throwing of thousands of people out of employment, as was instanced in the case of Broken Hill this afternoon. It must be remembered that those people in such cases are thrown upon the unskilled labour market, which is not protected by any wages board. That seems to me to be the difficulty with which we have to contend. We make special efforts by means of wages 'boards and other systems to protect the skilled trades, but we are making no attempt to do anything for the protection of unskilled labour. The introduction of machinery into the various trades to cheapen production has thrown thousands of skilled .workmen upon the unskilled labour market. That is where the great competition arises, and where we find the lowest wages. It is there also that the bulk of the people are employed.",41
189,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Surely it is not correct to say that the bulk of the people are employed in unskilled and unorganized labour?,41
190,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I did not say unorganized, but unskilled labour; and when I speak of the bulk of the people being engaged in unskilled labour, I mean that they have not been brought up to any trade or served an apprenticeship to any trade. I know that in many of what were originally skilled trades the labour is now performed by unskilled workmen. Take, for instance, the highly complicated trade of the compositor. A compositor required to serve an apprenticeship to learn the picking-up of type, while today a man without having served any apprenticeship at all, goes to a linotype, and in three or four days can perform the work.",41
191,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,They are binding them to that trade now in Victoria for seven years.,41
192,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Well , there is uo need for it . Honourable members will agree with me that any ordinary intelligent lad can pick up the operation of type-setting by the linotype in three or four days.",41
193,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,It requires skilled knowledge.,41
194,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Does the honourable member know anything of it from personal experience ?,41
195,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"There may be a little technical knowledge of use in some instances, just as one man may shovel mud better than another. But we know that where these linotype machiues are in use, a mechanical engineer is kept to look after them - It would be madness on the part of any firm to allow the mere operator of a linotype machine to attempt to repair it if it got out of order. I do not wish to go into that matter, but I desire to impress upon the committee that the mining industry at the present time wants a good deal of watching. While in some portions of Australia trie mining industry is being largely extended, I notice for instance that Victoria, which once occupied the premier position amongst the States in the matter of the production of gold, is now only third or fourth upon the list. I do not attribute that to protection, but what I wish to show from it is that we should be very careful in imposing duties, not to hamper this industry in 'any way. I believe that for many years in Australia the mining industry will be one of the most important in the country, and we should make every effort to lighten the burdens upon people engaged in it . If we allow them to get machinery in free, they will have so much more money to spend upon the development of the mines. It is possible that large mining centres may spring up in different parts of Australia which will give employment to thousands of men. If the machinery required can be produced as cheaply and as well here as in other parts of the world, those interested in mining are not going to be stupid enough to send elsewhere for it . Where it is necessary to import machinery for carrying pn the industry, we should make every effort to have that machineiy admitted into the Commonwealth free, and if it is not possible to admit it free, the duty should certainly be fixed at a much lower rate than is proposed in this Tariff.  upon this question, I should like to know just what the item means, ""n.e.i., including - engines, boilers, pumps, machines and machinery, n.e.i.""",41
196,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"It means those which have not been previously specified, less those which are declared to be exempt.  - able members who have been speaking upon this duty have really not known what they were talking about.

I am not inclined to vote that it should come in free.' So far as mining machinery' is concerned, I think it.should be admitted at the same rate as agricultural machinery, namely, 15 per cent. That is as far as I would go. The honourable and learned member for Indi has - said that we could cite no specific or concrete case to show that free-trade has led to machinery being imported any cheaper, I will give the honourable and learned member two instances which have come under my own observation. One is a case in which machinery was brought into Queensland from Victoria, and the other a case in which machinery was sent from Queensland into South Australia. The Moonta Mines 'Company, South Australia, called for tenders for a winding plant, the contract being open to manufacturers in the old - countiy as well as in the different States of the Commonwealth. The result was that a Queensland firm was successful, notwithstanding that it had to pay a duty of 25 per cent, on the machinery which it sent into South Australia, and also to pay wages on a higher scale than those ruling in the southern States. If chat is not a sufficient argument in favour of allowing mining machinery to come into the Commonwealth free I do not know what is.",42
198,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Did contract relate to machinery which could be made by only the particular factory in Queensland 1  winding plants in Victoria or in South Australia, where, according to the boasts of certain honourable members, the finest foundry in Australia is to be found ?",42
199,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"No winding plant has been imported into Victoria for years.  South Australia. The machinery supplied by the Queensland firm was so good that the Moonta Company has repeated the order, and the factory is now making-up, to its order, a plant of the same kind.",42
200,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Does the honourable member refer to Walker's, of Maryborough 1 ",42
201,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"They want protection, too.  refer is that in which a boiling-down works, established at Barcaldine, in Central QueensThere is land, distant some 460 miles by rail from the coast, called for tenders for a boiling-down plant. A' Victorian firm, in competition with the Queensland firms, including those of Rockampton, which had only to send the machinery 460 miles by rail, secured, the contract, although it had to forward the plant to Queensland and pay a duty of something like 25 per cent. If that is not another argument in favour pf free-trade in machinery I do not know what is. If themanufacturers in the different States have been able to compete against one another, and send their machinery from one State to another, notwithstanding the border duties, is that not one of the strongest arguments for free-trade that could be given 1 I can vouch for every word which the honourable member for Kennedy has said in regard to mines being shut down for the sake of a few pounds. I am sorry to say that I have had an interest in some such mines myself, and I know it is a fact. In one particular instance up north, we required machinery to work a mine, but we had spent so much money on the mine that we would not pay any more, and it was shut down. Some one else came along and erected the necessary machinery, with the result that the mine is paying today. If mining machinery had been allowed to come in free at the time no doubt that mine, instead of proving a duffer so far as some of us were concerned, would not that have been a source of wealth to us.",42

Surely the honourable and learned member does not think he is going to draw me like that ? The machinery was to cost something like £800, and»if could have had the 25 per cent, duty knocked off no doubt we would have an effort to secure it . We had lost so much money in the mine, however, that we would not go in for the plant owing to excessive duty. If the manufacturers of one State have been able to compete against those of another in the open market, notcommittee withstanding the border duties, surely with by the Government. Inter-State free-trade and a larger market they can now carry on successfully without manufacturers of mining machinery will this duty? As the honourable member for Kennedy has suggested, however, Walkers' Limited still want protection. These firms say they cannot do without it . We have had an. instance of this in the telegram received by the Minister for Trade and Customs from the Clyde Engineering Works, setting forth that they cannot carry on without protection. I inquired about the .truth of that statement when I was going through Sydney recently, and one of local ironfounders said to me- "" Do you not think we should be fools if we refused accept a 10 per cent, or 25 per cent, tective duty when we could get it ?"" That is the line they go upon. If the Minister for Trade and Customs desires to add £ to every £100 that a manufacturer makes, a man would be fit only for a lunatic asylum if he refused to accept it . I fused to take £ 1 5 per month on top ""screw,"" when offered to me, honourable members would _ think "" there was some-. thing gone wrong with the works."" the Minister for Trade and Customs alongside wired to me in Queensland, as he that, wired to the Clyde Engineering Company,and asked whether I could carry on without a 20 per cent, addition to my "" screw,"" replied that I could do it very well, honorbelieve able members would say of me- "" He is a bigger fool than we took him to be.""",42
203,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,I did not communicate with the Clyde Engineering Company.  read a telegram from the company.,43
204,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,It was sent to me unmachinery solicited. 25 AI ,43
205,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"It was evidently sent is to upon perusal of a report of the debate.  thing. The sender of the telegram read the report of the debate which had taken we place in this committee, and immediately wired to the Minister that the company made could not go on without the duty. It is a peculiar thing that although manufacturers have sent circulars to us saying the that they cannot carry on unless they are given a certain amount of protection, their works have not been shut down when the has reduced the duties proposed No doubt, if we . admit mining machinery free, the local . still continue in existence. If they have"" been able to compete in the past, notwithstanding the existence of the State Tariffs, surely they will be able to carry on now if they have Inter-State free-trade and a certain amount of protection against the outside world. I maintain that an industry can be over protected, and I recently saw a very good illustration of that in a book by Curtis, entitled Protection and Prosperity. the In America, they have protected many things so highly that people have had to do to without them. If mining machinery is procheapened, there will be a great development in mining in Northern Queensland, but if its price is raised to a prohibitive 1 5 amount, people will not go in for mining speculations. The honourable member for Barrier spoke very highly about the f I rewonderful plants which are imported from of my the old country, but at Mount Morgan I have seen Australian manufactured machinery which compares favourably If with the imported machineiy standing it , and people there have told me even if it cost a little more, they would prefer to use locally made rnachinery, because then they can get any alterations and I made which may be necessary. I do not in decrying our local manufactures. I should like to see factories, especially iron foundries and machinery shops, established in every town in Australia.",43
206,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"There is no female labour employed in iron works, and the hands get  admitted free, but I do not think "" that all machineiy "" not elsewhere included"" should be admitted free. No doubt the honourable member for the Barrier is anxious to have mining machinery admitted free, just as I should like to have admitted free many things which are used by my constituents",43
207,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"-If agricultural machinery can pay a dvity of 15 per cent., why should not mining machinery do so ?  duty of 15 per cent, on agricultural machinery, because it falls upon the hardest workers in the country. But the fact that there is a duty on agricultural machinery affords no reason for imposing a duty upon mining machinery. The duty upon mining machinery falls upon those engaged in one of our primary industries. Everything that the miner eats, wears, and uses is taxed. The very rope employed to haul the ore from the bowels of the earth is taxed. It may be said that a duty upon mining machinery will not fall directly upon the miners; but if it does not affect, them directly it affects them indirectly. At Broken Hill as soon as the price of lead and silver went down miners wages were reduced. The miners, however, cannot be protected as other workers are protected in Victoria by the operation of wages boards. Victorian representatives want protection for everything that their people produce,-but when the representatives of other States want protection for their productions, Victorians cry out that these productions are their raw material, and should be admitted free.",44
208,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Has not Queensland got white labour by entering federation ?  it, and is willing to do so, but if that is all she is to get for entering federation the sooner she leaves it again the better. The natural result of things would be to make Queensland white, but Victoria will never be white, because she has a system of permits which enables aliens to return here, and she is breeding aliens here. In Little Bourke-street there is a bigger canker spot than the black labour in Queensland. Every industry in Victoria employing two men and a boy must be protected, but Victorians are not so ready to.protect the industries of other States. Every Victorian whom I have heard speak in this chamber is a protectionist for sentimental, not for economic reasons. The lord high priest of protection, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, is a protectionist for sentimental reasons. When I referred to the iron foundries he could* not refrain from interjecting about the non-employment of women, and if it is not the ladies with him it is the poor downtrodden factory hands. The Victorian system of protection requires the passing of special Acts to protect the workers.  workers from protection.  from protection! The Victorian protectionist would like to see all Victorian industries pro-, tected, but he is amost ardent free-trad er in regard to things that he has to consumehimselL When the timber merchants of. Queensland were down here it was very funny indeed to observe their movements. In Queensland they are rabid protectionists, and I am very pleased that they are to get a dose of their own physic. They looked upon the Victorian protectionists as brothers in arms, but what are they to get from them ? They know what they will get when the timber duties are reached. Timber is the raw material of our butter boxes, and on top of a duty on timber we have a duty on mining machinery. The Tariff is stifling one of the principal industries of Queensland, and that is mining. There are no gold mines in my electorate. The miners there are opal miners, and as they use the old windlass,' their machinery is taxed. Everything they use is taxed; even the oil Cruras they use for bucketing up the stuff are taxed. Although this paragraph is not quite the smallest in the Tariff, I think it includes more items than does any other. I should like to know from the honourable member for. Barrier if he really means to admit free the whole of the items in the paragraph. , I think he is anxious to get only mining machinery admitted free. I am with the honourable member for Newcastle to this extent,, that if we cannot get mining machinery admitted free I should like to .see the 25 per cent, duty kept on. I should like the Minister to tell us whether he is going to make any difference, or whether he intends to stick to the cast-iron 25 per cent, duty all through., There is only one course open to me. I have either to vote with the Government for the 25 per cent, duty, or to vote with my own party for the free admission of the items. I shall just leave the Minister to think for a moment what he should do.",44
209,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," I admit that the honourable member foe Barrier might have undertaken some classification before he moved his amendment, but I would point out that the Government have not attempted to classify the items under this heading as they should have been if they were to be dealt with in any intelligible manner. How can such terribly inclusive letters as ""n.e.i."" be expected to operate with judgment *or discretion ' in respect of items covering such a range of trades and businesses as the manufactures of metal ? There ought to have been. some more enlightened attempt at classification of the items by the Ministry. Failing such attempt on their part, we can hardly expect an honourable member' to undertake the task. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Barrier felt that, as mining machinery might include items which are equally useful in other industries, from the way in which the items had been grouped in the Tariff"", his only course was to propose the removal of the duty from all the items. I was rather astonished at some remarks that fell from the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. He, quite unnecessarily I think, introduced the old fiscal argument, but whilst I cannot compliment him on his argument, I must compliment him on his splendid audacity. I would not for a moment impugn his acuteness by saying that he did not see the contradictoriness of his own facts, but, in spite of that contradictoriness, he brought forward figures as to the wages in protectionist countries in* support of his argument that primarily protection was for the assistance of the labourer, and not of the manufacturer. Mr MCCoix - What he said was that he supported protection in the interest of the labourer here, and not of the capitalist.",44
210,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"But , in addition to that, he said that if he did not think that protection primarily assisted the worker he would not support it . I am not objecting to that statement. What I am objecting to are the illustrations brought forward in support of it . The honourable and learned member gave the wages of boiler-makers in five or six countries, and he said that it was against those wages that the workers of Australia had to compete. Every one of the countries in which the wages were below those in Great Britain, a free-trade country, was a protectionist country. There was one protectionist country above Great Britain, and that \vas the United States of 25 M 2 America. In making the comparison with England he omitted to allow for the longer hours worked per day by the American worker, for the wages he gave were per day. The American boiler-maker works ten hours. Even if the wages that have to be competed against be as low as those of Italy or Germany, as regards boilers, there is a natural protection that overcomes all that difference. Yet the honourable and learned member, whose astuteness I would not for a moment question, coolly put these figures and facts before the committee as an argument in favour of protection. He intimated that a cargo of boilers might arrive if this duty were not put on, but such a cargo is a thing I have never heard of. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports questions the correctness of the statements made by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa regarding the number of hands employed in the iron trade in New South Wales as compared with Victoria. According to the returns furnished by Coghlan, if we take the iron trades as including iron works, en-' gineering works and foundries, and railway carriage and rolling-stock manufacture and repairing works-and you cannot separate the iron work in the railway shops, which is veiy considerable, from other work, because the figures are not given separately-w e find that 6,800 hands are employed in New South Wales as against 6,500 in Victoria. Abandoning that basis, however, and adopting another, we find that by taking the engineering and boilermaking, brass and copper and dock operatives in New South Wales, and comparing their numbers with the brass and copper workers, engine and machinery and iron industry employees of Victoria, as detailed in the return laid upon the table of the House, there are 5,528 hands employed in Victoria, as compared with 5,166 in New South Wales.",45
211,Mr MAUCSEH,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,I bring out an altogether different result.,45
212,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The return from which I obtained my figures is that furnished by'the Ministry and laid before the House.,45
213,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"That is the return upon which I ' have relied. Compare those engaged in engineering works in New South Wales with those employed in Victoria, and see what the result is.",45
214,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"That would not be fair, because the engineering workers are' divided into a greater number of classes in New South Wales than in Victoria. . M i \ MAUGER - Why mention the dock employees ? What have they to do with engineering ?",45
215,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Does not the honourable member know that Mort's Dock and Engineering Company in Sydney carry on one of the largest ironworks in Australia? Mr WATKINS.""-They obtain more State assistance than any industry within the Commonwealth.",46
216,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I am not speaking about State assistance. Mort's Dock and Engineering Works is one of the largest in the Commonwealth, and the men who are emploj'ed on ships should not be excluded from consideration, because nearly all. ships are now constructed of iron. If the policy of the honourable member for Port Melbourne excludes ships and encourages the people who make what the ships carry, is he to get the credit for the labour employed in the making of the articles whilst - his opponent is not to be credited with the labour employed in repairing the ships which bring them ?",46
217,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,- I only want like to be compared with like.,46
218,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The honourable membei wants a comparison that will suit his own view. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo Stated that the Australian ironworks could supply machinery as cheaply as it could be imported. If that statement is correct why do the local manufacturers need protection ?,46
219,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,To steady the market.,46
220,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Surely the cost of conveying machinery and boilers from England to Melbourne and from Melbourne to Bendigo is a sufficient steadier for the Bendigo market.,46
221,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Boiler s are conveyed from England to Australia as cheaply as from Sydney to Fremantle.,46
222,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"They are not conveyed from England to Bendigo as cheaply as plates manufactured in England can be made into boilers in Bendigo. The honourable member stated that the Bendigo works could make machineiy as cheaply as the English manufacturers, and if they can, they should not need protection. The aspect from which the honourable and learned member views this matter is shown when he states that the mining industry grows up beside the iron works. Now, I say it is the iron _ works which grow up beside the mining industry. The whole tendency of those who support the protectionist policy is to place the secondary industry in the more important position, although it could not exist without the primary industry. I would ask whether this duty is proposed for revenue or protectionist purposes. Those honourable members who have spoken in its support have advocated it as a protective duty, although it covers a large class of articles, and it can - only be protective in regard to those articles which can be produced here. This protection gives to the manufacturer the power of levying duties which the Custom-house ought to collect. The duty cannot be protective in regard to that large class of articles which are patented-whic h can only be produced by plants out of all keeping with the requirements of Australia., and involving the use of patented machines. All this numerous class of articles will have to pay a heavy duty in order to gain admission to Australia.",46
223,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,To what particular class of articles does the honourable member refer ?,46
224,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I have already told the honourable member, and I cannot be expected to go through a list which would be yards long for his enlightenment. There are such articles as I'have referred to, and many of them, and if duty is charged upon them it will add to the cost of conducting certain industries. Now, does this seem reasonable ? It is proposed to protect certain industries, and to encourage new manufactures, and in order that these industries may be kept abreast of the times, and production may be cheapened so as to allow of competition with the world all the newest processes will have to be adopted, and the best appliances employed. Yet the first thing that is done when an attempt is made to bring new industries into existence or to extend their usefulness is to impose a tax of 25 per cent, upon the machinery required. Under all the circumstances, I think it would be infinitely better to abolish the duty than to retain it in its present form.",46
225,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," A great deal of time today has been devoted to the question of the admisskra>of mining machinery, which thei honourable member for the Barrier has moved shall be absolutely free. But while he and many others are anxious to see mining machinery admitted free, I do not think that such a course is desirable. At the same time, I am .satisfied that we shall not be able to cany a duty of 25 per cent., and recognising that without machinery it is impossible to develop this great primary industry of Australasia, I desiie to move as an amendment on the amendment that the duty on machinery be 15 per cent. I do not wish to occupy the time of the committee, but to get to business at once; and I ask my free-trade friends to accept my suggestion as a compromise, without further debate.",46
226,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"S mit the further amendment after the div on has been taken on the amendment be re us. , Mr OMALLEY - If there is going to be a division on the question of free-trade, I am not so sure that I shall propose that the duty bo 15 per cent.'",47
227,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Thin k of the West Coast miners.,47
228,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I hope the honourable member for the Barrier will recognise that all laws are the result of compromise with stipulations. Reason must govern the world, because reason is, or ought to be, the basis of Christian civilization; and when we refuse to reason, we return to savagery. I therefore ask the honourable member for the Barrier to withdrawhisfree-tradeamendment, and accept my amendment as a compromise, which will be fair all round. It will enable our great mining industry to be developed, and the difference, as shown in the cost of carriage for America and England, will help to make up the loss the local manufacturers will have to sustain.",47
229,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Migh t I ask that the course which has hitherto been adopted in discussing the Tariff be adhered to, and that there be a vote taken on"" the^ amendment which I have proposed. If we losewhich I hope and believe we shall notthen the amendment now suggested may be - submitted, while if we win, nothing further need be done.",47
230,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"The practice pointed out by the honourable member for Barrier has been adopted by the committee in the past, and I see no reason to make any alteration.",47
231,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"V e i y well.  rise to point out the difficulties which inexperienced members, and those not expert on the Tariff"" question, have in ascertaining really what is covered by this item. The item may be described as covering a multitude of sins of the Tariff"". To my surprise, I find that the item covers a lot of fencing material in the shape of .standards, which hitherto, in some of the States at any rate, have been admitted free, and which are an actual necessity in places where timber is veiy scarce. In South Australia these standards and their fixings are largely used on all pastoral runs, and will be more extensively used in the future than in the past, because of sub-divisions and the necessity for vermin-proof fencing. And yet, under- ""n.e.i.,"" this fencing material will pay a duty of 25 per cent. On the northern system of the South Australian railways the large bulk of the fencing material for the support of the wires is formed of this veiy material, and I would ask the Minister whether he cannot see his, way to admit it free. The standard to which I particularly refer is a patent, which in any case will have to be imported, so that there is no question of any local industry.",47
232,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"There will be nothing to prevent the honourable member subsequently moving that this material be placed on the list of exemptions.  to be a veiy considerable reduction in the proposed chity on mining machineiy. In South Australia, and at Broken Hill and various other places, too much of the necessary raw material cannot be placed on the free list. I admit that this is a big item, having regard to the whole list. That, however, is more the fault of the Ministry, because it is not fail to honourable members to submit a proposition of this kind, which covers, perhaps, hundreds of lines under ""n.e.i."" Honourable members, who would probably be prepared to support a duty on a number of the items for revenue purposes, are forced into the position of voting against the whole, which represents some £80,000 of supposed revenue.",47
233,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"More than that.  much is represented. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo suggested that honourable members should discriminate as to the lines they want on the free list, and I 'have instanced fencing material as showing the difficulty of knowing what is really covered. In connection with mining machinery, improvements are taking place every day, and a new invention may in a very short time put a machine out ofdate in the work of development. I think it was the honourable member for the Barrier who referred to the fact that some machineiy which was imported for the Broken Hill mines about a month prior to the introduction of the Tariff-machinei y which was not obtainable in any part of Australia-woul d have to pay £2,500 in duty under the special circumstances which exist today. I i we had a schedule of the-various kinds ""of machinery covered by this item, we should be in a much better position to deal with it . I u this connection, I would ask. the Minister for Trade and Customs if it is not possible to f uriiish honourable members with a detailed list of the lines thus included, so that we may know exactly upon what articles this duty is to be imposed. I am satisfied that the item must cover over 100 different lines which are dutiable at 25 per cent, and I am convinced that a number of honourable members opposite would not be prepared to vote for the imposition of such .a heavy rate if they knew exactly the articles upon which it was to be levied. I hope that the Minister, if he will not - consent to the inclusion of mining machineiy in the free list, will agree to a substantial reduction of the duty proposed. If any State in the group has been benefited by the mining industry, it is South Australia, .which has been rescued from an apparently hopeless position on three or four occasions by this great industry.",47
234,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"-In some of those cases the mines were within its own bounds.  instance, refer to Moonta and Kapunda. South Australia has also derived great benefit from the Broken Hill trade. There are millions of tons of low-grade ore in Broken Hill which can be treated by date machineiy with a small margin of profit, but for a considerable time, at any rate, that machinery must be imported from abroad, probably from America, where the manufacture of mining machinery has reached a very advanced stage. I cannot understand the terrible dread which some honourable members entertain that our local foundries will be closed, especially when we come to consider that the wages paid to the operatives in such establishments in America are in some instances higher than those which obtain in Australia, and that an enormous natural protection is represented by the freightage on foreign importations. The exceedingly heavy rates charged upon our railways for the carriage of machinery to mining.fields, and the costly nature of its transit, where no railways exist-representin g in some cases as much as £ 3 0 and £ 4 0 per ton - constitute a tremendous tax in themselves. Anything, therefore that we can possibly do to encourage the mining industry in Australia we ought cheerfully to undertake. There is an extensive tract of countiy in the Commonwealth which would be valueless were' it not for its mineral deposits. I agree that mining upon this continent is merely in its infancy. I believe that in many parts of Australia the opening up in the future of a single mine will provide an amount of employment equal to that which is at present furnished by half the factories in Victoria, despite all the artificial en-"" couragement which the. latter have received. No industry gives a greater fillip to other industries than d.oes that of mining. It has a special claim upon this House, because of the enormous cost invol-vedoin the opening up of mining .fields. The honourable and learned member for' Bendigo has said that the foreign trader does not help the mines, but I have yet to learn that the manufacturer is any more of a philanthropist than is the importer:",48
235,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Is he not?  The manufacturer does uot put one cent into anything from philanthropic motives. He invests his money for the purpose of deriving some material benefit, exactly as the importer does. I venture to say that if we could get the share list of the mines throughout Australia, we should find that a very large number of importers contribute quite as much to the call-paying roll as do up-to- the manufactuners. We have seen from the returns which have been quoted today that the Broken Hill mines are almost upon the verge of closing down. I wish also to point out the different attitude taken up by protectionists in regard to their own pet industries. If honourable members look at the list of proposed amendments upon their files, they will see that the demand is that every line of raw material required for the manufacturer shall be placed upon the free list. When we look down the schedule, it is evident that protectionists have no confidence in any man who"", is manufacturingmachinery in Australia of the particular class they want; because eveiy line of such machinery is on the free list. The moment we put it .to them that the made-up ai'ticle of the primary producer is the manufactured article of the secondary producer or manufacturer, they .say- "" We can make those in Australia."" But it is a singular fact, which that list will show, that there is hardly an implement or tool of trade used in their industries which they do not want to have on the free list. They care not a rap about an industry alongside of them. If that industry is struggling to turn out the very class of manufactured article which they require in connection with their own industry, they say- "" We want this on the free list,"" or they say that there is not a sufficient number of those articles used in the country to warrant the establishment of an industry for their manufacture. AVe have found the same thing in connection with deputations waiting upon Ministers to get certain lines of goods on the free list. I say the whole thing is wrapped up in. selfishness. All> kinds of articles which they require in connection with tlieir manufactures they want on the free list, and in addition they want to have the raw material they use also placed on the free list. I say at least let us have a few things, which mean life and death to the mining centres, on the free list, and if they are not to be placed on the free list do not put a duty of 25 per cent, on them, which really means over 100 per cent, when we come to consider the natural protection they have in the cost of bringing them here. Imagine a duty of 25 per cent, on boilers. An honourable member said we might bring out a cargo of boilers. Imagine a cargo of boilers coming out, and what would the freight on it be? Taking machinery as a whole, it will be found that, with the exception of furniture and bulky articles, there is no line of goods on which freight is higher. On our railways the freight on mining machinery is reckoned in the same way, and there is a sufficiently heavy tax upon mining machineiy-whic h ma)' be required to develop resources a thousand miles from the sea-board-in the cost of bringing it from the sea-board. The least we can do is to put a moderate duty upon such machineiy, and there Cannot be two minds amongst honourable members that wherever it is possible we should put on the free list every line which is going to be of advantage in the production of minerals.",48
236,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," The honorhere able member for South Australia has made a comparison between the manufacturer and the importer. He says that one is as much a philanthropist as the other. Possibly, they both act from motives of self-interest and, so far as that goes, tlieir starting ground is the same. But the effect of the two classes upon the country is very different indeed. The importer buys in a foreign land, and covers his risk by insurance. He has always, either at sea or on shore, 20s. in the pound, less wear and tear perhaps. He has always that in hand, and is in a comparatively safe position. As a rule he can get the cost value for the article he imports when he cannot get his profit upon it. But in the case of the manufacturer in a new countiy, such as this, starting a new industry, he is in an entirely different position. He has to put up his buildings, secure his plant, get his workmen, and provide them with their weekly wages; . then he has to purchase the raw material for his manufacture. When all that is done, he has to search out and compete for his market. So far as regards benefit to the country, there can be no comparison whatever between the importer and the manufacturer. To say that if we were a' nation entirely of importers, it would be the same as if we were producing all we require for ourselves is simply arrant nonsense. '",49
237,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"If we did not produce we could not import, surely ?",49
238,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Of course not; and thereforethe more we encourage production the more we shall be able to import ,49
239,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,We wish to encourage it by removing taxation upon it.,49
240,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"We wish to encourage production by giving the work to our own' people, and by increasing the wages fund of the country we shall have more money to spend on things we cannot produce ourselves. The honourable member for South Australia says that we desire to have on the free list every tool of trade used i u connection with our manufactures. I challenge that statement. It is not correct. What we desire to have admitted free are special or patented articles that are not made here, or articles one or two of which only are required to supply the wants of the whole country. Those are the only things we wish to have admitted free. They are .not things which can be made at all, but, used in manufacture here, they will provide work for our own people; X agree with the honourable member in his sixteen complaint about the vague and general in which this item is drawn. If we conbrought sider what is included in this one item stated here, we shall find that it covers scores of items upon which there were different duties under the Tariff. In the case of axles we had duties running from Is. an arm to 25 per or Bendigo manufacture. cent., engines from 30 per cent, to free. In this item we have boilers along with screws; engines along with cutlery; and things which have no relation to each are put under the same duty. It is awkward, therefore, to come to a definite understanding as to what the duty should be in this case. .1 believe there by this item some hundreds if not thousands of .different articles. On many of articles the dutyshould be 25 per cent., on some 20 per cent., on many 15 per cent., and"" a very great many of them should be fiee. Screws, for instance, should be free; we are not making them here. them Another article largely used by the public is hollow-ware, which was free under Victorian Tariff. We do not make hollowgeneralty, and gave us no ware, and we probably will not do so for generation in this country, and I think should also be admitted free. The main ground upon which the honourable member for Barrier has submitted his amendment, which I think he cannot have the remotest idea of carrying, because the committee will not be so unfair or prejudiced as carry such a proposal, is that mining machiby neiy ought to come in free. The honorit. able member, in advocating that mining machinery should be admitted free, the opportunity of having a tilt at colonial mining machineiy. I venture say, and the honourable member's speech discloses it, that he knows very little indeed of the subject upon which he was talking. He may know what machinery they have Broken Hill, but he certainty dogs not know what machinery is made in the ""State of Victoria, or he would not have spoken as did. In Bendigo, which is a much more important mining district than Broken Hill, which has been in existance for over years, and where for the last 30 years there has been yielded a weekly average of from 3,000 to 4,000 ozs. of gold, we have seen the mining industry profitably carried on, and we have seen growing up enormous workshops employing a great number of hands, with the result that during the Mr MCColl. or twenty years there has way not been a single new imported engine into the district. We have some as hundreds of engines there, and there is scarcely one that is imported. Some may have been brought from other districts of Victorian Victoria, but nearly every plant we have in the district is of Ballarat, Castlemaine, The honourable member comes now with a light heart and says we should have all this machineiy ' admitted free. I am surprised that labour other men should study only the particular very labour that sends them here, and should, be prepared to do what would throw out of employment 7,000 or 8,000 men engaged in are covered these industries. Mv. CONBOY - Surely as many would be those employed as in New South Wales.",49
241,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"No , nothing like it . The honourable member for - Maranoa has said that this is all for Victoria, but if we help manufactures here we shall be helping in the same way in all of the States. W it h regard to mining machinery, the the honourable member for Barrier spoke details. a He did not mention one particular machine it that is required, but dealt with mining machineiy as a whole. This is a very general item, and covers not only mining machinery, but machinery which is used in other occupations. The honourable member spoke of a particular engine being worth £10,000. to There is not one engine in Australia which itself is worth that amount, of\ half of A great deal has been made of the protection afforded by the high freights from took the old country. Iron work has been our brought out from Great Britain to this to country for as low as 7s. 6d. per ton freight. I admit that that was an exceptional case; but a great deal of iron work is brought out here at a freight as low as 10s. per ton. at To convey machinery from * Bendigo to Broken Hill , or Western Australia, costs more than it does to bring it from America he to this country. I was speaking recently to one of our oldest and most experienced mining inspectors, whom I met at the start50 ing of some mining machinery, and questioned him particularly in regard to mining machineiy. He has travelled in most of the States, and returned only recently from Broken Hill . I inquired how mining machinery made in Victoria compared with that in the other States, and especially rlast with imported machineiy. He replied. that there was no comparison whatever between them, and that we had nothing to learn from any country in this respect. He said-"" I except, of course, special makes, but ordinary mining machineiy manufactured elsewhere is not to be compared with that made in Victoria."" In Broken ' Hill they have enormous plants, ill-constructed and badly designed, possessing weight where it is not required, and weakness where strength is necessary.",50
242,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The inspector knows nothing about silver mines.,51
243,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,No doubt he does not know half as much about them as does the right honourable gentleman.,51
244,Mr RUID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Has he ever been in a silver mine 1,51
245,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"He had just returned from Broken Hill when I saw him, and he spoke of what he had seen himself. It has been said during this debate that wire rope used for mining purposes is dutiable under this Tariff. As a matter of fact it is not.",51
246,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"But Manilla ropes, which are used by the poor miners, are dutiable.",51
247,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I quite agree that patent machinery s'hould come in free, provided that care is taken to discriminate between such machines when they are passing through the Customs. Where a new patent is introduced, either in mining or agricultural machinery, there should be no bar to its entry into the countiy, so that our mechanics may learn to copy it and the public be benefited. But a machine that has simply a small patent attached to it should not be allowed to come in free. We know that the country which has been pointed to so frequently during this debate - America-ha s long been the home of patentmachinery, and that the greatest improvements in machinery are made there. We know that the invention and construction of machinery there have been stimulated by the establishment of workshops all over the country, and by the freedom of the patent laws. By reason of these facilities young men have been enabled to use their brains, and they have been encouraged especially by means of direct rewards. In that way, and by the imposition of protective duties, the manufacture of machineiy has increased there until its completeness has become the wonder of the world. If we are not to follow on the same lines, how are we going to stimulate our people to invent and to construct the machineiy required in all our productions ? What we have done already in this direction may be seen in our agricultural implements. The manufacture of agricultural machineiy here has been stimulated, and our manufacturers have been encouraged, with the result that we have harvesting machineiy superior to any to be found. That would not have been possible but for our workshops. W it h regard to this duty, I am sorry, as the honourable  has said, that we have not a schedule of the machines in this item, even if it were only a rough one, because it is most difficult to discriminate between them. There are a number of articles in the item which should come in free. On others there should be a duty of 25 per cent., but I think that a great many should come in at 15 per cent. I do not agree with the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, that a sweeping reduction should be made all round, but I think we ought to have a schedule so that we may impose a duty which will be ""fair. I would ask honourable members to consider that we must have a compromise Tariff. We find that in the various States the duties on the articles under this heading have run from 30 per cent, down to the free list. We do not wish to be discussing this Tariff for ever. I presume we want to get away, and I would say, therefore, that as we have adopted certain lines in other cases - we should go upon them again, and by means of fair compromise come to a speedy conclusion of this debate. I wouldask the Minister to say whether he cannot differentiate between a number of articles included in this item, so that we may be able to put a fair duty on those that require a duty, and allow a large number of articles to come in free which should be free.",51
248,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," I think the committee generally will consider that the item before us is one of considerable importance, and that there is no waste of time involved' in the discussion which has taken place, or may take place, upon it. The matter was put from both sides veiy vividly at the beginning of the debate by the honourable member who moved the omission of these duties, and by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo who took up the opposite position, and seemed to be perfectly convinced of the accuracy of his views. It is rather puzzling, I must say, to find in the presence of so strong a faith in the wonderful advantages of these protective duties, such a disposition to compromise. Is it fair to the people of Australia that a S3stem which will impose no burdens upon the people, which will, on the contrary., without imposing any burdens upon a single human being or upon a single great industry, assure to the people in all our industries these vital blessings-cheap ness, the best of quality, the best of suitability, and, upon the top of all that, the development of Australian industry-shoul d be abandoned?. A policy which will, without placing a burden upon anything in the countiy, assure cheaper, better, and more suitable goods than we can' obtain elsewhere, and at the same time found a large number of national industries, is one about whi.'-h there should be no compromise because there is nothing to lose.",51
249,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The right honourable member ought to come over here.,52
250,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I am trying to represent the views of my honourable friends on the other side. These are not my views. I wish my honourable friends, who speak so eloquently and earnestly, to give some assurance of the faith which is in them in moulding this Tariff, because a policy which will do all the things which have been urged in favour of this dut\'' of 25 per cent, on mining machinery, is one which should be pushed to the point of prohibition for the benefit and protection of the people all round. If my belief were the same as that of honourable members opposite, I think I should stand a little more strongly by such a grand national policy. Itniust be a source of deep regret to some honourable members that the Tariff is being steadily improved in accordance with the views of His Majesty's Opposition, if it be possible to improve a thing of this kind. Improvement is very difficult because, of course, we are working upon opposite lines. The Government brought in a tolerably sound protective Tariff. Putting the Maitland speech aside, the Tariff is a very cleverly constructed protective Tariff, and conve)'S the appearance at certain points of an anxiety for the public .revenue. But instead of standing up for the Tariff as introduced, a number of honourable members opposite have helped as to make great alterations. From a selfish point of view, the more incomplete, defective, unjust, and irritating the Tariff as finally settled may be, the better it will be for those who opposed it. But, of course, we have no right to put such contemptible considerations r before our duty to the public. We, on this side, who consider that the Tariff has been moulded upon absolutely wrong principles, have a very difficult task in endeavouring to alter it: but it must be understood that ' we in no sense recognise the Tariff when altered as being founded upon sound principles. It is impossible to create a hybrid production such as this Tariff will be without having a number of striking anomalies and hardships which will make it a source of oppression and hardship, and something which must be radically altered at the earliest opportunity possible. At the same time it is clearly the duty of the members of the Opposition, if we cannot get our own way entirely, to strive to bring the rates imposed on every important item down as nearly as possible towards a point at which we could consider them fair. My line of action here will be this- I shall endeavour to carry out my views in their entirety, and, if that is impossible, I shall try to give as much effect to them as I can by voting for the reduction of duties which I cannot get rid of altogether. But under no circumstances will the Opposition consider themselves responsible for this Tariff. If we clear awa}' some of the misunderstandings which have arisen, it will be found that there are not so many grievous gaps between free-traders and protectionists as some jieople think, though there are many. For instance, we free-traders have no sort of animosity against manufacturing industries, or against any policy which will tend to develop in the country as many industries as possible. In no sense-do we desire to retard the development of inventive skill or of the higher forms of industry. But we think that' it is extremely difficult to act fairly by all in endeavouring to legislate in favour of any particular class or of any particular industry. If this policy could work all round, its absurdity would become more obvious. It is not reduced to an utter absurdity, because it is not pressed to it fullest extent. But when the honourable and learned member for Bendigo pleads the cause of the engineers and boiler-makers of that town, as a class who ought not to be exposed to the cruel brunt of unrestricted competition, does it occur to him that nine-tenths of the working people of Australia cannot be rescued from such competition? Take the industry of the miner, or of the farmer, for example. Do we not knuw .that tlieir whole prospects, I do not say a fortune or of a large return, - but of merely making a bare living, depend upon ithe fluctuations of prices in markets thousands of miles beyond the limits of legislative power ? That is one of the hard facts which we must take into account. Coming from the country to the great .cities of the continent, with - their buildings full of clerks and shopman, and tlieir - streets crowded with drivers of' vehicles, do we not know that there is no law in the country which will prevent any man from taking the first empty shop and exposing the adjoining shopkeeper, who has built up. a business by perhaps twenty years of honest industry to all the cruelty and unfairness of competition 1 The of competition - presses upon every man, and if we are to have regard to its inciused dental evils and hardships we should make an effort to screen the whole community from them. It is a strong departure to select only particular classes for protection. Should we not all rejoice if the honourable - and learned member for Bendigo could tell - us that the great body of working men i Melbourne earn from 9s. to 1 Is. a day, should we not be prepared to vote solidly for any legislative enactment which would ensure to the workers of Australia as body a similar wage ? Our indictment cheapness against protection is that, whilst it incidentally favour a few, and give tliem high wages, the benefits which they obtain come out of the pockets of persons receive veiy much less. Some of us not look with unalloyed pleasure at the factories in Bendigo, where men may earn l is . a day,"" when we know that they being supported by thousands of miners this country who, as tributors, earn 2os. or 30s. a week. Mr O'MALLKV - And some of them much less.",52
251,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Is it not time that we thought also of the great mass of labourers who enjoy none of the advantages of protection, and upon whom we are asked to place such heavy burdens? It may be right that my honourable and learned friend should see that Bendigo is | looked after, but we have to see that Aus' tralia is looked after, and we, in dealing with the mining industry, are on very broad Australian ground. In no sense is it a Victorian or New South Wales industry. of It is a thorough Australian industry, which is one of the strongest elements, not only in the present strength .of each and every State, but in the prospects of the whole conour , tinent. If there is an industry which - should coinmand earnest attention at our hands it is the mining industry. But, as I ! have said, my honourable friends opposite | assure us that these 'duties will entail no [ sort of burden or injustice on the mining i community. One does look for some ! sort of consistency in dealing with these I vital matters. Some of those honourable | members - who have made that statement have notices on this paper asking - that certain forms of machinery used in agriculture shall be put on the law free list. Why should we have the free list filled with selected forms of machineryin any particular industry if there is no hardship to be remedied, if the fact of putting them on the free list will expose Australia to all the dreadful evils to which my honourable friends have referred ? We Shall have shoddy machineiy; we shall have dearer machinerv ; we shall. have an n article which will be an injury to all and and an ad vantage to none. The public have a right to expect at least. this sort of consistency, that if honourable members assert as a a fact that these duties do insure greater ancl better quality, they should be may applied for the benefit of the farmers and every one else, as well as the miners of Australia. I take up this notice-paper, and who I find the honourable member for Echuca canintimating that he intends to move that traction-engines, cast-steel shares known as Hornsby's, and reaper and hay knives be - are placed on the free list. Does he mean to in tell us that the industrial wonders of Viconly toria have not yet reached the level of making a hay knife, or a reaping knife, or a traction-engine-that this cannot be done by men who are equal to transmuting into mechanical shape all the most difficult contrivances known throughout the world,, and ' which are required in developing our mining j industries at the present time? How is it | that traction-engines must be dragged out j of this industrial paradise for the benefit of j the hated, greedy, unscrupulous importer? - Why should the curse of an imported traction-engine, or hay knife, or reaper, he inflicted on Australia 'i Then the honourable member for Wimmera goes further. He insists that seed drills, plough and trace chains, and type- a curious mixture-shal l be placed on the free list. Surely the marvellous industrial development which can solve the difficulties of constructing mining machinery, is equal to the construction of seed drills, or plough chains, or type! The young and amiable member for Darling Downs wants a number of agricultural implements and machines to be placed on the free list, and he names them as follows:Acme harrows, cane shavers, cane shredders, circular coulters, cultivators, dairy refrigerators, drill wheel hoe cultivator, fertilizer and drill bined, grain mills, hushers aud shelters, horse rakes, milking machine, mowers, potato raisers, root cutters, scufflers, steam ploughs, sulky ploughs, straw stackers, threshers, tractionengines. The honourable and learned member considers that these are things beyond the industrial skill of Australia, beyond . the circle within which people can get things so cheap and so good. In one breath, certain honourable members say that the importer is a hated, unscrupulous person, but in the next breath they say that he is philanthropic enough to pay the whole of the duty. It is rather a puzzling sort of picture which at one time represents the importer as that widely benevolent individual who pays the duties on goods importeu, and does not pass them on to the customer, and in another depicts him as the most selfish of his class. These attacks upon classes of men engaged in different industries are entirely unworthy of us.",53
252,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Hear , hear.",54
253,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"On our side I admit we have got occasionally into the trick of using the term "" manufacturer "" in the way of reproach. We are not quite perfect yet, and one proof of it is that we occasionally speak of manufacturers as if they were to be singled out from the other classes of the community for reprobation.",54
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,And we have never called them robbers!,54
255,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Eve n for the sake of free trade, I cannot say that we have not. At this time of day, on both sides, we might try to avoid these attacks on different classes, whether manufacturers or importers. If the country think it well to impose protective duties, we have no right to complain of any man of capital and enterprise putting his money into the industries which it invites him to establish. For even broader reasons we have no light to look on a man who is engaged in commerce as if he were to be singled out by some moral obliquity from the rest of his species. He has a useful office to fill, too, and probably he is quite as respectable and just as is any other class in the community. We shall get rid of a number of embarrassing personalties if we try to look at the question quite away from the individuals who may happen to be engaged in these respective industries. But that is not all, sir. I have before me what the Government have already done, perhaps in some comcases not so much by their own initiative as from the force of some division.",54
256,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Alway s that.,54
257,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I do not wish to put the Government in any unfair position, but I take up the item which is before the committee. The honourable member for Barrier proposes that engines, boilers, pumps, machines, and machinery n.e.i., also screws n.e.i., axles, springs, and plated and mixed metal-ware, including plated cutlery, shall be placed on the free list. What an extraordinary assortment of articles is contained in this item. Surely the skill of my distinguised friend, the Minister for Trade and Customs, should have been equal to placing plated cutlery somewhere away from engines and boilers, but I suppose the magic .letters, n.e.i., are responsible for a number of these ill-assorted families. It is admitted that the mines, upon which the bread of thousands of families depend today, are in a position of great trial and difficult}', and that within a short period thousands of men engaged in the mining industry in one part of Australia have had to leave work, owing to the low price ""of their products in the markets of the world. This is the fact which the honourable member for Barrier has brought before us. Without being offensive to anyone, I say.that the largeness and tenderness of heart which made my Victorian friends gather as one phalanx round the two or three men and boys who are making horse-shoe nails in Melbourne, and around those who are making starch and blue and a hundred other things in Melbourne, should be shown on behalf of some of the people who do not live in Melbourne. When I appeal to this committee for some sort of kindness towards the embarrassed mining industry, I am speaking not only for my own colony, but for South Australia, the prosperity of which I think the Minister for Trade and Customs will admit is affected in a most substantial way by the continuance of the mining industry at Broken Hill . Thus we see that we are speaking on a broader basis in dealing with this particular set of mines than in connection with some other matters to which 1I have referred. Now, what does this mean ? It is said that this is a proper duty-this 25 per cent, duty, which is 10 per cent, more than the rate imposed upon agricultural machinery, and that in itself is a monstrous distinction. It is said that this 25 per cent, duty is necessary for the benefit of the miners at Broken Hill . Was not a duty on machinery necessary for the benefit of those who have embarked their capital in woollen manufactures and in the various trades connected with clothing ? I find that even the small tools used in the hat factories, and shirt factories, and slop factories are all on the free list. Surely the giant development of industrial skill and enterprise, to which allusion has been made, hasovertaken the problem of making machines and tools of the description to which I am about to refer. I find that five engines, for instance, are on the free list. Is there any marvellous patent or mystery involved in the making or construction of a fire engine ? Is not that one of the engines which these great Victorian manufacturers could make ? I should think so. Why should fire engines be placed on the free list ? Were they not placed there so that those who were engaged in the laudable task of keeping down fires might be enabled to get their fire engines at a cheaper price? Por what other purpose would our friends put fire engines on the free list? Out of the thousand engines used in the various industries of Australia, why should this particular engine be placed upon the free list? Was it in orier to make it dearer and to allow the foreign manufacturer to supply us with rotten engines, that would not last? Was the competition thrown open to the whole world, so that we should be able to obtain an inferior article ? There is a certain amount of inconsistency about this. Why did not .my honourable and learned friend, who does not wish to see property given to the flames in Victoria, insist that the placing of fire engines on the free list would expose us to the foreign shoddy that is sent to us from abroad? AVhy should not the giant arm of Victorian enterprise embrace fire engines as well as other engines ? \\ hy should fire engines be taken T out of the clutch, of the Victorian manufacturer ? AVe must assume, with the present administration in power, that they were placed on the free list with a very good object. Now, coming a little lower down, we find machinery for scouring, washing, carding, spinning, weaving, and finishing the manufacture of fibrous materials placed on the free list. Surely the industry for the manufacture of woollen goods, which has the advantage of a protective duty, might be left within the sphere of the taxed machinery ? If men who have to sell their lead in Europe and London at ruination prices, in competition with the coloured labour of the world, are left out in the cold; or if it is unfair to them to ""leave them out in the cold, why are some honourable members so industrious, and so particular, and so precise, as to add to the protection given to other industries the benefits of free - trade in machinery at the same time ? What greater degree of free-trade could there be than free-trade in the machinery necessary for making woollen goods? If a duty on machinery,is good enough for the struggling miners throughout Australia, is it not good enough for the woollen companies of Ballarat and Melbourne f These are things regarding which we should like some explanation. Then, whilst linotypes and machines of that sort are open to special observations as highly complicated and patented articles, printing machines and presses are also on the free list. Sewing machine heads, stitching machines, and typewriters are also on the free list. Now we come to something else.",54
258,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,It would be better to cometo the item under discussion.,55
259,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Most intelligent men, in dealing with a complicated matter of this sort, would derive some light from the way in which other articles, falling under another heading, are dealt with. In the country I come from a certain amount of respect was paid to that method of treatment. Now we come to a much lower grade of articles than the complex mining machinery which is used for dealing with the treasures of the earth. In the free list is includedMachine tools used in the following industries and specified in departmental by-laws :-Appare l and attire making, bookbinding, boot making, brushmaking, glassrnaking and working, hat-' making, india rubber working, leather dressing, metal working, paper cutting, finishing, and folding, stone working, tile, pipe, and brick making. « Why shouicl all these industries, which are covered by a protective duty on the articles they make, have their tools of trade placed on the free list, whilst the mining industry, - whose product gets not a shred of protection, is called upon to pay a duty of 25 per cent. Is - not this adding a little grease to the pig-to the fatted calf. These are considerations' which do not occur to gentlemen . whose eyes for so many years have been steadily fixed on the industries of Melbourne. But this is an Australian Parliament, and we are dealing with a system of taxation that will affect every mining field in Australia. We must try to do something for the miners after the fashion of what we have done for the benefit of the slopmakers and. the bootmakers, who are all worthy men, following worthy industries. All I say is that if the industries which have been, given duties have the benefit of machines and tools on the free list, then those who get no benefit from protective duties ought to have the same privilege. If it is not to the benefit of industries that this should be given them, we had better puc c all these tools and machines back on the dutiable list, in order to be consistent. Then I see that amongst the special exemptions is copper in bars, sheets, pipes, and so on. Well, we have copper in the Commonwealth, which has to be sold in competition in the markets of the whole world, and we have - tin, which is subject to the same conditions. We have lead, which comes from the very mines which are in the difficult position that has been indicated. Each one of these three raw materials is on the free list; there is no protection for the Australian copper miner, tin miner, or lead miner. Lead was subject to a duty of £2 per ton, but by some marvellous piece of' consideration that little shred of benefit, if there be any benefit, was taken away. What sort of consistency is there in the work we are doing at the present time t If there is a principle involved in doing nothing for miners in the way of putting, mining machines on the free list, ought we not'for the same reason to put other machines, on the dutiable list ? But, of course, one feels discouraged by the fact Mr Meid. no matter what one says-and I make this remark in all fairness-man y of my honourable friends are in such a position, from their public principles and statementsto the electors, that one cannot expect them to go as far as we go. I quite admit that men must be consistent with their pubiicprinciples and professions to the electors, and, therefore, I cannot fairly ask a protectionist, or I suppose I cannot-- ",55
260,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Mak e the duty 15 per cent.,56
261,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I am speaking of putting the whole of this machinery on the free list. I admit that a protectionist member may fairly say- "" I-came in as a protectionist, and cannot vote for admitting these goods-free ; 1 may, in view of' the whole of the circumstances we are dealing with now,, go down to a 10 per cent, or 15 percent, duty, but I cannot vote for a free list."" I do not wish or expect any man to act dishonourably by the electors, and I have a feeling that, as the House is constituted, there is a fair majority of gentlemen in the chamber whose pledges-' prevent their doing what we ask. But still honourable members will see that although that is so, Ave, from our point of view, have to do our duty to our electorstreatment before whom we expressed different prin-' ciples. I do not want to take up an unfair amount of time in dealing with this matter, unless there is any attempt to drive ; and if there is any such attempt, we know what the results are. I would much rather that our time should always be devoted to aprofitable discussion of the items, and, therefore, I shall curtail my remarks to a great extent on the present occasion, feeling that so far as generalities are concerned they have been sufficiently dealt with. But before I sit down, I may be pardoned if I make' one or two further observations. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo seems to think that the whole matter is settled, when he states that there is a certain number of men at Bendigo earning certain wages. Every intelligent free-trader admits, that this is only a matter of money. We can produce in any countiy any conceivable article at once if we have money enough to do so, and are willing to spend that money. The expression is often used, on both sidesof the House, though not so much on the opposition as the Government side-- "" I am in favour of protecting anything that can that be produced in the country."" It is a loose expression, and the more accurate sense, and probably the sense in - which it is generally intended is- "" Anything which can be profitably produced."" 'The introduction of that one word "" profitably"" throws a flood of light on the whole question. The moment we come to the question of profitable labour, we see the distinction- a most valuable and vital distinction-betwee n finding work for men to do which is a loss to the community, and finding work which is a profit to the community. I suppose there is more labour involved in attempting to climb a greasy pole than in any honest, profitable occupation. Would it follow, if we set the whole of the working men of Victoria attempting to climb a greasy pole for eight hours a day at 10s - and they would fully earn it-that that industry was in a flourishing condition in this State? Protectionists have only solved half the industrial question when they point to any particular development of an industry. There is another questiondid that development of industry cost the people more than a development in another direction ? Is it not at least possible that the energies of a whole community who are left alone to develop the broad, obvious, natural wealth of the country, may produce a greater degree of abundance and prosperity than the energies of men who have tasks set them by Acts of Parliament ? Do not let any one think that, because we are free-traders, we believe in idleness, or do not believe in Australian industry. Instead of taking up the time of the committee with long lists of details, it ought to be seen that there is the one simple fact standing out. According to protectionists, if there ate two countries in the world which should be going downhill, or which should be buffeted about at the mercy of all the other countries, those two are Great Britain and New South Wales. Great Britain has stood a good deal of buffeting amongst the nations of the world, and is at the head of them all today. As for New South Wales, as she stood two years ago, without this elaborate system of throwing a mesh of taxation over the industrial community, so she stands today with as many men employed in her factories as are employed in the factories of Victoria. When my honourable friend spoke of the mines springing up beside the factories he rather reversed the operations under which nations grow. If there is one truth obvious in the history of the development of all countries, it is that at first the pastoral industry and then the agricultural industry springs into existence, and when these have established themselves, villages and towns grow of themselves. When men tell me that if Australia does not impose these heavy duties she will never have manufacturingindustries, they speak in a way which strikes meas being a trifle extravagant; Why with the very growth of a town a number of industries must spring up. If we were all afflicted with a mania to buy everything we require in England, we should still have to depend upon Australian iadus tries for a number of things in our daily work and wants. Out of that nucleus of absolute necessity, and without any fostering or artificial stimulus, as the country grows the riper forms of industry, will begin to develop. That was the process in a sister State, where the wages are at least as high as they are in Victoria, and where the comforts of life are indulged in at least as freely. There were two processes going on. Those processes have now been arrested, so that we are denied a chance of seeing any further phase in the development of these interestingproblems. I ' de-: sire to be understood as taking so strong a stand in connection with this matter, because I honestly believe that the policy which I am advocating is the best for all our industries. But if we depart from the broad path which deals with matters of first principles, and if we listen to the voice of humanity and tenderness and consideration, then I say that, out of the hearts which can open so freely to the artisans of Melbournej we want some little gush of sympathy for the pioneers of Australia.",56
262,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," I must congratulate the right honourable member upon having spoken for a considerable time in regard to the item before the Chair, and upon having said very little about it. At least, he accomplished, the feat of sitting down without telling the committee what he intended to do. He told us that he did not intend to. do this, that, and the other, without giving, us the slightest idea as to what he did intend. I venture to say that a great many of his remarks were rather wide of the subject under discussion, but probably the truth is that, in his absence-whic h we all regret - he has accumulated a number of observations which he was bound to fire off at the earliest opportunity. Now that he has got rid of them. I hope that he will respect parliamentary procedure and practice, and not occupy valuable time with irrelevant matter. I was delighted more particularly by the indignant way in which he repudiated the suggestion of one of his lieutenants, that at no time had the charge of robbery been levelled against manufacturers. I felt sure that his regard for fact would induce that refutation, which I was delighted to hear. I take this opportunity of saying that I hope I have never used any words which reflected unfairly upon importers. Had I done so, I should have been very sorry, but I feel that my conduct in the past in this respect has been so irreprdchable that no stigma can possibly attach to me. The importer and the manufacturer are both out for business. Both are made of the same clay. They want to make money, and that is the reason they embark in trade. We have no right to institute comparisons to the disadvantage of one, Or to the particular advantage of the other. But I do say-and 1 hold this view most strongly-that the operations of the manufacturer are far and away more to the advantage of the State in which he condusts his business than are those of the importer.",57
263,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,If they do not cost too much.,58
264,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"If they do not cost the country too much. What we know is that in the case of the employer there is capital available for the purchase of the goods. The goods come out here. They may be, as stated by the chief lieutenant of the Opposition, ""the sweepings of the world."" They are got as cheap as cheap can be. Not one penny of their cost goes in the employment of a single Australian hand. They come here and are sold under circumstances in which they compete very harshly with the products of the Australian manufacturer, who spends his capital in the employment of men, and who has to pay higher wages. In the one case all the money goes out of the country, whilst in the other it is spent locally in the employment of men, whose wages find their way into other channels, so that it is not only of direct advantage to themselves but to others dependent upon them, and is, indeed, for the good of all. What does the manufacturer do ? He builds or rents his factory-eithe r are equally good for the land-holder-spend s his money in the employment of men and the purchase of machinery which may be ""locally produced, which is a most distinct gain to all in the State. But I feel that I am likely to imitate the example of the leader of the Opposition, by indulging in a general discussion when I have not the same excuse for so doing. I have not been absent from this chamber for the time that he has, and, therefore, I shall proceed to deal more closely with the matter immediately before us. The right honourable member for East Sydney said that he was against compromise. He scoffed at anything in the shape of compromise being entertained in connection with this matter. I want to define precisely the position of the Government in this respect. We desire to carry this Tariff subject to any neeessaiy amendments. During the past few weeks of the debate. nothing has been more constant than the cry of the Opposition, "" Meet us half-way; compromise, compromise!""",58
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"No , No.",58
266,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Undoubtedly. It would have been a great deal better if the leader of the Opposition had made himself acquainted with what has taken place in this chamber, and had endeavoured to steer a consistent course. The cry of honourable members opposite time and again has been "" Compromise, compromise !"" We do not wish to compromise unnecessarily. We should like to get what we believe in, and to get it to the fullest extent, but if we cannot get all that we want we will get all that we can.  everything that we have got.",58
267,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"In some cases we have met honourable members. In a variety of instances arrangements h«,ve been made upon the floor of the House between the Opposition and the Government, as well as between other sections of it , which have resulted in compromises that are satisfactory to all.",58
268,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"It is not absolutely "" satisfactory to all, but when we could not get the best, we went for the next best.",58
269,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"A compromise is not generally absolutely satisfactory to either of the parties to it, but it is a fair and proper thing under the circumstances, and I venture to hold that it .will be a mistake if, upon mati ters of detail at least, a spirit of compromise j is altogether rejected, and we are to refuse to I listen to strong arguments in favour of a medium, course. One matter has been .brought under our notice by the honourable member for the Barrier, and I would ask' honourable members to consider this item as regards what is proposed and what the amendment is. The item which we have before us deals with manufactures of metals n.e.i. and with expressed inclusions of certain goods. It includes a variety of articles, but^ mining machinery is the chief article included, and under the item it is estimated that a total revenue of £280,000 will be received. When honourable members consider that the proposition of the honourable member for Barrier is practically to strike out all these items, and transfer them to the free list, with a resulting loss of over £250,000, I am sure that they will not be long in coining to the conclusion that an amendment of that sort cannot be entertained for a moment. Mr B.EfD - Then the right honourable gentleman does expect them to be imported, and the duty paid upon them ? We were told there would not be a penny of duty paid.",58
270,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"The interjection of the leader of the Opposition amuses me. I told the committee time and .again what was expected. I am only too delighted to hear the right honourable gentleman, but I like the laugh best that is genuine, and that mirthless giggle, which we sometimes hear, is not so happy in its results as some people may imagine. What we stated at the very earliest moment was that the Tariff was designed for the double purpose of revenue and protection. In connection with this item we expect revenue from the importations which will take place, and we expect also protection as regards the items which may be affected by the protective incidence of revenue duties. All revenue duties to some extent operate protectively incidentally. We explained our proposals in connection with this item, and gave honourable members details as to what was expected from it at the earliest possible moment. They have the figures' before them, which show that we expect under this item a matter of £280,000 revenue. Do honourable members really wish to strike out that item 1 I think not.",59
271,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,I do. id X,59
272,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"The honourable member for the Barrier is a type of the extreme party. I believe he is one of the most genuine free-traders in this House. We have proposed this line in this form, and honourable members in discussingi t have selected simply mining machinery while, of course, a number of other items are also under consideration. What I wish honourable members to do is to recognise the matter from this point of view : Let ustake a division, say on the n.e.i., at first, for the purpose of ascertaining the highest rate at which any of the residue should be taxed. Then let us proceed with the discussion of the various lines in detail to determine what items should beincluded in that residue. Of course, we canput any item, mining machinery it may be, on the free list or at a reduced rate, but unless we determine that no item whatevershall be subjected to a taxation of 25 per cent, we must reject the proposal of the-honourable member for' BarrieV I wouldput it to the honourable member that,, free-trader as he undoubtedly is, he must recognise our revenue necessities, and I do not think that on the fullest consideration he would wish to wipe out this line, lock, stock, and - barrel. I venture to consider, therefore, that it would be for the far greater convenience of the committee if he accepted my suggestion not to take adivision upon his present proposal, but"" to deal first with the n.e.i - com e to a decision as to whether the duty there shall be 25per cent, or 20 per cent, and then proceed in accordance with the practice we have adopted in all other cases in connection with this Tariff, of considering thedetails, and distributing them here and there wherever we think they ought"" to go, according to the wishes of the majority of the committee. I am. sure honourable members will be sorry to depart from the practice that has hitherto obtained, and which I believe has worked 1 with advantage. The intention of the Government is to give the committee the fullest opportunity of dealing with the matter in detail as they please. We have no intention of springing anything upon the committee in the shape of a block vote, or of supporting anything in the shape of a block vote, to induce the committee to come to a conclusion which we could not support, without the fullest consideration. Ourwish, I believe, is in accordance with that' of a large majority of the committee. The right honourable the leader of the Opposition has said that he does not believe there is as much difference between protectionists and free-traders as might appear at first sight, and the position the Government take is the same as that which they took in connection with agricultural machinery. We wish to protect, but we do not wish, where there is no reasonable probability of the goods being manufactured here, to put on a protective duty. In such cases a revenue duty will at least be sufficient if, indeed, those goods are not admitted free. There is nothing I should like more strongly to repudiate than the suggestion that we wish to tax goods at protective rates when they are not likely to be manufactured in Australia, or are not properly the subject of protective taxation. I fcannot put it too strongly in that respect, and if I repeat myself in this connection I ask the indulgence of the committee for the reason that I should be sorry that, where we are so nearly agreed, there should, in the absence of a full explanation on the part of the Government, be any misunderstanding between those who I believe can for the good of Australia be led to act in co-operation in this important matter.. We do not wish to protect that which cannot be reasonably made here. When from the nature of the instrument, and the rareness with which it would be wanted in Australia, or from any other cause, we cannot by a reasonable protective duty enable it to be manufactured here, so as to compete with the imported article, then I say away with the protective duty, and we have only the right to ask for a revenue tax, if indeed such articles might not fairly, in the interests of industry, be allowed to come in free.  for.",59
273,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I believe that is all honourable members generally are asking for. And in that spirit let us reason together, and, so far as we can, adopt the practice we adopted in dealing with agricultural machinery, of exempting all which we cannot satisfactorily make here. I venture to consider that in connection ""-with agricultural machinery the subject was veiy fairly discussed, and very reasonable conclusions come to in all the circumstances. AVe have onty to apply bur minds to the various items in connection with this line to arrive at, probabty, similarly happy results.",60

275,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"The proposition as regards mining machinery is 25 per cent. duty. I believe there is little, if any, mining machinery which cannot reasonably be made here. Let me take the committee further into my confidence. When we rose, but a month ago, I felt that the committee would desire information, so far as it was obtainable, as to what machinery we could produce, and what we could not produce. To that end I gave instructions to my officers to make the fullest inquiry into the subject. The information which I have received from them is that there is little, if any, mining machinery which we cannot produce.",60
276,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Did they make their inquiries from the persons who were making the machinery, or from those who were buying the machinery 1",60
277,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,- I suppose they made inquiries from both. They are intelligent men. They were given carte blanche. No Minister requiring information of the character to which I refer would for a moment limit the sources from which his officers should obtain it .,60

Time after time the challenge has been thrown out to honourable members to state what mining machineiy cannot be produced here. There is the honourable member for Barrier- a good member too, and a friend of mine. Can he specify any machine which cannot be produced locally ?  manufactured here.",60
286,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"We will come to that in one moment. If the honourable member for Barrier can specify any machine which cannot be produced in Australia, I promise him the fullest inquiry into ject. I will place an officer at his disposal to assist him in exploring all formation. I venture to suggest that in matters of this sort, honourable members should freely accept the statement of the Government of what their wishes are, and the means which they have taken to ascertain the facts. Then they should assist us in regard to the facts. Those honourable members who say we cannot manufacture some of these machines, should tell us what they are. If they can show that a machine cannot be made here, then we will put it on the free list.",61

If we were to accept a broad definition of that kind, we might, by the patentiug of some small matter in connection with mining machinery, have to permit the free admission of all the mining machinery in the world into Australia, and destroy the benefits which are intended to be conveyed by protection in connection with these manufactures. I venture to think I have made a fair offer. Can any honourable member suggest a fairer one? Are we agreed that it is a reasonable thing to protect machinery which can be manufactured here at a reasonable price ?",61

We believe in incidental protection in connection with this particular matter. AVe propose it and we hope that the committee will proceed to discuss the item on the basis to which I have referred. Let us decide what the general rates for all these residuary manufactures of metal are, and then let us, as in previous cases, proceed to the discussion of a definition of articles which we intend to include, or which any honourable member cati show good cause for excluding from this list. 25 N 2  when they are not placed before us ?",61

296,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I think I have said enough to show what is the position taken up by the Government. T do not want to go over all the points which have been put, but a great deal has been said about Broken Hill . I dare say I was interested in Broken Hill before the honourable member for Barrier was, and I think that I have many good friends there. I should be sorry to do anything to the disadvantage of Broken Hill , or to the disadvantage of any section of the community. I should be sorry to do an injustice to any section. AVe do a good deal for the workers. At the least, we do the best that we can for them. Of course, in connection with our mining resources the wealth is the produce of the mine.' It has to be obtained. There is the labour in digging it out.. Machinery and men are employed. . Then there are the men who make the machinery, who are capable of employment, and the men who use the machinerytodig out the wealth. The position is this: Everything that we could possibly do, or that we have thought of yet, has been done for the men. What was the chief work of the session la3t year? Additional precautions for the protection of our white workers from unfair competition, for their protection against workers under contract - and black men, and further, steps for the deportation of certain coloured workers who are here already. AVe did all that and did it properly.",61
297,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,For the sake of the miner alone?,62
298,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"For the sake of the miner and all Australia. To save the workers from competition to which they ought not to be exposed. Is the miner simply going to say-""Protec t me, and so long as my wages are right I do not care if the man who makes the machinery I use is sweated""? That is really the attitude of a miner or o£ any one else who, crying out for a white Australia and for the exclusion of the black people in the interests of labour, would yet compel the factory operative in Australia to compete with the cheap and pauper labour of the world. I speak strongly, because I feel strongly. It is a shame that men are not taught by their leaders to recognise the false position in which they are placed when they are induced to follow such a selfish policy as that. I am getting tired of hearing speeches about the success which is seen to have attended the policy of one Stfite when its progress is compared with that of another. We have heard a great deal about the larger number of operativesin one State than in another, and the number of people who have gone from one State to another to seek employment: but, with regard to machinery, I find that New South Wales exported only £48,605 worth, whereas South Australia has exported £127,997 worth, and Victoria £230,456 worth. It would be strange, indeed, if a State three times as large and four times as old as another had not greater resources and a larger development. But the effects of protection can be estimated only in connection with industries where the imports compete with the exports. Has New South Wales, with a population one-eighth greater than that of Victoria, more people employed in her industries ? No. The number of persons employed in protected industries in New South Wales is only 22,000, while the number employed, in A ictoria is 24,000. If one faces the contrast between the two policies fairly, he must be forced to the conclusion that the Victorian policv has all the best of it . Exception has been taken to the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent, upon mining machinery, because the duty on agricultural machinery is only 15 per cent., but the reason for the difference is plain. The initial cost of, and the expense of - setting up plant to make mining machinery is undoubtedly far greater than the expense of a plant to make agricultural ruachinery, while the output of mining machineiy cannot be so large as the output of agricultural machinery. I invite honourable members to discuss the item upon the lines which have been previously followedduring the consideration of the Tariff. Let us settle the general rate first, and then deal with exemptions, putting such articles as the committee may think good upon the free list, and reducing the duties upon others.",62
299,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," The Minister has made a number of interesting speeches during the last hour. I have followed them all, and I have failed utterly to see why he has taken the trouble to speak so frequently upon subjects so widely divergent from, and at times altogether unconnected with, the question before the Chair. He deprecated the action of honourable members in wandering all over the place; but what has he been doing ? He made a proposition of a most touching character to the honourable member for Barrier, asking him, as a loyal and consistent free-trader, of not to j>ress his amendment, but to deal with the matter in a spirit of compromise. When the Minister was asked what was his idea of compromise, he said a duty of 25 percent. He tells us that his idea of the Tariff is to bolster up industries and to get revenue. When he cannot get revenue he bolsters up industries, and when he cannot bolster up industries, he gets revenue. Having arrived at this rather confusing position, he told us that he was quite prepared, when an article could not be produced here, to allow it to be imported upon the payment of a reasonable revenue duty. But can he mention any article, unless it is a patented invention, which cannot be produced here.? There are skilled mechanics in the country, and there are capitalists who are ready and willing, if they are given sufficient incentive, to embark their money upon the enterr prise. This question should be faced fairly and squarely, and we should deal with the item either from the stand-point of revenue or from the stand-point of protection. So far as I can see, with the exception of patented machineiy, such as linotypes, all that the Government propose to admit free is machineiy in the nature of tools of trade for the textile and other industries of Victoria. It is useless for the Minister say, however, that every kind of machinery can be made here at a profit.",62
300,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,I did not say that.,63
301,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Does the Minister familiar think that any one would try to make things. here if he knew that he could not carry his operations at a profit ? Or does he think that the countiy should be taxed to provide manufacturers with profits? Although he affects to regard the interests of the and other primary producers, there seems to run through his remarks the idea that the manufacturer is a divine personage, sent here to provide work for the people. But the manufacturer does not provide work for the people; it is the people provide a profit for the manufacturer. the manufacturers have been sent here vide work for the people, why do they not do How is it that in the protected State of toria this celebrated sj^stem was quite adequate to keep the rate of wages up to the civilized standard ? How is it that they had to get a wages board and one thing another to keep up the rate of wages ? I the Minister will approach this question from the stand-point of revenue he will find honourable members on this side quite ready to meet him. He says that this class of machinery must have very heavy protecthat tion, because it takes a lot of money to down the plant to make it . One good tory, such as exists in America and England, could make quite readily all the machineiy which is used for the 4,000,000 peoplein tralia. I.do not deny that there are a numfailure ber of factories in Australia. But it is physically impossible that with 4,000,000 people you can ever get men to invest sufficient capital to produce expensive with profit to the countiy and to themselves. If the Minister will offer a promise on which we can discuss it will be possible for us to consider of the attitudes which he assumed during his speech. But if he is still of the opinion that 25 per cent, is the right duty to pose, I do not see that there is much rooip for discussion. The mining industries this country strike a blow at centralization If there is a danger to civilization, especially to Australian civilization, it is this tendency to crowd into the cities. The policy of Minister is siniply to bolster up the cities the expense of the countiy. The countiy is do. being denuded; we have huge cities and sparsely settled districts. Let the Ministei to do what he can to foster the basic and primary industries, and the others will look after themselves.",63
302,Mr MCC AY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," Any one not with the course of events in the Chamber during the past few months, who on had listened to the debate during the last two or three hours, would have little suspected that we were discussing a sub-item, important as it may be, half way through miners the Tariff. The honourable member for Barrier has urged the placing of mining machinery on the free list for two reasons. In the first place, he assumes that the existence of a duty will inevitably increase the price of the machineiy to the consumer who in Broken Hill-the place with which he If was chiefly concerned-by at least the to proamount of the d u t y ; and he gave so? us the figures which had been worked out Vicfor him by certain mine managers, amountining to between £30,000 and £40,000 on the various articles which are used in the mines-not , of course, the mining machineiy and exclusively; and he then went on to sugf gest, although he did not say so, that that increase in the burden upon production might lead to the closing up practically of Broken Hill . I am sure that the honourable member, if he paused to seriously consider latter statement, would not be conlay vinced of its accuracy. He would not for facone moment suggest that an alteration of £40,000 a year, even in the cost of production, in the various mines there, could make Austhe difference between prosperity and to that large and important centre.",63

318,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"The honourable member is higherapparently concerned only about that directly affects his own constitM y constituents largely conof miners and those who are directly dependent upon the mining infor their livelihood, and a very small proportion are interested i u manufactures. and I have no hesitation in saying that the duty on machineiy, and especially on mining machinery, in Victoria, has been, of the greatest service to the mining industry, and the my support of a duty on machinery is not based merely upon the benefits that accrue to the engineers or boiler-makers, or other mechanics who find employment in the how engineering shops, but upon the fact that the it has been proved by practical experience the purchaser of these articles has been benefited by the duty, as well as has the The effect of a protective duty is not necessarily to give a better article, or a cheaper article, but if it leaves the of the same quality and at the same as before the duty was imposed, and changes the place of origin from foreign parts to Australia, the purpose of the local manufacturer and his employee will be served without injuring any one else. Experience has shown that Australian-made machinery is just as serviceable as is the imported article and apparently the importing States take that view. We may fairly say that as regards mining machinery, Western Australia is chiefly an importing State. It is only recently that she has begun the manufacture of machinery, and the local industry has not yet attained any great proportions. In the year 1900, Western Australia imported electrical machinery, steam engines, flour-milling engines, ice-making machinery, .locomotives, mining machinery, engineering parts, and printing machinery, of a total value of £438,000. Of this, £204,000 worth was Australian made, and £224,000 worth came from beyond the seas. If we take mining machinery-as regards the Australian production, of which some honourable members have chosen to use terms of disparagement, in comparing it with the imported article-w e find that Western Australia imported in 1900 a total of £322,000 worth, of which £152,000 worth was Australian made, and £169,000 woith was imported from abroad, the bulk of the latter coming from Great Britain. We all know of the relations which exist"" between the Western Australian mining companies and Great Britain, and there must inevitably be a tendency in . favour of buying the articles required for the mines in the place where the bulk of the shares are held. But in spite of that, half the imports in Western Australia are Australian products.",64
319,Mr KIKWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The honourable learned member is quite wrong; I have more recent figures.,65
320,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I give the figures for 1900 as token from the Statistical Register of Western Australia. The bulk of these imports were then from Victoria and South Australia, the only two States which have endeavoured to give practical protection.to those industries.",65
321,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,And which have the least natural advantages.,65
322,Mr BEID,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Exactly ; that shows - how much the industries .cost.,65
323,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"-We are told that New South Wales has more, or as many, or nearly as many hands engaged in foundries and kindred works as Victoria, but I am astounded that there are not a great many more, in spite of the different fiscal policy, having regard to the considerable coal and iron deposits in the adjoining State. We have nothing in Victoria to compare with New South Wales in that respect. Again taking the figures for the year 1900, we find, whatever may be the number of hands employed, that Victoria, - with nearly one-sixth less population, apparently worked something like 15 per cent, more iron and steel than did New South Wales, although New South Wales worked all the iron ore raised within her border. It is true that the latter was not a large amount, if the New South Wales Statistical Register is to be trusted. As I said, the great bulk of the imports into Western Australia from the rest of the Commonwealth were from Victoria and South Australia ; and some honourable members contend that that fact shows that no duty is wanted.",65
324,Mr GLVNN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,It was free-trade in New South Wales that made the manufactures in South Australia.,65
325,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Possibl y so, ancl it is free trade between the States that will make the manufactures of all the States. I have always advocated free-trade between the 1 States, believing that within the one legislative area we should have as much freedom of trade as possible. In that area we can control the relations between employer and employed, buyer and seller, and the various interests concerned ; but when we go beyond the legislative area we must set up a barrier, large or small. We cannot control operations beyond the Commonwealth, and it is at the limits that we have to establish and any barriers which it may be decided shall exist. The fact that the bulk of the imports into AVestern Australia were from Victoria and South Australia does not in the least degree show that no duty is required. This export trade has been successfully established under a fiscal system. As I have already pointed out, the effect of a duty frequently is merely to change the place of origin of the article supplied, and to secure that it shall be in the community in which we live, and not some foreign country. I do not desire to weary the committee by dealing elaborately with this question. I only rose to say that experience has proved the correctness, in this particular instance at any rate, of the views held by protectionists, and the incorrect-, ness of the views held by free-traders. There is no use in our discussing any number of theories when we have facts to guide us. It seems to me that there is only one inference to be drawn from those facts, and that inference I have ventured to draw. In conclusion, I wish, to .say that my voting for any particular duty under the head of "" n.e.i."" must not be taken to mean that' I believe that every article at present included should remain at 25 per cent. There are articles on which the duty should be reduced, and other articles which sliould be placed on the free list. I discriminate as to articles there is a chance of producing locally in sufficient quantities to satisfy the demand, and to create such competition as will keep prices within reason. I hold myself free, in regard to a number of items under this general heading, to vote for placing articles on the free list because they can be locally produced, or for reducing the duty on other articles because, under the circumstances, I consider the duty too high.",65
326,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," I feel all the more ready to support the amendment, because I returned only today from a visit to Western Australia, where the feeling is - one, of consternation concerning the proposed duty of 25 per cent on mining machinery. In AVestern Australia no less than S6 per cent, of the total production of the State comes from mining. The State generally is absolutely dependent upon mining, and if the progress of that industry be retarded, as no doubt it will be by this dut}% the State must suffer very considerably. I trust that the officer who has been appointed by the Government to make in-quiries concerning mining machinery, has been through the same experience as myself during the last few weeks. Wherever I went I heard nothing but bitter complaints about the proposed high duty of 25 per cent. I discussed the matter with a good many mining men, and they all agreed that the duty would do very considerable injury, not only to the big companies, whose money is invested i u Western Australia, but also to the small prospectors.",66
327,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,What is the present AVestern Australian Tariff on mining machinerv 1,66
328,Mr KIRWASF,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Fiv e per cent. It is most singular that although I have been to see most of the mining men in that State, and have interviewed the Chamber of Mines and other similar bodies, whom one would imagine any officer appointed by the Federal Government would consult, I did not get the slightest information of any such inquiries having been made. If inquiries of such a nature had been made. I should have heard of them, and it would surely be very strange for an officer to enter upon an investigation of the kind and not direct his attention to the State to which the mining industry is of more importance than it is to any other State of the Commonwealth.",66
329,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Do those people say that mining machinery cannot be made in the Commonwealth at a reasonable rate ?,66
330,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I will tell the right honourable gentleman exactly what they did say on that point. The Minister for Trade and Customs said, as I understood him, that he would be in favour of putting on the free list mining machineiy which cannot be made in Australia. There was not much, however, in that statement, when we consider that just previously the leader of the Opposition had admitted that there was nothing which could not be made in Australia. The Minister for Trade and Customs should take into consideration the cost of production; and I should like to read, in reply to the question just asked, what the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia says on this particular point. In reply to a telegram which I sent to that body some time ago I received the following :We admit all machinery can be made in Australia if cost be no object; but, when quality is considered, high-class steam engines, electrical plants, and crushing mills can be imported 15 per cent, cheaper nnder old Tariff. That means that machinery imported from the old countiy or elsewhere could be sold in Australia at 20 per cent, less than it is being sold at present. The communication proceeded :The higher quality required the greater is the saving. Owing to the natural conditions here, only best quality should be used. There is one point in connection with the speech delivered by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo which has not been sufficiently noticed. It is that whilst machinery suitable for the free milling ores which are found at Ballarat and Bendigo can be manufactured in Australia, the mining at those places is as different from the operations which aie carried on at Broken Hill and. Kalgoorlie as mining itself is from agriculture. At Kalgoorlie there are refractory ores which require most scientific treatment. Indeed the mining operation's carried on there are the most scientific in the world, with the exception of those conducted - at Cripple Creek in America. It is imperative, therefore, that the different mining companies shall secure the most costly machinery. But the demand for that class of machinery in Australia is not sufficient to justify the establishment of the extensive foundries which would be necessary for its manufacture. The Minister for Trade and Customs spoke as if he were an authority upon the question of mining machinery. In this connection I should like to quote the opinions of a few men. who are recognised, not only in Australia, but throughout the world, as authorities upon this subject. I will first refer to a speech by the ex-Premier of Western Australia, Mr A . E. Morgans, who is a well-known mining man. He has had experience in all parts of the world, and is considered an authority upon this matter. The speech in question was delivered in the Parliament of Western Australia when that body unanimously carried aresolutionhavingreference to the Tariff. Surely that Parliament ought to know something concerning the effect which the Tariff will have upon Western Australia. Some time ago the Prime Minister suggested that the representatives of the smaller States did not understand the position in which their respective States stoodI think, however, that what has since been said by the Treasurer in regard to Western Australia shows that those who were mistaken in the views which they held upon the financial position of that State are to be found upon the Ministerial benches.",66
331,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,It is not often that the honourable member quotes with delight the resolutions of the Western Australian Parliament.,67
332,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,I quote this resolution to show that all parties are agreed upon the question.,67
333,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The honourable member tells us that that State Parliament does not represent the people.,67
334,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"In this particular instance I tell the Minister for Trade and Customs that it does represent the people. The resolution is as followsThat this House views with consternation the Federal Tariftj which has been promulgated in view of the serious consequences that must result to the. trade and commerce of this State as well as to the mining industry, which is one of the principal elements of prosperity, and this House enters its protest against the imposition of the proposed Tariff in its present form. In discussing that resolution, Mr Morgans gave a lot of valuable information in regard to the relationship of the Tariff to the mining industry in Western Australia. Concerning what can be done by the manufacturers of machinery in the eastern States, he saidWhat advantage would it be to the mining industry whether they paid 25 per cent, to Fraser and Chalmers or to the Otis Engineering Company in Melbourne ? What was the effect oif the creation of a ring, but to create a price, and what was the Federal Tariff bnt a ring for the purpose of protecting the manufactories of the other States ? He had the facts in his possession showing that since the promulgation of the Tariff the manufactories in Victoria had withdrawn their original quotations for the purpose of raising the prices. It was true that it would stop the importation of machinery from England and the United States, but they would not get as good machinery from Victoria, and they would have to pay 22£ per cent, more for a vastly inferior article. He had bought immense quantities of it, and he knew its value and its merits. He did not deny that the manufactories in the eastern States made fairly good batteries, and engine and boilers which would answer the purpose, but they could uot make them to compare with the English or the United States article. This is the opinion of a man who does not speak hastily, and who is an admitted authority upon this question.",67
335,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Has the honourable member got the facts about raising the prices ?,67
336,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Suret y Mr Morgans is an honourable man and his word can be taken.,67
337,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"He has been applied to for particulars, but so far they have not been forthcoming.",67
338,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,If it be a slander it can easily be refuted.,67
339,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,We should like to know the names.,67
340,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"We asked Mr Morgans for particulars, and he has failed to supply them to this day.",67
341,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I wish also to-quote the opinion of Mr G. W . Hall, who is another mining authority, upon this question. He thinks that it is not the large mining companies which will be chiefly affected by this duty. Many of those companies have already secured their plants, and their principal trouble will arise in connection with the importation of different parts of thoir machineiy. But the tax proposed will fall very heavily upon prospectors who are endeavoring to open up new country. Mr Hall speaks for these men, as he is very much interested in the North Coolgardie district, which lacks the advantage of railway communication. The cost of cartage there is considerable, and the scarcity of water constitutes a very great difficulty. All these things tend to seriously hamper the work of the prospector. Mr Hall saysMost of the miners in the back blocks will be seriously affected by this increase in the Tariff, for the reason that right through the northern field, from Lake Way to HJrlistoun, the bulk of the mines are dealing with low grade ore. Consequently, although large numbers of men are employed, the profits are necessarily Smaller than on mines of higher grade. The margin of profit being small, large quantities of ore must be treated. Being so far from machinery centres, any break down is very disastrous, and, consequently, the mines are forced to go in for the very highest class of machinery-and that comes from the old country. My experience of colonial batteries is that for the first twelve months they will run all right, but after that you very soon spend as much in repairs as would make up the cost of a first-class Fraser and Chalmers, or Sandicroft, battery. The charge for cartagewhich is such a tremendous item-is no greater on n first-class battery than on a cheaper one, and altogether, the out back miners recognise that the first cost is the best. For these reasons the machinery tax will press very heavily on those who are opening np the mines in the back country.",67
342,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,He admits that the Australian machinery is cheaper.,68
343,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"He does not say it is cheaper. He says the imported machinery is undoubtedly cheaper in the end, because it will last longer, and it is machinery which is particularly useful in that country. A good deal has been said here about what can be done by the local manufacturers. I know of a particular instance of a rock drill which I may mention here, the Ingersoll-Sergeant Rock Drill. We can get Ingersoll drills made in Australia; but what are those drills ? The Ingersoll Drill Company some considerable time ago patented a certain class of drill. Since then they have been continually improving it , and they allowed the patents they had taken out for the older class of drill to lapse, and now the Ingersoll drills we can get in the Australian States are much inferior to the new Ingersoll-Sergeant drill which can be'got from America. That is an instance of the kind of thing carried on in connection with the manufacture of machinery in Australia. Many of these rock crushers, diamond drills, and other mining machinery are patented machines that cannot possibly be produced in Australia. I certainly hope that at least ii as regards these patented machines, the Government will see their way to place them on the free list. Just by accident I managed to get this extract from, I think, the Mining Standa/rd, to show how this Tariff is affecting one of our mines in New South Wales, which is referred to as- "" the oldest, deepest, and best mine in this State""namely, the Lucknow mine, at Orange. This is what the manager of that mine says concerning the TariffMr Newman tells us that he will have to leavethousands of tons of low grade ore (containing no fine gold whatever, but which entails a concentrating and smelting process) below, as it cannot now be raised unless under a considerable loss to the company-which , of course, means a reduction of hands. To treat this vast body of low-grade ore Mr Newman has discovered, and. widen is said to be of a different class ever obtained on this field before, the present crushing plant of 20 head will have to be increased to 50, while the latest and best concentrators will have to be sent from London to replaee those at present in use ; but, owing to the ruinous Tariff proposals, this important discovery is rendered valueless, and consequently all the machinery has been countermanded, and a host of men promised work will now be thrown upon the State. Another instance of the kind which I quoted before, is so much to the point that I think it will bear quotation again. There are three important mines on the Kalgoorlie field, and they do not speak of a few men being employed there or a few thousands of pounds being spent. Those three mines, the Associated Northern, the Oroya, and the Golden Link, intended to introduce a sulphide plant to cost £200,000, but as soon as they found that this plant would have to pay a duty of 25 per cent., which would be equal to £50,000 added to the cost, they abandoned their idea. That plant, if introduced, would have given employment to 400 men, who, of course, will not now be employed, and yet the Government argue that this Tariff will give employment to a number of men.",68
344,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,The profits they were going to make could not be very large if they could not afford to pay the duty.,68
345,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"The right honourable gentleman must remember that many of these mines are worked at a very low profit.. The difference between profit and loss in the working of mines is often very small, and there are quite a number of mines in AVestern Australia, as there are in every mining camp in the world, that are being worked at a loss in the hope of some development taking place which will repay the investors. I could mention a number of mines on Kalgoorlie that are just paying expenses, but those who are working them are perfectly satisfied to go on, in the hope of something good turning up. If , however, we put a duty of 25 per cent, upon the machinery they use, they may not be disposed to continue to work their mines.",68
346,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"What do we the 25 per cent, duty upon ? Not upon the machinery with which they are working.",69
347,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"No , but there are parts of machineiy which they require. Some of these .mines are often working with an insufficient plant, and mining explosives and other mining supplies are also taxed. The honourable and learned member' for Corinella quoted accurately the importations of machinery from the Statistical Register, but I have here a return which shows the value of machinery and mining supplies imported from the Australian States and abroad for the year ended 30th September, 1901. The return - refers only to 44 of the Western Australian inining companies, but they are 44 of the best known companies. I shall be very happy to hand the return to the Minister for Trade and Customs, so that he may give it to the officer who is in search of information, but whom nobody seems to know anything at all about. This return shows exactly the importations of machinery into Western Australia by those 44 companies. I find from it that the imports of mining machinery from Australiaamountedin value to £96,941, and that is 33 per cent, of the whole of the machinery imported into Western Australia. The machinery imported from abroad amounted in value to £197,246, and that is, roughly, 67 per cent, of the total. That makes a total importation of machinery to the value of £294,187. There is another item here of equal importance, and that is the importation of mining supplies. The total value of the mining supplies imported from Australia amounted to £125,430, which is 25 per cent, of the total importations, while the importations of mining supplies from Great Britain and foreign countries amounted in value to £369,666.",69
348,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Does the return distinguish between Great Britain and other countries 1 ',69
349,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"No , the figures I have given are simply under the heading "" foreign,"" and the value of the importations of mining supplies from foreign countries, as. stated here, amounts to 75 per cent, of the total mining supplies imported into Western Australia. That is the return for 44 companies.",69
350,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Are those foreignowned companies?,69
351,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I . may explain that put there are some 96 Western Australian companies represeted in the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia, and the Chamber sent out circulars asking for particulars to be supplied. The figures I have given are taken from the particulars they have received up to dateSeveral of these mines are held by Western Australian companies. The honourable and learned member for Corinella said that mining directors of British companies would naturally exhibit some sympathy for British firms.",69
352,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I said there was a natural, tendency which I did not consider improper.",69
353,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"It amounts to Very much the same thing. So far as the natural tendency is concerned, if the honourable and learned membeiknows anything about milling men, he must be aware that they are not likely to be influenced by matters of that kind. They will go where they can obtain machinery at the cheapest rates, and of the best quality. If , as has been contended by some honourable members, mining machinery can be produced in Australia equal to any that is imported, and at the same cost, honourable members will find that mining managers will always give the preference to the Australian article. It must be remembered that the cost of carriage of machinery from the eastern States to Western Australia is veiy much less than the freights from the old world. Mining men will simply go where they can obtain the best value for their money. There, are some other returns which have also been supplied by the Western Australian Chamber of Mines, and the details of which I shall be glad to supply to the Minister in order to show their accuracy. They show exactly what has been done by 66 mining companies who are operating in Western Australia. These companies employ 10,474 men and their disbursement in wages for the year ending 31st August, 1901, was £1,933,000. If we divide the total sum paid in wages by the number of workmen, we find that the average wage earner there is not receiving a sweated wage. He is not receiving the wage of a factory hand in Melbourne, but practically an average of £ 2 00 per annum. Honourable members will see what a great gain this is to the whole Commonwealth, and what a large number of hands this industry employs. The amount of money which is spent annually in Western Australia in connection with the mining industry-includin g the expenditure upon fuel, water, stores, drainage, duty on profits, import and export duties, lease rents and other Government fees-is £3,463,849. That represents the disbursements of 66 mining companies in Western Australia, whilst the value of the plants employed by them is £2,577,000. We hear a great deal about the harm that may be done to the sugar industry of Queensland by the abolition of Kanaka labour. I claim that the mining industry of Western Australia is of far greater importance to the Commonwealth than is the sugar industry to Queensland. The number of hands employed in connection with the Queensland sugar industry is far below the number engaged in connection with the mining industry of Western Australia. The annual value of the products of the Queensland sugar industry is something like £2,000,000, but the output of gold from Western Australian mines for the year just closed amounted in round figures to 1,800,000 ozs., or, roughly speaking, to over £7,000,000 in value.",69
354,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"£7,200,00 0 odd.",70
355,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Surely this industry is worthy of consideration, and the Government ought not to place upon it the very heavy impost proposed by them-a n impost which will undoubtedly hamper the industry.",70
356,Mr LE GROOM,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Darling Downs) I do not intend to take up much of the time of the committee upon this item,, but I desire to point out the fact that this is not a matter which affects only Victoria. Honourable members of the Opposition have referred to this matter as if it chiefly affected Bendigo and one or two other towns in this State. As a matter of fact, however, Queensland will be very seriously affected if the articles included in this item, and especially mining machinery, are placed on the free list. I gather from the official statistics that as regards metal works of all kinds there are no less than 329 factories in Queensland, employing 3,931 hands. When I say that industries in Queensland having reference to metal working have grown up under a protective Tariff of 25 per cent., which has been imposed for a dozen years, honourable members will see what the position is. Certain honourable members coming from a free-trade State are desirous of doing what they call justice by reducing immediately all the industries of the Commonwealth to the position of the industries, if any, which exist in their own State. I understand from an honourable member that there are none there. Probably that is due to the fact that it is a free-trade State. I believe that the honourable member for Barrier, who has proposed that the articles included in this item should be placed on the free list, is desirous of doing what is fair and just. I would ask him, however, whether it is fair and just to the States which have industries that have grown up under protective Tariffs-in which capital has been invested, and where on the strength of these duties wages have been gradually raised, until by reason of the protective duties, they have been brought to a level of 10s. a day-that the whole of this economic and industrial fabric should be wiped out by his proposal.",70
357,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,Why does the honourable and learned member want all the other things in the list of exemptions to come in free?,70
358,Mr LE GROOM,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"Because * none of them will affect the industries to which I refer in the same way as would the placing of the articles in this item on the free list. The factories I refer to are factories which have grown up under a protective Tariff. We are framing a Tariff for Australia, and that being so, we have to consider the conditions of the various States. Where we find in existence industries that have grown up under a protective Tariff, we must give them fair and proper consideration. In Maryborough, Queensland, there is one factory-Walker' s Ltd - where , I am informed, nearly all the mining machineiy that is required in Queensland can be and is manufactured. That is only a single instanpe; thpre are other factories doing the same work in Brisbane and elsewhere. Therefore I submit that even a desire to be fair and just to all the States could not lead us to amend this item to the extent of putting all such articles upon the free list. I trust that the honourable member for Barrier will seriously consider his position, and withdraw his motion to make this item free.",70
359,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has told us that this matter does not affect Victoria alone, as some honourable members on this side of the Chamber seem to think. I agree with him there j it is a matter which affects tens of thousands of pioneers who are engaged' in developing one of the chief primary industries of the country. We, on this side of the Chamber, are considering, not the interests of the manufacturers of Victoria, whose claims have been put forward so strongly to-night by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, but the interests of the thousands of hard-working men who, at Broken Hill and in other parts of Australia, are earning, their bread by the sweat of their brow in the development of our mineral resources. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has told us that under a 25 per cent, duty Queensland manufacturers have been able to produce mining machinery. I agree with him that they are entitled to consideration, but have we not, by the. act of federation, thrown"" open the whole of the Australian market to them and to other manufacturers, and, by doing so, have we not given them all the consideration to which they are entitled after their many years of protection 1 I am entirely in accord with the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier. I understand that he said that the proposed duty on mining machinery would have a disastrous effect upon the mining operations at Broken Hill . But if the mining operations at Broken Hill are inteii'ered with, it is not only the Broken Hill miners who will suffer. At Cockle Creek, near Newcastle, and at Dapto, on the shores of Lake Illawarra, there are very large smelting works, and if the Broken Hill and other mines throughout the country are shut down because of the high duties upon mining machinery, many men connected with those smelting works will be thrown out of employment. Then, again, the coal-raining industry employs more than .10,000 men in New South Wales, and a great many more people are employed I by it indirectly. In what is known as the South Coast district of New South Wales, between Clifton and Lake Illawarra, there are hundreds of coke ovens. The mines' at Broken Hill and other places provide a market for the coke that is made in that district, and if the mines are shut down, the coke-making industry will suffer. Thus, to benefit the comparatively few men who are engaged in the manufacture of mining machineiy in Ballarat and other parts of Victoria, tens of thousands of men elsewhere will bethrown out of employment. Under the Tariff, everything a miner uses and consumes is taxed, and on behalf of the coal-miners of my electorate, who number fully one-half of my constituents, I again raise my protest against it . The Minister for Trade and Customs was very pronounced in his statement to-night that the Government did not wish to tax articles which could not be produced here, or which were only very rarely used in Australia. He said that if a single case of that sort were brought under his notice, he would give instructions to have it inquired into, so that the articles might be admitted duty free, or allowed to - come in under a revenue duty. Now, among the coke-making companies in the South Coast district in New South Wales, there is the Federal Coke Company Limited, whose head office is at 3 Gresham-street, Sydney, and this afternoon I received a letter from the secretary to the company, calling my attention to a machine which is used in connection with the manufacture of coke, under new principles recently applied in America and Wales. The letter is as follows :--.1>EAR Sm, I have been instructed to bring under your notice, as the member for the district in which our works are situated-viz. , Wollongong-the following facts in connection with a coke ram, or pusher, ordered many months ago, and on which, owing to its arrival shortly after the imposition of the Federal Tariff, a heavy duty is demanded - ou r desire being to get this admitted free. About fifteen months ago a new company was formed, known as the Federal Coke Company Limited, with a capitalof £13,000, which has since erected its works at Wollongong. These works were designed after a principle much used in America and Wales. In order to curry out "" this design it was necessary to got a coke rani, or pusher, to discharge the ovens. Tenders were called in the C0I0113', but as it had never been used out here, we were unable to get a satisfactory tender, so we had to send to Liverpool, England, for the necessary machinery, the cost of which is about f l ,500, and its erection will cost about another £250. This machinery should have arrived before the duties .were put on, but owing to delay, it did not reach here until some few weeks after, and it is now in bond. As this coke ram is entirely new to the colonies, and is to assist a local industry on which £13,000 has already been expended, we think that in justice to the company the duty should not be insisted upon in connection with this particular case. It is entirely new, and nothing like it has ever been used in the colonies. Taking the Minister on his very strong . statement here this' evening-considerin g that the article has never been produced in the State, and that it is absolutely necessary in order to carry on the industry on the most approved principles, I ask him to send a despatch to .his officer without the slightest delay, and see that these men get this important article duty free. We hear a lot about the encouragement of native industries by the Government. Here is a native industry to which no encouragement could be given by way of duty, but every obstacle is thrown in its way by the Government, which can possibly be done. I sincerely trust that in the interests of all classes of miners throughout Australia-no t only the gold miner, but also the coal miner and all the other3-the Government will see its way to come to a compromise with regard to this item, if we are not able to get the articles in duty free.",71
360,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"The honourable learned member is revolting from his leader's cry of "" no compromise.""",72
361,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR,"I am not revolting in an}' way. The Minister talked a lot about compromise here this evening; he told us that we' ought to deal with the Tariff in a spirit of compromise, as we had been doing for the last two months; and then all the compromise he offers us is that he will stick to the 25 per cent, duty in his Tariff, j shall stick to the position put forward by the leader of the Opposition tonight, that if we cannot get all we want to carry out free-trade principles, we must try and bring the duty as closely as possible into harmony with those principles which we believe should be adopted in the best interests of the country.",72
362,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH MEMJENTO FOR," I should ""like some of my honourable friends opposite to explain one or two little matters, which. I shall state as mildly as possible. Of course we all understand that, according to the free-trade argument, a pipe extends directly from the producer to the consumer, and therefore, when you buy in a free-trade market, you get the goods. at the lowest possible price. I mentioned in the House before a significant fact. In Sydney I bought a pump, for which I paid 63 in that free-trade port. I imagined that I was getting the pump at a free-trade price. Subsequently I found that the English price was £ 4 0 . The indent agent in Sydney had placed 50 per cent, on the pump in a free trade market. W it h regard to almost everything wluch is bought in connection with mining machinery, exactly the same thing happens.' If to-night we were discussing the question ' of a 50 per cent, duty, honourable members opposite, wonld. be horrified. In a free trade countiy I paid 50 per cent, extra, and am anxious to' obtain an explanation. A little while ago I was connected with the purchase of an extremely good American engine. One of the parts went - wrong, and it was impossible without very great delay to get a similar part. We discovered that it was much better to pay for a colonially made engine, for which we could get the parts readily, rather than buy an article from another part of the world. I shouldalso like honourable members to explain why iron castings in Sydney are dearer than steel castings in Melbourne. If you wish to obtain anything good in connection with and mining machineiy it has to be steel or something better. In Melbourne you can buy steel castings that will do their work thoroughly. But if you buy in Sydney } ou r will have to give more for iron castings. The New South Wales manufacturer has not had a fair chance. Victoria may have had to pay a considerable amount to establish her industries, but they are established. In several places in Victoria you can get steel castings, but I do not think that any one will contend that you are likely to obtain first class steel castings in Sydney. There is just one other point I wish to mention. I know an instance of tenders being called for machinery from selected Melbourne and Sydney firms. The lowest Sydney tender was £ 1 6 , 0 0 0; the lowest Melbourne tender was £11,000 ; and of course the Melbourne man got the contract. In a matter of £16,000, free-trade Sydney was £5000 over protectionist Melbourne. I can prove the accuracy of every statement. I have made. I know perfectly well that it may be 'necessary to import engines in connection with intricate mining work, but for the small article for the small industry, it is better, if necessary, to pay 50 per cent, more-it is better to have it made at home, I have already shown that in some instances the protected market is the cheaper. Every honourable member knows that, in common with any industry, if he can buy his goods just on the other side of the fence it is better to buy them there than to import them from a distance, .because he saves in time, and he gets a good article under his eye. These are a few facts which have come under rny own notice, and I defy any honourable member to disprove them. Progress reported. House adjourned at 1.0.49 p.m.",72
